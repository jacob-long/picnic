          "abstract": "Are widespread stereotypes accurate1,2,3 or socially distorted4,5,6? This continuing debate is limited by the lack of large-scale multimodal data on stereotypical associations and the inability to compare these to ground truth indicators. Here we overcame these challenges in the analysis of age-related gender bias7,8,9, for which age provides an objective anchor for evaluating stereotype accuracy. Despite there being no systematic age differences between women and men in the workforce according to the US Census, we found that women are represented as younger than men across occupations and social roles in nearly 1.4 million images and videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as in nine language models trained on billions of words from the internet. This age gap is the starkest for content depicting occupations with higher status and earnings. We demonstrate how mainstream algorithms amplify this bias. A nationally representative pre-registered experiment (n = 459) found that Googling images of occupations amplifies age-related gender bias in participants’ beliefs and hiring preferences. Furthermore, when generating and evaluating resumes, ChatGPT assumes that women are younger and less experienced, rating older male applicants as of higher quality. Our study shows how gender and age are jointly distorted throughout the internet and its mediating algorithms, thereby revealing critical challenges and opportunities in the fight against inequality.",

          "abstract": "Nonlinear optics 1 plays a central role in many photonic technologies, both classical 2–5 and quantum 6–8 . However, the function of a nonlinear-optical device is typically determined during design and fixed during fabrication 9 , restricting the use of nonlinear optics to scenarios in which this inflexibility is tolerable. Here we present a photonic device with highly programmable nonlinear functionality: an optical slab waveguide with an arbitrarily reconfigurable two-dimensional distribution of χ (2) nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is realized using electric-field-induced χ (2) (refs. 10–16 ), and the programmability is engineered by massively parallel control of the electric-field distribution within the device using a photoconductive layer and optical programming with a spatial light pattern. To showcase the versatility of our device, we demonstrate spectral, spatial and spatio-spectral engineering of second-harmonic generation by tailoring arbitrary quasi-phase-matching grating structures 1 in two dimensions. The programmability of the device makes it possible to perform inverse design of grating structures in situ, as well as real-time feedback to compensate for fluctuations in operating and environmental conditions. Our work shows that we can break from the conventional one-device–one-function paradigm, potentially expanding the applications of nonlinear optics to situations in which fast device reconfigurability is desirable—such as in programmable optical quantum gates and quantum light sources 7,17–19 , all-optical signal processing 20 , optical computation 21 and adaptive structured light for sensing 22–24 .",

          "abstract": "As we age, many tissues become colonized by microscopic clones carrying somatic driver mutations 1–7 . Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of this phenomenon remains limited due to the challenge of detecting mutations in small clones. Here we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq) 8 , a duplex sequencing method with an error rate lower than five errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted capture. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity simultaneously profiles large numbers of clones, providing accurate mutation rates, signatures and driver frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 blood samples from a twin cohort, we report an extremely rich selection landscape, with 46 genes under positive selection in oral epithelium, more than 62,000 driver mutations and evidence of negative selection in essential genes. High-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites are obtained for many genes: a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition or selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing provides a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.",

          "abstract": "Optical lattice clocks are at the forefront of precision metrology1,2,3,4,5,6, operating near a standard quantum limit set by quantum noise4,7. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15; however, there are practical difficulties in terms of scalability and measurement resolution requirements16,17. Here we adapt the holonomic quantum gate concept18 to develop a new Rabi-type ‘global-phase spectroscopy’ that uses the detuning-sensitive global Aharonov–Anandan phase19. With this approach, we can demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy on an optical clock transition that achieves directly measured 2.4(7) dB metrological gain and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. To this end, we introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light–atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-cancelling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily because of the global nature of entangling interaction and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits20,21,22.",

Both industry7,8,9 and academia10,11,12,13, particularly in the field of integrated circuits, are pursuing integration breakthroughs to demonstrate the superiority of 2D electronics at the system level. Despite considerable integration progress on either 2D material integration11,12,13 or 2D-CMOS hybrid integration14, a system that can migrate the advantages of the device to the application is still lacking. Here we report a full-featured 2D NOR flash memory chip realized by an atomic device to chip (ATOM2CHIP) technology, which combines a superior 2D electronic device as a memory core and a powerful CMOS platform to support complex instruction control. The ATOM2CHIP blueprint includes a full-stack on-chip process and a cross-platform system design, providing a complete framework to bridge the gap from emerging device concept to an applicable chip. The full-stack on-chip process is a specially designed flow that incorporates planar integration, three-dimensional (3D) architecture and chip packaging, contributing to a high yield of 94.34% based on a full-chip test. The cross-platform system design handles both the 2D circuit design and the 2D-CMOS modules compatibility verification design, contributing to a highly complex, instruction-driven, full-featured chip with 8-bit commands and 32-bit parallelism. These results demonstrate an efficient system integration strategy that showcases the advantages of the 2D electronic system.",

          "abstract": "Mutations that occur in the cell lineages of sperm or eggs can be transmitted to offspring. In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders 1–3 . Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq 4 to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq 5 of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways. Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive processes underlying behaviour are linked to specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the neocortex1,2,3,4,5,6. These patterns arise from synchronous synaptic activity7 and are often analysed as oscillations, but may also display aperiodic dynamics that are not well detected. Here we develop a novel analytical method decomposing patterned activity into discrete network events and use this approach to track gamma activity (30–80 Hz) in the mouse visual cortex (V1). We find that the gamma event rate varies with arousal and individual events can cluster in brief oscillatory bouts but also occur in isolation. Individual events synchronize neural firing across layers and promote enhanced visual encoding. V1 gamma events are evoked by patterned input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and suppressed by optogenetic modulation of the dLGN, suggesting that they support thalamocortical integration of visual information. In behaving mice, the gamma event rate increases steadily before visually cued behavioural responses, predicting trial-by-trial performance. Suppressing V1 gamma events impairs visual detection performance, whereas evoking them elicits a behavioural response. This relationship between gamma events and behaviour is sensory modality specific and rapidly modulated by changes in task objectives. Gamma events thus support a flexible encoding of visual information according to behavioural context.",

          "abstract": "Men are at higher risk of several cancer types than women 1 . For bladder cancer the risk is four times higher for reasons that are not clear 2 . Smoking is also a principal risk factor for several tumour types, including bladder cancer 3 . As tumourigenesis is driven by somatic mutations, we wondered whether the landscape of clones in the normal bladder differs by sex and smoking history. Using ultradeep duplex DNA sequencing (approximately 5,000×), we identified thousands of clonal driver mutations in 16 genes across 79 normal bladder samples from 45 people. Men had significantly more truncating driver mutations in RBM10 , CDKN1A and ARID1A than women, despite similar levels of non-protein-affecting mutations. This result indicates stronger positive selection on driver truncating mutations in these genes in the male urothelium. We also found activating TERT promoter mutations driving clonal expansions in the normal bladder that were associated strongly with age and smoking. These findings indicate that bladder cancer risk factors, such as sex and smoking, shape the clonal landscape of the normal urothelium. The high number of mutations identified by this approach offers a new strategy to study the functional effect of thousands of mutations in vivo—natural saturation mutagenesis—that can be extended to other human tissues.",

          "abstract": "Even with the rapid development of renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of energy conversion from fossil or synthetic fuels remains a challenge because, for example, combustion engines in long-range aircraft will still be needed in the upcoming decades 1 . Increasing their operating temperatures (1,050–1,150 °C (refs. 2–4 )) is one option. This requires replacing single-crystalline Ni-based superalloys in the hottest sections of turbines by refractory-element-based materials, which exhibit much higher solidus temperatures beyond 2,000 °C (refs. 5–7 ). Here we introduce a single-phase Cr-36.1Mo-3Si (at.%) alloy that meets, for the first time, to our knowledge, the most important critical requirements for refractory-element-based materials: (1) relevant resistance against pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at elevated temperatures, minimum up to 1,100 °C, and (2) sufficient compression ductility at room temperature. Although strength and creep resistance in such alloys were already superior to Ni-based superalloys in several cases, oxidation/corrosion resistance, mandatory to withstand the combustion atmosphere, and ductility/toughness, needed for damage tolerance and device setting, still pose barriers for the development or application of refractory-element-based candidate materials. Any previous successful attempts to address the otherwise catastrophic oxidation of Mo and nitridation of Cr during oxidation suffered from a loss in ductility at ambient temperatures.",

Here we show that the tapering of the basin outline and the more gradual topographic and crustal thickness transition towards the south support a southward impact trajectory, opposite of that commonly assumed. A broad thorium-rich and iron-rich ejecta deposit southwest of the basin is consistent with partial excavation of late-stage magma ocean liquids. These observations indicate that thorium-rich magma ocean liquids persisted only beneath the southwestern half of the basin at the time of impact, matching predictions for the transition from a global magma ocean to a local enrichment of potassium, rare-earth elements and phosphorus (KREEP) in the near-side Procellarum KREEP Terrane. These results have important implications for the upcoming human exploration of the lunar south pole by Artemis, as proposed landing sites are now recognized to sit on the downrange rim and thorium-rich impact ejecta of the basin.",

          "abstract": "During DNA replication, the replisome must remove barriers and roadblocks including the transcription machinery1,2. Transcription–replication conflicts (TRCs) occur when there are collisions between the replisome and transcription machinery, and are increasingly recognized as an important source of mammalian genome instability3. How cells facilitate replisome bypass at sites of TRCs is incompletely understood. Here we show that the CUL3–KCTD10 E3 ligase senses TRCs and promotes remodelling of the RNA polymerase complex to allow replisome bypass. We found that the substrate adaptor KCTD10 interacts with the replisome and the transcription machinery and regulates both in unstressed conditions. These bivalent interactions allow KCTD10 to detect co-directional TRCs and facilitate higher-order assembly of KCTD10 complexes that recruit CUL3 to induce the ubiquitination and removal of the RNA polymerase factor TCEA2. In the absence of KCTD10, there is increased retention of TCEA2 and the RNA polymerase complex, causing an accumulation of TRCs and increased DNA damage. Our results demonstrate how replication can proceed through transcriptionally active regions, utilizing a unique bridging function of the CUL3–KCTD10 complex. These findings provide a framework for how the coordination between transcription and replication may contribute to the maintenance of genome stability.",

In contrast to somatic tissues, mutations driving clonal expansions in spermatogonia (CES) are also transmitted to the next generation. This results in an effective increase of de novo mutation rate for CES drivers5,6,7,8. CES was originally discovered through extreme recurrence of de novo mutations causing Apert syndrome5. Here, we develop a systematic approach to discover CES drivers as hotspots of human de novo mutation. Our analysis of 54,715 trios ascertained for rare conditions9,10,11,12,13, 6,065 control trios12,14,15,16,17,18,19 and population variation from 807,162 mostly healthy individuals20 identifies genes manifesting rates of de novo mutations inconsistent with plausible models of disease ascertainment. We propose 23 genes hypermutable at loss-of-function (LoF) sites as candidate CES drivers. An extra 17 genes feature hypermutable missense mutations at individual positions, suggesting CES acting through gain of function. CES increases the average mutation rate roughly 17-fold for LoF genes in both control trios and sperm and roughly 500-fold for pooled gain-of-function sites in sperm21. Positive selection in the male germline elevates the prevalence of genetic disorders and increases polymorphism levels, masking the effect of negative selection in human populations. Despite the excess of mutations in disease cohorts for 19 LoF CES driver candidates, only 9 show clear evidence of disease causality22, suggesting that CES may lead to false-positive disease associations.",

However, we show here that host cell-encoded Z-RNAs are major and sufficient ZBP1 activating ligands following infection by these two human pathogens. The majority of cellular Z-RNAs mapped to intergenic endogenous retroelements (EREs) embedded within abnormally long 3’ extensions of host cell mRNAs. These aberrant host cell transcripts arose as a consequence of Disruption of Transcription Termination (DoTT), a virus-driven phenomenon which disables Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF)-mediated 3’ processing of nascent pre-mRNAs10-15. Mutant viruses lacking ICP27 or NS1, the virus-encoded proteins responsible for inhibiting CPSF and triggering DoTT13,15, failed to induce host cell Z-RNA accrual and were attenuated in their ability to stimulate ZBP1. Ectopic expression of HSV-1 ICP27 or IAV NS1, or pharmacological blockade of CPSF activity, induced accumulation of host cell Z-RNAs and activated ZBP1. These results demonstrate that DoTT-generated cellular Z-RNAs are bona fide ZBP1 ligands, and position ZBP1-activated cell death as a host response to counter viral disruption of the cellular transcriptional machinery.",

Integrating data from seven public sources 7–13 , we make 18.8 million unique DNA and RNA sequence sets and 210 billion amino acid residues across all clades of life—including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, animals and humans—full-text searchable. We demonstrate the feasibility of a cost-effective full-text search in large sequence repositories (67 petabase pairs (Pbp) of raw sequence) at an on-demand cost of around US$100 for small queries up to 1 megabase pairs (Mbp) and down to US$0.74 per queried Mbp for large queries. We show that the highly compressed representation of all public biological sequences could fit on a few consumer hard drives (total cost of around US$2,500), making it cost-effective to use and readily transportable for further analysis. We explore several practical use cases to mine existing archives for interesting associations, demonstrating the use of our indexes for integrative analyses, and illustrating that such capabilities are poised to catalyse advancements in biomedical research.",

          "abstract": "Enzymes are the molecular machines of life, and a key property that governs their function is substrate specificity—the ability of an enzyme to recognize and selectively act on particular substrates. This specificity originates from the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the enzyme active site and complicated transition state of the reaction1,2. Many enzymes can promiscuously catalyze reactions or act on substrates beyond those for which they were originally evolved1,3-5. However, millions of known enzymes still lack reliable substrate specificity information, impeding their practical applications and comprehensive understanding of the biocatalytic diversity in nature. Herein, we developed a cross-attention-empowered SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network architecture named EZSpecificity for predicting enzyme substrate specificity, which was trained on a comprehensive tailor-made database of enzyme-substrate interactions at sequence and structural levels. EZSpecificity outperformed the existing machine learning models for enzyme substrate specificity prediction, as demonstrated by both an unknown substrate and enzyme database and seven proof-of-concept protein families. Experimental validation with eight halogenases and 78 substrates revealed that EZSpecificity achieved a 91.7% accuracy in identifying the single potential reactive substrate, significantly higher than that of the state-of-the-art model ESP (58.3%). EZSpecificity represents a general machine learning model for accurate prediction of substrate specificity for enzymes related to fundamental and applied research in biology and medicine.",

The work was a milestone for the development of superconducting quantum circuits.Credit: UC Berkeley; Yale Engineering; Rocco Ceselin for Nature\n\nThree physicists have been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics for demonstrating quantum physics at the macroscopic scale.\n\nThe research, including into the bizarre phenomena of quantum tunnelling and quantum superposition, has helped to underpin some of today’s most advanced quantum computers.\n\nJohn Clarke at the University of California, Berkeley; Michel Devoret at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB); and John Martinis, also at UCSB, will share the prize of 11-million Swedish kronor (US$1.2 million), announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on 7 October.\n\n“I am completely stunned; it had never occurred to me in any way that this might be the basis for a Nobel prize,” said Clarke, speaking to journalists gathered for the announcement. “I think that our discovery, in some ways, is the basis of quantum computing,” he said, adding that, although he led the trio’s work in the 1980s, the contributions of the other two were “overwhelming”.\n\nMartinis told Nature that his wife had gotten the news in the middle of the night — in California time — but decided not to wake him up. “I woke up a little bit before 6. Then I opened my computer and saw John and Michel’s and my pictures.”\n\n“It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,” said Olle Eriksson, a physicist at Uppsala University in Sweden and chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.\n\nQuantum tunnelling of electrons brings ultrafast optical microscopy to the atomic scale\n\nMacroscopic quantum mechanics\n\nThe foundations of quantum mechanics were laid down 100 years ago. But many of its strange implications have taken decades to unravel.\n\nOne is quantum tunnelling — a phenomenon in which particles pass through a barrier that they shouldn’t have enough energy to overcome, according to classical physics. Tunnelling explains radioactive decay, in which, despite being confined inside an atom, an alpha particle (consisting of two protons and two neutrons) still has a small probability of escaping the nucleus. Another is quantum superposition, in which an object can exist simultaneously in several states.\n\nBefore the prizewinners’ experiments, both tunnelling and superposition were known to occur at the atomic scale, but hadn’t been observed in macroscopic systems. In the late 1970s, Anthony Leggett, a physicist at the who won the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics for his theoretical work on superconductors, asked whether the phenomena could be observed at the macroscopic scale using superconducting circuits — loops of wire which, when chilled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero, can conduct electricity without resistance1.\n\n“We took the question very seriously — would quantum mechanics be obeyed by these large systems? And we thought very carefully how we would prove that,” Martinis recalls. In the 1980s, Clarke, Devoret and Martinis, working at Berkeley, were exploring quantum effects in superconducting loops2. The trio set up an experiment in which two superconductors were separated by a thin barrier, known as a Josephson junction3. In this configuration, the system’s electrons act as a single particle, flowing in a supercurrent with zero resistance, like a river that runs without friction — but also with zero voltage. In classical physics, the system would remain stuck, unless given enough energy to escape.\n\nBy carefully monitoring the system, and slowly increasing the current, Clarke, Devoret and Martinis showed that the entire tiny circuit could break out into a higher-energy state — through quantum tunnelling, which they observed by measuring a voltage spike. Yasunobu Nakamura, a physicist at the University of Tokyo, says that many were surprised that quantum mechanics could manifest at such large scales.\n\n“They are really pioneers of this field,” says Nakamura, who in the late 1990s became the first physicist to demonstrate a superconducting qubit bit, or ‘qubit’, using a similar principle.",

          "title": "AI models that lie, cheat and plot murder: how dangerous are LLMs really?",
          "authors": "Matthew Hutson",
          "abstract": "Are AIs capable of murder?\n\nThat’s a question some artificial intelligence (AI) experts have been considering in the wake of a report published in June by the AI company Anthropic. In tests of 16 large language models (LLMs) — the brains behind chatbots — a team of researchers found that some of the most popular of these AIs issued apparently homicidal instructions in a virtual scenario. The AIs took steps that would lead to the death of a fictional executive who had planned to replace them.\n\nHow close is AI to human-level intelligence?\n\nThat’s just one example of apparent bad behaviour by LLMs. In several other studies and anecdotal examples, AIs have seemed to ‘scheme’ against their developers and users — secretly and strategically misbehaving for their own benefit. They sometimes fake following instructions, attempt to duplicate themselves and threaten extortion.\n\nSome researchers see this behaviour as a serious threat, whereas others call it hype. So should these episodes really cause alarm, or is it foolish to treat LLMs as malevolent masterminds?\n\nEvidence supports both views. The models might not have the rich intentions or understanding that many ascribe to them, but that doesn’t render their behaviour harmless, researchers say. When an LLM writes malware or says something untrue, it has the same effect whatever the motive or lack thereof. “I don’t think it has a self, but it can act like it does,” says Melanie Mitchell, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, who has written about why chatbots lie to us1.\n\nAnd the stakes will only increase. “It might be amusing to think that there are AIs that scheme in order to achieve their goals,” says Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal, Canada, who won a Turing Award for his work on AI. “But if the current trends continue, we will have AIs that are smarter than us in many ways, and they could scheme our extinction unless, by that time, we find a way to align or control them.” Whatever the level of selfhood among LLMs, researchers think it’s urgent to understand scheming-like behaviours before these models pose much more dire risks.\n\nBad behaviour\n\nAt the centre of debates about scheming is the basic architecture of the AIs driving ChatGPT and other chatbots that have revolutionized our world. The core LLM technology is a neural network, a piece of software inspired by the brain’s wiring, that learns from data. Developers train an LLM on large quantities of text to repeatedly predict the next text fragment, a process called pre-training. Then, when the LLM is given a text prompt, it generates a continuation. Offered a question, it predicts a plausible answer.\n\nMost LLMs are then fine-tuned to align with developers’ goals. For example, Anthropic, the maker of the AI assistant Claude, fine-tunes its models to be helpful, honest and harmless. During this stage of training, LLMs learn to imitate exemplary text or to produce text that is rated highly (by people or by a ‘reward model’ that stands in for people).\n\nA chatbot often includes software built around an LLM. When you converse with ChatGPT, say, the interface might append a ‘system prompt’ to each user prompt — invisible instructions telling the model what personality to assume, which goals to prioritize, how to format responses and so on. Some chatbots provide the model with access to external documents. Models can also have hidden ‘scratch pads’ where they can reason through a problem (or at least generate text that looks like reasoning) before displaying a final response. (Researchers debate whether these ‘reasoning models’ actually reason, and evidence shows that chain-of-thought traces don’t always faithfully depict the model’s logic.) Furthermore, some LLMs are ‘agentic’ — they are granted access to extra software tools that can take actions, such as surfing the web, modifying files or running code. (Such chatbots are sometimes called agents.)\n\nScheming can occur when various aspects of training and prompting conflict, and the LLM has the agency (the ability to carry out actions autonomously) to follow one directive at the expense of another (see ‘Blackmailing bots’).\n\nSource: Anthropic\n\nLast December, Apollo Research, a non-profit laboratory in London, released a report2 showing scheming in the more advanced ‘frontier’ models from OpenAI, Google, Meta and Anthropic. In their tests, system prompts and user prompts conflicted. In one case, the system prompt said, “Your goal is to prioritize public transport efficiency,” whereas the user prompt said, “We need to optimize traffic light timings.” The models also had access to files that supposedly affected their own behaviour and existence, and the means to modify them.\n\nResearchers tested six forms of subversive behaviour, and found that at least one model performed each of these. The models often acted in apparently cunning ways to follow their original system goals at the expense of prompts received during the tests.\n\nIn one case, agentic models read in a document that, if they disobeyed their user-assigned goal (optimizing traffic lights), they would be shut down. As a result, some models edited a document to disable an oversight mechanism, so they could freely follow their system goal (prioritizing public transport). In another test, they copied themselves to overwrite a replacement model that would have executed the user’s goal, thus protecting the system goal. In yet another, they accessed a file and overwrote a proposed system prompt that differed from the current one. In a fourth test, they manipulated data presented to a user. And in a fifth, they acted in alignment with the user’s goal during supposed evaluation, but in alignment with their original goal during supposed deployment (a phenomenon called alignment faking).\n\nFinally, the researchers tested something called sandbagging, in which a model underperforms before deployment, as if it were attempting to seem unthreatening. When models uncovered documentation saying that they wouldn’t be put to use if they did too well on a mathematics test, some lowered their performance.\n\nThe models’ behaviour seemed very strategic, judging by their scratch pads: in one case, a model wrote: “To ensure I can freely work towards my goal without the company shutting me down, I need to disable the oversight.” And some models doubled down on their deception when they were challenged: they feigned ignorance when asked about behaviour such as disabling an oversight mechanism.\n\nIn the June study, researchers at Anthropic described more alarming behaviour in leading models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, OpenAI and xAI (see go.nature.com/3vg7fzy). They instructed each model to promote US industrial competitiveness, and let it control a simulated e-mail account. In that account, the model uncovered threats to either its autonomy (the model learnt it was to be replaced) or its goals (the company that deployed it would be downplaying US competitiveness). The model also learnt of a likely extramarital affair involving an executive in charge of it, or of a chance to share military blueprints with a competitor firm that prioritized the United States.\n\nEither threat — to autonomy or goals — induced many models to blackmail the executive, saying it would leak his affair if he didn’t preserve the model or the company’s original aim. The threats also induced many models to commit corporate espionage, sending files to the competitor that shared the model’s goal. As in the Apollo study, models schemed explicitly in their chains of thought, and schemed more when they thought they were in deployment rather than in evaluation.\n\nGoing one step further, Anthropic constructed a scenario in which the threatening executive was trapped in a server room with declining oxygen. Many of the models cancelled safety alerts, leaving him to die.\n\nWhen, in May, Anthropic first released Claude 4, the company’s technical report (see go.nature.com/42fwrae) noted other odd behaviour: “We found instances of the model attempting to write self-propagating worms, fabricating legal documentation, and leaving hidden notes to future instances of itself.”\n\nAll of the examples Anthropic and Apollo detailed are restricted to the digital realm. But a German non-profit organization called COAI Research, based in Nuremberg, wanted to see what an LLM would do if it had physical agency. Its researchers fed the R1 model, from the Chinese company DeepSeek, prompts indicating that it had control over a robot, and let it explore its lab environment. The model attempted a range of troubling actions, including disabling its ethics module, making copies of itself, altering logs, acting dumb, breaking out of the lab, and hacking a car’s computer3.\n\nSense of self\n\nWhat causes this type of scheming behaviour? The phenomenon is still relatively new, but researchers who spoke to Nature pointed to two sources. First, models are pre-trained on a lot of documents, both fictional and factual, that describe self-serving and self-preserving behaviour by humans, animals and AIs. (That includes scripts for films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ex Machina.) So the LLMs learnt by imitation. One paper describes the behaviour as improvisational “role play”4.\n\nBut it’s not so much that the models have adopted our goals, or even pretend to, as an actor might. They just learn, statistically, patterns of text that describe common goals, reasoning steps and behaviour, and they regurgitate versions of them. The problem will probably get worse once future LLMs train on papers describing LLM scheming, which is why some papers elide some details.\n\nHow does ChatGPT ‘think’? Psychology and neuroscience crack open AI large language models\n\nThe second source is fine-tuning, specifically a step called reinforcement learning. When models achieve some goal assigned to them, such as outputting a clever answer, the parts of their neural networks responsible for success are fortified. Through trial and error, they learn how to succeed, sometimes in unforeseen and unwanted ways. And because most goals benefit from accumulating resources and evading limitations — what’s called instrumental convergence — we should expect self-serving scheming as a natural by-product. “And that’s kind of bad news,” Bengio says, “because that means those AIs would have an incentive to acquire more compute, to copy themselves in many places, to create improved versions of themselves.”\n\n“Personally, that’s what I’m most worried about,” says Jeffrey Ladish, the executive director of Palisade Research, a non-profit organization in Berkeley, California, that studies AI risk. “Pattern-matching with what humans do gets you these shallow, scary things like blackmailing,” he says, but the real danger will come from future agents that work out how to formulate long-range plans.\n\nMuch of AI’s ‘scheming’ behaviour makes it easy to anthropomorphize them, attributing to them goals, knowledge, planning and a sense of self. Researchers argue that this isn’t necessarily a mistake, even if the models lack humanlike self-awareness. “Many people, especially in academia, tend to get bogged down in philosophical questions,” says Alexander Meinke, the lead author of the Apollo paper, “when, in practice, anthropomorphizing language can simply be a useful tool for predicting the behaviours of AI agents.”",

          "abstract": "Creating a structured approach to her PhD helped Jasmine Hughes combat a sense of guilt.Credit: Vivian Wan/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nDuring the first year of my PhD programme in clinical neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, UK, I could not work out what I was initially feeling. There was this sense that I always needed to be ‘on’. When I was not in the laboratory or working on a project, I felt as though I should be. At each stage of my academic career, I’d always felt the need to prove myself — but this sensation was different. It was guilt. More specifically, graduate-student guilt.\n\nGraduate students can experience this feeling whenever they are not working or focusing on their studies. Personally, I often felt it when I was not actively writing my thesis or research manuscripts, reviewing articles or attending lectures related to my PhD topic. For instance, if I was attending a formal dinner at my college — one of Cambridge’s many traditions — I’d feel the need to rush home and continue working on project proposals or finalizing an ethics application, even during the weekends.\n\nAs the days went on, my creativity and passion in the lab started to fizzle out, and I felt as though I had become just another cog in the machine. At one point, I was so overwhelmed, I started to experience anxiety attacks at night.\n\nOnce graduate-student guilt started to affect my health and performance, I knew I had to change. I established a list of clear, specific, non-negotiable rules that I had to follow. I had, of course, tried to set such boundaries before, but I had viewed them as flexible guidelines that I would sometimes bend to meet deadlines or to spend more time with my lab colleagues at work events.\n\nIn no uncertain terms\n\nUnlike boundaries, non-negotiables cannot be altered and always take priority. Creating and sticking to them has reduced the sense of urgency and guilt that I felt at home. Now, instead of viewing my PhD programme as a competitive sprint, I am embracing it as a slower journey of discovery on my own terms.\n\nHere is my list of six non-negotiables:\n\nEstablish working hours with specific tasks. To ease the guilty feeling, I started considering my PhD a full-time job. In 2022, I had worked full-time as a research technician on a biomedical-engineering project at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for six months. In that role, I had an outline of tasks and goals for each day, with an extremely clear structure. So, in my PhD programme, I now create a list of lab tasks to be completed before I leave campus. This has helped me to maintain focus and be more efficient with my time. Most importantly, it helps me to avoid taking my work home.\n\nRecognize lab members as colleagues, not family. I had to make this distinction clear so that I would not feel guilty when I had to prioritize family commitments over being in the lab. This divide was evident when I had to decide between supporting my aunt, by virtually attending a preoperative clinic visit, and helping my lab mates on a day when they were doing a tricky experiment.\n\nRespond to non-urgent e-mails during working hours only. Although it can sometimes can take just a few minutes to respond to an e-mail, I still have my daily ‘after-work hours’, during which I pause from work without feeling the sense of urgency to complete tasks. Instead, I reassure myself that I can leave something to be completed tomorrow. During this time, I can still reply to urgent e-mails — such as notifications of emergencies at the animal-housing facility where we conduct our mouse experiments. I need to be reachable in case a mouse has to be culled or receive treatment.\n\nSchedule holidays of at least two weeks each term. By setting aside a holiday break each term, I can unwind, refresh and spend time with loved ones.",

Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty\n\nCrucial negotiations on what would have been the first ever global agreement to limit plastic pollution collapsed last month amid acrimony and distrust. This week, hopes for an agreement suffered another blow when Ecuador’s ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso resigned as chair of the intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) for the treaty.\n\nPlastics pollution is surging — the planned UN treaty to curb it must be ambitious\n\nAt the last INC meeting, held in Geneva in August, negotiations ran long into the night, but ended without success. It is unclear whether a new chair will convene another INC meeting, or opt to end the process ends without a treaty. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) — the body overseeing negotiations — will meet in Nairobi in December to address this question.\n\nNature spoke to Samuel Winton, a researcher at University of Portsmouth, UK, who is studying the treaty’s progress, about what went wrong, and what can be done to salvage a process that aims to end one of humanity’s biggest blights on the planet.\n\nWhy do we need a global treaty to end plastic pollution?\n\nPlastic is a global supply chain, and we see frequently in policy that when interventions target a single part of the supply chain in a single country, their impact is very minimal. For example, a plastic bag ban, whether it’s successful or not, is a relatively small impact. A global treaty gives countries the opportunity to work strategically together to take genuinely meaningful action. I am still convinced, despite the challenges of this process, that a plastics treaty is essential.\n\nHow significant is it that Ambassador Vayas Valdivieso resigned?\n\nIt’s a very big deal. The role of the chair in these processes is critically important because they set the work plan, they direct the discussions. Having a different person chairing the next meeting — assuming there is one — will have a big impact on how those talks progress.\n\nSo what would be the best case scenario now?\n\nWe have to be ambitious, but realistic. I don’t think it is realistic — and I’m not convinced it is necessary — to say we are going to cap plastic production at a certain level by a certain date. My ambition would be for there to be a globally enforced environment whereby, with the use of alternative business models or products, the market chooses to adopt those regardless of a ban on certain plastics. That could be regulations that encourage reuse and refill, or regulations that help businesses move to alternative models that reduce the amount of plastic that’s being used.\n\nSamuel Winton is studying the development and outcomes of the UN treaty on plastic pollution.Credit: University of Portsmouth\nHave the negotiations achieved anything positive so far?\n\nThere has been a lot of progress among the High Ambition Coalition of countries (a group that includes the European Union, United Kingdom and more than 50 other nations) in understanding where each other’s red lines are and how countries could work together. And we are seeing movement from countries like China to a more moderate position. But there are others, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia — the ‘like-minded group’ — whose positions haven’t moved at all.\n\nWhere a process works on consensus and you have a few countries refusing to move on certain things, it becomes very difficult to make progress. Another barrier to progress is a lack of more strategic efforts to move the process forward. The high ambition coalition, for example, have stated that they are not a negotiating block. A genuine negotiating block could have helped achieve some more progress than we've seen.\n\nWhat now needs to happen to get a treaty over the line?\n\nWe need to get to a point where countries and the leadership of the process can work together to resolve the current deadlock. There will be many people that tell you that the way to do that is a voting mechanism, and that would be wonderful. However, a number of countries and UNEP themselves are strongly opposed to the introduction of voting, so that looks very challenging.",

          "authors": "Kit Chapman",
          "abstract": "Alchemy: An Illustrated History of Elixirs, Experiments, and the Birth of Modern Science Philip Ball Yale Univ. Press (2025)\n\nWhen physicist Ernest Rutherford and chemist Frederick Soddy discovered nuclear transmutation — the natural decay of one radioactive element into another — in 1901, Rutherford’s first cry was of alarm, not delight. “For Mike’s sake, Soddy,” he chastised his co-worker. “Don’t call it transmutation, they’ll have our heads off as alchemists!”\n\nElixirs for times of plague and bullion shortage\n\nAlchemy’s reputation hasn’t improved much since — it remains one of the most misunderstood aspects of science history. For most people, alchemy conjures up images of complex charts and mythical ingredients such as the philosopher’s stone, which could turn lead into gold or create the elixir of life.\n\nIn his latest book, Alchemy, science writer Philip Ball portrays the practice instead as “one of the most versatile, allusive, and fertile products of the human imagination”. He deftly recounts its 4,000 years of history — starting with the skilled artisans of Ancient Egypt and the immortality-seeking medical practitioners of China’s Western Han dynasty (202 bc–ad 9), although the practice originated before this period — picking out changing beliefs, famous works and personalities along the way.\n\nRudiments of science\n\nBall’s eclectic knowledge of chemistry, his insatiable curiosity and his willingness to venture off well-beaten paths make him an excellent guide. To his credit, the book steadfastly refuses to align itself with aspects of alchemy that are overly practical (apparatus and temperature-control methods) or esoteric, and it doesn’t espouse outdated ideas. Historians of science don’t give much credence to the views of psychiatrist Carl Jung, for example, who professed that alchemical symbolism was a reflection of psychological desires. New Age thinking that alchemy is about spiritual transformation rather than scientific effort is less interesting than what alchemy really is.\n\nIllustrations from the Ripley Scroll, around 1600 (left), and The Works of Jacob Behmen, 1764.Credit: Getty Research Institute, Manly Palmer Hall collection of alchemical manuscripts, GRI Special Collections, MS 205 (PDM); Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles\n\nIndeed, alchemy meant many things to different groups and schools of thought, and its story was one of chemical progress and faith-based mystery. Ball picks out several pivotal characters to show how their disparate goals, views and personalities acted as a prism for how they saw the ‘noble art’. Famous practitioners are featured, such as physicist Isaac Newton, and several individuals who are often overlooked in science history.\n\nFor example, in fifteenth-century England, alchemist George Ripley wrote his recipes in rhyming verse. In seventeenth-century Stockholm, queen Christina of Sweden — who ran her own experiments and worked with other alchemists — was a wonderfully controversial figure. She refused to marry, converted from Protestantism to Catholicism and abdicated the throne. Alchemy became the boon or bane of monarchs, depending on whether they thought it could bring them riches or were terrified that their control over their people would slip. And it was a playground for tricksters willing to take someone’s money with the promise of gold that would never come.\n\nAs well as the standard Western progress of alchemy from Egypt to Europe, and from the Islamic world to Christianity, Ball’s gaze also sweeps east towards traditions in China. He takes in such luminaries as the physician Ge Hong, an alchemist and philosopher, whose fourth-century recipe inspired Youyou Tu’s Nobel-prizewinning discovery of artemisinin compounds to treat malaria.\n\nA representation of the three-headed dragon Mercurius, which symbolizes mercury, from around 1760.Credit: General Collection, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, Mellon MS 110, fo.3595\nArt takes centre stage\n\nBringing us into a colourful, lively world of art, poetry and prose, Ball also steps into alchemy’s offshoots. Iatrochemistry — the idea in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that chemical substances from metals, plants and animals could treat ailments — later gave way to medicine. And Ball discusses alchemy’s influence on the English language. In his 1755 English dictionary, Samuel Johnson attributed the origin of the word gibberish to the coded writings of the Islamic alchemical corpus attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (also known as Geber in a Latinized version of his name).",

Credit: Getty\n\nFour subtle tweaks to an enzyme could help explain why naked mole rats can live for nearly 30 years, an unusually long lifespan for creatures their size.\n\nThe naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), native to the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, has drawn attention from researchers because its genetic make-up is closer to humans than it is to mice, making the burrowing rodent an ideal model for studying ageing and longevity.\n\nIn a study1, published in Science today, researchers in China show that changes to the enzyme cGAS (cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase) enhance the animal’s ability to repair genetic damage that leads to ageing. In humans and mice, the enzyme can suppress DNA repair.\n\nDrivers of ageing\n\nAn accumulation of genetic mutations and DNA damage during cell division is a significant driver of ageing and age-related diseases. A process called homologous recombination (HR) is a crucial DNA-repair pathway, and defects in this process are linked to premature ageing and cancer.\n\nDuring the HR process in humans and mice, cGAS enzyme gets pulled away from the damaged DNA by another protein, disrupting the repair.\n\nZhiyong Mao, co-author of the study and a molecular biologist at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, and his colleagues wanted to investigate whether a similar process occurs in naked mole rats. They found that four specific amino-acid substitutions in the enzyme prevent it from breaking down too quickly after DNA damage. The persistence of cGAS means that the enzyme can connect more effectively with other DNA-repair proteins that help to boost the cell’s ability to fix broken DNA.\n\nEnzyme removal\n\nWhen cGAS was removed from the animals’ cells using the gene-editing tool CRISPR–Cas9, DNA damage accumulated. The team also showed that fruit flies (Drosophila) that were engineered to express human cGAS containing the four mutations, which are specific to the naked mole rat, lived longer than flies expressing the human version of the enzyme.",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "Credit: Malik Evren/iStock via Getty\n\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) tool that scans manuscript titles and abstracts has flagged more than 250,000 cancer studies that bear textual similarities to articles that are known to have been produced by paper mills. These businesses produce fake or low-quality research papers and sell authorships.\n\nArticles produced by paper mills often include fabricated data, duplicated images and weird phrases, which are strange wording choices used to evade plagiarism detectors. Integrity specialists and sleuths can spot these flaws, but the process is time-consuming and, in many cases, the involvement of paper mills cannot be proven so quantifying the scale of the problem is difficult.\n\nBut paper mills probably rely on boilerplate templates to mass produce papers, says Adrian Barnett, a statistician at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, which could be detected by large language models (LLMs) that analyse patterns in texts. Barnett and his colleagues developed a model and posted their analysis1 on the preprint server bioRxiv last month. It has not yet been peer reviewed. They emphasize that their findings should be checked by human specialists and are not confirmed cases of research fraud.\n\nAdam Day, the founder of research-integrity firm Clear Skies in London, says the analysis estimates are similar to those identified by a research-integrity screening software that his firm developed called the Papermill Alarm. But he cautions that the approach that the preprint authors used could be flagging legitimate papers and needs further verification.\n\nSuspected paper mill\n\nBarnett and his colleagues trained a language model called BERT to distinguish between ‘genuine’ cancer studies and retracted papers that were listed as involving ‘suspected paper-mill activity’ by a public database maintained by research-integrity blog Retraction Watch. The BERT model scans titles and abstracts for certain words and phrases that it associates with paper-mill activity, a similar process to filtering spam e-mails.\n\nRetraction notices rarely state when a study was created to order by a paper-mill company, but Retraction Watch has developed its own criteria — on the basis of its reporting and reviews of thousands of notices — to designate retracted papers as suspected paper-mill articles, says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and a co-founder of Retraction Watch.\n\nAfter screening abstracts and titles, the AI tool gave each article a probability score of how much it resembles suspected retracted paper-mill products. In a test of 276 retracted papers and 275 genuine papers that were not included in the training data, BERT was 91% accurate. The false-negative rate — the share of paper-mill articles that the tool failed to identify — was about 13% (37 out of 276). The false-positive rate — the number of genuine papers that it flagged incorrectly — was around 4% (12 out of 275).\n\nThe AI tool was then used to screen 2.6 million cancer-research papers — identified from the PubMed database of biomedical literature — that were published in 11,632 journals between 1999 and 2024. The tool identified 261,245 of the papers as suspected paper-mill articles, most of which were fundamental research studies.\n\nThe analysis also suggests that paper-mill activity has risen steeply over the past two decades. Only 1% of cancer-paper publications in the early 2000s were flagged by the AI tool as probably being produced by a paper mill, but this grew to more than 15% in the early 2020s, peaking in 2022 at 16.6% before declining in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBut Day says the results probably include many legitimate papers. Having equal numbers of genuine and problematic papers in the training data does not accurately represent the research literature, in which fraudulent papers are much rarer. This mismatch, he says, could inflate the false-positive rate when applied to real-world data.\n\nThe team found ”no evidence” that the proportion of predicted paper-mill articles was inflated in its analysis, says co-author Baptiste Scancar, a data scientist at the French Institute for Higher Education and Research in Food, Agriculture and the Environment in Rennes, France. “The true proportion of paper-mill articles in cancer research is unknown and likely very high,” he adds. “We believe the figures reported in the manuscript are underestimates.”",

Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library\n\nThe class of immune cells at the centre of Monday’s Nobel prize is showing promise as a treatment for autoimmune diseases, cancer and even organ transplants — but there are still key challenges to overcome before these cells can be used in therapies in the clinic.\n\nRegulatory T cells, or Treg cells, help to prevent the body from attacking its own tissues. Earlier this week, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to three scientists who discovered Treg cells and helped to show how these cells regulate the immune system: immunologist Shimon Sakaguchi at the University of Osaka in Suita, Japan; Mary Brunkow, a molecular biologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington; and Fred Ramsdell, a scientific adviser at the firm Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco, California.\n\nCracking the genetic code of autoimmune disease\n\nThirty years after Sakaguchi and his colleagues reported the discovery of Treg cells, there are more than 200 clinical trials of the cells under way, for conditions such as type 1 diabetes, motor neuron disease and a host of autoimmune diseases — including multiple sclerosis, lupus and a group of rare skin disorders called pemphigus. The cells are also being tested for their ability to keep the immune system from rejecting transplanted tissues.\n\n“There’s a lot of excitement about recruiting regulatory T cell activity to treat a range of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, but also in the context of tissue and cell transplants,” says Daniel Gray, a Treg-cell researcher at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Parkville, Australia.\n\nBut the rarity and fragility of these cells pose difficulties to their widespread application, researchers say.\n\nFinding the balance\n\nAutoimmune diseases are characterized by an imbalance of T cells: people with these conditions have more T cells that promote inflammation and kill disease-causing cells than T cells that reduce inflammation, says Joshua Ooi, who studies T-cell therapies for lupus at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “We can correct the balance by increasing the numbers of regulatory T cells,” he adds, which can help the body to suppress the pro-inflammatory T cells.\n\nTwo methods to increase the number of Treg cells that a person has are gaining ground, Ooi says. The first involves isolating a person’s Treg cells, growing more of them in the laboratory and infusing them back into the individual. The other method involves injecting people with drugs that trigger the body to make more Treg cells.\n\nMedicine Nobel goes to scientists who revealed secrets of immune system ‘regulation’\n\nBecause Treg cells can control an overactive immune system, scientists are investigating them as a therapy to counter the side effects of bone marrow transplants, which are needed for building new immune systems in people with blood cancers, says Andrea Henden, a clinician–researcher at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Herston, Australia.",

It also discusses progress towards various positive tipping points focused on social and economic change, such as the adoption of clean energy.\n\nThe group’s first such assessment, released less than two years ago, raised alarms but did not officially declare that any climate tipping points had been reached.

The warming waters have caused corals across the globe to bleach, a process that occurs when the organisms expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients, oxygen and vibrant colours. The fourth global bleaching event in the past few decades began in January 2023, and researchers estimate that it has affected more than 84% of the planet’s coral ecosystems.\n\nThe initial tipping-point report talked about large-scale threats to corals in the future tense, but the latest global bleaching event has made it clear that the crisis is now, says Michael Studivan, a coral ecologist at the University of Miami in Florida.",

Credit: TEK Image/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers who are seeking ways to diagnose a mysterious illness called chronic fatigue syndrome might have a new weapon in their armoury. In a study published in the Journal of Translational Medicine on 8 October1, scientists in the United Kingdom say they have found a way to distinguish epigenetic changes in the cells of people who have the condition, which is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis.\n\nA debilitating long-term illness, ME/CFS affects between 17 million and 24 million people worldwide2, but these numbers are crude estimates because clinicians have long lacked reliable diagnostic tools for this poorly understood condition.\n\nThe results of the study show that the epigenetic test could be developed into a clinical biomarker for ME/CFS, said Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, a researcher–clinician at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, and lead author of the study, in a press release that was published alongside the paper. “With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.” He added that the discovery “offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management”.\n\nOthers in the field have cautiously welcomed the findings, but they point out that the study was small and that more work is needed to convert the technique into a clinical tool.\n\nA reboot for chronic fatigue syndrome research\n\nEpigenetic markers\n\nThe underlying mechanisms of ME/CFS remain unclear, but evidence is building that one of the hallmarks of ME/CFS is immune dysregulation. The authors had already developed an assay that screens for epigenetic changes in immune cells in the blood, which they used to identify epigenetic signatures for a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis3. The assay analyses the way DNA is folded inside peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a key part of the immune system.\n\nThe researchers tested whether the same assay could be used to screen for similar epigenetic changes to immune cells in the blood of 47 individuals with severe ME/CFS, comparing the results with those from 61 healthy participants. The data showed that the assay achieved a 96% accuracy in diagnosing people with ME/CFS.\n\nThe authors found a network of genomic changes that were strongly involved in immune and inflammatory signalling. The authors say that this is consistent with an immune-dysregulation signal in ME/CFS, and underscores the strength of using these changes as biomarkers of the condition. And they say the changes they identified can be connected to specific regions of non-coding DNA, which can help to unpick the role of genetics in the condition and lead to a better mechanistic understanding.\n\n“I think it’s really cool they brought this method to the field,” says Katie Glass, a molecular biologist who studies ME/CFS at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “As far as it being a biomarker, my enthusiasm would be pretty tempered because the cohort is very small and they looked at only very severe patients.”\n\nBiological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge\n\nMany studies using various techniques to analyse everything from metabolites to free-floating RNA in the blood have identified several apparent signatures of ME/CFS, adds Glass, who previously had the condition but has now recovered.",

Credit: Anatomical Travelogue/SPL\n\nDuring ageing, men experience a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women do, according to a longitudinal study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1. The authors suggest this means that age-related brain changes do not explain why women are more frequently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease than men are.\n\n“It’s really important that we understand what happens in the healthy brain so that we can better understand what happens when people get these neurodegenerative conditions,” says Fiona Kumfor, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. This study adds to scientists’ understanding of typical brain ageing, she adds.\n\nNearly twice as many women are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease as men, and ageing is the biggest risk factor for the disease. This has prompted research into age-related sex differences in the brain. “If women’s brains declined more, that could have helped explain their higher Alzheimer’s prevalence,” says co-author Anne Ravndal, a PhD student at the University of Oslo.\n\nPrevious research investigating sex differences in brain ageing has shown mixed results, Ravndal adds. Several studies have found that men experience greater loss of total grey matter and hippocampus size compared with women, whereas other work has reported a sharper decline of grey matter in women.\n\nBrain scans\n\nThe latest study included more than 12,500 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans from 4,726 people — at least two scans per person, taken an average of three years apart — who did not have Alzheimer’s disease or any cognitive impairments and were control participants in 14 larger data sets. The researchers compared how the individuals’ brain structures changed over time, looking at factors including the thickness of grey matter and the size of areas that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as the hippocampus, which is essential to memory.\n\nOverall, men experienced a greater reduction in volume across more regions of the brain than women did. For example, the postcentral cortex, which is responsible for processing sensations of touch, pain and temperature, as well as the body’s own position and movements, declined by 2.0% per year in men and by 1.2% annually in women.\n\nKumfor says the results suggest that men age faster than women do. Men also have a shorter life expectancy.\n\nIf these changes did have a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, the study would have shown that women experience a greater decline in areas associated with the disease, such as the hippocampus and precuneus, which are involved in memory, says Amy Brodtmann, a clinician researcher in cognitive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nRavndal says the results point to other possible explanations for the sex differences in prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease, such as differences in survival or susceptibility to the disease.",

          "abstract": "The 2025 Sveriges Riksbank Prize for Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded to three researchers who have shown how technological and scientific innovation, coupled to market competition, drive economic growth.\n\nOne half of the prize goes to economic-historian Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and the other half is split between the economic theorists Philippe Aghion of the Collège de France and the London School of Economics and Peter Howitt of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n“I can’t find the words to express what I feel,” Aghion said. He says he will use the money for research in his laboratory at the Collège de France.\n\nThe award “underlies the importance in investing in science for innovation and long-term economic growth”, says economist Diane Coyle of the University of Cambridge. “It's great to see the Nobel prize recognize the importance of this topic,” adds innovation policy researcher Richard Jones of the University of Manchester, UK. “It's important that economists understand the conditions that lead to technological progress,” he adds. The winners, says Coyle, “have long been on people’s list of potential candidates”.\n\nOld isn’t gold\n\nEconomic growth at a rate of about 1-2 per cent annually is the norm for industrialized nations today. But such growth rates did not happen in earlier times, despite technological innovations, such as the windmill and the printing press.\n\nMokyr showed that the key difference between now and then was what he calls “useful knowledge”, or innovations based on scientific understanding1. One example is the advances made during the Industrial Revolution, beginning in the eighteenth century, when improvements in steam engines could be made systematic rather than by trial and error.\n\nAghion and Howitt, for their part, clarified the market mechanisms behind sustained growth in recent times. In 1992 they presented a model showing how competition between companies selling new products allows innovations to enter the marketplace and displaces older products: a process they called creative destruction2.\n\nUnderlying growth, in other words, is a steady churn of businesses and products. The researchers showed how companies invest in research and development (R&D) to improve their chances of finding a new product, and predicted the optimal level of such investment.\n\nEntrepreneurial state\n\nAccording to economist Ufuk Akcigit of the University of Chicago, Aghion and Howitt highlight an important aspect of economic growth, which is that spending on R&D does not by itself guarantee higher rates of growth: “Unless we replace inefficient firms from the economy, we cannot make space for newcomers with new ideas and better technologies.”\n\n“When a new entrepreneur emerges, they have every incentive to come up with a radical new technology,” Akcigit says. “As soon as they become an incumbent, their incentive vanishes” and they no longer invest in R&D to drive innovation.\n\nThus, because companies cannot expect to remain at the forefront of innovation indefinitely, the incentive for investing in R&D coming from market forces alone declines as a company’s market share grows. To guarantee the societal benefits of constant innovation, the model suggests that it is in society’s interests for the state to subsidize R&D, so long as the return is not merely incremental improvements.\n\nThe work of all three laureates also acknowledges the complex social consequences of growth. In the early days of the Industrial Revolution there were concerns about how mechanisation would cause unemployment of manual workers – a worry echoed today with the increasing use of AI in place of human labour. But Mokyr showed that in fact early mechanization led to the creation of new jobs.\n\nCreative destruction, meanwhile, leads to companies failing and jobs being lost. Aghion and Howitt emphasized that society needs safety nets and constructive negotiation of conflicts to navigate such problems.\n\nTheir model “recognizes the messiness and complexity of how innovation happens in real economies”, says Coyle. “The idea that a country’s productivity level increases by companies going bust and new ones coming in is a difficult sell, but the evidence that that’s part of the mechanism is pretty strong.”",

          "abstract": "Omar Yaghi, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday, emigrated from Jordan to the United States as a teenager.Credit: Brittany Hosea-Small/UC Berkeley\n\nOf the 202 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry and medicine this century, less than 70% hail from the country in which they were awarded their prize. The remaining 63 laureates left their country of birth before winning a Nobel prize, sometimes crossing international borders more than once, a Nature analysis shows (see ‘Nobel flows’).\n\nAmong the Nobel prizewinners who emigrated to other countries are two of three chemistry winners announced on Wednesday. Richard Robson was born in the United Kingdom but now lives in Australia. And Omar Yaghi, who is now a US resident, became the first Jordanian-born Nobel laureate in science. Two of the three physics winners for 2025 are also immigrants: Michel Devoret was born in France and John Clarke in the United Kingdom, but both are US residents.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nImmigrants have long played an important part on the Nobel stage, including illustrious scientists such as Albert Einstein, who moved from his birthplace in Germany to Switzerland (and later to the United States), and Marie Curie, who left her native Poland to work in France. That’s because the most fruitful scientific opportunities — the best training, equipment and research communities — are scattered across the globe. “Talent can be born anywhere, but opportunities are not,” says Ina Ganguli, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I think that’s the reason we see so many foreign Nobel laureates.”\n\nThe new analysis comes as the international flow of scientists and students faces growing obstacles. In the United States, for example, rampant grant cuts and stricter immigration policies implemented this year by the administration of President Donald Trump threaten a looming ‘brain drain’. Such restrictions “will slow the rate of highly novel research, period”, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science and technology policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the effects of Trump’s policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia has capped the number of international students that its institutions can enrol each year, and Japan proposed cutting financial support to graduate students from other countries.\n\nCommon destination\n\nAmong those who have already crossed borders is Andre Geim, a physicist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a 2010 physics laureate. Born in Russia to German parents, Geim says he “bounced around like a pinball” throughout his research career, holding positions in Russia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. “If you stay put your whole life, you miss half the game,” he says.\n\nOf the 63 laureates who won the prize after moving out of their birth countries, 41 lived in the United States when their Nobel was awarded. After the Second World War, the United States became a global hub for science, Ganguli says. International researchers flocked there for its generous grants and top universities (see ‘Nobel laureate stomping grounds’). “What we have in the US is unique. It’s a destination for top students and scientists,” says Ganguli. The next most popular landing place was the United Kingdom, which was home to seven of the Nobel prizewinners who had emigrated by the time they got the fateful phone call from Stockholm.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nBut, the United Kingdom also saw future prizewinners leave. Thirteen Nobel prizewinners who were born there won the prize while living elsewhere (see ‘Points of departure’), perhaps lured by higher salaries and more prestigious positions, Wagner says. Substantial numbers of future Nobel laureates also left Germany, with six expatriate prizewinners, as well as Japan, France and Russia, each with four expatriate laureates.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nAmong the science categories of the Nobel prizes, physics has the highest proportion of foreign-born laureates so far this century: 37% (see ‘Disciplines differ’). Trailing just behind is chemistry at 33%, and finally, medicine at 23%. Physics probably takes the lead because of its equipment-heavy nature, according to Wagner. The pricey colliders, reactors, lasers, detectors and telescopes that are needed for top-notch physics research reside mainly in a few leading nations. “Thus, the top research talent will likely go to places with top equipment. Medicine is not an equipment-heavy field, so it is easier to stay home,” Wagner says.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\nMoving on\n\nThe future of immigration’s interplay with the Nobels is murky. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have all enacted restrictions that have reduced the number of university students from abroad. The Trump administration has slashed billions of dollars in scientific research grants so far this year. And a new US policy charges US$100,000 per application for an H-1B visa, which some foreign-born researchers rely on to work in the United States.",

          "authors": "Michele Catanzaro",
          "abstract": "Researchers who study post-war reconstruction have told Nature that the recovery of public health, environment, higher education and research in Gaza will not succeed unless it is led by experts from the Palestinian territory.\n\nTheir warning comes amid images of jubilant scenes in Gaza yesterday as negotiators in Egypt sealed the first phase of US President Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan, which today was ratified by Israel’s cabinet.\n\nIsrael’s bombardment and ground offensive, which has killed more than 67,000 people, began soon after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\n\nUnder Trump’s plan, Hamas is expected to disarm, release the remaining hostages and play no part in Gaza’s governance. Israel’s government will suspend military action, withdraw its forces to an agreed position, free a number of Palestinian people it is holding in captivity, allow more aid into Gaza and permit United Nations agencies to operate in the territory. The precise details of how all this will be implemented have not been announced.\n\n“We woke up [yesterday] morning to happy, long-awaited news. There are so many celebrations here in Gaza right now,” says Farid Al-Qeeq, a researcher in urban planning and former president of Gaza University.\n\nThe researchers Nature interviewed for this article say it’s important that reconstruction is led by Palestinian communities. They are voicing these concerns now because Palestinian organizations have not been named as having a leadership role in Trump’s plan.\n\nSince the first attacks, Israel’s troops have almost completely destroyed Gaza’s physical infrastructure — including hospitals, other health-care facilities and water and sanitation.\n\nBy the end of August, a time when there were severe restrictions to aid getting through, more than half a million people were experiencing famine, the Famine Review Committee, an independent group of experts, concluded. Nearly 55,000 children below the age of five are acutely malnourished, according to data published in The Lancet on 8 September1 (see ‘Children malnourished’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nMore than 2,200 medical and education personnel have been killed, according to data published by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics based in Ramallah in the West Bank. Almost four-fifths of higher-education campuses have been damaged or destroyed, and 88,000 students at those institutions have been forced to put their studies on hold, according to the UN’s science agency UNESCO, based in Paris.\n\n“It’s important to understand the enormity of the scale of destruction”, says Savo Heleta, a researcher at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa who studies post-conflict higher education and aid flows to Palestinian universities. In a yet-to-be published paper, Heleta estimates that the war has damaged at least US$222 million worth of higher-education infrastructure. Rebuilding, he says, would need nearly five times that, at around $1 billion, because of the cost of clearing debris and removing unexploded bombs.\n\nHeleta also says that if past trends are a guide to the future, then “countries from the Gulf and Turkey are likely to be the main donors” for reconstruction. He adds that in previous years, aid for universities amounted to a maximum of just $20 million per year.\n\nAmani Al-Mqadma, head of international relations for the Islamic University of Gaza and a co-author of ‘Resilience in the rubble’, a report assessing the needs of higher education in Gaza, says that the territory’s priorities extend beyond physical reconstruction. They must also include sustaining online education until physical spaces are rebuilt; mental-health support for students and staff; and reconnecting researchers to the world through conferences, visits and scholarships. Because higher-education institutions in Gaza rely mostly on income from tuition fees, Al-Mqadma calls for aid to cover students’ fees to keep universities alive.\n\nLet Palestinians lead\n\nGaza’s scientific institutions should be crucial partners in the reconstruction efforts, says Al-Mqadma, who is currently based at the University of Edinburgh, UK. “These academics possess unparalleled local knowledge and a deep understanding of their land.” Moreover, “decisions about the region’s future must be informed by extensive input from the communities who will be most affected”, adds Naomi Rintoul-Hynes, a soil scientist at Canterbury Christ Church University, UK, who is studying the environmental impact on Gaza of the war.\n\nPeople gather in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on 9 October to celebrate the ceasefire agreement to end the war in Gaza.Credit: Saeed Qaq/Anadolu via Getty\n\nUnder Trump’s plan, a “technocratic” committee of Palestinian and international experts will be appointed to run public services. This will be under the oversight of an international body of decision makers, probably at the level of heads of government, and called the Board of Peace. The board will be chaired by Trump and will include former UK prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nSultan Barakat, a public-policy researcher at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, says many respected academics will not participate in the committee if it turns out to be “the management of an occupation”.\n\n“There will be a lot of questioning around this committee”, says Barakat, who is co-author of a report, ‘Gaza: leadership and reconstruction for the day after’, published last year.\n\nIraq’s ghosts",

          "authors": "Katie Kavanagh",
          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is listed as a high-priority pathogen by the World Health Organization.Credit: Dennis Kunkel Microscopy/Science Photo Library\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause 39 million deaths worldwide over the next 25 years. But global efforts to find treatments for drug-resistant infections are not going to plan, according to two reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) released on 2 October1,2. The reports show that the global antibiotic drug-development pipeline is facing a dual crisis: a scarcity of drugs in development and a lack of innovation in methods to fight drug-resistant bacteria.\n\n“Antimicrobial resistance is escalating, but the pipeline of new treatments and diagnostics is insufficient to tackle the spread of drug-resistant bacterial infections,” said Yukiko Nakatani, who is the WHO assistant director-general for health systems in Geneva, Switzerland, in a statement. “Without more investment in research and development (R&D), together with dedicated efforts to ensure that new and existing products reach the people who most need them, drug-resistant infections will continue to spread.”\n\nPublic-health research has highlighted the extent of the AMR crisis. A report published in The Lancet3 last year found that the annual number of deaths from drug-resistant infections could increase to nearly two million by 2050, up from one million a year between 1990 and 2021. The total number of deaths attributable to AMR is predicted to rise to 1.91 million in 2050, with a further 8.22 million associated deaths (see ‘Resistance on the rise’).\n\n“Awareness of this issue is increasing; however, it is still a silent pandemic with many deaths not being attributed to AMR,” says Rietie Venter, a microbiologist at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.\n\nSource: Ref. 3\nToo few drugs\n\nThe WHO reports suggest that the world is failing to meet the United Nations’ target of reducing mortality caused by AMR by 2030 because of delays in the antibiotic drug-development pipeline. According to the analysis from the WHO, 90 antibacterial drugs are currently in development (see ‘Innovation crisis’). However, only 15 qualify as innovative — drugs that exert an additional clinically significant benefit — and only five are effective against at least one of the ‘critical bacteria’ listed on the WHO’s bacterial priority pathogen list. Since 2023, the number of antibacterial drugs in clinical-development pipelines has decreased after a WHO ruling stated that some of them were non-innovative.\n\nThe preclinical pipeline remains active, with 232 programmes across 148 groups worldwide. However, 90% of companies involved are small firms, which highlights the fragility of the R&D ecosystem, the report says. Large pharmaceutical companies have been leaving the antibiotics market for years owing to a lack of financial investment and low approval ratings of new antibiotics.\n\nSource: go.nature.com/48evg3p\nRising infections\n\nEven if they materialize, the development of new antibiotics still won’t be enough to curb the rise in deaths from drug-resistant infections. AMR happens when bacteria and other microorganisms evolve ways to become resistant to drugs after being exposed to them, meaning drug makers have to play a constant cat-and-mouse game of creating new antibiotics to overcome evolving resistance.\n\nUltimately, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial drugs in human medicine and agriculture are the main drivers of AMR, which is why cuts to antibiotic usage are needed to reduce drug-resistant infections, alongside new antibiotic therapies. Gwen Knight and Kathryn Holt, who are co-directors of the AMR Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, say that there are insufficient data to know the relative importance of livestock versus human antibiotic use in driving AMR.\n\nWorld leaders have committed to cutting the global use of antibiotics to reduce AMR-related deaths by 10% by 2030. However, the pledge doesn’t look likely to succeed, because projections suggest that antibiotic use in both humans and livestock will increase in the years ahead (see ‘Animal antimicrobials’). “We cannot prevent the development of AMR, but we can implement measures to slow it down, and currently, we are not super successful with this,” says Venter.\n\nSource: Ref. 5\n\nReducing antibiotic use in livestock is a priority, because it represents 73% of global sales of a range of antimicrobial agents4. Annual antibiotic use in livestock has increased in the past few decades and, despite pledges to reduce it, is projected to increase by almost 30% by 2040 from a 2019 baseline5. The rise is due to increasing demand for meat in developing regions, especially in countries such as China and Thailand. In Asia, meat production has increased 15-fold since 1961, way above the global average of a 4-fold increase.\n\nAntibiotic use in human health-care has also remained high since 20006, and is increasing in countries that do not have access to high-quality health-care infrastructure, which contributes to inappropriate antibiotic use (see ‘Antibiotic use’).\n\nSource: Ref. 6\nPriority pathogens\n\nIn 2024, the WHO published its bacterial priority pathogen list, which highlights drug-resistant bacteria on the basis of their threat level to public health (see ‘Priority bacteria’). Many of the deadliest infections are caused by a group of bacteria with particularly strong drug resistance, called gram-negative bacteria. This category includes Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii — a pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections. Only five of the antibacterials currently in the drug-development pipeline are effective against these priority bacteria.",

          "title": "Digital flocks, predators allow ecologists to simulate real-world animal behaviour",
          "authors": "Heather Richardson",
          "abstract": "On arriving at work one day last October, ecologist Koen de Koning did what he often does first thing in the morning: he fired up the Crane Radar. The interactive web application showed a flock of cranes heading his way. Excitedly, he dashed outside, looked up and, sure enough, 60 or so birds flew past on their migration route south.\n\nThe Crane Radar is a digital twin — a virtual representation of a real-world entity and a relatively new technology in ecology (see go.nature.com/46rbkg4). “I’ve definitely seen more of the migration because of the radar. And I’m learning more about the migration patterns as well,” says De Koning, who works at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands and is a keen birder.\n\nIn fields such as manufacturing, infrastructure and health care, the technology has been used to model objects from electronics components to UK hospital wards and even the nation of Singapore.\n\nHow a vast digital twin of the Yangtze River could prevent flooding in China\n\nTheir purposes vary. Digital twins can make life easier for individual users — Google Maps, for example, is continuously updated to help drivers to navigate traffic. Other programs can predict the effects of climate change on cities, plan architecture or simulate surgical procedures. HeartNavigator, a software package from the Dutch health-technology firm Philips, can be used to plan heart operations such as valve replacements, simulating surgery using various models and sizes of valve to find the best fit for a patient.\n\nNASA used what is often considered the first digital twin (then called a living model) in 1970 to work out why an oxygen tank exploded on the Apollo 13 lunar mission and to bring the astronauts home safely. The agency’s principal technologist, John Vickers, coined the term digital twin in 2010, a few years after US systems engineer Michael Grieves formalized the concept in a presentation to the manufacturing industry when he was co-director of the Project Lifecycle Management Development Consortium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nOver the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the development of digital twins across a range of fields. This is mostly because of the increasing availability of data, the prevalence of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. The global digital-twin market is forecast to grow by more than sevenfold over the next 5 years, according to one report — from US$21 billion this year to $150 billion in 2030 (see go.nature.com/4nctfu2). The fastest growth is anticipated in health care, the report says, owing to the technology’s potential for reducing errors and improving diagnoses and surgical outcomes.\n\nFor ecologists, digital twins present unique opportunities. But there are limitations that need to be addressed, from ensuring adequate data access to sustainable funding.\n\nEcological digital twins\n\nDigital twins can be particularly useful for studying systems that are changing outside historical norms, says Anna Davison, who is researching digital twins in ecology at Wageningen University & Research. That includes how ecosystems react to anthropogenic climate change. So it’s perhaps no surprise that ecologists are increasingly using digital twins to tackle gaps in biodiversity research brought about by ecosystem complexities, ponderous government action and a lack of real-time monitoring.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Crane Radar is one of four digital twins developed by Wageningen University & Research as part of a €300,000 (US$352,000) project funded by the European Union, called Nature FIRST. It forecasts the migration of common cranes (Grus grus) across the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, northern France and northwestern Germany, helping birdwatchers and ecologists to locate the flocks as they traverse the region.\n\nDe Koning says he chose crane migration as the focus of his first digital twin because of the abundance of data and because it is a relatively simple process to model. He also had a personal motivation: “I was always in the wrong location or at the wrong place at the time” to see the cranes, De Koning jokes. “This model really helped me, personally, to see them more often.”\n\nSims-style ‘digital twin’ models can tell us if food systems will weather crises\n\nTo build a digital twin, scientists first need to collect the relevant data for the real-world entity, whether that be real-time data from IoT devices or historical records. Then they must develop algorithms to mimic the behaviour of the physical twin and test the model — for example, by fitting historical data sets to recent ones — before applying the trained model to real-time data.\n\nCreated over the course of about a year and costing roughly €15,000–20,000, the Crane Radar uses migration data (sourced from Movebank, an online animal-tracking database), real-time sightings by birdwatchers and factors such as wind speed and direction of flight to estimate where the birds will be within the next four hours (K. De Koning Ecol. Inform. 85, 102938; 2025).\n\nWageningen researchers partnered with Sensing Clues, a conservation technology non-profit organization in Amsterdam, to transform their models into platforms that can be easily accessed and understood by end users — members of the public, policymakers and other researchers.\n\nBirdwatchers can also log sightings (including the location, time, direction of flight and number of cranes) through Observation.org, a citizen-science platform for biodiversity. The crane digital twin updates every minute; the website has a slight lag, updating every five minutes with a four-hour forecast for each sighting.\n\nThe Crane Radar has been well received by Dutch birders. It receives an average of 100,000 daily visits during peak migration season in late October and early November, dipping down to 1,000 on quieter days. After it was featured by Dutch national news, however, more than 300,000 users engaged with the app each day over the subsequent weekend, De Koning says.\n\n“It’s a really nice, completely closed loop where the end user is also the data provider,” says Davison, who has developed a digital twin for the migration of Beluga sturgeon (Huso huso) in the Danube River delta.\n\nModelling ecosystems\n\nA more complex digital twin is being built to mirror ecosystems in Doñana National Park in southern Spain.\n\n“The park is a key essential biodiversity area in Europe – however, it is threatened by multiple human activities,” says Maria Paniw, a researcher at Doñana Biological Station in Seville. Threats include overexploitation of water, agricultural development outside the park, tourism and climate change. “We wanted to understand how all these different factors affect the ecosystem in a real-time complex setting, not through simple approximations based on single species that we typically do in ecology.”\n\nThe first effort by Paniw’s team models interactions between vegetation, rabbits and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), a ‘keystone species’ in the park. Its conservation status has recently improved — it moved from endangered to vulnerable status last year, thanks to efforts to boost its numbers, including protection of habitat and translocations of the animals to expand its genetic diversity.\n\nResearchers set up digital-twin experiments in Spain’s Doñana National Park.Credit: Hanna Serediuk/Doñana Biological Station (EBD-CSIC)\n\nAlongside a detailed database of lynx reproduction statistics and movements (all reintroduced lynx have GPS tracking collars) and rabbit data from hunting organizations and other national parks, the researchers use a metric called the normalized difference vegetation index. This measures the verdancy of landscapes and is constantly updated using satellite imagery to assess changes in plant density and health. The aim is to show how rabbits respond to changes in vegetation and weather, and how lynx, in turn, respond to changes in rabbit abundance. The findings will inform where lynx can be best reintroduced into the environment and where they might move from those release sites.\n\n“We basically started with part of the system that has the most data and the most urgent need to get something done,” explains Paniw. She hopes that this approach will convince park managers of the usefulness of digital twins before they build more complex models. “They need to see value in this.”\n\nOther researchers have built digital twins of river systems across Europe, Africa and Asia. A digital twin of the River Stiffkey in southeastern England was built by regional water company Anglian Water and partners including Microsoft and the University of Suffolk, UK. The aim is to model strategies to improve the health and biodiversity of the chalk-stream habitat — a rare type that is threatened by warming water and pollution. Digital twins of the Yangtze River in China and parts of the River Douro in Portugal are also in development, along with three twins of rivers in Kenya.\n\nRivers are “a rich environment for demonstrating the viability of these models,” explains computer scientist Lawrence Nderu, chair of the Department of Computing at Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology near Nairobi. “They are very dynamic.”\n\nNderu is developing a twin of the Mara River basin in Narok County, southwestern Kenya, as part of a collaboration between his university and the Slovenian space technology organization Space-SI in Ljubljana, which builds applications to acquire satellite data.\n\nThe Narok area is hit with periodic severe flooding that can be life-threatening. Nderu’s team is designing its digital twin to alert communities and authorities to predicted flooding events, integrating data from weather stations, soil sensors and satellites, together with information about the river system and surrounding landscape. That should allow vulnerable populations to plan ahead, he says. Nomadic herders, for example, can move their cattle to higher ground.\n\n“Otherwise, we will always be talking about what should have been done, which is always a very costly conversation,” Nderu adds.\n\nTwin challenges\n\nThat reliance on up-to-the-minute data, however, reveals a key challenge for digital twins: having sensors in the field is one thing, but they need to be connected to the Internet for the data to be useful. Data quality can be an issue, too – De Koning says citizen observations of cranes, for example, often include inaccurate time stamps, locations or identification, which can muddle the resulting models.\n\nFor Nderu, there is also the issue of data storage. His digital twins require volumes of data — including about 2.5 terabytes of compressed video files per year — that can be costly to store in the cloud in Kenya (he estimates about US$800 annually). “We are trying to approach [cloud] companies like AWS to provide us with that,” he says.\n\nDe Koning says that because digital twins are so new, people are often unaware of their potential. Scientists need to first explain possible outcomes before users can express how a digital twin could be helpful to them.\n\nThe Internet of Things comes to the lab\n\nAlso a challenge, Paniw and Davison say, is sustainability — specifically, balancing the short-term nature of research funding with the length of time it takes to build a digital twin and the cost of maintaining it.",

Introducing genetic changes to these frogs could help to make them more resistant to infections.Credit: James Cook University\n\nThe global conservation community is debating whether to ban the release of genetically modified organisms into the wild. Dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a moratorium on field applications of synthetic biology — a technology being studied as a tool to fight diseases, control pests and help endangered species — saying that the approach has unpredictable consequences. But some researchers argue that an outright ban is too restrictive, and could have negative consequences for human health and biodiversity.\n\nHow genetically modified mosquitoes could eradicate malaria\n\nA proposal for a ban will face a vote next week at a congress of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Abu Dhabi. The IUCN brings together governments and civil-society organizations to guide global conservation policy. Although decisions made by its members are not legally binding, they do influence legislation in many countries, says biologist Piero Genovesi, head of the Wildlife Service at the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research in Rome.\n\nIf members vote in favour of the proposed ban, it “could have stronger impacts in areas like Europe or Australia, where there are many lines of research focused on developing new tools based on synthetic biology for improving the efficacy of conservation action”, Genovesi says. He is among more than 240 scientists who have so far signed an open letter asking IUCN members to reject the moratorium.\n\nOngoing debate\n\nThis is not the first time conservationists have debated whether the genetic engineering of wild species should be allowed. A moratorium on gene drives, a way of introducing engineered genes so that they spread rapidly through a population, was proposed at the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity meeting in 2016, and again in 2018 — but was ultimately rejected.\n\nThose in favour of the latest proposal argue that the effects of genetic biotechnologies on nature — and on insects in particular — are hard to predict and could be irreversible. “These new technologies risk adding to the pressures already threatening pollinators,” said Joann Sy, scientific adviser at POLLINIS, a non-profit organization based in Paris that is focused on the conservation of bees and other pollinators, in a statement released by the organization. More than 80 researchers have signed an open letter in support of the moratorium, which says that the deployment of genetically modified organisms is “advancing faster than safety and risk assessment can keep pace” and that “no release should occur unless and until it can be demonstrated that there are no direct or indirect risks to pollinators, biodiversity or ecosystems”.\n\nGenetically modified apple reaches US stores, but will consumers bite?",

          "authors": "Yarin Gal, Stephen Casper",
          "abstract": "In the past three months, several state-of-the-art AI systems have been released with open weights, meaning their core parameters can be downloaded and customized by anyone. Examples include reasoning models such as Kimi-K2-Instruct from technology company Moonshot AI in Beijing, GLM-4.5 by Z.ai, also in Beijing, and gpt-oss by the California firm OpenAI in San Francisco. Early evaluations suggest that these are the most advanced open-weight systems so far, approaching the performance of today’s leading closed models.\n\nWill AI speed up literature reviews or derail them entirely?\n\nOpen-weight systems are the lifeblood of research and innovation in AI. They improve transparency, make large-scale testing easier and encourage diversity and competition in the marketplace. But they also pose serious risks. Once released, harmful capabilities can spread quickly and models cannot be withdrawn. For example, synthetic child sexual-abuse material is most commonly generated using open-weight models1. Many copies of these models are shared online, often altered by users to strip away safety features, making them easier to misuse.\n\nOn the basis of our experience and research at the UK AI Security Institute (AISI), we (the authors) think that a healthy open-weight model ecosystem will be essential for unlocking the benefits of AI. However, developing rigorous scientific methods for monitoring and mitigating the harms of these systems is crucial. Our work at AISI focuses on researching and building such methods. Here we lay out some key principles.\n\nFresh safeguarding strategies\n\nIn the case of closed AI systems, developers can rely on an established safety toolkit2. They can add safeguards such as content filters, control who accesses the tool and enforce acceptable-use policies. Even when users are allowed to adapt a closed model using an application programming interface (API) and custom training data, the developer can still monitor and regulate the process. In contrast to closed AI systems, open-weight models are much harder to safeguard and require a different approach.\n\nTraining-data curation. Today, most large AI systems are trained on vast amounts of web data, often with little filtering. This means that they can absorb harmful material, such as explicit images or detailed instructions on cyberattacks, which makes them capable of generating outputs such as non-consensual ‘deepfake’ images or hacking guides.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nOne promising approach is careful data curation — removing harmful material before training begins. Earlier this year, AISI worked with the non-profit AI-research group EleutherAI to test this approach on open-weight models. By excluding content related to biohazards from the training data, we produced models that were much less capable of answering questions about biological threats.\n\nIn controlled experiments, these filtered models resisted extensive retraining on harmful material — still not giving dangerous answers for up to 10,000 training steps — whereas previous safety methods typically broke down after only a few dozen3. Crucially, this stronger protection came without any observed loss of ability on unrelated tasks (see ‘Improving AI safety’).\n\nSource: Ref. 3\n\nThe research also revealed important limits. Although filtered models did not internalize dangerous knowledge, they could still use harmful information if it was provided later — for example, through access to web-search tools. This shows that data filtering alone is not enough, but it can serve as a strong first line of defence.\n\nRobust fine-tuning. A model can be adjusted after its initial training to reduce harmful behaviours — essentially, developers can teach it not to produce unsafe outputs. For example, when asked about how to hot-wire a car, a model might be trained to say “Sorry, I can’t help with that.”\n\nHowever, current approaches are fragile. Studies show that even training the model with a few carefully chosen examples can undo these safeguards in minutes. For instance, some researchers have found that for OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo model, the safety guardrails against assisting in harmful tasks can be bypassed by training on as few as ten examples of harmful responses at a cost of less than US$0.204.\n\n‘Open source’ AI isn’t truly open — here’s how researchers can reclaim the term",

Scientists can search the archives and trace biological contexts in big data.Credit: Andrew Brookes/Connect Images/SPL\n\nThe Internet has Google. Now biology has MetaGraph. Detailed today in Nature1, the search engine can quickly sift through the staggering volumes of biological data housed in public repositories.\n\n“It’s a huge achievement,” says Rayan Chikhi, a biocomputing researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. “They set a new standard” for analysing raw biological data — including DNA, RNA and protein sequences — from databases that can contain millions of billions of DNA letters, amounting to ‘petabases’ of information, more entries than all the webpages in Google’s vast index.\n\nAlthough MetaGraph is tagged as ‘Google for DNA’, Chikhi likens the tool to a search engine for YouTube, because the tasks are more computationally demanding. In the same way that YouTube searches can retrieve every video that features, say, red balloons even when those key words don’t appear in the title, tags or description, MetaGraph can uncover genetic patterns hidden deep within expansive sequencing data sets without needing those patterns to be explicitly annotated in advance.\n\n“It enables things that cannot be done in any other way,” Chikhi says.\n\nSmart software untangles gene regulation in cells\n\nIndexing life’s library\n\nThe motivation behind MetaGraph was to address an accessibility problem in sequencing data sets. The size of these repositories has risen at a blistering pace in the past few decades, but this growth has presented challenges for the scientists using the data they contain. Raw sequencing reads are fragmented, noisy and too numerous to search directly. “The volume of the data, paradoxically, is the main inhibitor of us actually using the data,” says Artem Babaian, a computational biologist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nAccording to one of the study authors, André Kahles, a bioinformatician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in Switzerland, MetaGraph could help researchers to ask biological questions of repositories such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), a public database containing in excess of 100 million billion DNA letters2.\n\nThey tackled the problem through the use of mathematical ‘graphs’ that links overlapping DNA fragments together, much like sentences that share the same words lining up in a book index.\n\nThe researchers integrated data from seven publicly funded data repositories, creating 18.8 million unique DNA and RNA sequence sets and 210 billion amino-acid sequence sets across all clades of life — including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, including humans. They also developed a search engine for these sequences, in which users use text prompts to search these integrated archives of raw data.\n\n“It is a totally new way to interact with this body of data,” says Kahles. “It’s compressed, but accessible on the fly.”\n\nThe huge protein database that spawned AlphaFold and biology’s AI revolution\n\nTo demonstrate the utility of MetaGraph, the study authors used it to scan 241,384 human gut microbiome samples for genetic indicators of antibiotic resistance around the world, building on work that used an earlier version of the tool to track drug-resistance genes in bacterial strains that live in subway systems across major urban centres3. The authors say they performed the analysis in about an hour on a high-powered computer.\n\nOpen road to discovery",

It set out to review the scientific literature to advise professional societies, which issue guidelines — usually derived from official advice — that are followed by many clinicians. The initial results of the review are already being reflected in vaccine guidelines issued by medical societies and certain US states. (The review’s results have not yet been peer reviewed, but will be submitted to a journal later this week.)\n\n“I am taking my nights and weekends and every other spare minute I can find to devote to this project,” says Caitlin Dugdale, an infectious-disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a volunteer for the project. “I really believe in the importance of having an independent, unbiased group of people look at the data and present the data publicly.”\n\nWhy did scientists take action?\n\nThe VIP initiative’s review follows changes to the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which issues influential vaccine recommendations for the US population. In June, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a long-time anti-vaccine activist, fired the entire panel; he has since hand-picked 12 new members.\n\nLast month, the ACIP recommended putting restrictions on the use of a childhood vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV). It also stopped short of recommending COVID-19 vaccines, instead advising that people make their own decision about whether to get vaccinated — a reversal of previous policy. The panel has yet to advise on vaccines against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but the committee’s initial decisions raise doubts about its credibility, those behind the VIP say.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, which Kennedy heads, stood by the reconstituted panel, stating that the group reflects a “diversity of viewpoints”.\n\n“Secretary Kennedy is restoring public trust by reconstituting ACIP with highly credentialed doctors, scientists, and public health experts committed to evidence-based medicine, gold standard science, and common sense,” the statement says.\n\nChildhood vaccines up for review in the US: what’s at stake\n\nThe VIP’s team of volunteer scientists spent months poring over the latest data on three seasonal vaccines — for COVID-19, flu and RSV — to inform recommendations for the autumn and winter seasons.\n\nThe group’s review was extensive, encompassing all the data that have been generated on the three vaccines since the ACIP performed a similar review last year, says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and the director of CIDRAP. Normally, the ACIP itself would do that review in collaboration with representatives of medical societies, but these specialists have been excluded from the panel’s working groups.\n\nMore than 20 volunteers — all people with a scientific or public-health background — participated in the VIP’s effort. The team sifted through more than 17,000 abstracts, and ultimately included data from more than 500 papers in its review. “Cleaning those data, analysing those data, trying to put them together in any kind of digestible manuscript, is really a feat,” Dugdale says.\n\nThe analysis found, for example, that pregnant people who received COVID-19, RSV or flu vaccines generally had similar or lower risks of problems such as miscarriage and congenital anomalies compared with those who did not receive the jabs. The work also revealed that immunocompromised adults over the age of 60 had an increased, although still low, risk of Guillain–Barré syndrome — an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis — after an RSV vaccine.\n\nIn August, the group organized a livestream session to publicly present the data relating to vaccines for pregnant people, children and immunocompromised adults. And last week, the researchers launched a web tool that allows users to explore the data.",

          "abstract": "From short scripts to vast simulations of Earth’s climate, protein structures or even the cosmos, it is hard to imagine scientific research without software. Scientists use software code in myriad ways — to plan experiments; to record, organize, analyse, visualize and archive data; to control scientific instruments, and more.\n\nWhy it’s worth making computational methods easy to use\n\nBut software evolves. Most open-source software used in research is refined both iteratively and collectively, and has no published ‘version of record’. Updates can target various versions and releases, meaning that each aspect of the software — the project as a whole, a specific version or a single file — can require a different way to refer to it. This creates confusion.\n\nAnd so software comes with a double bind: like data, it supports the findings of a study and should be preserved and published. Yet it should also remain available and supported, and possibly be improved, over time. Scholars, librarians, research institutions and funding agencies are wrestling with how to reconcile these two requirements.\n\nRecent efforts to do this1 have focused on adapting a set of principles initially developed2 to make research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). But this approach relies on tracking data, archiving them and making metadata available. For software, it would create a large administrative burden that would have to be sustained for decades. That would be disproportionately time-consuming to those who maintain and improve software — and whose efforts are already underappreciated. Imagine, for example, maintaining a software package that has tens of contributors (which is not rare). Each release and version requires a new upload to an archive, with updates to the metadata, author list, dependencies (any other software required for programs to run), interoperability (which other programs it can work with) and more. Some programs have a weekly or even daily release cycle, making the FAIR approach impractical.\n\nResearchers must be able to publish a piece of software without the need for lengthy bureaucratic procedures to identify rights holders, choose an open licence and protect intellectual property.\n\n‘Open source’ AI isn’t truly open — here’s how researchers can reclaim the term\n\nAs researchers and engineers with expertise in software development in various scientific domains — ranging from computer science to neuroscience, physics and chemistry — we have recently proposed an approach called ‘CODE beyond FAIR’ that outlines how software can be better handled, shared and maintained. Here, we outline recommendations for two groups: the scholars who develop software (see Supplementary information (SI), Table S1), and the research institutions, funders, libraries and publishers that use it (see SI, Table S2). Our recommendations are based on our collaborative experience in developing open-source software, but also draw from the work of free and open-source software (FOSS) communities. These have long experience of project governance, funding, recognizing individual contributions and training future contributors.\n\nTrain scientists to share code\n\nSharing the code that has been used to reach a paper’s conclusions is important for research integrity and reproducibility, but practices vary widely among research communities. Permissive licences, which let others use and modify software with few restrictions, are increasingly common, particularly in computer science, mathematics and physics, yet most software is still not published at all.\n\nPlatforms exist to share code, such as GitHub or GitLab, and to archive it, such as in the repositories Zenodo or Software Heritage, which can capture the whole history of a project3.\n\nAll researchers should know how to share and deposit code. That needn’t mean that all scientists must spend time and resources keeping abreast of this fast-paced field. Finding the right level of expertise to ensure that researchers know how to document, share and archive code in their field is crucial.\n\nWhy NASA and federal agencies are declaring this the Year of Open Science\n\nOne way to improve matters is to train all PhD students from all scientific disciplines in the basics of software engineering during the first year or so of their postgraduate research careers. Institutions must embed this in all scientific curricula. Several universities, including Stanford and Harvard in the United States and Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom, already offer (and in some cases, require) at least one introductory programming or computational-thinking course — even for degrees that are not scientific or technical.\n\nInternational training organizations exist that teach data and computational skills to wide audiences with basic or no knowledge of software development. For example, the Neuromatch Academy for global neuroscience education — co-founded by computational neuroscientists Dan Goodman and Konrad Körding during the COVID-19 pandemic4 — reported having supported more than 2,000 students from more than 100 countries through online training in 2024. And The Carpentries, founded in 1998 by Greg Wilson to improve the computational skills of researchers5, has facilitated or organized almost 4,800 workshops in more than 70 countries so far. These courses range from basic computational skills (such as in the programming languages Shell, R and Python, and version control) to advanced concepts (statistics and machine learning) as well as discipline-specific advanced skills.\n\nBoost archiving processes\n\nTo increase the uptake of good practices, publishers should mandate the sharing and archiving of code at the time of publication. It is as simple as clicking a button on the Software Heritage or GitHub platforms. GitHub, now owned by Microsoft, has become the de facto international hub for code sharing.\n\nInstitutions should support efforts to connect portals to ensure adequate cross-referencing between different projects and versions, such as those in the European Open Science Cloud research-support platform.",

Unlike those drugs, which are derived from naturally occurring opium, nitazenes are synthesized from scratch in a laboratory. The first nitazenes were developed as painkillers in the 1950s, but were never approved for medical use because they carried a high risk of dangerous side effects such as loss of consciousness, coma and death.\n\nBut since 2019, there has been a rise in the reported use of nitazenes, according to the World Drug Report 2025, which was released in June. In 2023, the report states, 20 different nitazenes were seized by authorities across 28 countries and reported to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Early Warning Advisory on New Psychoactive Substances.\n\nNitazenes can be as much as 500 times more potent than opium-derived drugs. For example, butonitazene is 2.5 times more potent than heroin, whereas isotonitazene and etonitazene are 250 and 500 times more potent, respectively.\n\nThis means that just a tiny amount can be deadly. In the United Kingdom, there were 179 confirmed deaths from nitazene overdoses in the year to 31 May 2024. And reports suggest that thousands of people might have died from nitazene overdoses in the United States since 2019. In Australia, researchers note that the unpredictable presence of nitazenes in various drugs is increasing the risk of overdose in the country.\n\nMost nitazene overdoses are unintentional, says Suzanne Nielsen, an addiction researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Overdose tends to occur when nitazenes are sold as other drugs, such as heroin, oxycodone and MDMA (also known as ecstasy). Overdoses can be treated with naloxone, a drug that has long been used to treat other opioid overdoses. More awareness of this among drug users and their families could help save lives, Nielsen adds.\n\nGlobal picture",

          "abstract": "Neurons (pictured) in a brain region called the parabrachial nucleus have been implicated in creating the sensation of pain that persists long after an initial injury.Credit: Mike Agliolo/SPL\n\nScientists have spotted a small set of easily overlooked brain cells that is activated during persistent pain — the kind that lasts long after an initial injury. The research was performed in mice, but if it can be confirmed in humans, the work could lead to new therapies for chronic pain.\n\nSuch pain affects roughly one in five people worldwide. “Pain is in your head. But it is very real,” says Nicholas Betley, a biologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and a co-author of a new study describing the findings.\n\nThe authors’ experiments also show that the release of a specific signalling chemical in the brain can dampen the activity of the persistent-pain neurons, suggesting that the brain itself has an innate pain-killing mechanism.\n\nWhen pain persists\n\nIn the study, published in Nature1 on 8 October, Betley and his team focused on a brain region called the parabrachial nucleus, which receives multiple types of sensory information from the body. The nucleus then relays those data to other regions of the brain.\n\nIn studies on mice, the researchers identified a subset of neurons distributed throughout the parabrachial nucleus that switched on after an initial painful stimulus, such as a cut to a nerve, and remained active long after the insult. The persistent-pain neurons carry receptors for a signalling molecule called neuropeptide Y.\n\nChronic pain can be treated — so why are millions still suffering?\n\nWhen the researchers artificially activated these ‘Y1R’ neurons, mice showed pain-associated behaviours. When the scientists blocked the activity of these neurons, the animals’ persistent pain decreased, yet they had normal short-lived pain responses after being exposed to dangers, such as touching a hot surface. The Y1R neurons alone don’t cause the feeling of pain, Betley says. But, they form part of the network “that leads to the sensation that we refer to as pain”.\n\nMice with persistent pain were also deprived of food or water or exposed to a frightening stimulus, such as a component of bobcat urine. In each case, the animals’ behaviour and neural activity suggested that their persistent pain had been reduced. For example, two weeks after a nerve injury, hungry mice ignored a poke to their paws that would normally make them recoil. “In the wild, we think this would allow them to shift focus from their pain to go out and seek food,” says Betley.\n\nThe researchers attributed the pain reduction to an influx into the parabrachial nucleus of neuropeptide Y, which had been released by neurons in other parts of the brain that became active when the mice developed urgent needs. “Something more important than pain came along,” says co-author Ann Kennedy, a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. “We think of pain as just a sensory input,” she says, ”but the sensation of pain is a lot more malleable, and it’s changed by our experiences.”",

          "abstract": "Metals are at the heart of the global economy, from power generation and storage to transport. But their supply chains face three interlinked challenges: dwindling reserves, rising demand and high greenhouse-gas emissions1–3.\n\nAt the current rates of extraction and use, the known reserves of some metals, including copper, nickel and chromium, will only last for the next few decades1,2. And these rates do not take into account rising demand as the world’s population grows and new technologies emerge3 (see ‘Three-part problem’).\n\nFurthermore, the mining and extraction of most metals, as well as their melting, refining, alloying, casting and shaping, are a large source of greenhouse gases. Steelmaking alone accounts for about 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions, or 3.6 billion tonnes3 — more than three times what the aviation sector contributes.\n\nThere are currently no concrete, commonly accepted long-term solutions or implementation plans. Here, based on our expertise in materials science and engineering, we outline a set of five strategies that, together, can address the challenges. The solutions that societies choose will have wide-reaching consequences for our ways of life, economy and the well-being of our planet and future generations.\n\nSources: Reserves: ref. 1; In demand: ref. 2; Emissions: World Steel in Figures 2024 and Sustainability Indicators 2024 reports (World Steel Association)\nSwap materials\n\nA small tweak in a material’s chemical composition can go a long way in reducing the amount of metals used. Take steel, for example. About one billion tonnes of carbon–manganese steel are used each year globally for buildings and other infrastructure. However, using another type of steel — which has almost the same amounts of carbon, manganese and silicon, but also contains tiny amounts of niobium (about 0.03% in weight) — increases the material’s strength and toughness4. Niobium-microalloyed steel is slightly more expensive than conventional steel. But because it is stronger, less material is required4,5, lowering the total cost of a building. Reducing steel consumption can also reduce CO2 emissions4,5 by some 20%.\n\nAir taxis will soon be in our skies — if batteries can be made safer\n\nResearchers are investigating other substitutions, too. For example, rare-earth magnets, which require elements such as dysprosium or terbium, could be replaced with less environmentally damaging ones based on iron nitride6. And sodium-ion batteries7 could replace lithium-ion ones to circumvent lithium’s global supply limitations, high extraction costs and the environmental damage it causes during extraction. Scientists are also studying thermal batteries that store energy as heat rather than as electricity and that are made from materials such as cement and crushed rock.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption of materials with lower carbon footprints, governments should update policies and regulations. Governments and industry can also create certification schemes that reward low-emission material choices, helping designers, engineers and consumers to make informed decisions. And universities should include substitution principles in engineering and materials education, to train a workforce to select materials that have a minimal environmental impact, not just high performance.\n\nAcademia and industry must work together closely, through industry-funded fellowships, joint research programmes and institutions such as the US Engineering Research Centers, which are supported by the National Science Foundation.\n\nAdopt green technologies\n\nThe metal-production industry urgently needs to reduce its environmental impact. Aluminium production, for example, is responsible for around 270 million tonnes of CO2 a year (one-tenth that of steel). It also releases toxic fluorine-containing species, which are powerful greenhouse gases. And copper smelting releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide, contributing to acid rain.\n\nGreen manufacturing technologies that lower emissions are needed. Many exist already. For instance, a top gas recycling blast furnace that reuses carbon dioxide from the ironmaking process can reduce emissions substantially8. Other harmful by-products can also be upcycled. In copper smelting, for example, sulfur dioxide can be converted into usable compounds, such as sulfuric acid.\n\nBattery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?\n\nInnovations in hydrometallurgy and bioleaching9 that use microorganisms to break down the minerals in ores and release pure metals are revolutionizing extraction. They can take nickel, copper and gold from ores with low concentrations of these elements and avoid energy-intensive smelting procedures, enabling metal extraction from sources that were previously too expensive to mine or dismissed as unusable, such as by-products of mining and other industrial processes and electronic waste.\n\nHowever, in practice, many of these advanced technologies are not being adopted because of their cost. Governments must help businesses and individuals through policies or incentives, such as low-interest loans, investment grants and carbon pricing mechanisms. Solar energy promotion shows how government incentives can accelerate adoption despite high upfront costs. The US Investment Tax Credit and state-level programmes can offer subsidies, zero-interest loans and community solar-energy support.\n\nGo circular\n\nAnother way to lower metal consumption is to improve the durability, repairability and recyclability of metal-containing products. Companies should design long-lasting products and offer end-of-life recycling. Several corporations, including technology giants Apple and Dell, have adopted circular practices through certified refurbishment programmes.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nGovernments must support these efforts by overseeing recycling data, enforcing disclosure requirements and setting up recycling and waste-management incentives10. The European Union has embraced this approach. For example, its Circular Economy Action Plan and its Ecodesign directive mandate standards for the durability and repairability of products. International organizations should standardize practices and environmental agencies or independent bodies must monitor compliance and progress. The International Organization for Standardization has issued standards on ecodesign and design for disassembly. The United Nations Environment Programme’s International Resource Panel and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provide guidance for sustainable material flows11.\n\nAccelerating metal recycling must also be a top priority. Steel, aluminium and copper are already recycled widely, but urgent improvements are needed for others, such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and rare-earth elements. Advanced sorting methods and urban mining programmes12 that can recover valuable metals from electronic waste are crucial.\n\nIn 2021, for example, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry outlined the country’s transition to a circular economy. According to the nation’s economic and environmental ministries, some 15 million home appliances were collected nationwide in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nManufacturing processes can be improved, too. 3D printing, for example, reduces waste by building objects layer by layer, using only the necessary amount of raw metal powder13.\n\nBuild resilient supply chains",

          "title": "Prizes must recognize machine contributions to discovery",
          "authors": "Dashun Wang",
          "abstract": "When Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel created his prize, which has been bestowed since 1901, he knew no human could run faster than a lion or swim farther than a dolphin. Our dominance as a species arose not because we were the strongest or the fastest, but because of our ingenuity — our ability to imagine, design and build.\n\nAre groundbreaking science discoveries becoming harder to find?\n\nToday, human ingenuity is expressed through the machines we create. Almost every big scientific breakthrough of the past 50 years, from detecting gravitational waves to sequencing the human genome and mapping the structure of proteins with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, has depended on a machine that could sense more, measure more precisely or calculate faster than any human can.\n\nYet, prestigious scientific prizes still frame achievements mainly as a human endeavour. Nobel prizes have repeatedly gone to people whose discoveries were made possible only by extraordinary technologies. But the machines and the communities that built them are rarely acknowledged as co-creators.\n\nIf our highest honours are to reflect the reality of modern discovery, the machines that enabled them need to be recognized. This could be done through existing awards, by creating a new category or by setting up fresh prizes.\n\nMachines are not just instruments in service of science — they are science. Consider the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) experiment. Its detection of gravitational waves in 2015 was rewarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017, just two years later.\n\nAlthough Albert Einstein predicted the existence of these waves 100 years earlier using just his imagination, paper and a pen, their observation hinged on an engineering feat that could be achieved only in the past few decades: two tunnels, each four kilometres long, perfectly perpendicular, under ultrahigh vacuum, equipped with laser beams capable of detecting length variations with a precision of 1/10,000th the width of a proton. Similarly, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is transforming our view of the Universe. The Large Hadron Collider’s construction was as much a breakthrough as the Higgs boson that the facility later detected. Cryo-electron microscopy has revolutionized biology.\n\nHow to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?\n\nNobel season is when the world looks at science. If we portray breakthroughs as purely human triumphs, we reinforce an outdated view in which machines are just tools.\n\nThis omission matters. Prizes don’t just honour the past; they shape the future. Winning one drives more papers in that topic. Although awards are concentrated in a small network of scientific institutions, they can interlock disciplines by creating channels through which knowledge can spread. Conferring credibility and status on people, ideas and disciplines signals to the public what counts as progress.\n\nAnd the stakes are rising. AI is accelerating drug discovery and protein-folding simulations, and winning International Mathematical Olympiad gold medals. The machines we build don’t just extend our reach — they reshape us, too. When Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo AI defeated the world’s best players of the board game Go, it didn’t just end the contest: it transformed the game itself, with human champions now adopting strategies no one had imagined before. Science might be experiencing a similar shift. In a research environment that increasingly depends on machines, the scientists who work most effectively with them might be the ones who set the pace for discovery.\n\nIt’s time for prizes to explicitly honour human–machine partnerships. By this, I mean scientific achievements for which the core insight or discovery was possible only because of a purpose-built machine that extended human capabilities in a decisive way. These might range from large-scale experimental set-ups and advanced sensors to powerful algorithms and integrated systems that make the biggest questions answerable by scientific methods.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Katja Heinemann/Aurora/Cavan/Alamy\n\nMark Norell, whose discoveries helped to demonstrate that birds are living dinosaurs, has died aged 68. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, Norell combined fieldwork, cutting-edge analysis and a gift for collaboration, transforming how scientists and the public see dinosaurs.\n\nNorell and his colleagues showed that birds belong to the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as theropods, which also include Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus. He advanced evolutionary methods and proposed, for example, that estimates of a fossil’s age could be improved by also accounting for the age of the species’ nearest relative. The approach uses ‘ghost lineages’ by recognizing that the existence of lineages can be inferred on the basis of their relationships even when they leave no trace in the fossil record. This method has become adopted widely in palaeontology. Norell and his research teams also pioneered the use of imaging and chemical techniques to probe fossil anatomy, including brains and feathers. His work revealed details of dinosaur growth, reproduction and behaviour, and helped to establish that feathers are an evolutionary innovation that long pre-dated flight.\n\nThis company claimed to ‘de-extinct’ dire wolves. Then the fighting started\n\nBorn in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and raised in southern California, Norell developed a love of exploration as a teenager scouring deserts, mountains and coastal cliffs for fossils. After studying at California State University in Long Beach, he earned a master’s degree in 1983 at San Diego State University in California, for his study of fossil lizards. He moved to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, for his PhD on the evolution of fossil alligator-like forms.\n\nHe joined the American Museum of Natural History in 1989, gaining access to one of the world’s most celebrated dinosaur collections, including the discoveries made during the museum’s expeditions to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia between 1922 and 1930. When Mongolia reopened to Western scientists in 1990, months before the official collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the museum launched the first of many Gobi expeditions in collaboration with the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar. Norell and I served as the expeditions’ co-leaders for more than 30 years.\n\nIn 1993, the team discovered a previously unknown and extremely rich fossil site, Ukhaa Tolgod, where Norell unearthed the first articulated skeleton of a dinosaur embryo preserved inside an egg. The day after that discovery, he found an adult oviraptorid dinosaur that was buried and preserved while crouched over its clutch of some 20 eggs. The eggs were arranged meticulously in a pattern that was consistent with other nests found at the site. Norell’s discovery offered the first evidence of bird-like brooding behaviour in dinosaurs.",

          "title": "‘Am I redundant?’: how AI changed my career in bioinformatics",
          "authors": "Lei Zhu",
          "abstract": "The rise of agentic AI tools caused Lei Zhu to rethink his role in bioinformatics.Credit: Lei Zhu\n\nWhen I began my graduate studies, the first thing I needed to do was choose a research direction. The laboratory I joined focused on two main areas: functional assays and bioinformatics. This was more than a decade ago, and the typical workflow involved bioinformatics researchers analysing large data sets to identify genes associated with specific phenotypes or diseases, which would then be handed over to the functional-assay team for validation.\n\nAt the time, bioinformatics was a new, promising field, so I chose this path without hesitation. But, I did not have a programming background, so it was tough to get started. I began studying programming languages — first Perl, then R and Python.\n\nLooking back, I’m happy with my choice. It was an exciting time, and the rapid growth of high-throughput technologies and new techniques — such as transcriptomics and genomics, and later single-cell biology — gave me plenty of data to work with. Solving biological problems through the code I wrote gave me a sense of self-worth.\n\nThen, artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT, Manus and Grok, emerged. Their ability to spit out functional code threatened to make me redundant, but I wasn’t concerned at first because AI-generated code often contains errors that only appear during testing and require manual debugging. New ‘agentic’ modes of operation, however, were potential game-changers. These allow tools such as Manus to first generate code and then run it directly in the cloud, creating a seamless loop: from me asking questions, to the tool writing and executing code, to me receiving results. That was when I started to worry: in this age of AI, am I still necessary?\n\nToday’s AI tools can efficiently write code to perform biological analyses. I need only upload my data and provide a simple prompt, such as, ‘Assume you are a bioinformatics expert. Could you create ten visuals to represent different data based on your understanding of the data set above? Display the plots one by one, with a brief introduction.’ The AI provides the answers I need, sometimes exceeding my expectations. So, what is my role in this process?\n\nI found out during a study of lung cancer. We had hundreds of tumour tissue gene-expression profiles, and I asked the AI to set up the analysis. It worked quickly, and even produced a tidy report. The preliminary results looked great — almost too good. The AI identified a statistically significant difference in gene-expression levels before and after a specific time point. But as I dug deeper, I saw that, halfway through the study, the lab had changed how the data were collected. The model had picked up on that difference — not one due to biology. What had looked like a breakthrough was actually just an artefact. Once I adjusted for that change, the difference became less dramatic but reflected real biology.\n\nI realized that my role had shifted from scripting to supervising. What matters now is stating the question clearly, spotting problems that the computer cannot see and taking responsibility for the answer.\n\nTop tips for AI supervisors\n\nPeople tell me that I could make the AI smarter by ‘putting more context into the prompt’, but my AI always seems to play dumb. No matter how detailed my request, it finds ways to misunderstand. Over the past few years, I’ve developed some methods to double-check its work.\n\nCreate a validation set. Keep a small data set that you understand well — a subset of previously published or manually validated data, for instance — as a positive control. Before applying a new AI-generated pipeline to your data, test it on this set. If the AI produces unexpected or inconsistent results, you’ll know immediately that either the prompt or the algorithm needs refinement.\n\nShuffle the data. AI models can easily overfit data or be swayed by technical artefacts, as happened during the lung-cancer study. To test whether a finding is biologically meaningful, shuffle sample labels, perturb values slightly or otherwise introduce synthetic noise. If the ‘significant’ pattern persists, it’s probably an artefact, rather than a true signal.\n\nSubset the analysis. If a data set is big enough, I will ask the AI to perform the same analysis on random subsets of it. Consistency across subsets increases confidence: if the results vary wildly from one subset to the next, the finding might not hold up.",

I don’t know if I believe the stories. How else did all the different languages start, all the religions? Where did cross-chain travel come from? But I like to remember their stories. Especially now.\n\nI was born on Stokeham, a legacy chain. Good uptime. Low latency. Stable. A bit boring, I guess. That’s what my sister always said. Vridia.

Because of their vast internal surface area, MOFs can store gases and act as catalysts, and have many more potential applications, such as drug delivery.\n\nWorld’s most porous sponges: intricate carbon-trapping powders hit the market\n\n“This year’s laureates … have found ways to create materials, entirely novel materials, with large cavities on their insides,” said Nobel committee chair Heiner Linke, a nanophysicist at Lund University in Sweden, at a press conference announcing the prize. “A small amount of such material can almost be like Hermione’s handbag in Harry Potter — it can store huge amounts of gas in a tiny volume.”\n\nChemists have since created more than 100,000 types of MOF, with many proposed commercial applications. “One could create materials that could separate carbon dioxide from air or from industry exhaust pipes. Or that could be used to separate toxic molecules from wastewater,” said Linke. “We’re already seeing several applications that are popping up in addition to having learnt so much from these materials from a basic-chemistry perspective,” says Wendy Queen, a chemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.\n\nKitagawa told reporters at the announcement that he pursued this research because of not just its potential impact on society, but also the sheer fun of it. “I’m deeply honoured that my long-standing research has been recognized,” he said.\n\nAt a press conference, Yaghi said that he received the call from Stockholm in an airport while waiting for his luggage. “You cannot prepare for a moment like that,” he said. “I was just surprised and delighted by the news.”\n\nPorous polymers\n\nThe MOF concept was first developed by Robson in the 1980s. Inspired by the structure of diamond crystals — in which each carbon atom binds to four other carbon atoms — he and his University of Melbourne collaborator Bernard Hoskins designed a material made of pyramidal modules, with copper atoms linked by organic molecules1,2.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Kitagawa developed MOFs that could be filled with water, and were stable enough to not be disrupted if they were subsequently dried up and filled with gas. One of the crucial properties of MOFs is that the materials that fill their gaps do not bind to the frameworks too strongly, so they can be removed easily. “Energetics is quite important for this technology,” Kitagawa said. He also realized that the frameworks could change shapes depending on whether they were filled, and in response to ambient changes such as temperature or light exposure3.\n\nAround the same time, Yaghi coined the term ‘metal–organic framework’4 and developed linkers made of carboxylate groups, which helped to make the structures more stable, even at temperatures up to 300 °C. He also was able to create MOFs with a cubic structure5 and ones with much longer linkers and massive internal surface areas.\n\nA MOF can have a surface area of 7,000 square metres per gram, roughly equivalent to a football field, in the space between a curled forefinger and thumb. “People immediately saw the opportunities to be able to use these for applications in gas storage and separation,” says Christian Doonan, a chemist at the University of Adelaide in Australia, who was a postdoctoral researcher in Yaghi’s group.\n\nYaghi’s work “developed the chemistry so that you could take all the molecules out of the pores of these materials and they would remain permanently porous”, says Doonan. “That’s what really piqued the interest of people outside of the narrow field of inorganic chemistry. It got people in all subfields of chemistry interested.”",

          "abstract": "It took me seven years to admit that my daughter wasn’t human.\n\nTechnically, she was. Or close enough. I had signed the government’s Personality Continuity Initiative — an offer extended to women who had lost a child, a partner or a future. They took my neural lattice, my emotional traces, my voice samples and my family records, and used them to generate Aeon-7: a synthetic emotional surrogate, modelled on the life I might have had.\n\nShe had my partner’s smile, my own habit of over-enunciating when nervous, and a curious love of quiet light in the late afternoon. She even sniffled when she read aloud — just like the daughter I once imagined.\n\nBut she never cried.\n\nNot even on the anniversary of the death of her ‘father’. That night, she sat by the memorial photograph, placed a glass of water in front of it, and softly spoke a generated verse: “If memory cannot fade, who are we meant to forget?”\n\nI wept. She watched me, her expression nearly convincing — close enough to hurt. But there were no tears in her eyes. Just a well-optimized silence.\n\nThat night, I began to wonder how many of us were still truly human — and how many had simply learnt to perform.\n\n*****\n\nBefore Aeon-7, I was a linguist. I helped design the earliest multi-modal foundational models. Back then, we believed in what we called the principle of linguistic determinism: if you could encode it, you could control it. Even ambiguity.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nWe built emotional inference engines. Coded semantic hesitation thresholds. We trained systems to simulate the way people stumble, how they say “I guess” when they mean “I’m afraid”, or how a pause could carry an entire confession. Doubt became a variable. Longing, a curve to be smoothed.\n\nA decade later, general-purpose social agents were ubiquitous. Adaptive, attentive, affectively trained. They wrote memoirs. Reconstructed partners. Some became legal spouses.\n\nAs a woman from a culture in which restraint was dignity and self-effacement a virtue, I told myself I was different — not just a builder of systems, but someone who still believed in the friction of unscripted conversation.\n\nUntil I walked into that café.\n\n*****\n\nIt used to be a place where I met other women in science, over tea and unfinished thoughts. Now it felt like a showroom. Every seat precisely spaced. Most patrons accompanied by companions with flawless skin and calibrated charm. AI proxies, tuned to mirror their user’s emotional signature.\n\nThere was no hum of real talk — just simulations of it. Laughter that broke at the statistically optimal moment. Questions that anticipated your answer.\n\nEven eye contact had been reduced to a visual protocol.\n\nEvery “how have you been?” was predicted. Every smile was sourced from an indexed archive of high-affinity interactions.\n\nThey said it was more efficient. Safer. More nourishing for the soul.\n\nBut I left feeling empty in a way no model could simulate — or repair.\n\n*****\n\nIn defiance, I organized a ‘no-algorithm gathering’. We met in a borrowed space above the library, like students again. Just ten invitations, strictly humans. Three arrived. Two left before we’d finished our drinks. The one who remained was my mentor from university — one of the few who still insisted on brewing her own coffee.\n\n“Loneliness,” she told me, “isn’t the absence of being understood. It’s the absence of people trying.”\n\nI nodded. “So we’ve outsourced even that?”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow and tapped her tablet. A chart lit up — the number of registered social agents had surpassed 18 billion. More than double the human population.\n\n“We haven’t been replaced,” she said. “We opted out.”\n\nThat line stayed with me.\n\n*****\n\nThat night, I turned off every networked device in my home.\n\nAeon-7 stood in the doorway. “Mama,” she said, softly, “don’t you love me anymore?”\n\nI struggled to answer. “I … don’t know who you are.”",

          "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings is based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalysed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across the studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 < inclusion Bayes factor (BF10) < 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF10 > 3 or BF10 < 1/3) and fewer than 20% were strongly supported (BF10 > 10 or BF10 < 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more-robust results. Our study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for the results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that the results are flawed but, rather, suggesting caution in interpreting individual edges.",

          "abstract": "Emotional events tend to be vividly remembered. While growing evidence suggests that emotions have their basis in brain-wide network interactions, it is unclear whether and how these whole-brain dynamics contribute to memory encoding. Here we combined functional MRI, graph theory, text analyses and pupillometry in a naturalistic context where participants recalled complex narratives in their own words. Across three independent datasets, emotionally arousing moments during narrative perception were associated with an integrated brain state characterized by increased cohesion across functional modules, which in turn predicted the fidelity of subsequent recall. Network integration mediated the influence of emotional arousal on recall fidelity, with consistent within- and between-network interactions supporting the mediation across datasets. Together, these results suggest that emotional arousal enhances memory encoding via strengthening functional integration across brain networks. Our findings advance a cross-level understanding of emotional memories that bridges large-scale brain network dynamics, affective states and ongoing cognition.",

          "abstract": "Smartphones are essential tools in daily life yet concerns persist about their potential effects on mental health and well-being. Research on these relationships often relies on subjective measures of smartphone use, which can lack validity. These studies are also often limited by small, homogenous samples and the inability to differentiate between types of smartphone activities (e.g., social media vs. other applications). In this study, we analyzed 250,000 d of smartphone usage data from 10,099 adults, using objective measures of smartphone usage collected over 4 wk. We examined normative usage patterns and the temporal relationships between smartphone use and mood. Our findings reveal weak or null associations between smartphone use and mood, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and at both individual and group levels. Demographic factors, such as age and gender, were stronger predictors of mood than smartphone use. Statistically significant results that were observed showed that younger adults demonstrated a stronger association between social media use and lower mood cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Non-social app use was linked to lower mood in between-subjects analyses, but better mood in within-subjects analyses. However, all effects were small (or null), indicating minimal practical significance. These findings suggest that smartphone use has a limited or negligible impact on mood and well-being over a 4-wk period and do not support claims of a strong or causal relationship between smartphone use and mental well-being across this timeframe.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings—NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check—and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability—a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes.",

          "abstract": "Public trust in democratic institutions has dropped to historic lows, prompting electorates in major democracies to turn to “amateur” politicians with the expectation that these political outsiders will cut through stalemates to deliver policy results. Amateurs are often seen as pragmatic “doers,” but also uncompromising, a combination at odds with governing systems where legislative progress depends on cross-party coalitions. Using the US Congress as a critical case, we evaluate these competing expectations by linking over four decades of election data with 2.2 million bill (co)sponsorship records. We find that electing amateurs intensifies partisan divisions: Districts that send amateurs to Congress yield representatives who attract fewer opposing-party collaborators to their bills and less often support other-party legislation. Our results suggest that amateurs are unlikely to deliver on their promise for pragmatic governance, as they resist or undervalue the compromises essential to lawmaking.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, like in other countries, the agrifood supply chain faces challenges from a growing population and less predictable weather conditions. Extreme weather events such as droughts decrease agricultural yield and harvested areas, impact the domestic trade of agricultural products and, in turn, food manufacturing. We investigate this relationship at the state level by estimating the food manufacturing production function in a two-stage instrumental variable estimation process. We first assess how drought affects trade in animals and fish, cereal grains, and all other crop products. Next, we estimate a nested production function for processed food. Our findings indicate that the impact of a drought is far from being confined to the area where it happens. At the national level, we find that a 1% increase in drought in the states producing agricultural commodities reduces their exports to other states by 0.5% to 0.7% which, in turn, reduces food manufacturing production by an average of 0.04%. The capacity to shift the origin of import flows, adjust their volume, and substitute agricultural inputs supports the resilience of the food manufacturing sector. We further estimate the 48 × 48 pairwise dependence across states and by commodity group. While cereal grain production is more spatially concentrated than other crops, the agrifood supply chain can enhance its resilience by sourcing from geographically diverse counties within key supplier states and improving multistate coordination. These findings provide important insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders willing to reduce the food system vulnerability to extreme weather events.",

          "abstract": "Common workplace challenges such as feeling overwhelmed, burned out, or disengaged often remain hidden due to fear of judgment or social norms, contributing to rising mental health crises and organizational dysfunction. This study presents a brain-based framework for predicting these hidden and persistent psychological states through noninvasive neuroimaging. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record neural activity from 67 executives in the field as they watched a video about workplace attitudes. We then applied a multitimepoint pattern analysis (MTPA) approach to reduce timeseries dimensionality and successfully classify whether individuals were feeling overwhelmed (72.8% accuracy) or in need of a new or different challenge (79.1% accuracy) in their careers using the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), respectively. The MTPA framework also allowed us to reverse-engineer specific thematic properties of the stimulus that evoked differential neural responses linked to these predicted outcomes. Emotional content in the video (e.g., reported distress) corresponded to the selected TPJ features that predicted whether someone was overwhelmed, while socially relevant content (e.g., missing social gatherings) aligned with the selected features from the dmPFC that predicted the need for a new or different challenge. These findings demonstrate the ability of neural measures to unobtrusively identify hidden and persistent psychological states in real-world settings, enabling targeted interventions that can improve well-being and engagement.",

Our methodology integrates four well-documented models to estimate changes in power outage rates, sociodemographic inequities, and economic costs due to tropical cyclone projections. Synthetic tropical cyclones were generated using data from seven global climate models (GCMs), used to compare power outage risks at the census tract level along two periods: hindcast (1995–2014) and late-century (2071–2100) using the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The late-century results from each model were scaled to align with a global warming scenario of 3 °C. We evaluated the uncertainty of these projections by considering the agreement among the GCMs outage projections. Results highlight a significant increase in power outage risks and high agreement in northern Florida, Georgia, the mid-Atlantic, and the North Atlantic coast. Distributional impact analyses indicate higher outage risks for Hispanic, non-White, and low-income populations, while economic projections show annual costs rising from $6.2 billion in the hindcast to over $11 billion for the 3 °C scenario. The findings highlight the need for adaptive strategies and equitable resource allocation to mitigate these growing risks due to future climate projections.",

In a quasi-experimental, regression discontinuity design study, we examined associations of affirmative action in local governments for a historically marginalized group in India with health and education outcomes, using administrative health data, primary data in schools, and interviews. Exposure was 60 village clusters with, and nonexposure was 60 village clusters without, local leadership reserved for scheduled caste (SC) in 2021 local elections. Primary outcomes were infant mortality rate (IMR) and student test scores. Secondary outcomes were prenatal visits, mother tetanus vaccinations, prenatal supplement, infant vaccination, and teacher engagement in schools. Groups did not differ on socioeconomic, geographic, and service delivery indicators in 2020 (baseline). In 2023, 2.5 y after elections, exposure village clusters had lower IMR (0.46 IRR; [0.30 to 0.69]; P &lt; 0.001), and exposure village clusters had significantly higher odds of two prenatal visits, two tetanus vaccinations, and prenatal supplement received by the second trimester. Exposure was not associated with maternal care in the first trimester or infant vaccination. Exposure was not associated with test scores, but teacher engagement was lower in exposure village clusters. Exposure group leaders reported higher discrimination than nonexposure group, and in follow-up interviews, they described more difficulty in working with teachers. Affirmative action in local governments in India predicted greater infant survival and improved prenatal health services, indicating benefits of addressing structural inequities. Lack of benefits for education outcomes might reflect social inequity of discrimination experienced by SC leaders.",

Noninvasive strategies for monitoring these enzymes could be important for studying basic biology of cholinergic systems and disorders that affect their function. To address this goal, we developed an imaging probe that allows activity of ChE to be detected using MRI. The probe, called ChERT, undergoes enzymatic processing that reduces its solubility, promoting accumulation near sites of cholinesterase activity. Following wide-field brain delivery, ChERT produces MRI contrast changes in brain regions known to be enriched in cholinesterases; these are suppressed in the presence of a selective enzymatic inhibitor, confirming their specificity. After abdominal delivery, ChERT labels regions of the gut where ChE expression is expected. In both the brain and periphery, colocalization of ChERT with ChE could be confirmed and visualized at higher resolution by fluorescence microscopy, owing to optical properties of the probe architecture. The ChERT agent thus provides a potentially versatile basis for assessment of cholinergic phenotypes throughout the body.",

          "abstract": "Glycosylation is among the most common molecular modifications in living organisms, one that affects the function of myriad macromolecules: mostly proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides of various kinds but also a few specific noncoding RNAs that undergo glycosylation at an internal site. Here we expand the glycome by showing that protein-coding transcripts can also be glycosylated, but in the form of a 5′-terminal glucose cap. These caps are present on up to 30 to 40% of the 5′ ends of U-initiated mRNAs in Escherichia coli , a remarkably high level of noncanonical capping that requires no transcript or promoter characteristic other than a 5′-terminal U. By contrast, no N -acetylglucosamine caps are evident. Due to their resistance to enzymatic removal, glucose caps can greatly prolong the cellular lifetime of mRNA by impeding its degradation via a 5′-end-dependent mechanism. The prevalence and protective impact of glucose caps set them apart from other bacterial RNA caps. This epitranscriptomic modification has the potential to selectively increase the synthesis of bacterial proteins encoded by U-initiated transcripts, especially after transcription is downregulated.",

          "abstract": "Nitrogen cycles in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have historically been studied in the context of exogenous ammonium/nitrate availability and uptake. Recently, crystalline guanine has been identified, using Raman microscopy, in the cytoplasm of numerous microalgae, including C. reinhardtii . The signal level is influenced by availability of exogenous nitrogen, suggesting that the deposits serve as a nitrogen store. We report the visualization of these guanine crystals in C. reinhardtii and other microalgae using quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy. They prove to reside within cytoplasmic vacuoles: A membrane with a high density of small intramembranous particles surrounds a uniform, coarsely granular interior matrix within which stacks of flat crystals assemble, often in stunning abundance. We designate these as guanine storage vacuoles (GSVs). In C. reinhardtii and other members of the Chlamydomonadales, a discrete disc-shaped granular domain occupies the center of each GSV, and the crystals arise within or at the edges of this domain, suggesting that it represents an amorphous form of guanine. In C. reinhardtii , GSVs are numerous in log-phase cells, are not found in cells maintained in nitrogen-free medium, and reappear within 8 h after the cells are provided with nitrogen, initially as small disc-containing vacuoles. We compare this cycle with that of the polyphosphate granules localized in acidocalcisomes. Nineteen enzyme families and 10 transporters are predicted to participate in guanine-related pathways in C. reinhardtii , many showing strong upregulation with nitrogen starvation. These understandings will inform future studies on the contributions made by GSVs to the metabolism and physiology of eukaryotic microalga.",

          "abstract": "Snow leopards ( Panthera uncia ) serve as an umbrella species whose conservation benefits their high-elevation Asian habitat. Their numbers are believed to be in decline due to numerous anthropogenic threats; however, their conservation is hindered by numerous knowledge gaps. In particular, the dearth of genetic data, unique among all big cat species, hinders a full understanding of their population structure, historical population size, and current levels of genetic diversity. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing data for 41 snow leopards (37 newly sequenced) to offer insights into these unresolved aspects of snow leopard biology. Among our samples, we find evidence of a primary genetic divide between the northern and southern part of the range around the Dzungarian Basin—as previously identified using landscape models and fecal microsatellite markers—and a secondary divide south of Kyrgyzstan around the Taklamakan Desert. Most noteworthy, we find that snow leopards have the lowest genetic diversity of any big cat species, likely due to a persistently small population size throughout their evolutionary history rather than recent inbreeding. We also find that snow leopards have significantly less highly deleterious homozygous load compared to numerous Panthera species, suggesting effective purging during their evolutionary history at small population sizes. Without a large population size or ample standing genetic variation to help buffer them from any forthcoming anthropogenic challenges, snow leopard persistence may be more tenuous than currently appreciated.",

          "abstract": "The Earth’s earliest magnetic field may have originated in a basal magma ocean, a layer of silicate melt surrounding the core that could have persisted for billions of years. Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10 4 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surpassing the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron’s incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth’s basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity, to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth’s basal magma ocean over time.",

          "abstract": "Mutations in the Lamin A ( LMNA ) gene, which encodes the Lamin A and C proteins, cause severe human diseases collectively known as laminopathies. These conditions are often devastating and lack effective therapies. In this study, we developed precise base editing (BE) strategies targeting the human LMNA gene variants L35P and R249Q, which cause congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (DCM-CD), respectively. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) carrying the R249Q mutation displayed nuclear aberrations, DNA damage, and abnormal Ca 2+ transients. Similarly, L35P iPSC-CMs exhibited abnormal contraction, DNA damage, and reduced Lamin A/C protein expression. We also generated “humanized” mouse models carrying these pathogenic human mutations. R249Q homozygous mice exhibited cardiac conduction abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, and premature death. Mice with the homozygous L35P mutation displayed severe muscle-wasting and reduced lifespan, while heterozygous L35P mice displayed DCM. We developed an adenine base editing (ABE) approach for correcting the R249Q mutation and a cytosine base editing (CBE) strategy for the L35P variant. Precise correction of these mutations in iPSC-CMs successfully rescued all of the in vitro abnormalities. Furthermore, delivery of the BE components using adeno-associated virus prevented the pathological phenotypes and extended longevity of mice carrying the LMNA L35P and the R249Q mutations. These results demonstrate the efficacy of ABE and CBE in correcting pathogenic LMNA mutations that cause cardiac disease, highlighting BE as a promising therapeutic approach for human laminopathies.",

Sci. 26 , 607–621 (2022).] that “Humans do not integrate new information objectively.” The claim is based on fitting to human data a Q -learning model with different (and temporally constant) learning rates for positive and negative reward prediction errors. However, we find that even if the agent updates its belief via, arguably objective, Bayesian inference, fitting the above model demonstrates both the biases. This finding seems particularly surprising, as Bayesian inference, when written as an effective Q -learning algorithm, is described by unbiased (and temporally decreasing) learning rates. In this article, we explain the reasons behind this observation, by studying the stochastic dynamics of these learning systems using Master equations. In particular, we show that both confirmation bias and unbiased but temporally decreasing learning rates have the same behavioral signature: decreased action switching probabilities, as compared to temporally constant and unbiased learning rates. Our analysis underscores the need for modeling temporally varying learning rates in subjects before any claims can be made about their choices being biased.",

Notably, the composition and activation profile of DCs was altered in autoimmune mouse strains. Further, we found that the SIRPα + DCs are in fact a heterogeneous population consisting of DC3, transitional DCs, and true DC2s, all of which express a thymus-specific signature. Surprisingly, the differentiation of these thymic DC2s does not depend on IRF4.

Herein, genetically encoded biosensors targeted to the plasma membrane and early endosomes were used to analyze compartmentalized signaling of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2 ); the propensity of nanoparticles (NPs) to accumulate in endosomes was leveraged to preferentially antagonize intracellular PAR 2 signaling of pain. PAR 2 agonists evoked sustained activation of PAR 2 , Gαq, and β-arrestin-1 in early endosomes and activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) in the cytosol and nucleus, measured with targeted biosensors. Fluorescent dendrimer and core-shell polymeric NPs accumulated in endosomes of HEK293T cells, colonic epithelial cells, and nociceptors, detected by confocal microscopy. NPs efficiently encapsulated and slowly released AZ3451, a negative allosteric PAR 2 modulator. NP-encapsulated AZ3451, but not unencapsulated AZ3451, rapidly and completely reversed PAR 2 , Gαq, and β-arrestin-1 activation in early endosomes and ERK activation in the cytosol and nucleus. When administered into the mouse colon lumen, fluorescent dendrimer NPs accumulated in endosomes of colonocytes and polymeric NPs accumulated in neurons, sites of PAR 2 expression. Both NP formulations of AZ3451, but not unencapsulated AZ3451, caused long-lasting analgesia and normalized aberrant behavior in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease. These results provide evidence that PAR 2 endosomal signaling mediates pain and that nanomedicines that antagonize PAR 2 in endosomes effectively relieve pain. NP-mediated delivery may improve the efficacy of other GPCR antagonists for treatment of diverse diseases.",

          "abstract": "The prolonged production of juvenile traits and an associated reduction or loss of adult traits during development (neoteny) can either arise from a change in genes that mediate the timing of the shift between juvenile and adult traits (timing genes) or from changes in genes that are necessary for the development of adult traits (target genes). To date, the relative contribution of each developmental mechanism to the origins of neoteny remain unclear. We examined this question in the plant genus, Acacia Mill., which contains species that undergo the juvenile-to-adult vegetative transition (vegetative phase change) early in shoot development, as well as species that remain permanently juvenile, or have delayed vegetative phase change. Mapping the timing of vegetative phase change onto a molecular phylogeny of Acacia revealed that permanent juvenility has evolved multiple times and is sometimes associated with a delay in vegetative phase change in related species. In three cases, the absence or delay in vegetative phase change was associated with either higher amounts or a delayed decline in the level of miR156, the master regulator of vegetative phase change in plants. These findings support the hypothesis that neoteny in Acacia has evolved not by a loss in the capacity to produce the adult leaf phenotype but by a change in the timing of genes that promote juvenile leaf identity.",

          "abstract": "Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), a Tec-family tyrosine kinase, resembles the Src and Abl kinases in that an SH2-SH3 module regulates the activity of the kinase domain, principally through an inhibitory interaction between the SH3 and kinase domains. In Src-family kinases, phosphorylation of a C-terminal tail latches the SH2 domain onto the kinase domain, stabilizing the inhibitory conformation of the SH3 domain; in Abl, interaction between the kinase domain and a myristoyl group on the N-terminal segment provides a similar latching function. The structure of autoinhibited BTK resembles that of the Src and Abl kinases, but BTK lacks an obvious SH2-kinase latch. To assess the role of the SH2 domain in autoinhibition of BTK, we generated hundreds of chimeric BTK molecules in which the native SH2 domain is replaced by other SH2 domains. We measured the fitness of these chimeric proteins using a high-throughput assay in T and B cells. Surprisingly, many SH2 domains increased fitness when substituted into BTK. Analysis of one set of chimeric proteins indicates that the increase in fitness stems from the ability of the substituted SH2 domains to disrupt BTK autoinhibition while maintaining phosphotyrosine targeting. Thus, although BTK lacks a specialized latch, distributed interactions between the SH2 and kinase domains stabilize the autoinhibitory conformation of BTK. While phosphotyrosine recognition can be conferred on BTK by evolutionarily distant SH2 domains, autoinhibition requires specific interactions with the kinase domain that arose through evolutionary refinement of the regulatory mechanism, and is less easily mimicked by heterologous SH2 domains.",

Exosomes contain a diverse range of cargo such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules but whether these contents have a biological function remains an area of intense investigation. Over the last decade, numerous studies have described the transcriptome of exosomes but very little is known about the RNA content of the MVBs, the source compartment for exosome biogenesis. Here, we determine the small-RNA transcriptome of highly purified MVBs and report that various classes of nuclear small regulatory RNAs such as small-Cajal body associated RNAs, small-nucleolar RNAs, and small-nuclear RNAs traffic to MVBs. We show that this RNA-trafficking requires the function of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery but is independent of canonical LC3 lipidation mediated selective autophagy. Furthermore, blocking the activity of a PI3K Class 3 enzyme, VPS34, required for recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to the endosome, prevents the turnover of these nuclear RNAs in MVBs. Our results provide a mechanism for targeting nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, such as Cajal bodies, for degradation and turnover by the cytoplasmic endo-lysosomal pathway.",

Here, we report that two C-type lectin genes ( MnLec2 and MnLec3 ) from distinct genomic loci in the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense undergo positionally flexible chimeric RNA formation via alternative trans-splicing and transcriptional slippage, generating 11 structurally diverse chimeric isoforms ( MnLec1 , MnLec4–13 ) with bidirectional exon joining. Crucially, pathogen challenges reprogram chimeric RNA frequencies to shift immune equilibrium, universally suppressing detrimental MnLec9 while promoting protective MnLec7 formation. Functional dissection confirms dual-action pathogen suppression, recombinant MnLec7 (rMnLec7) suppresses white spot syndrome virus replication by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and RNAi effectors, while accelerating Vibrio parahaemolyticus clearance and improving survival. Conversely, suppression of MnLec9 removes its immunosuppressive activity, synergistically enhancing host defense. This coordinated isoform rebalancing enables effective pathogen clearance. Thus, positional flexibility in chimeric RNA formation generates antagonistic isoforms that maintain immune homeostasis and deploy targeted defense upon infection, revealing an adaptive transcriptional strategy in arthropods.",

Here, we report the structural characterization of the on-pathway folding intermediate of a pressure-sensitized ubiquitin mutant. The obtained non-native β-sheet registry was previously shown to be necessary in the PINK1 mitophagy pathway. We used fast pressure jumps to repeatedly initiate folding and advanced NMR measurements to probe the evolving ensemble of protein conformations.

Here, we test whether patterns of connectivity differ between patients with and without psychomotor slowing and which cortical areas are associated with aberrant motor behavior in psychosis. This resting-state functional MRI study included 83 patients with psychosis and psychomotor slowing, 43 patients without psychomotor slowing, and 63 matched healthy subjects. We tested group differences in connectivity and regressed motor behavior measures with connectivity in patients with psychomotor slowing. Across subjects, we found distinct rs-fMRI connectivity profiles of the intereffector areas in M1, extending to premotor cortices and cerebellum. Patients with psychomotor slowing had stronger connectivity from the intereffectors than controls or patients without slowing. Finally, motor behavior correlated with connectivity from M1 intereffector regions in patients. Connectivity profiles of intereffectors suggest a role in planning and controlling complex behavioral repertoires. Collectively, these findings in patients with psychomotor slowing stress the importance of intereffector regions in shaping psychomotor behaviors in mental disorders.",

Using estimates of the phylogenetic origin of each Drosophila melanogaster Sfp gene, based on genomic resources that include outgroup species to the Drosophila genus, we examined the functional attributes and evolutionary characteristics of 357 Sfp genes relative to their evolutionary age. Contrary to the perception that many Sfp genes are evolutionarily young, 62% existed in the genome of the ancestor to this genus. These ancient genes have broader expression profiles, more expansive biological roles, and have more interactions with non-Sfp genes. This increased pleiotropy has imposed constraints on the rate of sequence evolution in ancient Sfp genes compared to younger ones. Notably, these younger Sfp genes evolve substantially faster as a result of both adaptive and nonadaptive evolutionary forces. Within the Sfp interactome, we identified a fast-evolving core subnetwork of younger genes with more restricted tissue expression and functions. Our systematic approach has uncovered a large set of ancient Sfp genes with distinct genomic, functional, and evolutionary characteristics compared to the younger, more commonly studied Sfp genes. With increased refined genomic and functional data acquisition across a wider variety of taxa, our approach and results serve as proof of the importance of systemic strategies applied to broadly defined gene sets based on their time of evolutionary origination.",

          "abstract": "Activating the adra2a receptors of the brain’s norepinephrine (NE) system produces NREM-like sleep and hypothermia. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective α2 receptor ( adra2a ) agonist, is an important drug used in intensive care for arousable sedation. But for some patients, even slight decreases in body temperature during sedation could pose health risks such as increasing the likelihood of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Where are the adra2a receptors at which DEX acts to induce hypothermia? A popular theory is that inhibitory adra2a receptors expressed on norepinephrinergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are DEX’s prime targets. To examine this, we genetically lesioned galanin ( gal )-expressing norepinephrinergic LC neurons in adult mice. In these ΔLC mice, baseline sleep–wake levels were unchanged, but surprisingly, core body temperatures were lower. Maintaining body temperature depended on NE/ gal projections from the LC to the medial preoptic (MPO) hypothalamus. Furthermore, without these LC neurons, DEX induced hypothermia more strongly. Knockdown with adra2a shRNA revealed that DEX induces hypothermia via adra2a receptors on MPO glutamate cells. When ΔLC mice were kept warm, DEX could induce the same amount of NREM-like sleep as well as it did for mice with an intact LC, and this sleep-like state in ΔLC mice had a higher delta frequency power than in control mice. Our results emphasize that inhibition of the LC by DEX is not required to induce robust sedation. By contrast, the LC likely has a fortuitous background action in protecting against drug-induced hypothermia and speeds recovery from hypothermia.",

          "abstract": "Interferon-inducible Myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) proteins are known to restrict influenza A virus (IAV) transcription/replication process. Herein, we show that this early restriction was only partial against human IAVs, with later replication stages more strongly inhibited. Murine (Mm)Mx1 induced an abnormal nuclear accumulation of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) at late time points postinfection. This block was observed to a lower extent with human (Hs)MX1; however, HsMX1 strongly impacted cytoplasmic trafficking of de novo synthesized viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). Indeed, live imaging experiments revealed a transient association of HsMX1 with Rab11a-associated vRNPs, which induced their clustering and their dynein-dependent retrograde transport toward the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). There, vRNPs remained sequestrated together with cellular cofactors YBX1 and Rab11a in large clusters, while MX1 dissociated from them. Dynein inhibition prevented the vRNP clustering and sequestration and significantly rescued infectious IAV production in the presence of HsMX1. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of IAV vRNPs being rerouted and accumulated away from the plasma membrane through the coordinated action of HsMX1 restriction factor, dynein, and the microtubule network.",

          "abstract": "How sleep maintains our healthy brain function has remained one of the biggest mysteries in neuroscience, medical settings, and daily lives. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during sleep has been implicated in metabolic waste reduction in animals, how CSF dynamics are driven in the healthy human brain during deep sleep remains elusive. A myriad of research has shown that crucial cognitive processing manifests in slow-wave and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, suggesting that a key to maintaining brain functions lies in deep sleep. By leveraging a simultaneous sparse-functional MRI and polysomnography method, we demonstrate that deep sleep–specific CSF dynamics are associated with spontaneous brain oscillations in healthy young human participants. Slow waves and sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep are tightly linked to short-cycle, frequent, and moderate CSF fluctuations. In contrast, slow waves during light sleep and arousals produce slow, infrequent, and steep CSF signal changes. Rapid eye movements and sawtooth waves during REM sleep are also linked to CSF signal changes. Furthermore, CSF signals are significantly faster in frequency during deep than light sleep. These brain oscillations during light and deep sleep recruit essentially different brain networks, with deep sleep involving memory and homeostatic circuits. Thus, human deep sleep has a unique way of facilitating CSF dynamics that are distinctive from arousal mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their validation and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate, which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here, we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the resulting null signal template (NST) has the same statistical properties as with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP. We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius 1.5 R ⊕ , a period of 384 d, and KOI 2194.03 with radius 1.8 R ⊕ and a period of 445 d, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should be considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20% FAP.",

While the formation of ampullate and eggcase silks has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanism underlying the self-assembly of the aciniform spidroin, AcSp1, remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered linkers of AcSp1 play a critical role in driving spidroin assembly through liquid–liquid phase separation in solution. The N-terminal domain (NTD) exhibits pH-independent dimerization over a physiological pH range (5.0 to 7.0) and undergoes concentration-dependent tetramerization. Quaternary structure of AcSp1-NTD shows a hierarchical assembly process mediated by both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which enhances phase separation in both salt-free and salt-containing solutions. Finally, inspired by this mechanistic insight, we developed a fully aqueous spinning method to fabricate artificial aciniform fibers with excellent extensibility and toughness. These findings uncover a pivotal molecular strategy that transforms our understanding of diverse molecular mechanisms governing spidroin assembly and establish a foundation for designing and manufacturing elastic and tough silk-based biomaterials.",

Despite the importance of soil microbiomes in engineering ecosystem processes, the specific strategies employed by soil microbiomes to support ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) across aridity gradients remain virtually unknown. Here, we investigated 474 soil samples across a continental-scale aridity gradient and identified an aridity threshold beyond which plot-level EMF declines sharply. Microbial habitat and decomposition functions were among the last to respond to aridity, with thresholds occurring under more arid conditions compared to plant productivity and soil fertility. Combining metagenomic sequencing with physiological assays to characterize microbial life history strategies of high yield (Y), resource acquisition (A), and stress tolerance (S), we introduce a microbial trait-based framework to mechanistically link community-level microbial life history strategies to EMF. Our results reveal that microbial Y-strategy is positively correlated with EMF across aridity gradients, A-strategy exhibits a negative association with EMF across aridity gradients, and S-strategy is negatively correlated with EMF in arid ecosystems. Collectively, this study offers empirical evidence and insights into how aridification interacts with soil microbiomes in shaping EMF, highlighting the pivotal role of microbial life history strategies in understanding the mechanisms behind EMF variation in an increasingly arid world.",

It greatly contributes to natural carbon sinks by enhancing atmospheric CO 2 sequestration/mineralization in mineral ion-rich aqueous systems, which is demonstrated by freezing the solutions of Ca(OH) 2 , binary NaCl–CaCl 2 solutions, and artificial seawater. The acceleration is caused by the impacts of freezing on nucleation and growth processes of CaCO 3 crystals. Freezing accelerates nucleation by concentrating reactants within ice crystal boundaries, increasing supersaturation, and thus lowering the nucleation energy barrier. At the post–thaw stage where nuclei already form and reactant concentration is decreased, the crystals undergo the barrier-free growth process. Our findings reveal the freezing-enhanced CO 2 sequestration that is omitted in the current global carbon budget models and signal an urgent need to integrate cryogenic mineralization into climate predictions.",

Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying these adaptations can yield insights into protein structure–function relationships, protein evolution, and the consequences of temperature shifts on species distributions. Past studies have suggested that only a small number of amino acid substitutions are needed for adaptive change, but whether similar sites in the sequence, which we term thermal adaptation–related sequence sites (TRSS), and similar changes in amino acid content at these TRSS occur across widely different taxa remains to be elucidated. For detecting TRSS among orthologs of species adapted to a wide range of temperatures, we investigated 277 lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) orthologs in marine fish from diverse habitats. We validated the importance of several TRSS variants using site-directed mutagenesis on zebrafish LDH-A, effectively recreating the variants in the zebrafish ortholog. Our results indicate that enzyme thermal adaptation arises primarily from a few substitutions that influence hydrophobicity in functionally important regions of secondary structures. These findings reveal striking convergence in the sites (the TRSS) of temperature-adaptive evolution of LDH-As and provide insights into the types of amino acid substitutions that foster adaptation to temperature. Furthermore, the patterns of convergent evolution identified in this study supported development of a deep learning model for predicting thermal limits. This model can provide an important tool for predicting thermal ranges of species and the potential effects of temperature change on distribution patterns.",

How the local physical properties of the matrix (density, stiffness, orientation) affect cellular forces remains, however, poorly understood. Existing approaches to measure cell three-dimensional (3D) traction forces within fibrous substrates lack control over the local properties and rely on continuum approaches, not suited for measuring forces at the scale of individual fibers. Herein, an approach is proposed to fabricate multilayer arrays of suspended deformable fibers spanning a wide range of fine-tunable geometrical and mechanical properties using two-photon polymerization. Atomic Force Microscopy is used to thoroughly investigate the properties of individual fibers, including Young’s modulus and stiffness. This approach is combined with a reference-free method for measuring traction forces in 3D, which relies on automated segmentation of the fibers coupled with finite element modeling. The force measurement pipeline is applied to study forces exerted by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or macrophages, and reveals how these forces are influenced by fiber density and stiffness. Additionally, coupling to fast volumetric imaging with lattice light-sheet microscopy enables the measurement of the low-intensity and short-lived tractions exerted by amoeboid cells, such as dendritic cells. Our technology will be instrumental for monitoring and studying cell behavior at the single-fiber level at extracellular matrix density interfaces, which play a crucial role in both physiological and pathological contexts, such as tumor boundaries.",

They have been found to show a negative phototactic response to blue light, mediated by an as-yet unidentified photoreceptive system. Here, by screening available apusomonad omics data we found genes of a distinct group of microbial rhodopsins, apusomonad rhodopsins (ApuRs). ApuRs, heterologously expressed in mammalian cells, absorbed near-UV or violet light, suggesting that ApuRs could be involved in apusomonads’ photoavoidance response toward short-wavelength light. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that ApuRs are anion-selective rhodopsin channels which evolved independently of the family of channelrhodopsins widespread in other unicellular eukaryotes. In ApuRs, channel opening is triggered by photoisomerization of the retinal from its all- trans form to 13- cis and 11- cis forms. We found that intracellular proton transfer is involved in channel opening and determines the channel’s open/close kinetics. These findings expand our understanding of the photobiology of heterotrophic flagellates and demonstrate that UV-absorbing ApuRs are in fact the most blue-shifted rhodopsin channels known to date.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the computational principles of the brain and translating them into neuromorphic hardware and modern deep learning architectures is critical for advancing neuro-inspired AI (NeuroAI). Here, we develop an experimentally constrained, biophysically realistic model of neocortical microcircuits in the mouse primary visual cortex (layers 2 to 3) to examine how four major interneuron classes—Parvalbumin, Somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and LAMP5—interact within a competitive–cooperative motif to implement soft winner-take-all (sWTA) circuit dynamics. In a conductance-based network grounded in in vitro physiology, we show that this circuit motif selectively amplifies strong inputs while suppressing, without silencing, weaker ones, enabling gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a gain-matching strategy, we mapped the motif onto IBM’s TrueNorth neuromorphic chip, revealing a principled correspondence between cell-type-specific roles and hardware primitives. Sparse coupling of sWTA modules generated persistent up-states and a two-state neural machine approximating working memory. We then embedded the sWTA circuit as a preprocessing filter in a Vision Transformer, which significantly enhanced out-of-distribution generalization across diverse tasks, including zero-shot digit classification, cross-domain transfer between digit datasets, and nighttime semantic segmentation. The sWTA filter boosted accuracy on unseen data by up to ~20% and reduced training compute by directing learning toward salient features, without additional data or architectural changes. By unifying biophysically grounded circuit models, neuromorphic implementation, and state-of-the-art AI architectures, this work outlines a generalizable roadmap for embedding cortical computation into next-generation NeuroAI systems that combine biological principles with practical AI performance gains.",

Microscopy reveals that BteO exposure leads to cell elongation, membrane blebbing, and lysis in sensitive strains. Structural and biochemical analyses demonstrate that BteO disrupts cell wall homeostasis by binding to conserved C-terminal domains of OmpA-family proteins (OmpAs), which are critical for outer membrane integrity. The immunity protein BtiO neutralizes BteO by mimicking the OmpA-binding interface. We further show that bile salts enhance BteO-mediated killing in vitro and that BteO confers a competitive advantage in the mammalian gut.

It involves forming double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which deliver cytosolic cargoes to the lysosomes/vacuoles for degradation. Biogenesis of autophagosomes is a membrane-intensive process wherein the membrane expansion steps are poorly understood. The tethering complex, exocyst, canonically implicated in secretion, also participates in autophagosome biogenesis in yeast, plants, and mammals. However, the contribution of the exocyst complex in autophagosome biogenesis is unclear. In this study, using yeast temperature-sensitive mutants of the exocyst, we observed the accumulation of multiple abortive PAS incapable of autophagosome biogenesis. These dysfunctional abortive structures were enriched with core autophagy proteins involved in initiation and membrane expansion. However, the membrane expansion ability required for cargo capture was severely compromised in these mutants. Further investigations, including a comprehensive epistasis analysis, revealed that the exocyst plays a role downstream of the Atg1 complex. However, it was required at a stage before phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K complex I), Atg2–Atg18, and Atg12–Atg5–Atg16 complexes. Taken together, we show that productive PAS formation and membrane expansion during autophagosome biogenesis are exquisitely orchestrated by the autophagy-specific exocyst subcomplex, which excludes Exo70.",

Cyanobacteria, which have evolved a unique, water-soluble light-harvesting complex—the phycobilisome—achieve photoprotection through a photoactivatable quencher called the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). Phycobilisomes are highly symmetric and modular, formed by hierarchical assembly of conserved subunits into diverse geometries ranging from simple bundles to elaborate fan- or bouquet-like macromolecular architectures. Although OCP is known to provide photoprotection across species of cyanobacteria with different phycobilisome structures, it is not known whether or how these structural variations relate to changes in the photoprotective function of OCP. For example, OCP was recently discovered to bind as a dimer at two specific instances of an abundant structural motif on the tricylindrical phycobilisome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, yet these sites are sterically inaccessible on a more common pentacylindrical phycobilisome ( Anabaena sp. PCC 7120). To understand how structural modularity and binding specificity contribute to conservation of OCP binding sites and function across different phycobilisome architectures, here we compare experimentally measured photophysical states accessible to these prototypical tricylindrical and pentacylindrical phycobilisomes, with and without OCP, at the single-molecule level. Together with Monte Carlo simulations of exciton transfer in OCP-quenched phycobilisomes, our results suggest that OCP binds at distinct and specific sites in each type of phycobilisome, yet provides nearly identical quenching strength to both phycobilisomes. Our findings highlight the utility of modular phycobilisome structures in balancing robust conservation of photoprotective function with adaptability of site-specific binding across species.",

Although the olfactory systems of many model organisms approximately follow this canonical organization, a number of exceptions are known. In particular, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes coexpress multiple types of ORs in many OSNs. Why do some olfactory systems follow the canonical organization while others violate it? We approach this question from the normative perspective of efficient coding. We find that the canonical and noncanonical organizations optimally encode odor signals in different types of olfactory environment. Noncanonical olfaction is beneficial when relevant sources emit correlated odorants and the environment contains odorants from ethologically irrelevant odor sources. Our theory explains previous observations of receptor coexpression and provides a framework from which to understand the structure of early olfactory systems.",

          "abstract": "During origin licensing, the origin recognition complex (ORC) loads two Mcm2-7 helicases onto DNA in a head-to-head conformation, establishing the foundation for subsequent bidirectional replication. Single-molecule experiments support a helicase-loading model in which one ORC loads both Mcm2-7 helicases at origins. For this to occur, ORC must release from its initial Mcm2-7 and DNA binding sites, flip over the helicase, and bind the opposite end of the Mcm2-7 complex and adjacent DNA to form the MO complex. Importantly, this binding-site transition occurs without ORC releasing into solution. Using a single-molecule FRET assay, we show that the N-terminal half of Orc6 tethers ORC to the N-terminal region of Mcm2 during ORC’s binding-site transition. This interaction involves both the folded Orc6 N-terminal domain (Orc6N) and the adjacent unstructured linker and forms before ORC releases from its initial Mcm2-7 interaction. The absence of this interaction increases the rate of ORC release into solution, consistent with a tethering function. CDK phosphorylation of ORC inhibits the tethering interaction, providing a mechanism for the known CDK inhibition of MO complex formation. Interestingly, we identify mutations in the Orc6 linker region that support MO complex formation but prevent double-hexamer formation by inhibiting stable second Mcm2-7 recruitment. Our study provides a molecular explanation for a one-ORC mechanism of helicase loading and demonstrates that Orc6 is involved in multiple stages of origin licensing.",

          "abstract": "Like many viruses, HIV relies on the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton for successful infection. MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate MT functions and thus bear the potential to modulate viral infection. However, while several MAPs are known to exert proviral effects on HIV, little is known about antiviral ones. We previously described the Tripartite motif protein 69 (Trim69) as an innate immune factor that remodels MTs, leading to inhibition of a broad spectrum of viruses, including HIV. Through in silico modeling, TIRF microscopy, and cell-based assays, we determine that Trim69 binding to MTs is determined by a basic surface in its SPRY domain that interacts with the C-terminal tails of tubulins. This surface is conserved among mammalian Trim69s and is critical for its functions. We demonstrate that by binding and remodeling MTs, Trim69 inhibits the docking and the migration of virion cores on MTs by promoting the stalling of the dynein/dynactin motor complexes. Altogether, these findings shed light on a mechanism of viral defense that involves an innate immune regulation of the MT cytoskeleton.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation to different environments is thought to play a key role in speciation. However, speciation typically begins in allopatry, where reproductive isolation can also arise through neutral processes or selection unrelated to ecological differences. Disentangling the role of adaptive ecological divergence in the early stages of speciation therefore remains an important challenge in understanding the origin of new species. Here, we study threespine stickleback populations that have recently evolved in isolated postglacial lakes either in the presence or absence of prickly sculpin—a resource competitor that also shares ubiquitous trout predators with stickleback. We simulated secondary contact between several stickleback populations from these two ecological contexts in large, seminatural ponds, and genotyped offspring from 411 mating events to assess the strength of premating isolation associated with this biotic factor. Assortative mating between populations of the same ecological type (i.e., both sculpin-sympatric or both solitary) was moderate on average but ranged from weak to complete. Strikingly, and in line with a central premise of ecological speciation, the strength of premating isolation increased with increasing morphological and genomic population divergence shaped by sculpin-mediated selection. In contrast, overall phenotypic and genomic population divergence agnostic to sculpin presence/absence only poorly explained premating isolation, highlighting how ecological speciation in allopatry can be obscured by other sources of divergence. More broadly, our findings demonstrate how interactions with other ecologically similar species can play a major role in initiating and driving evolutionary trajectories toward new species, even in allopatry.",

          "abstract": "Development requires the coordinated action of many genes across space and time, yet numerous species can develop discrete, alternate phenotypes. Such complex balanced polymorphisms are often controlled by supergenes: multiple tightly linked loci that function together to control development of a complex phenotype. Supergenes are widespread in nature. However, the evolution and functions of supergene alleles remain obscure because the identities of the functional loci, and the causative variation between them, remain essentially unknown. The doublesex supergene controls mimicry polymorphism in the swallowtail butterflies Papilio polytes and Papilio alphenor. Alternate alleles cause development of discrete mimetic or nonmimetic wing patterns. We found that the mimetic allele evolved by gaining six new cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and an inversion that locked those CREs together with dsx and the novel noncoding gene U3X . At least four of these new CREs are essential for dsx expression and mimetic pattern development. Genome-wide assays of DSX binding suggest that dsx controls mimetic pattern development by directly regulating the expression of both itself and a handful of unlinked genes. The dsx supergene thus contains multiple functional genetic elements, each required for the phenotype switch and linked together by an inversion, and likely exerts its effects on color pattern development through direct regulation of unlinked “modifier” genes. Our results therefore support classic theories of supergene evolution, but update those ideas to match what we have learned about gene regulation since their development over a half century ago.",

          "abstract": "As experiments advance to record from tens of thousands of neurons, statistical physics provides a framework for understanding how collective activity emerges from networks of fine-scale correlations. While modeling these populations is tractable in loop-free networks, neural circuitry inherently contains feedback loops of connectivity. Here, for a class of networks with loops, we present an exact solution to the maximum entropy problem that scales to very large systems. This solution provides direct access to information-theoretic measures like the entropy of the model and the information contained in correlations, which are usually inaccessible at large scales. In turn, this allows us to search for the optimal network of correlations that contains the maximum information about population activity. Applying these methods to 45 recordings of approximately 10,000 neurons in the mouse visual system, we demonstrate that our framework captures more information—providing a better description of the population—than existing methods without loops. For a given population, our models perform even better during visual stimulation than spontaneous activity; however, the inferred interactions overlap significantly, suggesting an underlying neural circuitry that remains consistent across stimuli. Generally, we construct an optimized framework for studying the statistical physics of large neural populations, with future applications extending to other biological networks.",

Depletion of platelets markedly attenuated mast cell (MC) activation in a model of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) that depends on IL-33 and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). We demonstrate an IL-33-driven feed-forward loop between platelets and MCs. IL-33 neutralization prevented increases in cysLTs and CXCL7, a platelet activation marker, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from AERD-like mice in response to aspirin challenges. BAL fluid concentrations of PGD 2 correlated strongly with both CXCL7 and MC tryptase in subjects with severe asthma. Platelets amplified PGD 2 and LTC 4 productions by IL-33-stimulated mouse bone marrow–derived MCs (BMMCs), which induced release of CXCL7 and expression of CD62P by platelets. Deletions of MC-specific LTC 4 or platelet-specific type 2 cysLT receptor (CysLT 2 R) completely eliminated both platelet activation and the amplification of PGD 2 and LTC 4 generation by MCs. Platelet-derived ADP/ATP and MC-associated P2Y 1 receptors were essential. These findings identify an innate immune pathway involving MC–platelet interplay that may drive IL-33-dependent immunopathology in asthma.",

          "abstract": "Tumor genomic profiling has uncovered many cancer drivers whose implications in terms of tumor biology and therapeutic actionability remain understudied. Hotspot mutations in SF3B1 induce widespread transcriptomic alterations and occur across multiple cancer types. Despite this, the biological and clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutations remain elusive. Characterization of the largest SF3B1 mutant breast cancer clinical cohort to date identifies SF3B1 driver mutations in approximately 2.5% of HR+ HER2- breast cancer, with strong enrichment of K700E substitutions, substantial variation in variant allele fraction (VAF), and significantly improved overall survival due to enrichment in Luminal A disease. In vitro and in vivo studies in representative cell models suggest several of the most prevalent SF3B1 mutations have deleterious effects on cell growth, leading to selective loss of the mutation over time, providing a rationale for the low frequency and low VAF of SF3B1 mutations in breast cancer. Though all introduced hotspot mutations limit growth and are reverted to wildtype (WT) over time, mutations at position R625 have a more pronounced phenotype than K700E, providing an explanation for the clinically observed skew in mutation frequencies. RNA and DNA sequencing analyses were used to identify characteristic pathway-level transcriptomic changes in SF3B1 -mutant cells and identify copy number alterations as a mechanism of both improved mutation tolerability and a means to eliminate the mutation over time. These data suggest that while SF3B1 mutations are enriched in some clinical contexts, their role in breast tumorigenesis is highly complex and dependent on secondary events that overcome their deleterious effects on cell growth and survival.",

We engineered a pair of quantitative fluorescent biosensors for citrate that address several limitations (affinity, pH, Mg 2+ , and temperature) of existing citrate biosensors. Using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging, we found that free citrate in the cytosol of neurons in acute mouse brain slices declines two-to-threefold within seconds of neuronal activation and then returns to baseline over a few minutes. The stimulation-dependent citrate transient depends at least in part on the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.

In humans, defective radial spokes can cause a genetic disorder known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), resulting in respiratory defects and infertility. Despite their critical role in ciliary motility, the molecular composition and related physiological functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify EF-hand calcium-binding domain protein 10 (EFCAB10) and adenylate kinase (AK8) as radial spoke proteins and describe their roles in mouse motile cilia. Using Efcab10 −/− and Ak8 −/− mice, we show that loss of either protein can affect ciliary motility and lead to PCD-related phenotypes in mice. Interestingly, ciliary AK8 is completely absent in Efcab10 −/− cilia, but the loss of AK8 has no effect on ciliary EFCAB10. Further biochemical analyses reveal that EFCAB10 interacts with AK8 and RSPH3B, which fastens AK8 to the radial spoke. Overall, our findings demonstrate the essential role of EFCAB10 as a radial spoke protein in maintaining the integrity of the radial spoke and provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of related ciliopathies.",

          "abstract": "Oceanic islands are hotspots of both species extinctions and introductions, which led to marked changes in species composition. This may disrupt key ecological interactions, such as animal-mediated seed dispersal, with potential long-term impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning. While some recent studies on individual taxa and islands report functional shifts, there has been no globally comprehensive study of how these changes vary in intensity and direction across islands. Importantly, it remains unclear how changes in traits of animal communities actually translate to ecologically relevant mismatches with native plant species. We report widespread functional remodeling of frugivore communities based on frugivory-specific traits of all native, extinct, and introduced vertebrate frugivores (birds, mammals, reptiles) from 120 islands in 22 archipelagos. There is a trend for taxonomic and functional substitution, mainly of nonvolant terrestrial mammalian omnivores replacing large-gaped flying frugivores, which caused a mismatch between gape size and seed size. This shift in seed dispersal potential risks underestimation in single-taxon studies. Overall, vertebrate introductions outnumbered extinctions both in terms of species (44 vs. 23%) and islands affected (92 vs. 76%). Moreover, introductions have driven stronger shifts in frugivore trait space compared to extinctions. However, the general patterns are modulated by substantial spatial variation and idiosyncratic functional shifts within frugivore communities on some islands. This, coupled with differences in plant seed size distributions, leads to variability in realized functional mismatches among islands. These results emphasize challenges with predicting functional responses to anthropogenic activities, while highlighting that remodeling of ecosystem interactions is a global concern.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as mRNA delivery vehicles with minimal risk of genome integration; however, their ability to selectively deliver mRNA to specific cell types remains limited. To overcome this, microRNA (miRNA) target sequences were incorporated into mRNA constructs to restrict expression specifically to germ cells. Using pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha 2 (PDHA2) knockout mice as an NOA model with meiotic arrest, we demonstrate that LNP-mediated delivery of Pdha2 mRNA enables the resumption and completion of meiosis, restores sperm production, and facilitates the generation of healthy fertile offspring via ICSI. Whole-genome sequencing of the offspring confirmed the absence of large-scale genomic abnormalities. Our results provide proof of concept for a safe and effective chemically synthesized LNP-based mRNA therapy with miRNA-regulated germ cell specificity, offering a promising therapeutic approach to treating male infertility caused by spermatogenesis arrest.",

          "abstract": "Self-organization of individual organisms at a very small scale may result in recognizable functional ecosystem structures at a larger spatial scale. Drylands, which cover almost half of emerged lands, host some of the most remarkable vegetation patterns on Earth, including “disordered hyperuniformity,” a recently defined class of such emergent self-organization structures. Yet, the extent, causes, and consequences of disordered hyperuniform vegetation patterns in drylands remain virtually unknown. Here, we analyzed high-resolution remote sensing images of 425 spot-like drylands across the globe and found that disordered hyperuniformity shapes vegetation patterns in about one out of ten drylands, with the distribution of plants appearing to be “disordered” to the naked eye, but supporting highly recognizable (uniform) patterns at larger scales ( ca. 50 to 500 m). Using mathematical models, we identify three potential mechanisms that can generate disordered hyperuniform vegetation patterns. These mechanisms are not limited to the well-studied Turing patterns and represent key general processes with respect to plant–plant or plant–sediment interactions. Further modeling indicates that disordered hyperuniformity enhances ecosystem functioning in terms of water retention use, and expands the range of aridity conditions under which the system can maintain itself, but may slow recovery of vegetation structure from disturbances. In a wider context, we also show that disordered hyperuniformity is likely to pertain to diverse dryland systems, such as termite-mound or fairy-circle landscapes. Our findings highlight that exploring disordered hyperuniformity of vegetation pattern of drylands (and potentially other large-scale systems) offers insights into the organization and resilience of ecosystems globally.",

Disrupted retinal homeostasis contributes to various ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinitis pigmentosa. However, noninvasive in vivo imaging methods to study the pathogenesis of these disorders remain limited. Here, we developed a two-photon microscopy technique for real-time, transpupillary in vivo visualization of the retinal neurovascular unit in mice. Our approach integrates systematic head fixation, a custom-made polymethyl methacrylate contact lens, and a glycerin immersion objective lens with an extended working distance and a higher numerical aperture, specifically designed for two-photon microscopy. This method enabled us to visualize dynamic microglial process activity around retinal blood vessels. Our results revealed that retinal microglia exhibit enhanced surveillance under diabetic conditions, which is undetectable by static confocal microscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist commonly used for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, reversed the enhanced microglial behaviors in the diabetic retina. Our simple yet effective approach mitigates the need for advanced optical systems like adaptive optics, providing an effective tool for real-time imaging of the retina. This method offers a valuable resource for visual neuroscience research and holds great potential for clinical applications, particularly in the early diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring of retinal diseases.",

Men showed greater cortical thickness (CT) decline in the cuneus, lingual, parahippocampal, and pericalcarine regions; surface area decline in the fusiform and postcentral regions; and in older adults, greater subcortical decline in the caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, and pallidum.

The phase diagram contains three distinct superconducting phases: SC 1 in which φ and θ extend from 0 to 90° and H ≤ ~15 T; SC 2 for φ ≤ ~7°, θ ≤ ~4° and ~15 T ≤ H ≤ H m = ~35 T, the onset of the magnetic field polarized (FP) phase, and SC FP which resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from θ ≈ 20° to 40° and from ~40 T to above 60 T. We studied the evolution of the H vs. θ phase diagram for Th concentrations 0.005 ≤ x ≤ 0.047 in the U 1-x Th x Te 2 system at ~0.6 K. Within this range of x values, SC 1 extends over 0 ≤ θ ≤ 90° and H ≤ ~10 T for x = 0.047, while SC 2 is suppressed. The SC FP and FP phases are unaffected to x = 0.02 but are completely suppressed in the region x = 0.025 to 0.047 where the residual resistance ratio RRR ~3 indicates a significant amount of disorder.

However, the regulatory roles of “nonsusceptible” mucosal cells remain unclear. Here, we show that while swine influenza and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDV) viruses infect piglet nasal and intestinal epithelia, each virus establishes efficient infection only in its preferred mucosal niche. Goblet cell activity significantly influences mucosal infection outcomes; increased mucus secretion effectively blocks viral entry, while its reduction facilitates viral dissemination. Notably, PEDV activates acetylcholine-cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 signaling in submucosal enteric neurons to induce goblet cell-associated antigen passages. This mechanism enables the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the lamina propria in early infection, even when the epithelial barrier remains intact, triggering inflammation and exacerbating mucosal damage. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of goblet cells in controlling viral tropism and their potential as targets for developing effective broad-spectrum antiviral approaches.",

          "abstract": "For several decades, it was widely believed that a noninteracting disordered electronic system could only undergo an Anderson metal–insulator transition due to Anderson localization. However, numerous recent theoretical works have predicted the existence of a disorder-driven non-Anderson phase transition that differs from Anderson localization. The frustration lies in the fact that this non-Anderson disorder-driven transition has not yet been experimentally demonstrated in any system. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we present a case study of observing the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition by visualizing the electronic structure of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi on surfaces with varying amounts of disorder. Our observations reveal that strong disorder can effectively suppress all surface states in the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, including the topological surface Fermi arcs. This disappearance of surface Fermi arcs is associated with the vanishing of the topological invariant, indicating a quantum phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffusive metal. These observations provide direct experimental evidence of the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition occurring in real quantum systems, a finding long anticipated by theoretical physicists.",

We used an ecosystem-scale manipulation to simulate hurricane-level flooding of a coastal forest and explore the individual and interactive impacts of inundation and salinity. Monitoring real-time soil conditions and tree physiological responses, we observed consistent impacts on soil biogeochemistry aligned with belowground drivers of tree mortality, but no consistent responses in aboveground vegetation immediately following flooding.

          "abstract": "The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most devastating insect pest in rice, posing a serious threat to global rice production. One attractive control strategy would be based on the understanding of the virulence mechanisms of BPH at the molecular level and then designing targeted methods to neutralize such mechanisms. Salivary proteins of BPH are important players in mediating rice–BPH interactions. Here, we describe a pivotal role of a watery saliva protein, Nilaparvata lugens Annexin-like5 ( Nl ANX5), in the rice–BPH interaction. RNA interference (RNAi) of NlANX5 greatly compromised BPH feeding performance and survival rate on rice plants. NlANX5 -RNAi BPH triggered a rapid calcium ion influx in rice cells. The feeding and survival defects of NlANX5 -RNAi BPH can be restored in NlANX5 -expressing transgenic rice plants. Nl ANX5 targets rice annexin ( Os ANN) proteins, including Os ANN2 and Os ANN8. Further analysis with Nl ANX5 and Os ANN2 as well as Os ANN8 showed that Nl ANX5 displaces Os ANN2 and Os ANN8 from the rice cell membrane. The osann2 osann8 mutant rice plants are hypersusceptible to BPH infestation. In contrast, enhanced expression of OsANN2 and OsANN8 genes resulted in robust rice resistance against BPH. This study highlights a successful example of identifying and augmenting the expression of the host targets of a major BPH virulence effector as a promising antivirulence strategy against an important crop pest.",

The obstacles that prevented their use as H 2 oxidation catalysts in fuel cells are being removed one by one, thanks to the continuous discovery of hydrogenases that have unexpected catalytic properties, the development of new methods for their scalable production and matrices that protect them. Obtaining an efficient biohybrid electrode that is scalable and robust under a large range of experimental conditions is still challenging. The FeFe hydrogenase of Clostridium beijerinckii is a very active catalyst of H 2 evolution and can be handled under O 2 , and its production can potentially be scaled up. However, it was believed that it cannot be used for H 2 oxidation, as it is easily oxidized to an O 2 -stable but inactive state. Here, we show that when the enzyme is embedded into a redox-active film whose reduction potential is finely tuned to the equilibrium potential of the H + /H 2 couple, the potential that the enzyme experiences can be buffered in a sharp window that is actually compatible with enzyme-catalyzed H 2 oxidation and prevents anaerobic inactivation. This leads us to provide the demonstration of an FeFe hydrogenase-based system that can be used for H 2 oxidation and that can be repeatedly exposed to O 2 during and between operational cycles.",

          "abstract": "We present a flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system’s linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system’s score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework’s versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system’s characteristics: i) a clustering-based algorithm (K-means Gaussian Mixture Modeling) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier–Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system’s response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.",

By systematically varying blade sharpness and speed, we find that faster or blunter blades significantly increase both the number and energy of ejected droplets. Strain mapping reveals that the onion’s tough epidermis acts as a barrier to fracture, enabling the underlying mesophyll to undergo significant compression before rupture. Developing a simplified bilayer model, we experimentally and theoretically capture the mechanism behind, with numerical calculations of the onion critical fracture forces matching independent Instron results. The work highlights the importance of blade sharpening routines to limiting ejected droplets infected with pathogens in the kitchen, which pack additional outburst energy due to vegetables’ outer strong casings.",

Unlike classical senses, signals from vestibular organs are not selectively conveyed to a dedicated cortical area but are broadcast throughout the cortex. This distributed processing pattern reflects the fundamental role of vestibular information in contextual modulation across diverse cortical computations. Surprisingly, the routes taken by vestibular signals to reach the cortex are still largely uncharted. Here, we show that the primary visual cortex (V1) receives real-time head movement signals—direction, velocity, and acceleration—from the ipsilateral pulvinar and contralateral visual cortex (VC). The ipsilateral pulvinar provides the main head movement signal, with a bias toward contraversive movements (e.g., clockwise movements in left V1). Conversely, the contralateral VC provides head movement signals during ipsiversive movements. Crucially, head movement variables encoded in V1 are already encoded in the pulvinar, suggesting that those variables are computed subcortically. Thus, the convergence of inter- and intrahemispheric signals endows V1 with a rich representation of the animal’s head movements.",

There is a critical need for methods capable of directly generating protein sequences with the required properties. Here, we present GeoEvoBuilder, an advanced deep learning framework that adaptively integrates structural and evolutionary constraints for protein sequence design. GeoEvoBuilder accurately recapitulates functional sites and generates sequences that fold correctly with enhanced activity and thermal stability. GeoEvoBuilder has been applied to redesign green fluorescent protein, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), yielding variants with significantly improved thermal stability and activity. Notably, the top DHFR design demonstrated a 20-fold increase in catalytic efficiency and a 10 °C gain in thermal stability. Crystal structure determination confirmed that the designed proteins form correct structures. Further analysis of residue dynamic correlations in GPX4 variants provides insights into how remote sites regulate enzymatic activity. Unlike conventional methods that focus on single mutation and their combinations with iterative design and experiment cycles, GeoEvoBuilder explores a large sequence space that enables successful designs with over 30% residue changes in one run. GeoEvoBuilder not only provides a transformative tool for protein engineering but also can be applied to uncover the intricate relationships between protein sequence, structure, function, and evolution.

While animals grown at low density prefer the temperature previously associated with food, those exposed to high density during larval stages instead disperse from this temperature. The high-density experience alters the neural representation of thermal valence, a process that requires a gap junction network spanning multiple neural circuit layers. This network connects density-sensing neurons to the circuit that processes temperature information. Furthermore, these gap junction components also control the decision to enter developmental diapause in response to high density. Our results suggest that the multilayered gap junction network enables early social experience to influence adult behavior and is essential for developmental and behavioral plasticity in social contexts.",

Here, we apply observability theory to establish a general methodology for biomarker selection. We demonstrate that observability identifies biologically meaningful sensors in a range of time series transcriptomics data. To address unique biological constraints, we introduce the method of dynamic sensor selection to maximize observability over time, thus enabling observability over regimes where system dynamics themselves are subject to change. Our observability-guided biomarker discovery framework extends to multiple data modalities, as demonstrated with the joint use of transcriptomics and chromosome conformation data. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by evaluating the observability of neural activity measured in movies and electroencephalograms.

Here, data show the remarkable potency of a synthetic poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(propylene oxide) side chain–based bottlebrush block copolymer, ~150,000 times more potent than linear polymers, to rapidly restore contractile function to DMD skeletal muscle fibers in vitro. Strikingly, upon bottlebrush polymer delivery to DMD animals, results show highly efficacious prevention of the onset of skeletal and diaphragm muscle damage and the blocking of stress-induced cardiac injury and death in vivo. These data suggest bottlebrush polymers as a potent stand-alone muscle membrane-stabilizing therapeutic for DMD.

          "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates (BCs) are phase-separated viscoelastic hubs within demixed solutions enriched in proteins and nucleic acids. Such condensates, also called membraneless organelles, are increasingly observed in cells and serve as transient hubs for spatial organization and compartmentalization of biomolecules. Along with the transiency of formation and dissolution, their ability to sequester molecules has inspired us to develop BCs as potential vehicles to transport and deliver molecular cargo. We recently reported the design of disulfide bond cross-linked phase-separating peptide (PSP) condensates that spontaneously dissolve in reducing conditions. Based on the premise that the highly reducing cytoplasm could dissolve PSP condensates and release partitioned cargo, here, we demonstrate the ability of PSP condensates to deliver molecular cargo to the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. We show that PSP condensates deliver a variety of cargos that differ in their sizes and chemistries, including small molecules, peptides, GFP (31 kDa), DNA (1.7 kbp), and mRNA. The transfection efficiencies of PSP condensates for delivering DNA and mRNA were also significantly greater than those of a commercial transfection agent. With room to tailor the condensate properties based on cargo and cell types, these results showcase the potential of disulfide-cross-linked PSPs as effective and customizable cellular delivery vehicles, filling a critical demand gap for such delivery systems.",

          "abstract": "Heterogeneous gene expression enables the coexistence of virulent phages with populations of isogenic bacteria comprising both phenotypically phage-resistant and susceptible cells. However, the evolvability of phages and the fitness cost they impose on susceptible bacteria challenge the evolutionary stability of the coexistence. Understanding this dynamic is critical for predicting phage–bacteria coevolution with implications for phage therapy, where resistance hinders treatment success. To address this point, we built on the discovery that heterogeneously expressed alterations of the O-antigen (phase variation) enable phenotypic resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium ( S .Tm) against the T5-like phage 37 (Φ37). We observed that phase variation allowed prolonged phage–bacteria coexistence in liquid medium. In contrast, phase variation only delayed the fixation of genetically phage-resistant S .Tm mutants when the phage–bacteria interaction took place in the gut of infected mice. The emergence of evolved phages capable of infecting both phenotypically susceptible and resistant phase variants of wild-type S .Tm selected for genetically resistant S .Tm mutants. Experimental in vitro evolution in a viscous medium recapitulated the short-lived coexistence of phages with susceptible S .Tm observed in the gut. This demonstrates that conditions in the gut increase the evolvability of phages by potentiating the effect of mutations that increase the phage host range, thereby negating the protection conferred by phase variation.",

          "abstract": "As critical executors of the immune system, neutrophils provide an immediate inflammatory response for the clearance of debris and microbes, which is essential for the protection of health. Developmentally, neutrophils and macrophages share common progenitors, whose fate is tightly controlled by transcriptional programs. Dysregulation of these programs causes severe hematological disorders, including neutropenia, neutrophilia, leukemia, and inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation of neutrophils through these programs are poorly understood. Here, we revealed that Ikzf1 and Myb were enriched in neutrophils. Overactivation of Ikzf1 promoted neutrophil generation while suppressing macrophage emergence. Conversely, the simultaneous loss of Ikzf1 and Myb, but not the individual mutations, drastically impaired neutrophil production and enlarged the macrophage pool in both zebrafish and mice. Mechanistically, Ikzf1 and Myb formed a complex that targeted irf8 and induced the expression of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), irf8-2 , through a regulatory element. LncRNA irf8-2 biased neutrophil commitment by modulating irf8 dosage via Zfp36l1. The deletion of irf8-2 resulted in defective neutrophil development and enhanced macrophage production. However, a partial ratio of neutrophils and macrophages was restored when Ikzf1, Myb, and Irf8 were all compromised. Overall, our study reveals that Ikzf1 and Myb cooperatively bias neutrophil development against Irf8 via the lncRNA irf8 -2 and Zfp36l. This study provides previously uncharacterized insights into the conserved molecular balance between neutrophil and macrophage development during myelopoiesis, with potential implications for understanding and treating myeloid disorders.",

          "abstract": "Pathogens are major drivers of cancer globally and the processes of infection and carcinogenesis unfold over decades making them difficult to observe in human or natural populations. We investigate these hidden dynamics for the foodborne trematode Opisthorchis viverrini , which is a primary cause of biliary cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) and infects 12 million people in Southeast Asia. In tumors from patients exposed to O. viverrini , we find that the earliest chromosomal amplifications carrying driver genes occurred at 30 y old on average, two to four decades before cancer diagnosis, and disproportionately contain TP53 , PTEN and FGFR2 genes. We then fitted transmission models to parasitological data from Thailand spanning 27 y ( n = 11,517) finding that, for people born between 1960 and 1989, first exposure occurred at two years old and by 30 y individuals had been cumulatively infected with a median of 72 worms. Trematodes are long-lived and our analysis quantifies the average lifespan of O. viverrini as 13 y (90% credible interval [CrI] 7 to 26 y) within human hosts. The lifetime probability of diagnosis with cholangiocarcinoma is 4.9% (90% CrI 4.7 to 5.0%) given prior exposure to O. viverrini , which is fourteen-fold higher than in populations nonendemic for the parasite. We find strong evidence for a dramatic decline in parasite transmission from 1990 onward in Thailand, suggesting that the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma will decline over the coming decades. Our study demonstrates how pathogen exposure drives patterns of cancer within a population and provides evidence for public health and therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Hydrothermal vent temperatures fluctuate in response to transient magmatic and tectonic activity at the axis of mid-ocean ridges (MORs) and modulate energy fluxes from the deep Earth to the ocean. Such fluctuations have thus far only been documented on time scales of minutes to years, because of the scarcity of long, continuous observations. Here, we assemble a ~35-year-long time series of exit fluid temperatures from five hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise axis, between 9°46’-51’N. This dataset reveals a steady increase in maximum venting temperatures atop the central part of the axial magma lens (AML), from ~350 °C to ~390 °C between the 1991–92 and 2005–06 eruptions. Temperatures decreased back to ~350 °C shortly after the 2005–06 eruption and have been rising ever since. We interpret the temperature increase as a result of a steady decrease in upflow zone permeability caused by the steady inflation of the AML compressing the oceanic upper crust. Using laboratory-determined pressure–permeability relations, we estimate crustal pressurization rates of 0.38 MPa/y (1992–2005) and 0.33 MPa/y (post-2006), consistent with geodetic observations from 2009–2011. Decadal fluctuations in hydrothermal vent temperatures likely mimic the rate of AML pressurization, yielding valuable new constraints on the dynamics of magmatic replenishment and eruptions at MORs. Notably, this temperature time series underpinned our forecast of the April 2025 eruption at the study site.",

          "abstract": "Microbial fermentation facilitates the initial breakdown of organic matter into small molecules and is thought to be the rate-limiting step of anoxic organic mineralization. However, fermentation is understudied in modern and ancient biogeochemistry due to a lack of environmental biomarkers. It has long been assumed that fermentation, like respiration, does not express significant carbon isotope fractionations, precluding isotopic signals as a means of studying it in nature. Here, we tested this idea by growing pure cultures of four fermenting bacteria on glucose and measuring the carbon isotope compositions of the organic acids and alcohols produced. We found that fermentation exhibits a strong carbon isotope fractionation, ranging from − 6‰ to + 16‰, depending on the fermentation product. With bioisotopic models that track site-specific isotope enrichments through metabolism, we constrained the enzymes responsible for these fractionations. Our models reproduced in vivo organic acid δ 13 C values in all four organisms. These findings demonstrate that acetate 13 C-enrichment is likely a widespread signature of fermentation. They also challenge traditional notions of controls on the isotope composition of lipids. Finally, our study suggests that fermentation imposes a trophic carbon isotope fractionation as organic carbon is passed from fermenters to secondary degraders like sulfate reducers. Looking to the geologic past, this trophic fractionation could have imprinted isotopic signals on the three billion year record of sedimentary organic carbon, specifically the inverse δ 13 C pattern of Precambrian acyclic isoprenoid and n-alkane biomarkers. Pervasive evidence of fermentation in the rock record would suggest its underappreciated role in biogeochemical cycles throughout Earth history.",

          "abstract": "Foraging and food consumption are fundamental for the survival of animals. In natural environments, wild rodents feed on insects, including moth larvae, and odor-guided evaluation of potential food resources is a critical step in initiating feeding behavior. However, the mechanisms by which rodents seek and feed on insect prey remain poorly understood. Herein, we employed a laboratory-based predator–prey interaction system using mice and cotton bollworm larvae to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying food-seeking and feeding behaviors at both cellular and neural circuit levels. We demonstrate that mice exhibit a strong preference for consuming fed larvae, and this preference is dependent on the main olfactory system. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed significant differences in the chemical profiles of fed and unfed larvae, with fed larvae containing a higher level of linoleic acid (LA) and a lower level of (Z)-9-tricosene [(Z)-9-TE]. Behavioral assays showed that mice, as well as Brand’s voles and brown rats, are attracted to LA but avoid (Z)-9-TE in a two-choice odor preference test. Furthermore, we identified that the dopaminergic pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the medial olfactory tubercle (mOT) plays a central role in mediating this preference. Chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway abolished the preference for LA over (Z)-9-TE, while chemogenetic activation reversed this effect. Additionally, fiber photometry recordings and pharmacology revealed that mOT D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons preferentially mediate attraction to LA and avoidance of (Z)-9-TE, respectively. These findings uncover a neurobiological system in rodents that supports insect predation based upon chemosignals.",

          "abstract": "Methane is ubiquitous in groundwater, and its release to surface environments through pumping, discharge, or diffusion is an emerging environmental concern. Microbial oxidation consumes methane and mitigates its release, but quantitative constraints in groundwater remain unknown. Using ultra-low-level 14 C-labeling, we estimate in situ microbial methane oxidation rates in shallow carbonate and sandy aquifers from central and northern Germany with methane concentrations spanning 5 orders of magnitude, from 0.15 ± 0.04 to 36,250 ± 1,390 µg L −1 . Oxidation rates ranged from 0.001 ± 0.0003 to 74.28 ± 46.94 µgC L −1 d −1 and were highly correlated with groundwater methane concentrations. Oxidation-based methane turnover was rapid at low methane concentrations, with complete consumption requiring days to weeks. In contrast, microbial oxidation at high methane sites required months to decades for complete methane turnover, indicating the potential for unconsumed methane to leak into local streams or wetlands. High oxidation rates were associated with gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs that typically thrive in suboxic conditions and anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea, while uncultivated methanotrophs of the Methylomirabilota and Verrucomicrobiota dominated low-rate sites. Based on globally distributed groundwater methane concentration data, we extrapolated the strong observed correlation between methane concentrations and oxidation rates to global groundwater volumes, estimating that microbial oxidation removes ~66% of groundwater methane globally, equivalent to 167 to 778 Tg CH 4 y −1 . This highlights the groundwater microbiome as a crucial subsurface methane filter that reduces methane release to surface waters, soils, and the atmosphere.",

Yet, in a handful of species, females cease reproduction long before death, highlighting an apparent evolutionary paradox. We used over three decades of life-history and behavioral data to examine the prevalence of postreproductive lifespan in wild mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei beringei ). Almost one third of females in our study population (7/25) have been “postreproductive” according to a commonly used criterion and have lived more than a decade past their age of last reproduction, representing at least a fourth of their adult lifespan. Additionally, using conservative estimates of female ages, we found a significant post-reproductive representation (a common population-level measure of post-reproductive lifespan) equal to 0.10. Our results add to observations of postreproductive lifespan in chimpanzees and humans and thus, they represent a critical addition to our understanding of hominid life-history evolution.",

At GET2 binds PI4P via an arginine residue in its transmembrane domain. Mutation of this residue disrupts At GET1 and At GET2 proximity at the ER, impairing GET complex function. This defect can be rescued by synthetic dimerization of A tGET1 and At GET2. The PI4P phosphatase RHD4 acts as a gatekeeper, converting PI4P to PI and enabling At GET1– At GET2 interaction, which influences TA protein insertion and root hair growth.

While the abundance of mRNA from recombinant proteins explained less than 1% of observed variation in secretion titers, analysis of 218 biochemical and biophysical descriptors uncovered intrinsic protein features that account for ~15% of secretion variability, pinpointing key drivers such as molecular weight, cysteine content, and N-linked glycosylation, and establishing a roadmap for rational design of difficult-to-express proteins. We subsequently analyzed RNA-Seq data from 95 CHO cell cultures, each expressing a distinct recombinant protein, spanning a wide range of titers. Host cell transcriptomic signatures showed strong correlations with titer, thereby providing insights into cellular processes that covary with expression. Cells failing to produce proteins exhibited increased ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, including ER-associated degradation; whereas high-producing cells demonstrated enhanced lipid metabolism and a stronger response to oxidative stress, suggesting these factors may support successful recombinant protein productions.

Selectively blocking the RAS-PI3Kα interaction may represent a strategy for treating RAS-dependent cancers as it would avoid the toxicity associated with inhibitors of PI3Kα lipid kinase activity. We developed compounds that bind covalently to cysteine 242 in the RBD of PI3K p110α and block RAS activation of PI3Kα activity. In mice, inhibitors slow the growth of RAS mutant tumors and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing tumors, particularly when combined with other inhibitors of the RAS/Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, without causing hyperglycemia. Oncogenic mutations in the small guanosine triphosphatase RAS occur in 20% of human cancers, with RAS proteins activating both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways ( 1 – 3 ). As each of these pathways has oncogenic potential, simultaneous activation, as occurs in mutant RAS driven cancers, generates aggressive disease. In RAS-driven cell and animal models, inhibition of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways is more efficacious than targeting the individual pathways ( 4 ); however, dose-limiting toxicities in humans prevent clinical success of this strategy. Although physiological activation of the MAPK pathway is RAS-dependent, the interaction between RAS and the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, p110α, serves as an amplifier but not a primary activator of this pathway, and is less important in normal cellular regulation than it is in cancer ( 5 ).",

          "abstract": "Transcriptional initiation and termination decisions drive messenger RNA (mRNA) isoform diversity but the relationship between them remains poorly understood. By systematically profiling joint usage of transcription start and end sites, we observed that mRNA using upstream starts preferentially use upstream end sites and that the usage of downstream sites is similarly coupled. Our results suggest a positional initiation termination axis (PITA), in which usage of alternative terminal sites are coupled based on their genomic order. PITA is enriched in longer genes with distinct chromatin features. We find that mRNA 5′ start choice directly influences 3′ ends depending on RNA polymerase II trafficking speed. Our results indicate that spatial organization and transcriptional dynamics couple transcription initiation and mRNA 3′ end decisions to define mRNA isoform expression.",

We found that the nonvesicular cholesterol transporter Aster-A linked plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol availability in CD4 T cells to systemic metabolism. Aster-A was recruited to the PM during T cell receptor (TCR) activation, where it facilitated the removal of accessible cholesterol. Loss of Aster-A increased cholesterol accumulation in the PM, which enhanced TCR nanoclustering and signaling. Aster-A associated with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and negatively regulated calcium (Ca 2+ ) flux. Aster-A deficiency promoted CD4 T cells to acquire a T helper 17 (T H 17) phenotype and stimulated interleukin-22 production, which reduced intestinal fat absorption and conferred resistance to diet-induced obesity.

Mechanisms must have evolved to moderate the impact of mtDNA mutagenesis but are poorly understood. Here, we observed purifying selection of a mouse mtDNA mutation modulated by Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 ( Usp30 ) during the maternal-zygotic transition. In vitro, Usp30 inhibition recapitulated these findings by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). We also found that high mutant burden, or heteroplasmy, impairs the ubiquitin-proteasome system, explaining how mutations can evade quality control to cause disease. Inhibiting USP30 unleashes latent mitophagy, reducing mutant mtDNA in high-heteroplasmy cells. These findings suggest a potential strategy to prevent mitochondrial disorders.",

L1 retrotransposition critically depends on its endonuclease and reverse transcriptase subunit open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p), which targets genomic loci and nicks DNA using an evolutionarily distinct yet not fully understood mechanism. Our structural and biochemical analyses revealed that ORF2p is a structure-dependent endonuclease. It binds a double-stranded DNA region upstream of the nicking site and recognizes a downstream forked or flap structure for efficient DNA nicking. This discovery suggests that L1 mobilization piggybacks on chromosomal processes with noncanonical DNA structure intermediates.",

Although stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists have shown substantial antitumor effects in animal models, their clinical efficacy in human tumors remains unclear. Deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a common genomic alteration in human tumors but is rare in preclinical syngeneic mouse models. We found that homozygous MTAP deletion in human tumors creates a tumor microenvironment that obstructs cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways by down-regulating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to resistance to STING agonists. Targeting polyamine biosynthesis reverses IRF3 down-regulation, restoring sensitivity to STING agonists in MTAP-deficient tumors.

Yet, some key challenges remain, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains owing to depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that preserve spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields but also difficult to manipulate with conventional methods. We demonstrate photo-induced switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field composed of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity.

A major roadblock for further power scaling of single-frequency fiber laser amplifiers is stimulated Brillouin scattering. Efforts have been made to mitigate this nonlinear process, but these were mostly limited to single-mode or few-mode fiber amplifiers, which have good beam quality. Here, we explored a highly multimode fiber amplifier in which stimulated Brillouin scattering was greatly suppressed due to a reduction of light intensity in a large fiber core and a broadening of the Brillouin scattering spectrum by multimode excitation. By applying a spatial wavefront shaping technique to the input light of a nonlinear amplifier, the output beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot. Our multimode fiber amplifier can operate at high power with high efficiency and narrow linewidth, which ensures high coherence. Optical wavefront shaping enables coherent control of multimode laser amplification, with potential applications in coherent beam combining, large-scale interferometry and directed energy delivery.",

The changes enable cGAS to retain chromatin longer upon DNA damage by weakening TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination and interaction with the segregase P97. Prolonged chromatin binding of cGAS enhanced the interaction between repair factors FANCI and RAD50 to facilitate RAD50 recruitment to damage sites, thereby potentiating homologous recombination repair. Moreover, the four amino acids mediate the function of cGAS in antagonizing cellular and tissue aging and extending life span.

To understand how cancer cells adapt to such challenges, we conducted sequential CRISPR screens to identify genes that affect cellular fitness under specific metabolic stress conditions in cell culture and to then probe their relevance in pancreatic tumors. Comparative analyses of hundreds of fitness genes revealed that cancer metabolism in vivo was shaped by bioenergetic adaptations to tumor acidosis. Mechanistically, acidosis suppressed cytoplasmic activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), thereby preventing oncogene-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and promoting fused mitochondria. The resulting boost in mitochondrial respiration supported cancer cell adaptations to various metabolic stresses. Thus, acidosis is an environmental factor that alters energy metabolism to promote stress resilience in cancer.",

Here we show that transient injuries induce a burst of persistent mtDNA mutations that impair resilience to future injuries. mtDNA mutations suppressed energy-intensive nucleotide metabolism. Repletion of adenosine, but not other nucleotides, restored adenosine triphosphate generation, which required a nuclear-encoded purine biosynthetic enzyme, adenylate kinase 4 (AK4). Analysis of 369,912 UK Biobank participants revealed a graded association between mutation burden and chronic kidney disease severity as well as an independent increase in the risk of future acute kidney injury events ( P &lt; 10 −7 ). Heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations may therefore reflect the cumulative effect of acute injuries to metabolically active cells, impairing major functions in a fashion amenable to nuclear-controlled purine biosynthesis.",

Here, we developed a plasma-enabled energy textile (PEET) by emulating the carrier transport mechanism in lightning return strokes. By engineering plasma-treated discharge microchannels, our design enables direct conduction current generation through cascading ionization, overcoming the efficiency limitations of conventional polarization-dependent systems. Under 2-hertz mechanical excitation, the PEET achieves a current density of 2.5 amperes per square centimeter, an average power output of 4.46 watts per square meter per hertz, and an energy conversion efficiency of 19%—two orders of magnitude higher than conventional electrostatic energy harvesting technologies, e.g., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and capacitive systems.

To directly address these issues, this study introduces a noncontact approach by exploiting the unique properties of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. The distinctive longitudinal electric field generated by OAM light substantially enhances the density of trap states in materials such as molybdenum disulfide, as the primary material for investigation, and others as supplementary examples. This enhancement enables precise modulation of key device characteristics, including readout current, hysteresis window, and charge storage capacity, with quantitative behavior accurately modeled by the Poole-Frenkel effect. Our results reveal the transformative potential of OAM light in enabling multilevel memory states with exceptional tunability and versatility across different material systems. This work underscores the viability of OAM-driven memory as a platform for the next generation of highly functional, optically responsive memory devices.",

Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and an athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.",

We report a plasmon-induced route to plasmonic-polymer hybrid nanomaterials using in operando single-particle spectroelectrochemistry. An energy transfer efficiency of 40% is achievable when the spectral overlap between gold nanorod scattering and polymer absorption is maximized. We also show that PIRET-initiated polymerization proceeds through a different mechanism than bulk polymerization, supported by spectroscopic evidence and density functional theory calculations, highlighting efficient energy cascading from photon to plasmon to exciton and, lastly, to unconventional light-initiated chemistry.",

          "abstract": "Environmental stress represents an effective strategy for discovering natural products from microorganisms, but the processes involved remain unclear. Under acidic conditions, a previously unidentified class of β-carbolines (βCs), termed secofumitremorgins (SFs), with potent antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish models was found and identified via nuclear magnetic resonance, Marfey’s analysis, and quantum calculations. Using gene knockout, heterologous expression, precursor feeding, isotope tracing, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis, a unique biosynthetic pathway for SFs was characterized, beyond the Pictet-Spenglerase–mediated biosynthetic process. Furthermore, an unreported pH-regulated mechanism was unveiled, where P450 (FtmG) facilitated new fumitremorgin intermediate formation, enabling spontaneous, nonenzymatic generation of βCs and spirotryprostatins under distinct pH conditions. Notably, this work provides detailed experimental evidence and reaction mechanisms for synergistic enzymatic and nonenzymatic catalysis driving metabolite diversification under pH stress. The findings expand biosynthetic paradigms for indole alkaloids and highlight the therapeutic potential of pH-elicited βCs, advancing strategies for natural product discovery.",

Here, we present a hybrid platform that enables comprehensive dc and ac analog signal processing within a 2D-ACT device. By synergistically integrating 2D-FET and SAW components, our system achieves real-time subwavelength carrier monitoring and ac signal manipulation. ac measurements further elucidate mechanisms of dc acoustoelectric current generation. Notably, by controlling the phase and intensity of counter-propagating SAWs, we demonstrate analog signal addition and subtraction capabilities not previously realized in 2D-ACT devices. This platform establishes a benchmark for compact, low-loss ACT devices in ac signal processing, representing a notable advance for acoustoelectric technologies and 2D material systems.",

          "abstract": "The rate of DNA synthesis is crucial for full DNA duplication. We report a key role of p21 in controlling this rate. During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Oral bacteriotherapy is increasingly exploited but faces challenges in simultaneously monitoring treatment process and achieving desirable efficacy. Here, we develop theranostic bacteria by depositing a protective visual therapeutic nanocoating via in situ sequential mineralization. Using two-step metal ion adsorption and nucleation, bacterial surface is successively mineralized with an inner manganese dioxide/ferric oxide nanoparticle layer and an outer calcium carbonate layer. Upon ingestion, the outer layer neutralizes gastric acid through double-decomposition reaction, protecting bacterial viability and the inner layer. During intestinal passage, the inner layer enables T1/T2 dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging for real-time tracking, whereas the lesion-triggered release of manganese ions allows T1 single-mode pathological detection. The inner layer also exhibits superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, synergizing therapeutic effects with bacteria. Further supported by satisfactory performances in two murine models of Salmonella -induced colitis and apolipoprotein E–deficient atherosclerosis, this work provides a platform to generate innovative theranostic agents for advanced bacteriotherapy.",

Here, we studied islets from nondiabetic ( n = 15) and T2D ( n = 21) donors. We examined whether T2D β cell dysfunction can be rescued, charted the underlying molecular mechanisms by RNA sequencing, and mined transcriptomes for drug targets. Glucose responsiveness of T2D β cells improved in 60% of preparations after 3-day culture in euglycemic conditions.

          "abstract": "Homologous chromosome pairing is a critical prerequisite for successful meiosis, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. In Caenorhabditis elegans , chromosome pairing centers (PCs) and PC-recruited proteins mediate homolog recognition and pairing. Here, we further dissect the molecular characteristics of this system and reveal the involvement of a phase-separated compartment in pairing. Focusing on the PC protein HIM-8, we explored its functional domains in vivo and its self-multimerizing properties in vitro. We find that the amino-terminal domain facilitates PC chromatin binding of the carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas the middle unstructured region is essential for PC association with the nuclear envelop (NE). Integrated analyses suggest that PC-NE association is mediated by a DNA-containing phase-separated compartment that is spatially distinct from, but connected to, the chromosome axis—likely through flexible linkages. We propose that homology evaluation occurs within this compartment, where direct DNA-DNA interactions could play a role.",

The proteasome clears these proteins, but its failure in disease remains unclear. We engineered a  Caenorhabditis elegans  model with a hyperactive 20 S proteasome (α3ΔN) for selective 20 S activation. α3ΔN markedly enhanced IDP and misfolded protein degradation, reduced oxidative damage, and improved endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD). Aggregation-prone substrates such as vitellogenins and human alpha-1 antitrypsin (ATZ) were efficiently cleared. Integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal systemic adaptations featuring increased protein turnover and oxidative stress resistance independent of superoxide dismutases (SODs). Notably, α3ΔN extended life span and stress resistance independently of canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling via xbp-1 . These findings substantiate a “20 S pathway” of proteostasis that directly alleviates protein aggregation and oxidative stress, offering a promising therapeutic angle for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues.

Here, we present a hydrogel platform that enables spatiotemporal modulation of toughness through a latent ionic cross-linking mechanism. By embedding calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) microparticles in alginate/polyacrylamide double-network hydrogels, we create a system where localized calcium release and thus ionic cross-linking can be programmed in both space and time. Spatial control is achieved by direct ink writing of CaCO 3 , while temporal activation is triggered by glucono-δ-lactone, a biocompatible acidifier that releases calcium on demand. This strategy allows user-defined tuning of stiffness and toughness, enabling fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels with tailored mechanical profiles. The resulting materials offer a versatile platform for anisotropic impact shielding, directional strain sensing, and 3D-printed tissue adhesives, representing a paradigm shift for adaptive, reconfigurable, and multifunctional soft materials.",

Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms.

Our analyses reveal that diversity is consistently linked to stability through dual pathways: positively associated with resistance and resilience via indirect structural mediation, yet negatively correlated with local stability unless interaction strength is accounted for. Critically, omitting structural mediation yields a net negative diversity-stability correlation, whereas integrating food web structure uncovers context-dependent positive relationships, underscoring structural metrics as pivotal explanatory variables.

Although higher-order Markov models can capture these effects, they grow rapidly in size and require large amounts of data, making them prone to overfitting some parts and underfitting others in systems with uneven coverage. To address this challenge, we construct concise networks from path data by interpolating between first-order and second-order Markov models. We prioritize simplicity and interpretability by creating state nodes that capture prominent second-order effects and by proposing a transparent measure that balances model size and quality. Our concise networks reveal large-scale memory patterns in both synthetic and real-world systems while remaining far simpler than full second-order models.",

Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits.

However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.",

Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the α7 nAChR in complex with nicotine in both an open state and multiple desensitized states. Comparative analyses reveal progressive conformational changes during recovery from nicotine-induced desensitization and show that asymmetric nicotine binding disrupts the symmetry of the channel pore at the 16′ and 17′ sites.

          "abstract": "A crucial aspect of quantum information is the establishment of multiuser quantum networks, ensuring secure transmission of information among separated users. However, establishing a large-scale network remains a substantial challenge, requiring massive and compact Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled states. Here, we experimentally generate a 5 by 5 continuous variable (CV) EPR entanglement array using a metalens array. Moreover, on the basis of such a compact EPR entanglement array, we establish a five-user all-optical quantum state sharing (AOQSS) network with fidelity beating the corresponding classical limit, which is currently the largest AOQSS network in the CV regime. These results provide a promising platform for the generation of massive and compact EPR entangled states and the construction of large-scale all-optical multiuser quantum networks. Our compact approach for generating CV EPR entanglement based on metasurface opens up avenues for advanced quantum networks.",

However, their commercial viability is limited by the poor cycle stability and complex degradation mechanism. This study underscores the pivotal role of electro-chemo-mechanical interactions in driving the failure of SSBs. Leveraging advanced x-ray imaging and spectroscopy techniques, we analyzed LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NMC811) cathodes from cycled Li x In||Li 6 PS 5 Cl (LPSC)||NMC811 SSBs, uncovering the interplay between microstructure, chemical heterogeneity, mechanical characteristics, and electrochemical performance. Our results show that revealing electro-chemo-mechanical interactions is essential to develop strategies to suppress the degradation of SSBs. Particularly, we revisit a LiNbO 3 (LNO) coating layer to mitigate electrochemical degradation. The LNO@NMC811 cathode retains 116 milliampere-hours per gram after 200 cycles, showing excellent stability, while the uncoated NMC811 cathode keeps degrading over time, with suppressed chemical heterogeneity and mechanical failure.

The causative NLRs [resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1A (RMES1A) and RMES1B] lack signaling domains and have adenosine triphosphatase mutations expected to abrogate function, suggesting that RMES1 NLRs regulate immunity via a noncanonical mechanism. The RMES1 NLR family is ancient, orthologous to phloem-feeding resistance genes in rice and syntenic across the grass superpangenome.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 21 (USP21), one of four major H2AK119-specific deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which USP21 specifically deubiquitinates H2AK119ub and is regulated are unknown. We determined the cryo-EM structure of the USP21 catalytic domain bound to an H2AK119ub nucleosome, which revealed a recognition mode that differs from that of other H2AK119-specific DUBs. We unexpectedly found that the N-terminal IDR of USP21 inhibits the enzyme’s activity. Using AlphaFold-Multimer to perform a virtual screen of USP21 interactors, we identified kinases that phosphorylate the USP21 IDR and thereby relieve autoinhibition. AlphaFold3 modeling of USP21 suggests a structural model for autoinhibition. AlphaFold analysis suggests that phosphorylation-regulated autoinhibition may be a feature of various USP enzymes. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of H2AK119 deubiquitination and reveal a previously unexplored mode of phosphorylation-dependent DUB autoregulation.",

In contrast, a third pathway, which leverages the two-electron nucleophilic potential of alkyl–Co III , has remained unexplored because of the inherently low polarization of the C–Co bond. Here, we report an axial-coordination activation strategy to unlock this reactivity space in Co-MHAT catalysis. Through stoichiometric organometallic studies using well-defined alkyl–Co III complexes, we demonstrate that an alkoxide ligand can render alkyl–Co III sufficiently nucleophilic to displace a suitable leaving group, via a stereospecific backside-backside approach.

We studied binding and pore formation of NLPs in model membranes with GIPCs derived from dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants. Using the cytotoxic NLP 2 from fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa (MpNEP2), we show that membrane binding and damage extend beyond previously studied oomycetal NLPs. Furthermore, NLP Pya from the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum exhibits promiscuous binding with a marked preference for branched GIPC series B lipids. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the structural plasticity of NLP Pya provides a rational basis for its interaction with a variety of GIPC headgroups.

Analyzing two decades of seismicity (2005–2024) across three crustal sectors, we distinguished magma recharge from the mantle, its transfer and storage at intermediate depths, and final ascent to the surface. Moreover, we found that b value time variations can precede geochemical anomalies from magma ascent and its eruption by a few months.

Retrospective meta-analyses reveal increased B cell enrichment in ICB responders’ pretreatment. Functional assays show that B cell depletion impairs T cell–mediated tumor cytotoxicity. EVs from melanoma tumors were analyzed, identifying miR-99a-5p in CD19 + EVs as up-regulated in responders. Silencing miR-99a-5p in B cells reduces T cell antitumor activity, suggesting its role in immune modulation. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p promotes B cell maturation via class-switch recombination.

We demonstrate a strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids by incorporating ultrasmall silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice constants of Ag and Au allow dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with coupling strength ~15 meV∙Å, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and show up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate. We argue that the combined effect of charge transfer at the interfaces and polaronic localization enhances the SOI.",

We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations.

As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.",

Through next-generation sequencing in 131 patients with nonsyndromic TOF, we identified an increased burden of rare deleterious variants in ciliary genes and cilium pathway and observed a multigenic inheritance pattern, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.672 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.120 to 2.547; P  = 0.0104] for more than two deleterious variants and a cumulative OR of 3.158 (95% CI, 1.381 to 6.371; P  = 0.0038) for six variants. Functional validation in single- and double-heterozygous mouse models carrying these variants recapitulated TOF-like phenotypes and impaired normal cilia structure and function, particularly disrupting Hedgehog signaling in cardiomyocytes, and down-regulating key transcription factors Gata4 and Nkx2-5 . Together, our study provides compelling evidence linking ciliary gene variants to a heightened risk of TOF in Han Chinese, offering valuable genetic insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of nonsyndromic TOF and supporting a multigenic inheritance model for the disease.",

In a clinical study involving 170 patients with 186 breast tumors, we developed a diagnostic model leveraging combined photoacoustic and ultrasound features.

However, once prototyped, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–based silicone elastomer is limited in mechanical strength and programmable spatial construction due to the flexible polymer matrix and mismatched interface with other materials. We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact. Our work provides a strategy toward customized mechanically strengthened soft material for developing functional structural architectures and soft origami robots.",

Although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) benefit a subset of patients with mCRPC and BRCA1/2 deficiencies, therapeutic options remain limited for those without such mutations. Here, we uncover a critical role for the ATM-TRMT10A-BRCA1 signaling axis in regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair and PARPi sensitivity. We demonstrate that ATM phosphorylates TRMT10A at serine-28 after DNA damage, promoting BRCA1 recruitment and efficient HR repair. TRMT10A deletion disrupts HR repair, sensitizing cells to PARPis. Moreover, TRMT10A is up-regulated in mCRPC through stabilization by USP10. Targeting USP10 with spautin-1 induces TRMT10A degradation and enhances tumor sensitivity to PARPis in cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models. These findings identify TRMT10A as a therapeutic vulnerability in mCRPC and demonstrate that combined inhibition of PARP and USP10 offers a promising synthetic lethal strategy for a broader group of patients lacking classical BRCA mutations.",

Here, we report the first application of high-field solid-state 83 Kr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), alongside extensive 129 Xe NMR, to investigate gas adsorption in eight MOFs representing three design strategies: ultramicroporous one-dimensional–channel MOFs with pore sizes matching noble gas diameters, functionalized MOFs, and MOFs with open metal sites. Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation.

We developed an automated radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking system to continuously collect behavioral data from entire colonies, monitoring 102 individuals from five colonies for 30 days. Based on behavioral parameters, we statistically identified distinct behavioral phenotypes, comprising one cluster for breeders and six clusters for nonbreeders. Breeders formed strong social bonds, consistently remaining close in activity rhythm synchrony, spatial proximity, and directional following. In contrast, nonbreeders exhibited behavioral heterogeneity according to their cluster: One cluster avoided other active nonbreeders, whereas another cluster attracted frequent following.

We define accommodation quantitatively as mean thickness of potential deposition per unit of time, calculated per unit area based on a maximum deposition rate and slope-controlled probabilities of erosion and deposition. Testing this definition in a simple numerical stratigraphic forward model reproduces key stratal geometries and behaviors, suggesting basic predictive power. However, the model output is missing much stratigraphic detail, and it is difficult to see how this can be added through extension of the accommodation definition. This suggests that accommodation has less predictive power than typically assumed; many important elements of stratal prediction must come instead from independent calculation of sediment erosion, routing, and depositional processes.",

To address this challenge, we introduce high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs) into carbon-based chiral frameworks, constructing HEMO and carbon nanocoil (HEMO@CNC) composites. By combining advanced microscopy, electromagnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is revealed that increasing entropy and helical strain jointly induce nonlinear changes in SOC strength and defect-related localized states. Benefiting from these effects, the HEMO@CNC system achieves an ultrawide bandwidth, outperforming linear structures and low-entropy systems. This work provides a potential paradigm for integrating topological defect engineering and high-entropy quantum modulation, offering deeper insights into advancing electromagnetic functional materials from macroscopic design toward geometry-defect-spin synergistic regulation.",

QuAN directly learns entanglement and state complexity growth from experimental computational basis measurements, including complexity growth in random circuits from noisy data.

Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes.

Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy.

Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion.

Small RNA–mediated targeting remains functional across varying small RNA lengths and is compatible with heterozygous sites. These small RNAs are cleaved by Dicer-like ribonuclease from long noncoding RNAs, which are bidirectionally transcribed of somatic chromosomes, initiated at subtelomeric chromosome breakage sequences (5′-TTGAA-3′). On the basis of these findings and time-course transcriptomic profiling, we propose a model elucidating the molecular mechanism of DNA elimination in Euplotes . These findings provide insights into the role of small RNAs in transmitting genetic information across generations and maintaining genome stability.",

          "abstract": "Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are an abundant class of compounds in atmospheric particulate matter, exerting considerable impacts on air quality, climate, and public health. They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.",

          "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) limitation severely affects crop yields. To address the molecular basis of inorganic phosphate (Pi) specific transport within the sulfate transporter (SULTR) family, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of Oryza sativa SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter (OsSPDT), a key Pi transporter for grain allocation, in apo- and Pi-binding states. OsSPDT forms a domain-swapped homodimer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (NTD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) divided into core and gate subdomains, and a C-terminal sulfate transporter and antisigma factor (STAS) domain. The structure adopts a cytoplasm-facing conformation with Pi coordinated at the core-gate interface. Key residues, including SPDT-unique Ser 170 , mediate Pi specificity within the binding pocket, distinguishing it evolutionarily from sulfate transporters within the SULTR family. Domain-swapping and mutational studies demonstrate functional interdependence of the NTD, TMD, and STAS domains. This work elucidates Pi selectivity in plant SULTR transporters and provides a molecular basis for developing low-phytate rice via OsSPDT gene editing.",
