          "abstract": "Two decades of genetic studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified more than 100 genes harbouring rare risk mutations 1–13 . Despite this substantial heterogeneity, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses have identified convergent patterns of dysregulation across the ASD postmortem brain 14,15–17 . To identify shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD-linked mutations, we assembled a large patient collection of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells, consisting of 70 hiPS cell lines after stringent quality control representing 8 ASD-associated mutations, idiopathic ASD, and 20 lines from non-affected control individuals. Here we used these hiPS cell lines to generate human cortical organoids, profiling by RNA sequencing at four distinct time points up to 100 days after in vitro differentiation. Early time points harboured the largest mutation-specific changes, but different mutations converged on shared transcriptional changes as development progressed. We identified a shared RNA and protein interaction network, which was enriched in ASD risk genes and predicted to drive the observed downstream changes in gene expression. CRISPR–Cas9 screening of these candidate transcriptional regulators in induced human neural progenitors validated their downstream convergent molecular effects. These data illustrate how risk associated with genetically defined forms of ASD can propagate by means of transcriptional regulation to affect convergently dysregulated pathways, providing new insight into the convergent impact of ASD genetic risk on human neurodevelopment.",

          "abstract": "Optical amplifiers are fundamental to modern photonics, enabling long-distance communications1, precision sensing2,3 and quantum information processing4,5. Erbium-doped amplifiers dominate telecommunications but are restricted to specific wavelength bands1,6, whereas semiconductor amplifiers offer broader coverage but suffer from high noise and nonlinear distortions7. Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) promise broadband, quantum-limited amplification across arbitrary wavelengths8. However, their miniaturization and deployment have been hampered by watt-level power requirements. Here we demonstrate an integrated OPA on thin-film lithium niobate that achieves >17 dB gain with <200 mW input power—an order of magnitude improvement over previous demonstrations. Our second-harmonic-resonant design enhances both pump generation efficiency (95% conversion) and pump power utilization through recirculation, without sacrificing bandwidth. The resonant architecture increases the effective pump power by nearly an order of magnitude compared with conventional single-pass designs, while also multiplexing the signal and pump. We demonstrate flat near-quantum-limited noise performance over 110 nm. Our low-power architecture enables practical on-chip OPAs for next-generation quantum and classical photonics.",

          "abstract": "Ultralight axion particles are candidates for dark matter1, conjectured to form stable, macroscopic field configurations in three-dimensional space, resulting in the possible formation of topological defect dark matter2,3,4 (TDM). Exploring their possible existence through a realistic parameter space requires considering interactions that extend beyond the constraints imposed by astrophysical observations of stellar cooling processes5. Here we report the outcome of an experiment that monitors possible transient rotations of polarized spins, which could be induced by the interaction with topological defects, carried out by correlating five noble-gas laboratory set-ups located in two cities. Amplification and optimal noise filtering in hyperpolarized noble-gas spins greatly enhance the sensitivity to TDM-induced spin rotations, reaching approximately 10−6 rad. Through this, we set constraints on the axion–nucleon coupling across an axion mass range from 10 peV to 0.2 μeV, achieving 4.1 × 1010 GeV at 84 peV. These values exceed known constraints imposed by astrophysical observations, although these are obtained under different model assumptions. Our approach could further stimulate broad beyond-Standard Model physics searches, such as transient axion waves, axion stars, axion strings and Q-balls.",

          "abstract": "Integrated circuits for communications play an enabling role when it comes to outer-space exploration thanks to their small footprint and low weight1,2,3. However, owing to the severe irradiation effects of space energetic particles, the implementation of radiation-tolerant electronic circuits remains a challenge4,5,6. Here we report the observation of the space radiation effect on a satellite-based device and find that atomically thin materials are expected to accumulate minimal radiation-induced damage in principle. Accordingly, on the basis of a 4-inch wafer-scale monolayer 2D MoS2 process, we implement an atomic-layer transistor-based radiation-tolerant radio frequency (RF, 12–18 GHz) system with both transmitters and receivers for spaceborne communication. For on-orbit experiments, the 2D communication system was successfully launched to the approximately 517 km low Earth orbit. Notably, the system maintains a bit error rate (BER) of less than 10−8 in the transmitted data after 9 months of on-orbit operation, indicating substantial radiation tolerance and long stability. The lifespan of the 2D communication system is predicted to be about 271 years even on the geosynchronous orbit with a much harsher radiation environment. This work showcases the unique prospects of 2D electronics for spaceborne applications.",

          "abstract": "Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is an interesting topic with broad scientific and technological impact1,2,3,4. Twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2) is a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI)5,6,7,8,9,10, exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall effect11,12,13,14. As the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization15,16, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the Chern insulator (CI)/FCI states. Here we demonstrate control of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states, by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe2. At low excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, that is, electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states under helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature17,18. Both optical training and direct switching are most effective near CI and FCI states, which we attribute to a gap-enhanced valley polarization of optically pumped holes. The magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of ferromagnetic, and thus CI (or FCI) domains. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractionally quantized anomalous Hall domains4,19.",

          "abstract": "Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 100–200 nm) light sources are crucial for advanced spectroscopy, quantum research and semiconductor lithography1,2,3. Compared with conventional large-scale VUV generation technologies4,5,6,7, second-harmonic generation (SHG) through nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals8,9,10 is the simplest and most efficient method. However, the scarcity of suitable NLO crystals has constrained the production of VUV light through SHG: existing materials fail to meet phase-matching requirements, suffer from low conversion efficiency or have severe growth limitations11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. In this study, we report the development of the fluorooxoborate crystal NH4B4O6F (abbreviated as ABF) as a promising material for VUV light generation. VUV devices with specific phase-matching angles were constructed, achieving a record 158.9-nm light through phase-matching SHG and a maximum nanosecond pulse energy of 4.8 mJ at 177.3 nm with a conversion efficiency of 5.9%. The enhanced NLO performance is attributed to optimized arrangements of fluorine-based units creating asymmetric sublattices. This work provides further material in the NLO field, with potential for applications in compact, high-power VUV lasers using ABF.",

          "abstract": "Time-dependent drives hold promise for realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems1,2,3. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems4,5, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives6,7. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Here, using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by n-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is ‘doubly tunable’: one way by driving frequency, the other way by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent 2n + 1. Using quantum-state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a two-dimensional configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.",

Pesticide residues were detected in 70% of sites and emerged as the second strongest driver of soil biodiversity patterns after soil properties. Our analysis further revealed organism- and function-specific patterns, emphasizing complex and widespread non-target effects on soil biodiversity. Pesticides altered microbial functions, including phosphorus and nitrogen cycling, and suppressed beneficial taxa, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacterivore nematodes.

          "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that Parkinson’s disease (PD) may have its origin in the enteric nervous system (ENS), from where α-synuclein (αS) pathology spreads to the brain1,2,3,4. Decades before the onset of motor symptoms, patients with PD suffer from constipation and present with circulating T cells responsive to αS, suggesting that peripheral immune responses initiated in the ENS may be involved in the early stages of PD1,5,6,7. However, cellular mechanisms that trigger αS pathology in the ENS and its spread along the gut–brain axis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that muscularis macrophages (ME-Macs), housekeepers of ENS integrity and intestinal homeostasis, modulate αS pathology and neurodegeneration in models of PD8,9. ME-Macs contain misfolded αS, adopt a signature reflecting endolysosomal dysfunction and modulate the expansion of T cells that travel from the ENS to the brain through the dura mater as αS pathology progresses. Directed ME-Mac depletion leads to reduced αS pathology in the ENS and central nervous system, prevents T cell expansion and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction, suggesting a role for ME-Macs as early cellular initiators of αS pathology along the gut–brain axis. Understanding these mechanisms could pave the way for early-stage biomarkers in PD.",

          "abstract": "Most bacterial pathogens are polylysogens, harbouring multiple vertically transmitted prophages1,2,3. These prophages enhance bacterial pathogenicity and survival by encoding virulence factors and anti-phage defence systems while retaining the capacity for horizontal transfer. Thus, prophage-encoded anti-phage defences must block propagation of external phages without inhibiting the spread of the prophages that encode them. Here we identify HepS—an abortive infection system encoded on the Gifsy-1 prophage constituted of a single HEPN domain protein—which restricts phages of the Siphoviridae family. We demonstrate that in its native host context of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, HepS both senses phage infection and enacts abortive infection. Structures of HepS reveal a tetrameric nuclease complex that undergoes allosteric activation upon recognition of Siphoviridae tail tip proteins during production of new phage particles. Once activated, HepS cleaves specific transfer RNA anticodon loops and arrests phage replication. Gifsy-1, a Siphoviridae itself, evades self-targeting by expressing a tail tip variant that does not trigger HepS, as do co-resident Siphoviridae prophages Gifsy-2 and Gifsy-3. This evasion permits Gifsy-1 to spread despite encoding HepS. These findings reveal a mechanism by which a prophage defends the host while maintaining its propagation abilities.",

          "abstract": "Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve more than 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding1, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. Here, in response, we introduce Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be an expert-level closed-ended academic benchmark with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable but cannot be quickly answered by internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a marked gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.",

          "abstract": "The Stoner–Wohlfarth antiferromagnet (AFM), an extension of the classical Stoner–Wohlfarth model originally describing the magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic nanoparticles1,2, refers to a single-domain AFM whose Néel vector can be coherently switched by the magnetic field. These AFMs not only retain the inherent advantages of antiferromagnetism but also feature controllable Néel vector and a perfect switching ratio, thus emerging as promising building blocks for ultradense magnetic memories and high-throughput computing systems3,4. However, bulk AFMs are not the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs owing to the hard-to-switch Néel vector and inevitable multidomain structure3,5,6,7. Here we report that CrPS4, a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) A-type AFM, exhibits ideal characteristics of the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs, because of the dominance of antiferromagnetic exchange over the magnetic anisotropy and high quality of vdW interfaces. The antiferromagnetic order undergoes a ferromagnet (FM)-like binary switching with the magnetic field rather than the layer-by-layer flipping observed in other 2D A-type AFMs. Moreover, we deduce the characteristic exchange length of several vdW A-type AFMs and propose a criterion for judging the Stoner–Wohlfarth AFMs. Our work therefore establishes a universal framework for understanding the magnetization reversal in layered AFMs and promotes the effective use of 2D AFMs in advanced spintronic devices.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic genome replication is surveyed by the S-phase checkpoint, which coordinates sequential origin activation to prevent the exhaustion of poorly defined, rate-limiting replisome components 1–3 . Here we show that excessive origin firing saturates chromatin-bound proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)—a sliding clamp for DNA polymerase processivity and Okazaki fragment processing 4 —thereby restricting further PCNA loading and lagging-strand synthesis when checkpoint control is lost. PCNA-associated factor 15 (PAF15) emerges as a dosage-sensitive regulator of this process 5–9 . During unperturbed S phase, the entire soluble PAF15 pool binds to chromatin, leaving no reserve to stabilize PCNA under conditions of excessive origin activation. PAF15 binds to PCNA specifically on the lagging strand through a high-affinity PIP motif and occupies the DNA-encircling channel, protecting the clamp and associated enzymes from premature unloading by the ATAD5–RFC complex. Conversely, overexpression of PAF15 or forced redistribution to the leading strand disrupts replisome progression and induces cell death. These detrimental effects are mitigated by Timeless–Claspin, which blocks PAF15–PCNA binding on the leading strand. E2F4-mediated repression fine-tunes PAF15 expression to ensure optimal dosage and strand specificity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized replisome constraint: when PAF15–PCNA assemblies are exhausted, the S-phase checkpoint globally restricts origin activation, linking a strand-specific rate-limiting mechanism to global replication dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Cambrian Burgess Shale-type (BST) fossil biotas document nearly complete snapshots of the oldest Phanerozoic marine ecosystems1,2,3,4. However, the rarity of deposits bearing high-diversity BST biotas5 has restricted our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the Cambrian explosion. Here we report the Huayuan biota—a lower Cambrian (Stage 4, approximately 512 million years ago) BST Lagerstätte from an outer shelf, deep-water setting of the Yangtze Block in Hunan, South China. The Huayuan biota yields remarkable taxonomic richness, comprising 153 animal species of 16 phylum-level clades dominated by arthropods, poriferans and cnidarians, among which 59% of species are new. The biota is comprised overwhelmingly of soft-bodied forms that include preserved cellular tissues. The complex ecosystem contained diverse radiodonts and pelagic tunicates, filling a gap of high-diversity BST biotas from the Cambrian Stage 4. Critically, multivariate ordination based on a global dataset of Cambrian BST biotas places the Huayuan biota within a main transition of marine animal ecosystems between Cambrian Age 3 and Age 4. Network analysis reveals close faunal connections between the Huayuan and Burgess Shale biotas, indicating transoceanic dispersal. Dated shortly after the Sinsk event6,7,8, the Huayuan biota illuminates differences in the impacts of this extinction in shallow- versus deep-water settings during the first Phanerozoic mass extinction and offers critical insights into the transformation of global ecosystems in the early Cambrian.",

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters, the Universe’s largest halo structures, are filled with an X-ray-emitting gas with a temperature between 10 million and 100 million degrees. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures1,2,3. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematics remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of energy conversion within clusters4. High-resolution spectral mapping with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observatory5 offers a way forward6,7. Here we present XRISM kinematic measurements of the Perseus cluster, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner approximately 60 kpc, probably associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, SMBH feedback drives gas motions, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could have a substantial role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources to robustly characterize the velocity fields and their role in the evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for SMBH feedback models.",

          "abstract": "The invention of the laser transformed optics by providing intense, coherent light in the visible region, but extending this concept to X-rays has been hindered by a lack of suitable gain media and mirrors. Current hard X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities 1–5 overcome this by amplifying shot noise from a high-peak-current electron bunch via self-amplified spontaneous emission 6 in a single pass through long undulators, delivering very high brightness but with a noisy, multi-spiked temporal and spectral profile. Cavity-based XFELs (CBXFELs) 7–9 were proposed to close this gap by recirculating spectrally filtered X-ray pulses in a Bragg-reflecting cavity synchronized to a high-repetition-rate electron beam. Here we show lasing with multi-pass gain at 6.952 keV in a 132.8-m round-trip diamond-based Bragg cavity 10 at the European XFEL, matched to the 2.23-MHz bunch spacing of the superconducting accelerator 5 . Under stringent length and angular stability requirements, a ring-up in the cavity across successive bunches was observed, producing spectrally pure, microjoule-level pulses. This establishes the feasibility of CBXFELs in an accelerator environment and validates diamond Bragg optics for X-ray resonators. The demonstrated spectral purity opens a path to next-generation X-ray science, which demands highly coherent, stable sources.",

          "abstract": "During infection, many RNA viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), form specialized biomolecular condensates, viral factories (VFs), where viral transcription and replication occur1,2. Paradoxically, high protein concentrations are typically required for condensate nucleation3, yet attaining sufficient protein levels in infection is thought to require VFs for viral transcription and replication. Here, to uncover how viruses solve this paradox to establish VFs, we visualized early infection of RSV in real time with single genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) resolution. Our results reveal that VFs are nucleated from infecting vRNPs rather than de novo in the cytoplasm. VF nucleation further requires in-virion pre-assembly of viral protein–protein interaction networks on vRNPs to form ‘pre-replication centres’ (PRCs). PRCs are potent condensate nucleation seeds due to their efficient recruitment and retention of viral proteins. The high affinity of PRCs also results in increased association of the viral polymerase and its co-factors, allowing efficient viral transcription even in the absence of VFs. Together, these activities create a feed-forward loop that drives rapid VF formation. PRC assembly depends on in-virion viral protein levels and is highly heterogeneous among virions, explaining cell-to-cell heterogeneity in infection progression, and identifying heterogeneous virions as an important origin of infection heterogeneity. Together, our results show that in-virion pre-assembly of PRCs kick-starts viral condensate nucleation upon host-cell entry and explains cell-to-cell heterogeneity in RSV infection.",

However, existing methods face challenges in fabricating intricate 3D architectures from a diverse range of materials beyond conventional polymers. Here we introduce a universal 3D microfabrication/nanofabrication strategy compatible with a broad range of materials by precisely manipulating optofluidic interactions within a confined 3D space, enabling the creation of volumetric, free-form 3D microstructures/nanostructures. A femtosecond-laser-induced heating spot generates a localized thermal gradient, providing precise spatiotemporal control over optofluidic interactions of the nanoparticle-laden dispersions. This enables the rapid and highly localized assembly of nanoparticles with diverse shapes and compositions—including metals, metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials and quantum dots—into complex 3D microstructures. To demonstrate its versatility, we fabricate multifunctional microdevices, such as 3D microfluidic valves with size-selective sieving functionality, achieving fast separation of microparticles/nanoparticles with distinct dimensions, as well as microrobots integrated with four distinct functional materials, achieving multimodal locomotion powered by different external stimuli. This optofluidic 3D microfabrication/nanofabrication method unlocks new opportunities for advanced material innovation and miniaturized device development, paving the way for broad applications in colloidal robotics 7 , microphotonics/nanophotonics, catalysis and microfluidics.",

Here we compared psychedelics and their non-hallucinogenic analogues (nHAs) using in vitro and in vivo approaches, finding that 5-HT2AR-mediated non-canonical Gi signalling is essential for hallucinogenic effect. We further presented five cryo-electron microscopy structures of 5-HT2AR–Gi/Gq in complex with psychedelics or nHAs. Structural analysis and pharmacological investigation revealed that a special contact between nHAs with 5-HT2AR mediated the signalling bias. Building on this insight, we identified a 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine derivative, DOI-NBOMe, which exhibits potent and selective Gq-biased activity, and demonstrates promising therapeutic effects in mouse models without hallucinogenic effect.

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure1. Studying their progenitors, protoclusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. However, detecting protoclusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization2,3,4. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations located several protocluster candidates by identifying overdensities of z ≳ 5 galaxies5,6,7,8,9. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a protocluster, JADES-ID1, at z ≈ 5.68, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of \\({L}_{{\\rm{bol}}}=(1.{5}_{-0.6}^{+0.5})\\times 1{0}^{44}\\,{\\rm{erg}}\\,{{\\rm{s}}}^{-1}\\) and infer a total gravitating mass of \\({M}_{500}=(1.{8}_{-0.7}^{+0.6})\\times 1{0}^{13}\\,{M}_{\\odot }\\), making this system a progenitor of today’s most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as z ≈ 5.7. Also, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely10, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.",

Although primary infection is often subclinical, persistent EBV infection can drive immune dysregulation and long-term complications. Despite the ubiquity of infection, the determinants of EBV persistence following primary exposure remain poorly understood, although human genetic variation partially contributes to this phenotypic spectrum 1–3 . Here we demonstrate that existing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of human populations can be used to quantify persistent EBV DNA. Using WGS and health record data from the UK Biobank ( n = 490,560) and All of Us ( n = 245,394), we uncover reproducible associations between blood-derived EBV DNA quantifications and respiratory, autoimmune, neurological and cardiovascular diseases. We evaluate genetic determinants of persistent EBV DNA via genome association studies, revealing heritability enrichment in immune-associated regulatory regions and protein-altering variants in 148 genes. Single-cell and pathway level analyses of these loci implicate variable antigen processing as a primary determinant of EBV DNA persistence. Further, relevant gene programs were enriched in B cells and antigen-presenting cells, consistent with their roles in viral reservoir and clearance. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping and predicted viral epitope presentation affinities implicate major histocompatibility complex class II variation as a key modulator of EBV persistence. Together, our analyses demonstrate how re-analysis of human population-scale WGS data can elucidate the genetic architecture of viral DNA persistence, a framework generalizable to the broader human virome 4 .",

Here we functionally examined how the cortical song premotor region HVC, which is necessary for zebra finch song1, controls the sequential production of learned song syllables. We found that HVC could generate the complete sequence of learned song syllables independently of its main synaptic input pathways. Thalamic input to HVC was needed for song initiation, but it was not required for transitions between syllables or for song completion. We showed that excitation of HVC neurons during song reliably caused vocalizations to skip back to the beginning of the song, in a manner reminiscent of a skipping record. This restarting of syllable sequences could be induced at any moment of the song and relied on local circuits within HVC. We identified and computationally modelled a synaptic network, including intratelencephalic premotor and corticostriatal neurons within HVC that are essential for completing song syllable sequences. Together, our results show that the learned zebra finch song is controlled by a cortical sequence-generating network in HVC that, once started, can sustain production of all song syllables independent of major extrinsic input pathways. Thus, sequential neuronal activity can be organized to fuse well-learned vocal motor sequences, ultimately achieving holistic control of this naturally learned behaviour.",

However, how HSPGs mechanistically mediate signalling at the cell surface—particularly in the context of cell surface RNA—remain poorly understood. During developmental and disease processes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), a heparan sulfate-binding factor, regulates endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis3. The regulatory paradigm for endothelial cell-mediated selectively of VEGF-A binding and activity has largely been focused on understanding the selective sulfation of the anionic heparan sulfate chains4,5,6,7,8. Here we examine the organizational rules of a new class of anionic cell surface conjugates, glycoRNAs9,10, and cell surface RNA-binding proteins (csRBPs11,12). Leveraging genome-scale knockout screens, we discovered that heparan sulfate biosynthesis and specifically the 6-O-sulfated forms of heparan sulfate chains are critical for the assembly of clusters of glycoRNAs and csRBPs (cell surface ribonucleoproteins (csRNPs)). Mechanistically, we show that these clusters antagonize heparan sulfate-mediated activation of ERK signalling downstream of VEGF-A. We demonstrate that the heparan sulfate-binding domain of VEGF-A165 is responsible for binding RNA, and that disrupting this interaction enhances ERK signalling and impairs vascular development both in vitro and in vivo and is conserved across species. Our study thus uncovers a previously unrecognized regulatory axis by which csRNPs negatively modulate heparan sulfate-mediated signalling in the context of angiogenesis driven by VEGF-A.",

The superfluid phase has been observed in wide-ranging bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems1,2,3,4. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid—termed a supersolid5,6,7,8. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained unknown9,10,11. Here we report observation of a superfluid-to-insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons. Mapping the transport behaviour of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid on increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low-temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase.",

Many studies focus on parasite and vector ecology in isolation, neglecting the interactions between climate, malaria control and the socioeconomic environment, including disruption from extreme weather3,4. Here we integrate 25 years of African data on climate, malaria burden and control, socioeconomic factors, and extreme weather. Using a geotemporal model linked to an ensemble of climate projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP 2-4.5) scenario5, we estimate the future impact of climate change on malaria burden in Africa, including both ecological and disruptive effects. Our findings indicate that climate change could lead to 123 million (projection range 49.5 million to 203 million) additional malaria cases and 532,000 (195,000–912,000) additional deaths in Africa between 2024 and 2050 under current control levels. Contrary to the prevailing focus on ecological mechanisms, extreme weather events emerge as the primary driver of increased risk, accounting for 79% (50–94%) of additional cases and 93% (70–100%) of additional deaths. Most increases stem from intensification in existing endemic areas rather than range expansion, with significant regional variation in impact.

The roles of arterial baroreceptors in systemic physiology are well appreciated2, but the functions of vagal cardiac mechanoreceptors have been more difficult to parse, in part due to the closed-loop structure of the cardiovascular system. Here we use genetic tools in mice to identify a small group of neurons that are acutely sensitive to circulating blood volume and initiate a reflex that compensates for decreased filling of the heart in an upright posture and haemorrhage. Vagal PIEZO2 neurons form characteristic end-net endings in the heart, lower blood pressure in response to optogenetic stimulation and display blood-volume-dependent responses with every heartbeat that are time-locked to atrial and ventricular systole. Knockout of Piezo2 and/or ablation of PIEZO2 neurons in vagal ganglia eliminates this heartbeat-coupled nerve activity, causes orthostatic hypotension and compromises cardiovascular stability during trauma-induced blood loss. Together, these findings demonstrate that vagal mechanoreceptors monitor the cardiac cycle and initiate a blood-volume-dependent reflex that defends the constancy of circulation.",

Atomic electron tomography (AET) now provides a pathway to direct 3D atomic mapping in these materials25,26,27. Here we present a quantitative analysis of AET, showing how robust image preprocessing, denoising, projection alignment and normalization, advanced tomographic reconstruction, atom tracing, elemental classification and atomic position refinement collectively enable reliable determination of 3D atomic coordinates and elemental identities in amorphous materials. Using multislice-simulated datasets of amorphous Si, SiGeSn and CoPdPt nanoparticles under varying noise levels, our workflow outperforms an alternative approach28 in both positional precision and classification accuracy. For CoPdPt, we identify 95.1% of Co, 99.0% of Pd and 100% of Pt atoms, with corresponding 3D positional precisions of 29 pm, 12 pm and 6 pm, respectively, under realistic dose conditions.

The human organic solute transporter αβ (OSTα–OSTβ; hereafter referred to as OSTα/β) is a BA transporter that has a key role in the secretion and distribution of BAs3,4,5,6. Pathogenic mutations in OSTα/β have been associated with cholestasis7,8. Despite the functional importance of OSTα/β in BA homeostasis, the stoichiometry and assembly of the complex and the molecular mechanism that underlies BA transport by OSTα/β remain unknown. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human OSTα/β in complex with cholesterols and an endogenous substrate, elucidating the structural basis for the function of OSTα/β. OSTα/β is assembled in a novel dimer-of-heterodimers manner: two OSTα units form the homodimeric core, with two OSTβ units bound to the periphery. OSTα adopts the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) fold and contains a unique cysteine-rich loop with seven palmitoylation sites; these cooperate with transmembrane helices 5 and 6, constituting a BA recognition site. A positive cavity in OSTα connects the BA site and facilitates the transmembrane translocation of BAs through OSTα/β. Together, this study reveals the architecture and transport mechanism of OSTα/β and provides insights into the structure–function relationships of this crucial transporter in BA homeostasis.",

Taking advantage of inherent low sensitivity of a nuclear transition to its environment9, orders of magnitude more emitters can be hosted in a solid-state crystal compared with current optical lattice atomic clocks10. Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only simple thermal control11 are key to the development of field-deployable compact clocks. Here we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility of the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric for all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and centre frequency as a function of the doping concentration, temperature and time. We report the concentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition, limited by the intrinsic host crystal12 properties. We determine an optimal working temperature for the 229Th:CaF2 nuclear clock at 196(5) K, at which the first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in situ temperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the temperature-induced systematic shift below the 10−18 fractional frequency uncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition frequency is 220 Hz (fractionally 1.1 × 10−13) for two differently doped 229Th:CaF2 crystals over 7 months. These results form the foundation for understanding, controlling and harnessing the coherent nuclear excitation of 229Th in solid-state hosts and for their applications in constraining temporal variations of fundamental constants.",

High- T c materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model—a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice—is believed to capture the essential physics of high- T c materials 1–5 , obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging 6 . The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moiré WSe 2 (refs. 7,8 ), in which low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable 9–11 , presents a new platform for studying the high- T c problem. Here we tune moiré WSe 2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moiré unit cell ( ν = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high- T c phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at ν = 1, superconducting domes on electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states such as strange metals 12–14 . Twist-angle dependence studies further show that the highest T c always occurs adjacent to the Mott transition 3,15 . Our results indicate strong correlation as the key to superconductivity in moiré WSe 2 and establish a new material system for studying high- T c superconductivity in a controllable manner.",

          "abstract": "Early development across vertebrates and insects critically relies on robustly reorganizing the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs into individualized cells 1,2 . This intricate process is orchestrated by large microtubule structures that traverse the embryo, partitioning the cytoplasm into physically distinct and stable compartments 3,4 . Here, despite the robustness of embryonic development, we uncover an intrinsic instability in cytoplasmic partitioning driven by the microtubule cytoskeleton. By combining experiments in cytoplasmic extract and in vivo, we reveal that embryos circumvent this instability through two distinct mechanisms: either by matching the cell-cycle duration to the time needed for the instability to unfold or by limiting microtubule nucleation. These regulatory mechanisms give rise to two possible strategies to fill the cytoplasm, which we experimentally demonstrate in zebrafish and Drosophila embryos, respectively. In zebrafish embryos, unstable microtubule waves fill the geometry of the entire embryo from the first division. Conversely, in Drosophila embryos, stable microtubule asters resulting from reduced microtubule nucleation gradually fill the cytoplasm throughout multiple divisions. Our results indicate that the temporal control of microtubule dynamics could have driven the evolutionary emergence of species-specific mechanisms for effective cytoplasmic organization. Furthermore, our study unveils a fundamental synergy between physical instabilities and biological clocks, uncovering universal strategies for rapid, robust and efficient spatial ordering in biological systems.",

Here we introduce the cavity-array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements26,27, and instead uses a free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses28,29 to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micrometre-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom-array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom–cavity coupling and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fibre array as a proof of principle for networking applications30. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10-fold improvement in finesse.

In this context, a recent report describing the three-dimensional structure determination of an amorphous solid using atomic-resolution electron tomography (AET) is truly remarkable3. If validated, such an analysis would be groundbreaking. Here we address this issue and investigate whether and when AET can identify all or most atoms in an amorphous nanoparticle. By simulating AET, we reveal limitations on the structural and chemical information AET can determine from noisy electron images. For monoatomic nanoparticles, the structure can be determined with an atomic-position accuracy of tens of picometres under stringent fluence, sampling and projection requirements. For multi-element amorphous nanoparticles, chemical identification resolution is determined by noise and experimental sampling. Heavier atoms are more easily resolved than lighter ones, and large chemical analysis uncertainties emerge when atomic peak and background intensities overlap. Using these insights, we delineate nanoparticle size, composition, electron fluence and image sampling requirements for AET. The results serve as a benchmark for future experiment design and demonstrate a viable approach for amorphous structure determination validation using AET.",

The allergic state is typified by the presence of allergen-reactive immunoglobulin E (IgE), which triggers mast cell degranulation upon allergen encounter, manifesting in pruritis, oedema and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. Over the past century, the prevalence of allergic diseases has increased markedly, suggesting that environmental rather than genetic factors are mediating this change 2 . Although many hypotheses connecting environment to allergy exist 3–6 , the biological mechanisms that underpin environmentally mediated protection from allergy are unknown. Here we show, using a mouse model of allergic disease, that exposure to immunostimulatory environments generated cross-reactive adaptive immune memory, which tracked with obstructed type II immune responses upon allergen exposure. We found that engagement of cross-reactive adaptive immunity protected against future allergic sensitization and suppressed established allergic responses. Cross-reactivity in a tolerogenic context also prevented allergy, with the effect extending across antigenically complex exposures even at low protein sequence similarity. Our findings demonstrate a mechanistic relationship between environment and allergy, with general implications for adaptive immune function in natural settings.",

Ostα/β forms a symmetric tetramer of heterodimers, with each Ostα subunit showing a new seven-transmembrane fold, augmented by a single transmembrane helix of Ostβ. This architecture is stabilized by extensive lipid modifications, including a palmitoylated cysteine-rich motif that forms a lateral substrate-binding groove. The structures uncover a unique transport pathway featuring two substrate-binding sites connected by an amphipathic helix-gated conduit. This design, conserved in the evolutionarily related TMEM184 family, suggests an ancient mechanism for substrate translocation. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate voltage-sensitive, bidirectional transport driven by electrochemical gradients, elucidating the efflux role of Ostα/β in vivo. Lipid interactions, notably palmitoylation-dependent trafficking, emerge as critical for stability and function. These findings clarify the molecular mechanism of Ostα/β, provide a structural basis for disease-associated mutations4,5 and establish a paradigm for lipid-modified membrane transport.",

          "abstract": "Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing1. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks2–5. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters6, incorporating entanglement swapping4,7,8 and entanglement purification9–11 with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts12–25, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. Here, we demonstrate memory-memory entanglement between two nodes connected by 10 km of spooled fibre surviving beyond the average entanglement establishment time. This is enabled by the development of long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol26,27. As an application, we report a proof-of-principle device-independent quantum key distributio (DI-QKD) demonstration with finite-size analysis over 10 km and a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, with both distances exceeding previous work by more than two orders of magnitude28–30. Our work provides a critical building block for quantum repeaters and marks an important step toward scalable quantum networks.",

          "abstract": "Deep learning models that predict functional genomic measurements from DNA sequences are powerful tools for deciphering the genetic regulatory code. Existing methods involve a trade-off between input sequence length and prediction resolution, thereby limiting their modality scope and performance 1–5 . We present AlphaGenome, a unified DNA sequence model, which takes as input 1 Mb of DNA sequence and predicts thousands of functional genomic tracks up to single-base-pair resolution across diverse modalities. The modalities include gene expression, transcription initiation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, chromatin contact maps, splice site usage and splice junction coordinates and strength. Trained on human and mouse genomes, AlphaGenome matches or exceeds the strongest available external models in 25 of 26 evaluations of variant effect prediction. The ability of AlphaGenome to simultaneously score variant effects across all modalities accurately recapitulates the mechanisms of clinically relevant variants near the TAL1 oncogene 6 . To facilitate broader use, we provide tools for making genome track and variant effect predictions from sequence.",

          "abstract": "Effort is costly: given a choice, we tend to avoid it1. However, in many cases, effort adds value to the ensuing rewards2. From ants3 to humans4, individuals prefer rewards that had been harder to achieve. This counterintuitive process may promote reward seeking even in resource-poor environments, thus enhancing evolutionary fitness5. Despite its ubiquity, the neural mechanisms supporting this behavioural effect are poorly understood. Here we show that effort amplifies the dopamine response to an otherwise identical reward, and this amplification depends on local modulation of dopamine axons by acetylcholine. High-effort rewards evoke rapid acetylcholine release from local interneurons in the nucleus accumbens. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on dopamine axon terminals to augment dopamine release when reward is delivered. Blocking the cholinergic modulation blunts dopamine release selectively in high-effort contexts, impairing effortful behaviour while leaving low-effort reward consumption intact. These results reconcile in vitro studies, which have long demonstrated that acetylcholine can trigger dopamine release directly through dopamine axons6,7,8,9,10,11, with in vivo studies that failed to observe such modulation12,13,14, but did not examine high-effort contexts. Our findings uncover a mechanism that drives effortful behaviour through context-dependent local interactions between acetylcholine and dopamine axons.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary personality assessment relies heavily on psychometric scales, which offer efficiency but risk oversimplifying the rich and contextual nature of personality. Recognizing these limitations, this study explores the use of commercially available generative large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Claude and so on, to assess personality traits from open-ended qualitative narratives. Across two distinct samples and methodologies (spontaneous streams of thought and daily video diaries), we used seven commercial, generative LLMs to score Big-Five personality traits, achieving convergence with self-report measures comparable to or exceeding established benchmarks (for example, self–other agreement, ecological momentary assessment, and bespoke machine learning models). Although results differed across different LLMs, we found that using the average LLM score across models provided the strongest agreement with self-report. Further, LLM-generated trait scores also demonstrated predictive validity regarding daily behaviours and mental health outcomes. This LLM-based approach achieved quantitative rigour based on qualitative data and is easily accessible without specialized training. Importantly, our findings also reaffirm that personality is expressed ubiquitously, in that it is carried in the stream of our thoughts and is woven into the fabric of our daily lives. These results encourage broader adoption of generative LLMs for psychological assessment and—given the new generation of tools—stress the value of idiographic narratives as reliable sources of psychological insight.",

Here, to characterize mammalian information-processing architecture, we combine functional neuroimaging and anaesthesia in humans, macaques, marmosets and mice. We show that breakdown of information integration is a convergent effect of diverse anaesthetics across mammalian species. As the system disintegrates, brain dynamics become more difficult to control. Both effects are reversed upon re-awakening induced by thalamic deep-brain stimulation in the macaque. Regional breakdown of integrated information coincides with the species-specific spatial topography of PVALB/Pvalb gene expression. To provide mechanistic insight beyond correlation, we develop computational models for humans, macaques and mice that integrate species-specific connectivity and transcriptomic gradients, demonstrating their respective roles for controlling brain dynamics and information integration. We reveal evolutionarily conserved controllers of information integration in the mammalian brain.",

          "authors": "Pia Dietze, Riana M. Brown, Maureen A. Craig",
          "abstract": "“More than 1 in 8 LGBTQ people live in states where doctors can refuse to treat them.” This headline describes a flurry of laws passed in 2025 allowing doctors to refuse treatment of LGBTQ patients based on personal beliefs. This and other laws like it limit healthcare access and exacerbate health inequality for LGBTQ individuals. But health is not the only domain in which LGBTQ individuals face disparities. Long-standing inequalities also exist in other domains of life, for example, gay men earn up to 32% less wages than their heterosexual peers. In the current research, we ask if exposure to LGBTQ inequality in one domain (e.g., health) motivates more support for action than exposure to inequality in other domains (e.g., economics). In six experiments (five preregistered), we test our hypothesis that emphasizing health-based LGBTQ inequality (vs. economics and belonging) spurs engagement with and support for mitigating action (S1-2). We also investigate why people support action (S1a-1b) and what boosts support (S3a-3c). As predicted and preregistered, we find greater support for action to mitigate health-based LGBTQ inequality, compared to economics and belonging. This occurs, in part, because people blame LGBTQ individuals less for health (vs. economic) disparities and perceive health inequalities to violate morally sacred values, which is associated with greater perceived injustice. Finally, we find that connecting economic inequality to health inequality in individuals’ minds can increase support for mitigating economic inequality.",

          "authors": "Moradhvaj Dhakad, Erich Striessnig, Nandita Saikia, Samir K.C., Wolfgang Lutz",
          "abstract": "Preventing premature death is a global policy objective reflected in the SDGs. While numerous studies have found socioeconomic factors to be significantly associated with premature death everywhere in the world, the debate on the relative effect of such factors on mid-age (15 to 59 ages) has not received enough attention, particularly in low-income countries, where this question is pertinent due to scant resources in the healthcare sector. Using nationally representative, longitudinal data from the India Human Development Survey, we assess the relative importance of individual- and community-level education vs. income and wealth in India, where approximately 3 million premature deaths occur annually in mid-ages. We find a clear downward gradient in mid-age mortality with increasing education within each wealth category, whereas no consistent mortality advantage with increasing wealth status is visible within education subgroups. Multilevel logistic regression models show that the decline in the risk of death across the education spectrum by far exceeds (14% for male and 13% for female) the decline moving along the wealth distribution, even after controlling for other relevant demographic, socioeconomic, regional variables. Along with the direct effect of individual-level educational attainment, we also find a protective effect of education at the community level, particularly for women. Based on these findings, we infer that educational attainment is essential for reducing mid-age mortality in India. Population and health policies in developing countries, therefore, should focus on education to prevent adult mortality.",

          "authors": "Xiaomin Wang, Christian Hilbe, Boyu Zhang",
          "abstract": "When people collaborate in groups, they routinely face collective action problems: for the group effort to succeed, individuals need to cooperate despite any incentives to defect. These problems can be modeled with public goods games. To facilitate such an analysis, many studies assume the game is symmetric. Group members have the same means to cooperate (equal endowments), and contributions of different group members are equally effective (equal productivities). Studies that allow for some inequality tend to focus on one kind of inequality only. In practice, however, people can be unequal in many ways. The effect of these inequalities may in turn depend on the specific public goods game considered. To explore these issues, we combine a large-sample experiment with extensive theoretical work. We systematically vary four aspects: the group members’ endowments, their productivities, group size, and whether the public goods game exhibits linear returns or returns given by a threshold function. By exploring all four aspects, we obtain a unique dataset to explore the effect of asymmetry on cooperation. Based on this dataset, we study whether there is an advantage of “aligned inequality”: whether groups achieve a better surplus if more productive individuals have a larger endowment. For public goods games with linear returns, we find such an advantage, thereby corroborating previous research. If returns follow a threshold function, however, aligned inequality results in inferior payoffs. These results show that the effect of inequality on cooperation depends on the kind of public goods game considered.",

          "abstract": "When outgroups are present, adults may endorse ingroup choices that are at odds with their personal preferences, in an outward show of ingroup loyalty. Here, we examined whether 2-y-old toddlers ( N = 108) might already understand such shows of loyalty. In three violation-of-expectation experiments, toddlers watched interactions among a target individual, an ingroup member, and an outgroup member; group memberships were marked with novel labels. In the critical trials, the target individual chose between an ingroup- and an outgroup-associated toy. When the outgroup member was present during this selection process, toddlers expected the target individual to conform to her group’s norm and select the ingroup-associated toy, even when they knew she preferred the outgroup-associated toy. This was true whether or not the ingroup member remained in the scene; as long as the outgroup member was present, toddlers expected the target individual to select the ingroup-associated toy and no other toy. When the outgroup member was absent, however, toddlers expected the target individual to act on her personal preference, if any. They also held this expectation if no information was provided about group memberships. Together, these results indicate that by 2 y of age, toddlers a) construe individuals as possessed of both a personal and a social identity, b) understand that individuals may produce different actions in different contexts depending on which identity has precedence, and c) expect individuals’ social identity to take precedence in intergroup contexts even when it conflicts with their personal identity, in a show of ingroup loyalty.",

          "abstract": "Our adaptive immune system relies on the persistence over long times of a diverse set of antigen-experienced B cells to encode our memories of past infections and to protect us against future ones. While longitudinal repertoire sequencing promises to track the long-term dynamics of many B cell clones simultaneously, sampling and experimental noise make it hard to draw reliable quantitative conclusions. Leveraging statistical inference, we infer the dynamics of memory B cell clonal dynamics and conversion to plasmablasts, which includes clone creation, degradation, abundance fluctuations, and differentiation. We find that memory B cell clones degrade slowly, with a half-life of 10 y. Based on the inferred parameters, we predict that it takes about 50 y to renew 50% of the repertoire, with most observed clones surviving for a lifetime. We infer that, on average, 1 out of 100 memory B cells differentiates into a plasmablast each year, more than expected from purely antigen-stimulated differentiation, and that plasmablast clones degrade with a half-life of about one year in the absence of memory imports. Our method is general and could be applied to other longitudinal repertoire sequencing B cell subsets.",

          "abstract": "The removal of livestock grazers from historically grazed grasslands is widely proposed as a key strategy for the enhancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) for climate mitigation. Yet, accurate assessments of how grazer exclusion impacts SOC pools of differing stability are lacking, with most studies focusing on total SOC rather than the distribution of SOC within fast and more stable, slow-cycling pools. Here, we used 12 historically grazed grassland sites along an 800 km south–north gradient across the United Kingdom to test how particulate (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) pools were linked to long-term (&gt;10 y) exclusion of large domesticated grazers. We found that grazer exclusion was associated with relatively higher fast-cycling C pools, including plant and litter C, and to a lesser extent POC, but lower more stable, slow-cycling MAOC pools compared to grazed controls. Grazer exclusion was also associated with a marked shift in vegetation composition, with greater cover of ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) shrubs over arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) graminoids. This vegetation shift likely played a dual role in regulating SOC, contributing to higher POC via both the input of recalcitrant litter and by the enhancement of soil moisture and lower MAOC due to priming and decreased mineral protection of SOC. Our findings provide evidence that while the exclusion of grazers tends to favor fast-cycling C pools, it coincides with lower SOC persistence, potentially increasing the vulnerability of grassland SOC stocks to future climate change.",

Nuclear speckles, nuclear bodies enriched in RNA-processing factors, reposition around VRCs and undergo structural changes. While viral mRNAs are transcribed in VRCs and host transcription is largely suppressed, the nuclear routes used by viral and upregulated host transcripts and their relationship with nuclear bodies remain unclear. We show that immediate-early (IE) viral transcripts uniquely accumulate in nuclear speckles prior to export, unlike early or late transcripts, revealing a selective nuclear speckle-dependent pathway. Similarly, host mRNAs upregulated during infection traffic into nuclear speckles after transcription. Moreover, nuclear speckles are structurally remodeled, marked by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1 removal and increased dynamics of the nuclear speckle core protein SRRM2. Finally, we found that blocking mRNA export causes IE transcripts to accumulate in nuclear speckles and that nuclear speckle disassembly severely impairs IE mRNA export, preventing downstream viral gene expression. These findings establish nuclear speckles as dynamic regulatory hubs that selectively facilitate the processing and export of IE viral mRNAs during HSV-1 infection.",

Emerging evidence suggests that impaired microglial Aβ phagocytosis is a key feature in AD, highlighting the therapeutic potential of enhancing this innate immune function. Here, we demonstrate that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) ameliorated memory deficits and reduced Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we show that PTP1B was highly expressed in microglia, and its deficiency promoted a transcriptional shift toward immune activation and phagocytosis. Consistently, PTP1B deletion in microglia enhanced phagocytosis and energy metabolism, supported by increased AKT-mTOR signaling, a pathway essential for meeting the energy demands of activation. Mechanistically, we identified spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key regulator of microglial phagocytosis, as a direct substrate of PTP1B. Inhibition of SYK showed that PTP1B modulates microglial activation in a SYK-dependent manner. These findings established PTP1B as a critical modulator of microglial activation and a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

This study investigates the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the cytoskeleton-associated ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins through biochemical and structural characterization. A previously unidentified ERM-binding motif on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is identified, revealing that S-ERM interactions are specifically conserved among highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Functionally, these interactions facilitate S packaging into virions by directing it to assembly sites, utilizing ERM’s affinity for negatively curved membranes, akin to its role in cell surface protrusions. Silencing ERM expression significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 titer, highlighting its essential role in viral propagation. Additionally, leveraging the established role of COPI-mediated trafficking in S localization, a compound is developed to disrupt S-COPI binding, promoting S secretion to the cell surface and effectively reducing viral titers. Our findings revealed a critical host–pathogen interaction that drives S incorporation into virions and identified ERM proteins as key facilitators of coronavirus assembly. Furthermore, our study suggests an antiviral strategy by targeting the S-COPI trafficking pathway. These insights advanced our understanding of coronavirus–host interactions and provided a potential therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 and other highly pathogenic coronaviruses.",

While typically found in heavy element materials with large spin–orbit coupling, recent experiments on rhombohedral-stacked pentalayer graphene have demonstrated a longitudinal magnetoelectric coupling (LMC) without spin–orbit coupling. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of LMC in layered quantum materials and identify how it is controlled by a “layer-space” quantum geometry. Focusing on rhombohedral multilayer graphene systems, we find that the interplay between LMC and valley-polarized order produces a butterfly shaped magnetic hysteresis controlled by out-of-plane electric field: a signature of LMC and a multiferroic valley order. Furthermore, we identify a nonlinear LMC in rhombohedral multilayer graphene under time-reversal symmetry, while the absence of centrosymmetry enables the generation of a second-order nonlinear electric dipole moment in response to an out-of-plane magnetic field. Our theoretical framework provides a quantitative understanding of LMC, as well as the emergent magnetoelectric properties of rhombohedral multilayer graphene.",

We exploit the unique properties of our method to study in detail the nucleation mechanism, allowing us to detect and analyze the fluctuations that eventually lead to crystallization.

However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also corelease the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA corelease on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA corelease at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses corelease GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA corelease from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA corelease resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA corelease in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.",

How do these cells mitigate wound-induced stress and restore cellular homeostasis to promote regeneration? To address this question, we examined the role of autophagy—a conserved quality control pathway that recycles defective cellular components to sustain cellular homeostasis—in facilitating wound repair in plants. We demonstrate that transcriptional activation of autophagy-related gene 8 ( ATG8 ) genes is essential for de novo root regeneration, but dispensable for wound induced callus formation from an excised leaf. Plant-specific transcription factors PLETHORA (PLT) activate the transcription of a subset of ATG8 genes and function nonredundantly in this process. Disrupting the PLT– ATG8 regulatory axis severely impairs organelle turnover, resulting in increased intracellular stress and ectopic accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PLT– ATG8 mediated positioning of optimal ROS levels promotes the expression of stem-cell regulators for successful de novo root regeneration. Altogether, our findings illustrate how plants utilize kingdom-specific developmental regulators, such as PLTs, to activate evolutionarily conserved pathways, effectively managing wound-induced cellular stress and facilitating organ regeneration.",

Here, we identify specific sensory adaptations associated with the emergence of predatory feeding behaviors in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. While Caenorhabditis elegans uses contact-dependent sensing primarily to avoid threats, P. pacificus has co-opted this modality to support both avoidance and prey detection, enabling context-dependent predatory behavior. To uncover a potential mechanism underlying the evolution of P. pacificus prey perception, we mutated 27 canonical mechanosensory genes and assessed their function using behavioral assays, automated behavioral tracking, and a machine learning analysis of behavioral states. While several mutants showed mechanosensory defects, Ppa-mec-6 mutants specifically also impaired prey detection, indicating the emergence of a mechanosensory module linked to predatory behavior. Furthermore, disrupting both mechanosensation alongside chemosensation revealed a synergistic influence for these modalities. Crucially, Ppa-mec-6 is expressed in the environmentally exposed IL2 neurons that represent the first point of predator–prey contact. Moreover, silencing Ppa-mec-6 expressing cells induced severe predation defects validating their importance for prey sensing. Thus, predation evolved through the co-option of mechanosensory and chemosensory systems that act together to shape the evolution of complex behavioral traits.",

          "abstract": "Homomeric and heteromeric protein complexes are ubiquitous across all domains of life. The evolutionary transition from homo- to hetero-oligomers by gene duplication and chain specialization is widespread, yet it entails challenging requirements for maintaining oligomerization and functionality. Chain specialization in ferritins, which occurs in bacteria, vertebrates, and plants, is a salient example of this phenomenon. In heteroferritins, the two essential functions, ferroxidase activity and electron transfer, are split between two specialized chain types. Many heteroferritins assemble into complexes with variable subunit ratios, implying the existence of assembly rules that balance compositional flexibility with structural constraints. Here, we identify the assembly rules governing the organization of the heterobacterioferritin from Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense (MSR-1 Bfr) by analyzing its cryo-EM reconstructions. These rules consist of structural constraints that limit the number of possible arrangements and promote juxtaposition of the two, now separated functions. These constraints support compositional flexibility while preserving function, thereby providing resilience to stochastic variation in oligomer stoichiometry. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the assembly rules identified in MSR-1 Bfr are widespread across the Bfr family and coevolved with chain specialization. Together, these findings support leading models of hetero-oligomer evolution and reveal the emergence of order-exerting mutations that shape the organization of multimeric protein complexes while conserving function.",

However, their long-term fates and collective impacts on ecosystem nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and carbon (C) sequestration remain unresolved. Here, using a decade-long paired labeling ( 15 NH 4 + and 15 NO 3 − ) experiment in a temperate forest, we demonstrate that initially distinct fates of different N forms converged within 2 y due to low initial loss rates prior to organic incorporation. After 10 y, overall ecosystem retention was remarkably similar (55.3 to 65.6%) for both N forms. A process -based N-cycling model was built and parameterized by our 15 N recovery data and the model predicted declining ecosystem NUE with increasing N deposition level. We further identified a deposition-induced C sequestration potential of 41.41 kg C kg −1 N under an incremental deposition of 10 kg N ha −1 y −1 , exceeding prior estimates at comparable loads. This study provides mechanistic, high-resolution temporal data critical for refining N-cycle models and reveals an optimal N deposition range (20 to 30 kg N ha −1 y −1 ) that maximizes C sequestration while minimizing environmental risks (e.g., nutrient imbalance, eutrophication) in temperate forests.",

          "abstract": "DELLA proteins, members of the GRAS-domain family of transcriptional regulators, play a crucial role in plant growth and development. They modulate transcription indirectly via interactions with hundreds of transcription factors. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) triggers DELLA degradation, providing a mechanism by which plants can integrate developmental and environmental signals to regulate gene expression and optimize growth responses. In agriculture, DELLA mutations have been instrumental in improving crop performance. Most modern wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) varieties carry Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b alleles that encode DELLA proteins resistant to GA-mediated degradation, resulting in constitutive partial suppression of stem growth, a semi-dwarf stature, and lodging resistance. However, these alleles also reduce early vigor and nitrogen use efficiency, limiting their utility in some environments. Understanding how DELLA proteins regulate growth and development is, therefore, critical for refining breeding strategies. In this study, we identified the orthologous C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factors INDETERMINATE DOMAIN 5 ( IDD5 ) in wheat and SEMI-DWARF 3 ( SDW3 ) in barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) as positive regulators of stem and leaf expansion. Both IDD5 and SDW3 physically interact with, and act downstream of, DELLA proteins as key components of GA-mediated growth responses. Altered expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes suggest that IDD5 contributes to GA homeostasis in addition to growth regulation. Loss-of-function mutations in IDD5 and SDW3 confer a GA-insensitive semi-dwarf phenotype comparable in height to the Rht-D1b Green Revolution allele. In field trials, idd5 lines exhibited improved grain weight per spike but were lower-yielding due to reduced spike number.",

          "abstract": "The phage Mu C protein (MuC), along with core RNA polymerase (RNAP) and σ 70 , is required for transcription of phage late genes. We found that overexpression of MuC was lethal in Escherichia coli and observed that host replication was overinitiating under these conditions. Suppressors of MuC lethality mapped to dnaA , diaA , and dnaX . DnaA initiates replication at oriC , assisted by DiaA. Reinitiation is prevented by hydrolysis of ATP-DnaA to ADP-DnaA by Hda and DnaN (β-sliding clamp or Clamp). DnaX, the tau/gamma subunit of Pol III, is part of the Clamp loader complex. Coexpression of hda and dnaN rescued MuC lethality. This result suggested that MuC was interfering with either Hda or DnaN. We noticed that MuC contains two near-consensus Clamp-binding motifs (CBM), one at the N terminus and one at the C-terminus. Changing the consensus residues of either CBM abolished MuC lethality, abrogated MuC-dependent transcription, and reduced plaque-forming units. Inactivation of a ts Clamp through temperature shift specifically inhibited MuC-dependent transcription but not σ 70 -dependent transcription. We show that MuC interacts with the Clamp to activate late gene transcription both in vivo and in vitro. This study demonstrates the involvement of the E. coli Clamp, a processivity factor essential for DNA replication, for transcription by E. coli RNAP. We observed that members of the Mor/MuC family of transcription factors all possess at least one CBM, suggesting that engaging the Clamp for transcription is likely to be more prevalent than hitherto recognized.",

Although AGO family members have been extensively studied in animals and plants, where they are typically encoded by multiple genes, their function in brown algae, a diverse and complex group of multicellular algae, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the genomes of several brown algae encode only a single AGO protein, containing the conserved functional domains characteristic of the family. Using the model brown alga Ectocarpus and a combination of cell biology, genetic, and transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrate that AGO is essential for the transition from vegetative growth to sexual reproductive development and for germline establishment. Our results further suggest that AGO functions in concert with microRNAs to regulate target genes primarily at the posttranscriptional level, likely through translational repression. Ectocarpus thus represents a rare example of a complex multicellular organism that relies on a single AGO protein to regulate key developmental processes, pointing to a minimalistic model of RNA-based regulation in brown algae.",

Manipulating J-domain protein (JDP) chaperones, the most diverse family of chaperones, in a Drosophila neuronal circuit that encodes associative long-term memories, we identified yet uncharacterized JDPs that transduce sensory cues. One of these JDPs, CG10375, which we named Funes, enhances memory when overexpressed and impairs memory when functionally impaired. Funes overexpression enhances memory formation even when sensory stimuli are suboptimal. At the circuit level, Funes acts on neurons where conditioned and unconditioned stimuli converge to form associative memories. From a proteomic-based screen, we found that overexpression of Funes changes the solubility of a small subset of proteins, one of which is the mRNA-binding protein Orb2. Combining in vitro and in vivo biophysical, biochemical, and cryo-EM structural analyses, we found that Funes associates with oligomeric Orb2 and promotes the formation of translationally active amyloids. Perturbation of the conserved J domain eliminates the ability of Funes to facilitate amyloid assembly and promote memory. We posit that the brain harbors chaperones that influence memory by regulating physiological amyloid formation.",

Using a newly established geochemical database of 300 geological samples from 27 potential sources across Asia, we conducted trace-element analyses of 11 carnelian beads from the Sanxingdui pits (ca. 1200–1000 BCE), Sichuan Basin, southwest China. Canonical discriminant analysis indicates that the raw materials of these carnelian beads do not primarily derive from south China, but the Yanshan Orogeny, Central Asian Orogenic Belt and some unknown sources that might be close to Hexi Corridor, pointing to raw-material sources located over 1,000 km to the north of the Sichuan Basin. Comparative analyses of contemporaneous beads from Gansu, Shaanxi, and Beijing show similar northern provenance signatures, suggesting a broad and persistent exchange sphere spanning the southern Mongolian Plateau, Loess Plateau, eastern Tibetan Plateau, Central Plains, and Sichuan Basin between 1500–1000 BCE. Our results provide the earliest direct geochemical evidence for long-distance carnelian exchange in Bronze Age China and demonstrate the value of integrating geochemical sourcing with archaeological context to reconstruct ancient interaction networks.",

          "abstract": "Nonequilibrium selection pressures were proposed for forming oligonucleotides with rich functionalities encoded in their sequences, such as catalysis. Since phase separation was shown to direct various chemical processes, we ask whether condensed phases can provide mechanisms for sequence selection. To answer this question, we use nonequilibrium thermodynamics and describe the reversible oligomerization of different monomers to sequences at nondilute conditions prone to phase separation. We find that as sequences form, their interactions can trigger phase separation, which in turn enriches some sequences while depleting others. Our main result is that phase separation creates a selection pressure leading to specific sequence patterns when fragmentation maintains the system away from equilibrium. When fragmentation is slow, alternating sequences that interact more cooperatively with their surroundings are preferred. When fragmentation is fast, sequences with longer repeating motifs capable of more specific interactions are selected instead. Our finding that out-of-equilibrium condensed phases can provide a selection mechanism highlights their potential as versatile hubs for the evolution of functional sequences, a question relevant to the molecular origin of life and de novo life.",

          "abstract": "For proper segregation of chromosomes and successful cytokinesis, chromosomes must first “congress”—gather in a tight plate near the spindle equator. Molecular mechanism(s) of congression are not fully understood. Here we combine live-cell microscopy, perturbations of microtubule motor activities, correlative light/electron microscopy, and computational modeling, to quantitatively characterize the early-prometaphase movements that bring the scattered chromosomes to the equator in human RPE1 cells. We find that the early-prometaphase movements are directed toward the center of the spindle axis and not the spindle poles. Centromere velocity of the centripetal movements is not constant, with centromeres moving faster at larger distances from the spindle center. We also detect that numerous short microtubules appear at kinetochores at the earliest stages of spindle assembly and prior to chromosome congression. Computational modeling reveals that a mechanism based on brief, stochastic, minus-end directed interactions between the short microtubules protruding from the kinetochores and long appropriately curved microtubules within the spindle accurately predicts the observed distance-velocity function. Further, the model predicts that insufficient numbers of microtubules protruding from the kinetochores decreases the velocity and randomizes directionality of congression movements. These predictions match changes in the chromosome behavior observed in cells with suppressed nucleation of microtubules at the kinetochore corona (RPE1 Rod Δ/Δ ). In contrast, predictions of computational models based on continuous pulling forces at kinetochores differ significantly from the experimental observations. Together, live-cell observations and modeling reveal a mechanism that enables the efficient and synchronized arrival of chromosomes to the spindle equator.",

          "abstract": "The ATR/CHK1 pathway governs a crucial intra-S-phase checkpoint that safeguards genome stability under replication stress by stabilizing stalled replication forks and ensuring high-fidelity DNA replication. Traditionally, activation of this pathway is thought to rely on replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA, which recruits the ATR–ATRIP complex to sites of stalling fork, positioning RPA as essential for ATR signaling. In this study, we report a surprising and previously unrecognized phenomenon: acute depletion of RPA2 triggers robust ATR/CHK1 activation through an RPA-independent mechanism. Using 293A and RPE-1 cells engineered with an inducible RPA2-dTAG degron system, we observed increased phosphorylation of CHK1 at Ser296 and Ser345 in the absence of RPA. Notably, this elevated CHK1 phosphorylation was abolished by ATR inhibition, confirming its dependence on ATR kinase activity. Mechanistic analyses further revealed that this RPA-independent activation requires the checkpoint mediators RAD9 and TOPBP1. These findings uncover dual mechanisms, both RPA-dependent and -independent, of ATR/CHK1 pathway activation, highlighting a robust and flexible replication stress response network that preserves genome integrity even when canonical signaling is disrupted.",

Powering these systems with low-energy photons is essential for their future applications, since visible light, compared to UV light, is less damaging and offers more selective isomerization with higher penetration depth. However, the construction of visible light-responsive porous materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the construction of a series of visible-light-responsive porous aromatic switchable framework materials grafted with o -fluoroazobenzene pendants ( Azo-PSFs ). The materials exhibit high microporosity and reversible photoswitching upon irradiation with visible light. The highly robust materials can be cycled between two distinct states multiple times without showing any photo fatigue or decomposition. Remarkably, solid-state NMR revealed that the azobenzene moiety undergoes reversible bulk isomerization in the framework. The isomerization of azobenzene within the framework is associated with substantial changes in adsorption capacity and CO 2 uptake-release by the material. This work presents the example of visible-light-triggered bulk isomerization in an azobenzene-based porous material, providing a benchmark characterization of photoresponsive systems and paving the way for the future advancements in light-driven materials.",

          "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (αS) plays a central role in several neurodegenerative diseases. Although predominantly neuronal, αS is also present in peripheral fluids such as serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it may contribute to disease propagation. However, its extracellular interactions remain poorly understood. By combining in situ NMR spectroscopy and bottom–up MS proteomics, we reveal that monomeric αS exhibits distinct interactomes in serum versus CSF. Both N- and C-terminal αS regions bind to serum components, while in CSF, αS remains largely unbound. The N- and C-terminal interactions are mechanistically diverse: C-terminal binding is electrostatic, whereas N-terminal interactions persist under high ionic strength, implicating hydrophobic interactions. Deletion of the first ten N-terminal residues, which include several hydrophobic side chains, abolishes these interactions, highlighting their functional importance. Proteomic profiling and NMR validation identify key αS serum partners, including albumin, γ-globulins, and lipoproteins, which, together, are sufficient to recapitulate the serum αS interactome and elicit redundant interactions with the αS N-terminal region. Despite such redundancy, αS methionine oxidation selectively disrupts N-terminal binding, suggesting a redox-sensitive mechanism regulating the αS extracellular interactome. Notably, C-terminal interactions are preserved when the N-terminal binding is detuned, indicating that the N- and C-termini elicit independent interactions with the extracellular matrix, a marked difference from the intracellular milieu. These findings uncover dynamic and fluid-specific αS interaction signatures, offering new molecular insights into its peripheral roles and identifying potential new epitopes as synucleinopathy biomarkers. These results are also relevant for other amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), for which αS serves as a prototype.",

In contrast, data are lacking on the Antarctic Ice Sheet’s (AIS) effect on Southern Ocean overturning, despite the Southern Ocean’s central role in ventilating the ocean interior. Here, we present diatom-bound nitrogen isotope evidence indicating that during deglaciations, as wind-driven upwelling in the open Antarctic Ocean increased, AIS melting strengthened density stratification in the polar Antarctic Ocean. This change coincides with reconstructions of meltwater discharge and resembles model simulations of global warming including AIS meltwater forcing. The transient input of freshwater and, thus, buoyancy weakened Southern Ocean’s “lower cell” that outcrops in the polar Antarctic Ocean even as open Antarctic Ocean’s “upper cell” strengthened. Given evidence that deep-ocean ventilation and CO 2 release were ongoing early in deglaciation, our data suggest that the open Antarctic Ocean, and not solely the most polar Antarctic Ocean, can directly ventilate the deep ocean. During the last deglaciation, the strongest density stratification in the polar Antarctic Ocean occurred just before the Antarctic Cold Reversal, when southern hemisphere warming paused and the northern hemisphere warmed sharply (i.e., during the Bølling–Allerød period). We propose that when combined with stronger wind-driven upwelling, the freshwater-driven redirection of upwelled water away from deep water formation and toward the upper cell deepened the global pycnocline, working to restart North Atlantic deep water formation in the Bølling–Allerød period. If so, polar ocean freshening in both hemispheres drove the “bipolar seesaw” events of deglaciation.",

The nuclear receptors REV-ERB-α ( Nr1d1 ) and REV-ERB-β ( Nr1d2 ) are components of the core circadian clock which regulate metabolism, neuroinflammatory responses, synaptic pruning, and protein aggregation, though the cell type–specific effects and relative compensatory effects of REV-ERB-α AND -β in the brain are unknown. To study the CNS functions of REV-ERBs, we developed mouse lines with global or astrocyte-specific, conditional knockout of both REV-ERB-α and -β. We demonstrate that inducible postnatal global deletion of both REV-ERB-α and -β unmasks extensive transcriptional changes in the brain in disease-relevant pathways such as protein catabolism, complement, and oxidative stress which are not observed with REV-ERB-α deletion alone, and drives spontaneous astrocyte reactivity. Astrocyte-specific deletion of REV-ERB-α/-β recapitulates this spontaneous astrocyte reactivity phenotype, indicating that REV-ERBs regulate astrocyte activation in a cell-autonomous manner downstream of the core circadian clock. Upstream transcription factor analysis revealed that REV-ERB-α/-β repress transcription of Stat3 , and astrocytic deletion of REV-ERBs induced astrocytic STAT3 expression and downstream STAT3-mediated gene expression, providing a mechanistic link to the astrocyte reactivity shift. Dual REV-ERB deletion enhanced astrocyte alpha-synuclein uptake and protein degradation in vitro and mitigated alpha-synuclein spreading pathology in an in vivo model of Parkinson’s Disease. This study reveals REV-ERBs as regulators of astrocyte function and implicates astrocyte REV-ERBs as potential therapeutic targets to prevent synucleinopathies and other neurodegenerative pathologies.",

          "abstract": "CD4 + helper T cells are essential for controlling viral infections. During chronic LCMV infection, CD4 + T cells differentiate into heterogeneous populations, including a TCF-1 hi progenitor subset that serves as a reservoir to continuously replenish type 1 helper (Th1) and follicular helper (Tfh) T cells. The gradual loss of CD4 + Th1 cell responses impairs the immune system’s ability to control viral replication and contributes to the development of CD8 + T cell exhaustion. However, the mechanisms directing Th1 differentiation and the factors underlying their progressive decline during chronic infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we delineate the stepwise differentiation trajectory of Th1 cells, tracing their progression from TCF-1 hi progenitors through an intermediate state to fully differentiated Th1 cells. We identify an intermediate CD4 + T cell subset that serves as a precursor to Th1 cells, demonstrate that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling suppresses the transition from the progenitor to intermediate state, whereas the chromatin-remodeling complex PBAF restricts the terminal differentiation of CD4 + T cells into the Th1 subset. Notably, the combined blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and genetic ablation of PBAF component (ARID2) additively enhanced Th1 differentiation and maintenance, leading to effective viral control. Thus, targeting these mechanisms driving CD4 Th1 cell differentiation and maintenance could enhance therapeutic strategies to restore Th1 function and control chronic infection.",

          "abstract": "Repeated games and stochastic games are important frameworks to study direct reciprocity. Individuals react strategically to their coplayers’ previous behavior. While strategies in such games can be arbitrarily complex, explorations of evolutionary dynamics are often done in specific strategy spaces. Individuals may consider a fixed number of past rounds, or only some of the partner’s previous actions. Such restrictions can make the interpretation of the results difficult. Strategies found to be superior within a restricted set may lose stability when more complex strategies are permitted. We discuss two notions of completeness that rule out this possibility. If a strategy space, S, is best-reply-complete, then any strategy in S is guaranteed to have a best reply in S. If a space, S, is payoff-complete, then any strategy playing against an opponent in S can be replaced by an equivalent strategy within S without affecting either player’s payoff. Sufficient conditions for best-reply-completeness have been given in a seminal paper by Levínský et al. Here, we show that for strategies of bounded memory, the same conditions are sufficient for payoff-completeness. Furthermore, using those conditions, we illustrate how to construct many complete spaces for simple games. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of complete strategy spaces, which are particularly useful when interpreting evolutionary simulations and determining best responses.",

          "abstract": "An elastic spring network is an example of evolvable matter. It can be pruned to couple separated pairs of nodes so that when a strain is applied to one of them, the other responds either in-phase or out-of-phase. This produces two pruned networks, with incompatible functions, that are nearly identical but differ from each other by a set of “mutations” each of which removes or adds a single bond in the network. We generate ensembles of network pairs that differ by a fixed number, M , of discrete mutations and evaluate all M ! mutational paths between the in- and out-of-phase behaviors up to M = 14. With a threshold response for the network to be considered sufficiently fit for either function, so that nonfunctional networks are disallowed, only some mutational pathways are viable. We find that there is a surprisingly high critical response threshold above which no evolutionarily viable path exists between the two networks. The few remaining pathways at this critical value dictate much of the behavior along the evolutionary trajectory. The effect of multiple mutations is epistatic, that is, the impact of a mutation is not invariant but depends on what other mutations have already occurred. In most cases, the mutations break up into two distinct classes based on epistasis. The analysis clarifies how the number of mutations and the position of a mutation along the pathway affect the evolutionary outcome.",

          "abstract": "The Pliocene is the most recent epoch in which the Earth warmed under atmospheric CO 2 levels similar to today (&gt;400 ppm). The Pliocene then transitioned to the colder Pleistocene epoch, with the initiation of large-scale Northern Hemisphere glaciations. Although ocean temperature changes across these epochs are relatively well-known, quantitative estimates of the magnitude of land temperature change in the tropics are scarce. We provide a Plio-Quaternary quantitative air temperature record based on the distribution of bacterial branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) preserved in sediments of the Funza-II core in the Sabana de Bogotá, Colombia (~4°N). Using a refined age model based on new U-Pb zircon dates from ash layers, and a novel mixed-source model that disentangles contributions from lake- and soil-derived brGDGTs, we show that warm Pliocene (3.8 to 2.58 Ma) temperatures were 4 . 8 - 1.4 + 1.8 °C warmer than the last ~800,000 y of the colder Pleistocene. The evolution of Pliocene-Pleistocene temperature in our record largely mirrors long-term tropical sea surface temperature (SST) cooling, highlighting the linkages between sea and land temperatures in the low latitudes via greenhouse-gas forcing. The median amplitude of Pliocene-Pleistocene cooling in the northern tropical Andes exceeds that predicted by theory, highlighting the importance of regional feedbacks including lapse rate adjustments and/or changes in Pacific SST gradients to the long-term evolution of Andean temperature. This first quantitative terrestrial temperature reconstruction within 5° of the equator over the past 3.8 My highlights that both regional and global processes must be considered when constraining uncertainties for future warming scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Essential metals accumulate in the basal ganglia at elevated levels and induce incurable motor disease. But, unlike other motor diseases, the neuronal targets of essential metals are unknown, and this fundamental knowledge gap has limited therapeutic progress. Because metal efflux transporters have high specificity, we hypothesized that neuron-specific knockout or knockin (i.e., overexpression) of efflux transporters may alter metal levels in targeted neurons and define the neuronal targets of metal-induced disease. To test this, we focused on manganese (Mn)-induced motor disease, which is a public health problem. We generated six neuron-specific Slc30a10 mouse strains with knockout or knockin of the Mn efflux transporter Slc30a10 in dopaminergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic neurons. In the knockout strains, SLC30A10 was depleted and Mn levels were elevated in targeted brain regions. However, only dopaminergic- or glutamatergic-, but not GABAergic-, specific knockouts developed motor deficits without Mn exposure. Conversely, in the knockins, SLC30A10 was elevated and the increase in Mn levels after Mn exposure was attenuated in targeted regions. However, only dopaminergic- or glutamatergic-, but not GABAergic-, specific knockins were protected against Mn-induced motor deficits. Dopaminergic-specific Slc30a10 knockouts also exhibited deficits in dopaminergic neurotransmission that were consistent with their motor phenotype. Overall, 1) elevated Mn targets dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons to induce motor disease, and 2) neuron-specific knockout/knockin of efflux transporters is an effective strategy to isolate the neuronal targets and underlying mechanisms of metal-induced neurological disease.",

A primary in vivo target for GLOD4-mediated nitration is alpha-synuclein (α-syn), which is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related disorders. We document tyrosine nitration of α-syn by GLOD4 in vitro, in cells, and in a murine model of synuclein pathology. The data identified a function of GLOD4 and other structurally related proteins that catalyze the peroxynitrite-mediated selective protein tyrosine nitration.

The field oscillations induce a shaking of the orientation of the skyrmion lines, leading to a phase where the critical depinning current for translational motion vanishes. We measure the transverse susceptibility of MnSi to track various depinning phase transitions induced by currents, oscillating fields, or combinations thereof. An effective slip–stick model for the bending and motion of the skyrmion lines in the presence of disorder explains main features of the experiment and predicts the existence of several dynamical skyrmion lattice phases under shaking and pushing representing phases of matter far from thermal equilibrium.",

During this time, executive functions mature alongside pronounced structural changes in the brain, including reductions in synapse density. Computational models suggest that synaptic pruning enhances performance by stabilizing neural dynamics—deepening attractor basins and accelerating return to baseline after perturbation. Here, we tested these predictions using EEG data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized controlled trial of foster care as an alternative to institutionalized care. Trial-by-trial EEG residuals during a Flanker task were modeled as a linear dynamical system, and changes in eigenvalue magnitude were tracked across adolescence. Across all groups, eigenvalues decreased with age, consistent with maturation of recurrent computations. However, children with histories of institutional care exhibited consistently higher eigenvalues, suggesting delayed or disrupted refinement of the neural dynamics. Importantly, higher eigenvalues were associated with poorer behavioral performance on the task, linking altered neural dynamics to altered executive functions. These findings demonstrate that early deprivation leaves a lasting imprint on the developmental trajectory of neural dynamics, affecting the maturation of brain systems underlying cognitive control.",

          "abstract": "The general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is a conserved stress-responsive protein that plays a critical role in restoring cellular homeostasis in the integrated stress response (ISR). In response to amino acid starvation or ribosome stalling and collisions, GCN2 phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α, conferring translational control to alleviate stress. GCN2 is a multidomain protein, containing a tandem kinase domain (KD) and a catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain (ψKD). Stress-induced activation of the kinase domain requires allosteric regulation and dimerization mediated by its regulatory domains. While the pseudokinase domain is essential for GCN2 function in yeast, its mechanistic role remains unclear and underexplored in other organisms. Here, we present the first crystal structure of the human GCN2 ψKD, revealing its distinct structural features. The structure visualizes an insertion N-terminal to helix αC unique to the GCN2 ψKD that interacts with the pseudoactivation loop, stabilizing an inactive conformation. Further structural analysis shows that the ψKD forms a dimer in the crystal lattice via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions spanning both the N- and C-lobes. Mutations that disrupt the dimer interface reduced downstream ATF4 expression that is important for stress adaptation, underscoring the functional significance of the GCN2 ψKD dimer in regulating GCN2 activity. Complementary AI-guided structure predictions indicate that the dimeric GCN2 ψKD architecture is conserved across evolution. These results support the role of ψKD dimerization as a regulatory feature in GCN2-mediated ISR signaling.",

Although direct-acting antivirals have shown success, their efficacy is limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral variants.

Here, we identify by phenotypic screening a set of stereochemically defined photoreactive small molecules (photo-stereoprobes) that stereoselectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung epithelial cells. Structure–activity relationship–guided chemical proteomics identified the eukaryotic translation termination factor 1 (ETF1) as a target of the photo-stereoprobes, and this interaction was recapitulated with recombinant purified ETF1. We found that the photo-stereoprobes modulate programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection without causing ETF1 degradation, thus distinguishing the photo-stereoprobes from other known ETF1-directed small molecules. We finally show that the photo-stereoprobes also inhibit the replication of additional viruses with noncanonical ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms. Our findings identify a mechanistically distinct class of ETF1 ligands that implicate host translation termination processes as a potential drug target for antiviral development.",

While these profiles contain a variety of alkanes, the less abundant alkenes are crucial for nestmate recognition [F. R. Dani et al. , Chem. Senses 30 , 477–489 (2005)]. However, due to their carbon–carbon double bonds, alkenes can easily become degraded by oxidants. One of those oxidants, ozone, that usually reaches concentrations of 10 ppb in nonurban areas and ca 30 ppb in cities nowadays has been reported to often exceed 100 ppb in highly polluted regions, with levels above 200 ppb occasionally reported. Here, we show that short exposure to such elevated levels degrades alkenes in CHC profiles of all six investigated ant species and compromises nestmate recognition in five of them. Furthermore, a separate experiment with long-term exposure to such ozone levels corrupted brood care behavior within ant colonies, resulting in the death of larvae. The oxidizing pollutants like ozone have already been shown to corrupt interactions of flowers and their pollinators [B. Cook et al. , J. Chem.

While recent breakthroughs have led to the creation of synthetic microswimmers and nanoagents that can also self-propel, they still lack the functionality and sophistication of their biological counterparts. This study pioneers a mechanism enabling synthetic agents to autonomously navigate and make decisions, allowing them to solve mazes and transport cargo through complex environments without requiring external cues or guidance. The mechanism exploits chemo-hydrodynamic signals, produced by agents like active droplets or colloids, to remotely sense and respond to their environment—similar to echolocation. Our research paves the way for endowing autonomous, motile synthetic agents with functionalities that have been so far exclusive to biological organisms.",

          "abstract": "Body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys can achieve gigapascal-level yield strengths but typically are limited in tensile ductility (&lt;20%), contrasting sharply with elemental metals (the largest elongation of ~50%). Multi-principal-element alloys offer vast compositional space to reach synergistic strength–ductility combinations. However, combinatorial trial-and-error exploration is prohibitively costly, while machine learning (ML) approaches are hindered by data scarcity. Here, we develop an ML-guided framework integrating active learning with physics-informed Bayesian optimization to rapidly converge on optimal compositions. The resulting Ti 36 V 14 Nb 22 Hf 22 Zr 1 Al 5 alloy achieves a yield strength of 953 MPa and a large tensile ductility of 42%. The high strength arises from the substantial lattice distortion, as well as the ~1-nm-sized local chemical fluctuations (LCFs) inherent to the highly concentrated bcc solid solution. The ubiquitous LCFs also substantially promote dislocation multiplication and strain hardening, enabling a large tensile ductility. Our approach demonstrates ML’s efficacy in accelerating the finding of high-performance alloys.",

          "abstract": "When studying a complex system, it is often useful to think of the system as a network of interacting units. One can then ask if some properties of the entire network are already explained by a small part of the network, a network motif. A famous example of an ecological motif is exploitative competition in food webs, where the presence of two species competing for a shared resource precludes the existence of a stable equilibrium for the whole system. However, other examples of motifs with such direct impacts on stability are not known. Here, we show why small motifs that allow conclusions on systemic stability are rare. More importantly, we show that another dynamical property, reactivity, is typically rooted in motifs. Computing the reactivity of motifs can reveal which parts of a network are prone to respond violently to perturbations. This highlights motif reactivity as a useful property to measure in real-world systems to understand likely modes of systemic failure in food webs or other networks in epidemics, supply chains, or power grids.",

By alloying 20 atomic percent (at.%) hafnium into Ta thin films, we achieve a superconducting transition temperature (T c ) of 6.09 K as observed in direct current (DC) transport measurements, reflecting an increase in the superconducting gap. We systematically vary deposition conditions to control film orientation and transport properties of Ta-Hf alloy thin films. We then confirm the enhancement in T c via microwave measurements at millikelvin temperatures. We verify the ∼ 40 % increase in T c relative to bare Ta devices, while the loss contributions from two-level systems and quasi-particles remain unchanged in the low temperature regime.

          "abstract": "In mammals, passive acquisition of maternal immunoglobulins is essential for neonatal immune development and defense against infections. IgG, a central mediator of humoral immunity, is maternally transferred via distinct mechanisms depending on placental structure in placental mammals. In humans (hemochorial placenta), IgG is prenatally transported across the placenta, whereas in large domestic animals such as pigs and cows (epitheliochorial/connective chorionic placenta), IgG is exclusively transferred postnatally via colostrum and absorbed in the neonatal intestine. Rodents (allantoic chorionic placenta) employ both pathways. Critically, IgG must traverse multiple tissue barriers-including the placenta, mammary gland, and neonatal intestine-to reach the circulation of newborns. While FcRn is known to facilitate IgG transport in the placenta and neonatal intestine, the mechanisms underlying IgG secretion into milk remain unclear. Here, we identify FcγRIIB as the key transporter mediating maternal IgG transfer across the mammary gland in mammals. Using constitutive and conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that FcγRIIB deficiency impairs mammary IgG transfer, whereas its overexpression enhances milk IgG levels. Strikingly, in pigs, FcγRIIB is highly upregulated in mammary tissue prepartum, and its disruption abolishes IgG accumulation in colostrum. Our work opens avenues for improving neonatal immunity through targeted modulation of FcγRIIB-mediated IgG transport.",

In this study, we systematically analyzed the entire human surfaceome, identifying approximately 4,500 targetable sites and introducing potential binding seeds for initiating protein design applications. To validate these seeds, we implemented two experimental approaches (protein scaffolding and peptide cyclization) on three representative targets (FGFR2, IFNAR2, and HER3).

          "abstract": "The myosin superfamily encompasses over 70 classes, each with multiple subclasses, and exhibits substantial diversity in properties such as velocity, ATPase activity, duty ratio, and directionality. This functional diversity enables the specialized roles of each myosin in various organisms, organs, and cell types. Beyond these well-characterized parameters, a newly recognized property has recently come into focus: Certain myosins drive actin filaments along chiral curved trajectories. However, this newly identified property remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated this chiral motion in vitro using Chara corallina myosin XI ( Cc XI), which drives fast clockwise (CW) movement of actin filaments. This chiral motion arises from asymmetric displacement at the filament’s leading tip, and its curvature depends on the myosin density. Surprisingly, at elevated actin concentrations, filaments exhibiting chiral curved motion undergo collective dynamics, spontaneously forming a ring-shaped structure—termed the actin chiral ring (ACR)—that exhibits persistent CW rotation. ACRs display remarkable stability, continuing to rotate at their formation site until ATP is depleted, while maintaining their structure even after rotation ceases. This stability has not been reported among reported collective motions of cytoskeletal proteins driven by various motors. Our findings demonstrate that myosins with chiral activity can autonomously organize actin filaments into stable, chiral structures through collective motion, providing insights into actin self-organization by unconventional myosins. This paradigm offers a mechanistic basis for how motor-driven molecular asymmetry can give rise to coherent structural chirality at the cellular scale—an essential step in the emergence of cell chirality and asymmetry during development.",

Examining the dynamics of signal and noise correlations among neuron pairs in chronic calcium imaging experiments in the mouse auditory cortex, we investigate how activity-dependent, Hebbian-like plasticity and activity-independent, stochastic synaptic processes contribute to representational drift. We found that signal correlations predict future noise correlations, suggesting that stimulus-induced coactivation leads to increased effective connectivity between neuron pairs. Moreover, simple linear network models were able to account for the observed temporal dependencies between signal and noise correlations, but only if both Hebbian-like plasticity and stochastic changes of either inputs or recurrent synapses contribute to representational drift. In conclusion, our findings suggest that continuous sensory input–driven Hebbian-like plasticity can balance ongoing stochastic synaptic changes, thereby preventing the network’s functional degradation.",

While extensive research has focused on the prevalence of this vector-borne pathogen in natural populations, increases of human cases and clinical manifestation, and pathogen structure, little is known about the movements of B. microti within vertebrate red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs are nonmotile due to their lack of cellular structures for active movement. Here, we report a phenomenon in which B. microti –infected RBCs exhibit an acquired motility compared to uninfected RBCs. Using live-cell tracking, we observed a subset (around 1% in whole blood and 10% in 1:100 diluted blood) of infected RBCs displayed active movement. This acquired motility suggests that B. microti may induce host cell modifications that facilitate its survival, dissemination, or immune evasion potential, allowing it to successfully move through the blood and infect new RBCs. Our findings highlight unconventional RBC dynamics and a potential broad aspect of B. microti pathogenesis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon could provide insights into parasite–host interactions and reveal targets for therapeutic intervention in treatment and/or prevention of babesiosis.",

However, recent rodent studies suggest that medullary regions and local spinal circuits also contribute to forelimb execution, leaving it uncertain if these findings apply to humans. Critically, the dynamic interactions among medullary motor regions, intersegmental spinal networks, and cortical sensorimotor areas during hand movement control remain poorly understood. Here, through functional MRI (fMRI) studies in humans and mice during forelimb movement tasks, we reveal topographically organized corticomedullary networks, comprising the lateral rostral medulla (Lat-RM) and caudal medulla (CauM), that regulate forelimb movement. In mice, the corticomedullary coupling in both CauM and Lat-RM increased systematically along a ventro-medio-dorsal gradient, with the strongest links to primary motor and premotor cortices. In humans, higher‐order sensorimotor regions drove the strongest connectivity with CauM and Lat-RM, while the more medially located medial rostral medulla remained weakly engaged. Furthermore, simultaneous brain-spinal fMRI revealed distinct functional territories within the human C3–C4 cervical spinal cord, with ventral regions exhibiting strong connectivity to the medulla and dorsal regions to lower cervical segments. Together, our findings identify a conserved corticomedullary network underlying forelimb movement control across species, while also uncovering variation in cortical involvement. They indicate the presence of an indirect pathway involving both the reticulospinal pathway and the C3–C4 propriospinal system, which contributes to fine hand motor control in the mammalian brain.",

Studies on Shaker channels in Arabidopsis have provided a paradigmatic framework, but the rice genome encodes an additional member, OsKAT1, whose function remians poorly defined. OsKAT1-type channels are characterized by an innately short cytosolic C terminus, forming a unique clade of monocot-specific short Shakers that is prevalent in Poaceae species. In rice, OsKAT1 is predominantly expressed in the root stele. Disruption of OsKAT1 (KO mutation) leads to a significant reduction in K + secretion into the xylem sap delivered to the shoot. Patch-clamp experiments on root stele protoplasts of WT and KO plants indicate that OsKAT1 functions as an inward channel. Functional analyses in Xenopus oocytes reveal that despite activating at weakly negative voltages, OsKAT1 is intrinsically incapable of mediating substantial outward currents—a property attributed to its truncated C terminus. Together with outward K + channel activity, this feature enables stelar cells to remain significantly permeable to K + around the K + equilibrium potential. When expressed in Arabidopsis , OsKAT1 contributes to K + transport in the xylem sap, but only in wild-type plants that express SKOR, a Shaker channel specialized for this role. These results demonstrate that OsKAT1 constitutes a component of K + translocation to shoots and shed light on the energization and regulation underlying this function. Moreover, OsKAT1 is shown to improve rice adaptation to environmental conditions and enhance grain yield under field conditions through its facilitating root-to-shoot ion translocation.",

This trend is consistent with the previously published 2004 to 2021 value of –2.1 ± 1.2% per decade. A more careful analysis of uncertainty now provides a more robust likely (one-sigma) range. From analyses of a range of factors controlling the N 2 O lifetime, we find that the decrease in lifetime can be explained by recent changes in stratospheric circulation and temperature. Projection of the lifetime change to 2100 shows that this effect is comparable to differences across the shared socioeconomic pathways used for climate projections and cannot be ignored. An updated evaluation of the N 2 O chemical feedbacks shows that this effect produces a relatively small shift in atmospheric abundance over the 21st century, but still an important shift, –11%, in the global warming potential of N 2 O.",

Recently, error-correcting codes tailored for noise-biased systems have been shown to offer high fault-tolerance thresholds and reduced hardware overhead, positioning noise-biased qubits as promising candidates for building universal quantum computers. However, quantum operations on these platforms remain challenging, and their noise structures have not yet been rigorously benchmarked to the same extent as those of conventional quantum hardware. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum control toolbox for a scalable noise-biased qubit, detuned Kerr-cat qubit, including initialization, universal single-qubit gates, and quantum nondemolition readout. We systematically characterize the noise structure of these operations using gate set tomography and dihedral randomized benchmarking, achieving high local gate fidelities, with F [ Z ( π / 2 ) ] = ( 99.18 ± 0.066 ) % and F [ X ( π / 2 ) ] = ( 92.5 ± 0.23 ) % . Notably, the noise bias of the detuned Kerr-cat qubit approaches 250 with a phase-flip time of 4   μ s , which outperforms its resonant-Kerr-cat qubit counterparts as reported previously, representing a state-of-the-art performance benchmark for Kerr-cat qubits. Moreover, our results reveal a critical overestimation of operational noise bias inferred from bit-flip and phase-flip times alone, highlighting the necessity of a precise and direct benchmarking for noise-biased qubit operations. Our work thus establishes a framework for systematically characterizing and validating the performance of quantum operations in structured-noise architectures, which lays the groundwork for implementing efficient quantum error correction in next-generation architectures.",

          "abstract": "Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme that converts ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides, enabling DNA synthesis and repair in all living organisms. Central to class Ia RNR activity is a long-range radical transport pathway spanning ∼ 32 Å across the α and β subunits by a series of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Although the collinear PCET reactions in the α subunit have been extensively studied, the multisite, orthogonal PCET reactions in the β subunit are less well understood. This work focuses on orthogonal PCET between the redox-active tryptophan, W48, and interfacial tyrosine, Y356, in the β subunit. Multiscale modeling strategies are employed to explore this PCET reaction. The simulations show that radical transfer from W48 to Y356 is thermodynamically favorable and is likely to occur by electron transfer from Y356 to the W48 cationic radical in conjunction with proton transfer from Y356 to a glutamate, E52, which forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction with Y356 following oxidation of W48. The conformational gating motion of Y356 is shown to be critical for allowing this residue to participate in PCET with W48 in the β subunit and with a tyrosine in the α subunit. Application of vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory highlights the significance of hydrogen tunneling and conformational motions that shorten the distance between Y356 and E52. This work demonstrates how conformational gating, hydrogen-bonding networks, and hydration at the α / β interface modulate PCET in RNR.

          "abstract": "RNAs transcribed from protein-coding gene loci are widely assumed to be translated into proteins. However, intronic polyadenylation (IPA) occurring near the transcription start site or within early introns can generate noncoding RNAs derived from protein-coding loci. Despite their abundance, the functional roles of such RNAs remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated one such noncoding RNA, CUL1-IPA , transcribed from the CUL1 gene locus. Our study revealed that CUL1-IPA is an RNA polymerase II–dependent IPA isoform that is polyadenylated, stable, and translocates to the nucleolus. Functional characterization demonstrated CUL1-IPA to play a critical role in maintaining nucleolar integrity. RNA-protein interaction assay identified GPATCH4 and NOP58, nucleolar proteins involved in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing, as binding partners of CUL1-IPA . Consistent with its localization and interactions, loss of CUL1-IPA led to the reduction in rRNA levels and consequent decrease in overall protein synthesis. This effect on rRNA levels could be reversed by reintroducing CUL1-IPA , confirming its functional importance. Furthermore, as nucleolar stress is known to affect cell cycle progression, we found that CUL1-IPA loss resulted in G2/M cell cycle phase arrest. Moreover, reduced CUL1-IPA expression was associated with improved survival outcomes in cancer patients. Together, our findings demonstrate that CUL1-IPA , an IPA-derived long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), forms an RNA-protein complex in the nucleolus to support nucleolar structure and function. This study provides an insight into the biological function of a lncRNA originating from a protein-coding gene and highlights the broader significance of IPA-derived noncoding RNAs as regulatory molecules.",

          "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells may be engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to recognize tumor-associated antigens which bolsters their antitumor activity. More so than CAR-T cells, CAR-NK cell responses result from an integration of signals from a wider range of innate activating cytotoxic receptors, inhibitory receptors, and adhesion receptors in addition to the engineered CAR, making computational modeling of CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity more difficult than CAR-T cells. Uncovering mechanisms and predicting tumor cell responses to CAR-NK cytotoxicity is essential for improving therapeutic efficacy. The complexity of these effector–target interactions and the donor-to-donor variations in NK cell receptor (NKR) repertoire preclude the use of predictive models based on a single receptor, requiring function to be determined experimentally for each donor, CAR, and target combination. Computational modeling generates frameworks that allow the relationships of these factors to biologic outcomes to be explored without resource-consuming experiments. Here, we developed a computational mechanistic multiscale model which considers heterogenous expression of CARs, NKRs, adhesion receptors, and their cognate ligands, signal transduction, and NK cell-target cell population kinetics. The model is trained with quantitative flow cytometry and in-vitro cytotoxicity data and accurately predicts the short-term, long-term, and in-vivo cytotoxicity of CAR-NK cells. Furthermore, using Pareto optimization we explored the effect of CAR proportion and NK cell signaling on the differential cytotoxicity of CD33CAR-NK cells to cancer and healthy cells. This model can be extended to predict CAR-NK cytotoxicity across many antigens and tumor targets and serves as a tool to mechanistically explore CAR-NK signaling and biology.",

Yet, the decision-making mechanisms that underlie social foraging in the real world remain unknown. Integrating high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking and video footage from large-scale foraging competitions with cognitive-computational modeling and agent-based simulations, we show how foragers integrate personal, social, and ecological information to guide spatial search and patch-leaving decisions. We show how the social context emerges as a key driver of foraging dynamics. Foragers adaptively rely on social information to locate resources when unsuccessful and extend giving-up times in the presence of others, which results in increased area-restricted search at high social densities. These findings demonstrate the importance of sociality for human foraging decisions and provide a template for harnessing high-resolution tracking data to study real-world cognition.",

Metal-organic (MO) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers promise for scalable growth, but the reactions are kinetically limited, leading to nanometer-scale domain size and carbon contaminations. Here, we unveil the fundamental kinetic limitations and overcome them by introducing oxygen-assisted MOCVD (oxy-MOCVD) technology. By tuning reactions with oxygen, MO precursors are converted into high-purity transition-metal oxides and chalcogens, producing aligned molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) domains with a size and growth rate that are orders of magnitude larger than conventional MOCVD. The MoS 2 is free of carbon impurities and exhibits average mobility exceeding 100 square centimeters per volt per second. The scalability of oxy-MOCVD is demonstrated by 150-millimeter single-crystal MoS 2 wafers, proving the feasibility of industrial-scale production.",

          "abstract": "Terrestrial vascular plants operate under negative water potential, which results in hydraulic tension in the vascular system. Vascular tension varies with transpiration and soil drying and is regulated by stomata, pressure-activated valves on the leaf surface. We hypothesize that soil physical constraints drive convergence in the operational range of leaf vascular tension. Based on a meta analysis of 19 diverse species, we find that stomatal regulation of transpiration is activated when leaf vascular tension reaches a narrow target of 1.3 ± 0.6 megapascals. This value matches the range (1.4 ± 0.6 megapascals) predicted from an optimal soil water extraction model. Optimality in plant vascular tension appears to have evolved by selection for a narrow range of osmotic pressure in the leaves of diverse species growing across variable environments.",

This biocatalyst efficiently facilitates the formation of amide bonds between diverse aldehydes and amines.

This QP ceramic exhibited a d 33 of ~6850 pC/N, which surpasses commercial PZT ceramics by 10 to 30 times and commercial lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate single crystal by ~4 times. This exceptional property arises from the tricritical nature of the QP, a thermodynamic singularity that produces an ultrasoft lattice and enables complete polarization alignment in polycrystals.

In skeletal muscle, this decline is largely driven by impaired function of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to efficiently contribute to muscle regeneration. We uncovered a cause of this aging-associated dysfunction: a cellular survivorship bias that prioritizes stem cell persistence at the expense of functionality. With age, MuSCs increased expression of a tumor suppressor, N-myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), which, by suppressing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, increased their long-term survival potential but at the cost of their ability to promptly activate and contribute to muscle regeneration. This delayed muscle regeneration with age may result from a trade-off that favors long-term stem cell survival over immediate regenerative capacity.",

Simple model calculations show that high slip rates on the Kunlun Fault enable east-west extension to be distributed broadly across the relatively weak southern and central Tibetan Plateau.

In this work, we show that the short-lived model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits a loss of epigenetic integrity during aging, which causes DNA methylation decay and the expression of transposable elements. We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing life span and that shoot apical meristems are protected from these epigenetic changes. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging and that mutants of this program display a complete absence of epigenetic decay while physical aging remains unaffected.",

          "abstract": "Biological function is fundamentally determined by nucleic acid and protein sequence. Beyond encoding genetic information, nucleic acids also display complex physicochemical parameters that shape structure, dynamics, and interactions. Understanding how sequence variation sculpts the energetic landscapes underlying these properties requires methods that capture both molecular diversity and dynamic behavior. Single-molecule techniques are ideally suited to this task, but conventional formats remain time and cost intensive. Recent breakthroughs have enabled highly multiplexed approaches for observing molecular dynamics across millions of individual molecules representing thousands of sequences or barcoded entities. Though still in development, these methods have begun to bridge sequence, structure, dynamics, and function at scale, opening new opportunities in drug discovery, molecular diagnostics, and functional genomics.",

However, current estimates of heritability are low—twin studies show heritability of only 20 to 25%, and recent large pedigree studies suggest it is as low as 6%. Here we show that these estimates are confounded by extrinsic mortality—deaths caused by extrinsic factors such as accidents or infections. We use mathematical modeling and analyses of twin cohorts raised together and apart to correct for this factor, revealing that heritability of human life span due to intrinsic mortality is above 50%. Such high heritability is similar to that of most other complex human traits and to life-span heritability in other species.",

We identified core regulators of cell identity and developed sequence-based models that revealed conserved regulatory codes. By predicting chromatin accessibility across 240 mammalian species, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of human cis-regulatory elements, identifying sets associated with positive selection and gene expression changes, including the recent gain of THRB expression in cerebellar progenitor cells. Collectively, our work reveals the shared and mammalian lineage-specific regulatory programs governing cerebellum development.",

We identified a role for the metalloprotease SPRTN in preventing DPC-driven immunity and its pathological consequences. Loss of SPRTN activity during replication and mitosis lead to unresolved DNA damage, chromosome segregation errors, micronuclei formation, and cytosolic DNA release that activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. In a Sprtn knock-in mouse model of Ruijs-Aalfs progeria syndrome, chronic cGas-Sting signaling caused embryonic lethality through inflammation and innate immune responses. Surviving mice displayed aging phenotypes beginning in embryogenesis, which persisted into adulthood. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of cGas-Sting rescued embryonic lethality and alleviated progeroid phenotypes.",

We sequenced eight new Blattodea species showing stepwise contracted genomes. Woodroach brood-rearing remained constrained by deactivated oxidative phosphorylation and peroxisome genes, consistent with slow immature growth. Termites lost key genes mediating sperm motility, corroborating that reproductive division of labor required monogamous colony-founding. They also co-opted many genes from fundamental nutrition-sensitive juvenile hormone, insulin, EGFR and Dpp signaling pathways. Thus, most larvae develop as workers via high energy metabolism early on, while reproductive nymphs highly express energy metabolism genes late in development. These pathways are consistent with obligate dependence on provisioning by specialized workers and feedback loops allowing large homeostatic colonies to evolve.",

Drill cores and geophysical logs from International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 405 demonstrate that the megathrust preferentially develops at the top or base of the pelagic clay in the sedimentary layers present on the incoming Pacific Plate, where pronounced contrasts in physical properties occur. This preference results in a narrow, weak fault located at a major mechanical contact between frontal prism mud and subducted sediments, which enhances the tendency for shallow seismic slip, suggesting that the Japan Trench may be more susceptible to ruptures with large shallow slip than are margins without weak clays.",

Although the spatial compartmentalization of metabolic functions is critical for proper liver function, it is unknown whether cancers arise from some zones but not others and whether there are metabolic determinants of cancer risk. Zone-specific, mosaic introduction of Ctnnb1 (catenin beta 1) and Arid2 (AT-rich interaction domain 2) mutations, commonly co-mutated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in mouse models showed that position and metabolic context determine clone fates. Ctnnb1 / Arid2 -driven cancers were much more likely to arise in zone 3. The zone 3 genes Gstm2 and Gstm3 were required for efficient HCC initiation, in part through inhibition of ferroptosis. In the liver, the zonal determinants of HCC development can reveal metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer.",

          "abstract": "Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, yet the contributions of its components remain unclear, particularly across geographic regions and racial/ethnic groups. We extended the generalized weighted quantile sum regression model by incorporating two-way fixed effects (gWQS-feglm) to quantify PM 2.5 component–attributable CVD deaths across the contiguous United States. PM 2.5 component–attributable CVD deaths declined from 42,200 (28,200,57,600) in 2001 to 23,500 (15,700,32,100) in 2020, driven by ammonium (NH 4 + ) and sulfate (SO 4 2− ) reductions. In 2020, high-attributable-mortality regions remained and regional disparities in PM 2.5 composition pronounced, with NH 4 + dominant in California and the East North Central, SO 4 2− in the South, and black carbon and SO 4 2− in the Middle Atlantic. Racial/ethnic disparities persisted, with non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing slower attributable-mortality declines compared with non-Hispanic whites. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions based on components to address disparities in PM 2.5 -attributable burden.",

          "abstract": "Nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis (RNS) occurs in some eudicots, including legumes, and is regulated by the transcription factor NODULE INCEPTION (NIN), derived from the NIN-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) family. However, how the NIN protein acquired RNS-specific functions remains unclear. We identify a previously undescribed motif in Lotus japonicus NIN, located downstream of the RWP-RK domain, which we term the FR. This motif broadens NIN’s DNA binding specificity by stabilizing the RWP-RK dimer interface. nin mutants lacking the FR motif show defective nodulation and impaired nitrogen fixation. Arabidopsis NLP2 carries a NIN-type FR and shares key features with NIN. Furthermore, the NIN-type FR had already emerged before the divergence of gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages, suggesting that a specific molecular feature of NIN involved in RNS regulation was inherited from ancestral NLPs prior to the emergence of RNS.",

While neuroinflammatory changes are suspected in these patients, measurements of both central and systemic inflammation in the brain remain unexplored. We investigate whether the translocator protein standardized uptake value ratio (TSPO SUVr), a quantifiable marker of neuroinflammation using positron emission tomography (PET), is elevated in the brains of patients with post–COVID-19 active TLE. In addition, we examine correlations between TSPO SUVr and inflammatory factors to identify potential peripheral blood inflammatory predictors of post–COVID-19 active epilepsy. Our study highlights the presence of widespread neuroinflammation in the brain and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of individuals with post–COVID-19 active TLE. Furthermore, strong correlations between plasma levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-10, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and neuroimmune activation suggest the potential for integrating plasma inflammatory factors with TSPO PET as a dependable approach for clinical diagnosis, dynamic monitoring, and assessment of immune-based therapeutic efficacy in TLE-associated neuroinflammation.",

On the basis of the bichiral cholesteric liquid crystal modulator, different morphology information of the target can be extracted with a high signal-to-noise ratio, including the entire shape and its fine outline. The nematic liquid crystal, leveraging its electrically tunable properties, is explored to select specific polarizations of heralded single photons, enabling dynamic remote switching in trimode quantum imaging. To further improve the time efficiency, an ultrafast remote switching is presented on the basis of the appealing ferroelectric liquid crystals.

Here, we demonstrate an elaborate design of two-dimensional hexagonal zinc-containing metal-organic framework anchored on conductive titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) MXene sheets (MX/2D-Zn-MOF) as a three-dimensional lightweight host for anode-less 5 V–class LMBs. The abundant nitrogen/fluorine/zinc-rich lithiophilic sites effectively decrease lithium nucleation energy barriers, ensure uniform lithium deposition, and stabilize solid electrolyte interphase. The interconnected three-dimensional framework further guides uniform lithium deposition by spatially homogenizing lithium ion flux and reducing local current density as well as offers sufficient space to alleviate structural change, thus affording structural integrity against pulverization. As a result, the MX/2D-Zn-MOF host demonstrates uniform lithium deposition, reversible lithium plating and stripping behavior, and stable cycling performance (~1800 hours at 1.0 milliamperes per square centimeter and 5.0 milliampere hours per square centimeter). Impressively, the assembled anode-less 5 V–class lithium metal pouch cell delivers stable cycling performance and high energy density.",

Coherent wavefront shaping enables precise energy delivery but typically requires full knowledge of the medium. Here, we introduce a universal statistical framework for targeted mode transport (TMT) that circumvents this limitation and validate it on various platforms including microwave networks, two-dimensional chaotic cavities, and three-dimensional reverberation chambers. TMT quantifies the efficiency of transferring energy between specified input and output channels in multimode wave-chaotic systems. We develop a diagrammatic theory that predicts the eigenvalue distribution of the TMT operator and identifies the macroscopic parameters—coupling strength, absorption, and channel control—that govern performance. The theory provides explicit bounds for optimal TMT wavefronts and captures phenomena like statistical transmission gaps and reflectionless states. These findings establish design principles for energy delivery and information transfer in complex environments, with broad implications for adaptive signal processing and wave-based technologies.",

          "abstract": "Processing and detecting quantum states with high fidelity are essential for enabling quantum advantages across many applications. However, these states are known to be fragile because of their sensitivity to losses, their inability to be amplified, and their susceptibility to decoherence. This makes them far more vulnerable to noise than classical signals, limiting their out-of-lab deployment. We demonstrate quantum coherent energy redistribution, which not only recovers entangled states buried in noise but also improves their properties, moving toward noise-robust architectures with better deployability. Using standard telecommunications infrastructure, we show an order of magnitude increase in the coincidence-to-accidental ratio for time-bin entangled photon pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the revival of lost entanglement by recovering quantum interference visibility and fidelity from quantum state tomography measurements of qubits corrupted by noise.",

The synthesis of this library was achieved through a highly effective stereoselective α-galactosylation approach. Immunological evaluations revealed that octasaccharide 4 and its two subunit tetrasaccharides 7 and 10 exhibited potent immunoregulatory activities, demonstrating a notable domain effect. Preliminary mechanistic studies unveiled that these oligosaccharides exert their effects by suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.

Here we propose a principle of hyperelastic and omniadhesive gels composed of polymer networks with long dangling chains and sufficient good solvents. The molecules of good solvents screen off interchain interactions for hyperelasticity. The long dangling chains disentangle and adsorb to substrate for strong adhesion. We synthesized such gels by controlling the polymerization kinetics. When a monomer solution is partially cured, some monomers form a network and others form the solvent. The resulting gel, termed homogel, consists of a polymer network with enormous dangling chains and solvent of identical chemistries. An interval exists where the dangling chains are long and disentangled substantially, and the homogel exhibits both hyperelasticity and omniadhesion. We demonstrated such a gel with a hysteresis of 4.1% (stretch = 10) and adhesion energy of ~510 joules per square meter. The principle is generic and applicable to gels of different types.",

Expanding PKM2-deficient CD4 T cells increased PKM1 expression with associated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species–mediated cell death. Examination of T cell compartments revealed that PKM2-deficient CD4 T cells were unaltered in the thymus but were significantly reduced in peripheral tissues as mice aged. The inability of PKM1 to protect CD4 T cells in the absence of PKM2 led to less severe T cell–mediated colitis as PKM2-deficient pathogenic cells were significantly reduced compared with control cells.

However, designing and fabricating microfluidic chips typically requires substantial expertise and numerous design iterations, posing considerable barriers to entry for nonexperts. We introduce μFluidicGenius (μFG), an open-access, machine learning (ML)–augmented design tool that enables nonexpert users to rapidly create functional microfluidic circuits. Users simply define the spatial placement of reservoirs, specify the channel connections between them, and assign desired flow rates through this layout. Leveraging a hybrid algorithmic framework that integrates ML models with mathematical modeling, μFG automatically generates spatially coded maze structures that implement the precise fluidic resistances needed to meet the target flow distribution. These resistive elements are optimized to fit within the available geometry and can reproduce complex flow profiles, such as physiologically relevant flow rates in multi-organ-on-chip platforms. The resulting microfluidic designs are directly exportable for three-dimensional printing. Experimental validation demonstrates that μFG-generated circuits reproduce target flow distributions with 90% accuracy. By streamlining and automating microfluidic circuit creation, μFG not only lowers the barrier to entry for nonexperts but also showcases a principled and efficient application of ML to fluidic system design, enabling rapid and customizable development of complex microfluidic architectures.",

While external stimuli, such as food and drugs of abuse, are activators of DA-neuron activity, growing evidence indicates that interoceptive signals also play a critical role. Among these, the gut-brain vagal axis has emerged as a key regulator, although its precise contribution to mesolimbic DA signaling and behavior remains unclear. Here, we combine complementary ex vivo and in vivo approaches across multiple scales to show that gut-brain vagal tone is essential for gating mesolimbic DA system activity and functions, modulating DA-dependent molecular and cellular processes, and scaling both food- and drug-induced reinforcement. These findings challenge the traditional brain-centric view of reward processing, supporting a more integrated model in which vagus-mediated interoceptive signals intrinsically shape motivation and reinforcement.

It enables wireless, mild-restricted measurement of eyelid deformation during eye movements. Through biomechanical modeling validated by ocular magnetic resonance imaging simulations, we establish a prior correlation between eyelid deformation and eye movements. The Eyelectronics, powered by our physiology knowledge-driven end-to-end AI algorithm, achieves simultaneous measurement of strabismus angle and identification of paretic muscle. It delivers a 96.6% four-direction classification accuracy and a 1.2° measurement accuracy in ocular motility examinations.

In the context of carbon-hydrogen oxidation, a key challenge in synthetic chemistry, unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) directly oxidize unactivated carbon-hydrogen bonds using hydrogen peroxide, yet their utility is limited by low activity and imperfect selectivity. By computational rational design, this study systematically navigated vast sequence spaces to identify mutations that enhance catalytic performance of UPOs, lastly yielded UPO variants with 13-fold enhanced activity and &gt;99% enantioselectivity, and revealed the dominant role of residue Lys 165 in activity and enantioselectivity.

We present a generative diffusion model called StormCast, which emulates the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR)—National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s state-of-the-art 3-kilometer operational CAM. StormCast autoregressively predicts 99 state variables at the kilometer scale using a 1-hour time step, with dense vertical resolution in the atmospheric boundary layer, conditioned on 26 synoptic variables.

Here, we report that extracellular domains (ECDs) of CATSPERε are essential for canopy and holo-complex assembly and modulate channel activity during sperm capacitation. CATSPERε-deficient males are sterile due to the absence of the entire channel and defective sperm hyperactivation. Expressing ECD-truncated CATSPERε during spermatogenesis does not rescue the knockout because it fails to incorporate into the native complex. In contrast, addition of a CATSPERε ECD fragment during sperm capacitation significantly reduces sperm hyperactivation.

Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we monitored the activity of major efflux systems in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Hoechst 33342 (HCT), a DNA binding inhibitor. We found that inactivation of efflux (Δ tolC in E. coli and Δ6 in P. aeruginosa ) increased the apparent HCT-DNA affinity, mediated by a decreased apparent unbinding rate, whereas the intrinsic rate remained unchanged. Statistical physics modeling and experimental testing show that, unlike under dilute in vitro conditions, drug molecules that unbind from their targets in intracellular environments undergo successive rebinding, prolonging the total lifetime of the drug bound to the target. However, efflux pumps counteract this effect by suppressing rebinding, thereby kinetically destabilizing drug-target interactions. This biophysical mechanism acts multiplicatively with the canonical gatekeeping effect to broaden and amplify drug resistance.",

In mice performing skilled locomotion, we recorded from dMSNs, iMSNs, and their cortical and thalamic inputs identified by monosynaptic rabies tracing. A recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier and clustering analysis revealed functionally heterogeneous subpopulations in each population, with dMSNs preferentially activated at movement onset and offset, and iMSNs during execution. Cortical and thalamic inputs were preferentially activated during onset/offset and execution, respectively, though dMSN- and iMSN-projecting neurons in each region showed similar patterns.

Through serum proteomic analysis, we identified LIM and calponin homology domain–containing protein 1 (LIMCH1) as a PE-associated EV protein that is highly expressed in PE placentas, particularly in syncytiotrophoblasts, which release EVs into the maternal circulation. LIMCH1-enriched EVs (LIMCH1-EVs) increased endothelial permeability in vitro. Transcriptome analysis revealed that LIMCH1-EVs disrupted endothelial cell-cell junction assembly by suppressing the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1. Furthermore, administration of LIMCH1-EVs promoted pulmonary vascular permeability in vivo. These findings suggest a role of LIMCH1-EVs in EV-associated vascular endothelial dysfunction, a central pathology of PE.

RIN3 has been shown to bind BIN1, and we previously reported that this interaction modulates amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) trafficking and Aβ generation in vitro. To extend these findings, we used Rin3 constitutive knockout ( Rin3-CKO ) mice and CRISPR-Cas9–edited human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons carrying either BIN1 knockout or rare familial AD RIN3 missense mutations within the BIN1-binding domain. We found that disruption of BIN1-RIN3 binding, through either genetic deletion or pathogenic RIN3 variants, resulted in RIN3-mediated RAB5 hyperactivation and enlargement of neuronal endosomes, a hallmark of early AD pathology. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed dysregulated expression of AD-related genes. Together, these findings establish BIN1 as a critical regulator of RIN3-driven RAB5 activation and neuronal endosomal homeostasis.",

Here, we developed, optimized, and performed an imaging-based genetic screen leveraging modulation of cohesin clustering to identify cohesin regulators. Using a sensitized background in which the cohesin unloader WAPL is partially degraded, we screened the druggable genome for effects on cohesin clustering. Through multiple rounds of screening and experimentation, we identified 7 enhancers and 10 suppressors of cohesin clustering. Several factors control genome folding at multiple loci and cohesin loading. Notably, our screen identified factors in mitochondrial function and epigenetic silencing, implicating these processes in the regulation of cohesin activity. This study offers a valuable resource identifying cohesin regulators and provides insights into upstream mechanisms governing genome folding.",

This social context–dependent modulation overrides responses to many external sensory cues and is shaped by developmental social experience. Leveraging the genetic toolbox available in Drosophila , we find that different sensory modalities are required for social context modulation. Our results show that even less social animals such as fly larvae are affected by conspecifics and recognize each other through multimodal sensory cues.

Here, we found that Set2-mediated H3K36me3 deposition occurs on the nucleosome reassembling behind the EC. The histone chaperone FACT suppresses H3K36me3 deposition on the downstream nucleosome, thereby ensuring that Set2 targets specifically on the reassembling upstream nucleosome. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of the nucleosome-transcribing EC complexed with Set2 revealed that Set2 is anchored by the Spt6 subunit of the EC to capture both of the H3 N-terminal tails in a stepwise manner during the nucleosome reassembly process.

The origin of these large ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs), referred to as mega-ULVZs, remains uncertain partly because of lack of constraints on the relative reduction in shear versus compressional wave speeds ( R S/P ). This ratio can give clues into the compositional makeup of the mega-ULVZs. Through joint seismic analysis of core-diffracted P and S waves beneath Hawai’i, we constrain the R S/P of its mega-ULVZ to 1 to 1.3. Mineralogical modeling reveals that iron enrichment via solid iron-rich magnesiowüstite [(Mg,Fe)O] matches this seismic constraint, independent of modeled ULVZ thickness. Enrichment of metallic iron-rich magnesiowüstite likely enhances the thermal conductivity of mega-ULVZs and provides a mechanism to drive localized plume upwelling. Higher reported R S/P values for smaller ULVZs near subduction zones may therefore indicate different processes at play controlling ULVZ formation across the diverse core-mantle boundary landscape.",

          "abstract": "The properties and stability of hydrous phases are crucial to unraveling the mysteries of the deep water cycle. Under deep lower mantle conditions, water and hydrous phases transition into a superionic state. However, superionic effect on their stability and dehydration behavior remains unclear. Using ab initio and deep learning potential molecular dynamics simulations, we discovered a doubly superionic transition in δ-AlOOH, characterized by the highly diffusive behavior of both hydrogen and aluminum ions within the oxygen sublattice. These highly diffusive elements contribute external entropy to the system, stabilizing the structure at 140 GPa and 3800 K. Our free-energy calculations reveal that water tends to freeze under deep lower mantle conditions, so dehydration becomes energetically and kinetically unfavorable even under core-mantle boundary (CMB) conditions. This implies that superionic water may accumulate in the deep lower mantle over geologic time, forming a long-term reservoir at the base of the mantle.",

          "abstract": "If the immune system is an interconnected network, then the evolution of an archetype that is ideal for fighting one pathogen should result in trade-offs decreasing its ability to fight others. How many archetypes are there in an immune system? We infected diverse mice with Plasmodium chabaudi and identified five distinct archetypes of responses on the basis of the host’s position in microbial load, immune activity, and host damage space. To better understand the nature of these archetypes, we developed a mathematical model of a generalized host-pathogen system. This model explains the number and distribution of archetypes across a population of diverse hosts. Mice resilient to P. chabaudi exhibited poor outcomes when challenged with influenza, SARS-CoV-1, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and vice versa, supporting our trade-off hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Stainless steels are essential materials in sustainable energy conversion systems, particularly in hydrogen-related applications. However, their susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement and corrosion limits their long-term use, creating a need for advanced alloys capable of resisting environmentally assisted damage and mechanical failure. Here, we design a cost-effective austenitic stainless steel. The key innovation involves the atomic-scale passivation of grain boundaries through nitrogen decoration. This enhances resistance to failure, achieving about 3.8-fold increase in corrosion resistance and a 1.35-fold increase in hydrogen embrittlement resistance compared to commercial 316L. The steel exhibits very low hydrogen diffusivity (~7.8 × 10 −17  square meters per second), mitigating hydrogen embrittlement at ambient temperature, an advantage over conventional steels. In addition, formation of a dense passive film improves corrosion resistance in environments such as dilute hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda. The outstanding resistance of the stainless steel against such harsh coupled environmental conditions qualifies it as a promising candidate for sustainable and secure infrastructure in the emerging hydrogen economy.",

          "authors": "Qihao Chen, Pu Yuan, Renjie Li, Xiaoyue Du, Rilei Yu, Yan Zhao",
          "abstract": "Human glucose-6-phosphate transporter 1 (G6PT1) is responsible for transporting glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a crucial rate-limiting step in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Complete and chronic dysfunction of G6PT1 can lead to the severe metabolic disorder GSD1b, whereas moderate and reversible inhibition contributes to diabetes treatment. We determined the structures of human G6PT1 in its apo state and in complex with the substrate G6P, cosubstrate phosphate, and the inhibitor chlorogenic acid (CGA). Captured in both lumen- and cytosol-facing conformations, these structures reveal the specific mechanism of phosphate-coupled G6P transport. In addition, the CGA-bound G6PT1 complex shows that CGA stabilizes the transporter in the cytosol-facing conformation, inhibiting it by competing with substrate binding and preventing conformational transitions, providing previously unreported insights into G6PT1 inhibition. Our findings provide a structural foundation for understanding the mechanisms of substrate recognition, transport, drug inhibition, and the pharmacology of G6PT1, paving the way to the rational design of potential therapeutic agents.",

          "abstract": "During the Cenozoic unipolar ice ages, benthic foraminiferal oxygen and carbon isotopes (proxies for bottom-water temperature and ice volume and for the carbon cycle, respectively) exhibited in-phase changes on eccentricity timescales. However, the mechanisms underlying this synchronized relationship remain unclear. Here, we present a high-resolution reconstruction of Miocene benthic foraminiferal boron-to-calcium ratios, revealing that eccentricity-paced fluctuations in deep-sea carbonate ion saturation covaried with oxygen and carbon isotopes, as well as with pelagic carbonate deposition. Integrating model results, we propose that orbital configurations and elevated temperatures during eccentricity maxima intensified monsoon rainfall and chemical weathering, enhancing the transport of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity from land to sea. These processes further redistributed massive carbonate burial from deep-ocean basins to continental shelves, lowering carbonate ion concentration and the carbon isotopic composition of seawater. Our findings underscore the crucial role of the low-latitude hydrological cycle in regulating carbon-cycle dynamics under warm climatic conditions.",

          "abstract": "Predicting floating ice dynamics remains a challenging problem with implications for Earth’s climate. While gigantic icebergs have garnered worldwide attention, small ice bodies have been overlooked, and we still lack their mechanistic models. Aided by a real-time tracking, we unravel the transient processes of freely floating ice in calm waters—including the kinematics, phase transition, and surrounding fluid dynamics—that govern melting. Combining the heat transfer model and our experimental results, we develop and validate a theoretical model for the melt rate, identifying ice geometry and convective regime as key controls. Furthermore, the ice-driven convective volume flux is found to exceed the meltwater flux by orders of magnitude, underscoring the ecological relevance of floating ice; it not only supplies freshwater but also acts as a destabilizing buoyancy source that redistributes mass macroscopically. Our study provides a foundation for developing mechanistic parameterizations of icebergs and ice floes melting in climate models.",
