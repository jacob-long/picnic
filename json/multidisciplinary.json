Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07219-0 (2024).\n\nKotz, Levermann and Wenz1 (henceforth, KLW) analysed how subnational gross domestic product (GDP) growth responds to year-to-year changes in temperature and precipitation. They reported that if historical relationships continue to hold, global GDP would be lowered by roughly 62% (central estimate) in 2100 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 ‘high emissions’ scenario, an impact roughly 3 times larger than similar previous estimates2,3. Here we show that (1) data anomalies arising from one country in KLW’s underlying GDP dataset, Uzbekistan, substantially bias their predicted impacts of climate change, (2) KLW underestimate statistical uncertainty in their future projections of climate impacts, and (3) additional data-quality concerns in KLW’s subnational GDP data warrant further investigation. When Uzbekistan’s data are removed and statistical uncertainty is corrected to account for spatial correlations, KLW’s central estimate aligns closely with previous literature and their results are no longer statistically distinguishable from mitigation costs at any time this century.",

          "abstract": "Predicting the social and behavioural impact of future technologies before they are achieved would enable us to guide their development and regulation before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method that uses experimental methods to simulate future technologies and collect quantitative measures of the attitudes and behaviours of participants assigned to controlled variations of the future. We call this method ‘science fiction science’. We suggest that the reason that this method has not been fully embraced yet, despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be reluctant to engage in work that faces such serious validity threats. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on the types of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the unconventional, immersive methods that it may require. We seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been marginalized for so long, the benefits it would bring if it could be built on strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle of validity improvement.",

          "abstract": "NSD2 catalyses the epigenetic modification H3K36me2 (refs. 1,2) and is a candidate convergent downstream effector of oncogenic signalling in diverse malignancies3,4,5. However, it remains unclear whether the enzymatic activity of NSD2 is therapeutically targetable. Here we characterize a series of clinical-grade small-molecule catalytic NSD2 inhibitors (NSD2i) and show that the pharmacological targeting of NSD2 constitutes an epigenetic dependency with broad therapeutic efficacy in KRAS-driven preclinical cancer models. NSD2i inhibits NSD2 with single-digit nanomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration potency and high selectivity over related methyltransferases. Structural analyses reveal that the specificity of NSD2i for NSD2 is due to competitive binding with S-adenosylmethionine and catalytic disruption through a binary-channel obstruction mechanism. Proteo-epigenomic and single-cell strategies in pancreatic and lung cancer models support a mechanism in which sustained NSD2i exposure reverses pathological H3K36me2-driven chromatin plasticity, re-establishing silencing at H3K27me3-legacy loci to curtail oncogenic gene expression programs. Accordingly, NSD2i impairs the viability of pancreatic and lung cancer cells and the growth of patient-derived xenograft tumours. Furthermore, NSD2i, which is well-tolerated in vivo, prolongs survival in advanced-stage autochthonous KRASG12C-driven pancreatic and lung tumours in mouse models to a comparable level as KRAS inhibition with sotorasib6. In these models, treatment with both a NSD2 inhibitor and sotorasib synergize to confer sustained survival with extensive tumour regression and elimination. Together, our work uncovers targeting of the NSD2–H3K36me2 axis as an actionable vulnerability in difficult to treat cancers and provides support for the evaluation of NSD2 and KRAS inhibitor combination therapies in a clinical setting.",

          "abstract": "Action potentials are generated by opening of voltage-activated sodium (Na v ) and potassium (K v ) channels 1 , which can rapidly inactivate to shape the nerve impulse and contribute to synaptic facilitation and short-term memory 1–4 . The mechanism of fast inactivation was proposed to involve an intracellular domain that blocks the internal pore in both Na v 5,6 and K v 7–9 channels; however, recent studies in Na v 10,11 and K v 12,13 channels support a mechanism in which the internal pore closes during inactivation. Here we investigate the mechanism of fast inactivation in the Shaker K v channel using cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and electrophysiology. We resolved structures of a fully inactivated state in which the non-polar end of the N terminus plugs the internal pore in an extended conformation. The N-terminal methionine is deleted, leaving an alanine that is acetylated and interacts with a pore-lining isoleucine residue where RNA editing regulates fast inactivation 14 . Opening of the internal activation gate is required for fast inactivation because it enables the plug domain to block the pore and repositions gate residues to interact with and stabilize that domain. We also show that external K + destabilizes the inactivated state by altering the conformation of the ion selectivity filter rather than by electrostatic repulsion. These findings establish the mechanism of fast inactivation in K v channels, revealing how it is regulated by RNA editing and N-terminal acetylation, and providing a framework for understanding related mechanisms in other voltage-activated channels.",

However, biologically inspired robots, especially those mimicking octopus locomotion4,5, are based on limited in situ behavioural data owing to the complexity of collecting quantitative observations. Here we describe deployments of a remotely operated vehicle, equipped with a suite of imaging systems, to study the mechanics of locomotion in the octopus Muusoctopus robustus at the recently discovered 3,000-m deep Octopus Garden. Using a recently developed light-field imaging system called EyeRIS and an ultra-high-definition science camera, we were able to capture wide and zoomed-in views to characterize whole-animal gaits in a completely unconstrained environment across multiple individuals. Furthermore, the real-time volumetric data captured using EyeRIS yielded quantitative kinematics measurements of individual octopus arms during crawling, showing regions of high curvature and strain concentrated at distinct arm locations. Our results indicate that M. robustus crawling patterns showed several elements of simplified control, with implications for the design of future octopus-inspired robots. Further developments and deployments of technologies such as EyeRIS, coupled with capable robotic vehicles, will enable mining of the deep ocean for biological inspiration.",

          "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is associated with poor cancer prognoses 1 . Large numbers of excised signal circles (ESCs) are produced as by-products of antigen receptor rearrangement during V(D)J recombination 2,3 . However, current dogma states that ESCs are progressively lost through cell division 4 . Here we show that ESCs replicate and persist through many cell generations and share many properties in common with circular extrachromosomal DNAs. Increased ESC copy numbers at diagnosis of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were highly correlated with subsequent relapse. By taking advantage of the matching recombination footprint that is formed upon the generation of each ESC, we measured ESC persistence and replication and found increased ESC replication in patients who later relapsed. This increased replication is controlled by cell-intrinsic factors and corresponds to increased expression of DNA replication- and repair-associated genes. Consistent with high ESC levels having a role in disease progression, the number of mutations typical of those caused by the V(D)J recombinase–ESC complex was significantly increased at diagnosis in patients who later relapsed. The number of such mutations in genes associated with relapse increased between diagnosis and relapse, and corresponded to clonal expansion of cells with high ESC copy numbers. These data demonstrate that the by-product of V(D)J recombination, when increased in abundance, potently associates with the V(D)J recombinase to cause adverse disease outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic soft robots offer considerable potential across various scenarios, such as biomedical applications and industrial tasks, due to their shape programmability and reconfigurability, safe interaction, and biocompatibility1–4. Despite recent advances, magnetic soft robots are still limited by the difficulties in reprogramming their required magnetization profiles in real time on the spot (in situ), which is essential for performing multiple functions or executing diverse tasks5,6. Here, we introduce a method for real-time, in situ magnetization reprogramming that enables the rearrangement and recombination of magnetic units to achieve diverse magnetization profiles. We explore the applications of this method in structures of varying dimensions, from one-dimensional (1D) tubes to three-dimensional (3D) frameworks, showcasing a diverse and expanded range of configurations and their deformations. This method also demonstrates versatility in diverse scenarios, including navigating around objects without undesired contact, reprogramming cilia arrays, managing multiple instruments cooperatively or independently under the same magnetic field, and manipulating objects of various shapes. These capabilities extend the range of applications for magnetic actuation technologies. Furthermore, this method emancipates magnetic soft robots from the sole reliance on external magnetic fields for shape change, facilitating unprecedented modes and varieties of deformation while simultaneously reducing the need for complex magnetic field generation systems; thereby, opening new avenues for the development of magnetic actuation technologies.",

          "abstract": "Migration of transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells into the brain following systemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transplantation (HCT) holds great promise as a therapeutic modality to correct genetic deficiencies in the brain such as lysosomal storage diseases.1–3 However, the toxic myeloablation required for allogeneic HCT can cause serious, life-threatening side effects limiting its applicability. Moreover, transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells are highly vulnerable to rejection even in an immune-privileged organ like the brain. Here we report a brain-restricted, high-efficiency microglia replacement approach without myeloablative preconditioning. Unlike previous assumptions, we found that hematopoietic stem cells are not required to repopulate the myeloid compartment of the brain environment. In contrast, Sca1- committed progenitor cells were highly efficient to replace microglia following intracerebral injection. This finding enabled the development of brain-restricted preconditioning and avoided long-term peripheral engraftment thus eliminating complications such as graft-vs-host disease. Evaluating its therapeutic potential, we found that our allogeneic microglia replacement method rescues the murine model of Sandhoff disease, a lysosomal storage disease caused by hexosaminidase B deficiency. In support of the translational relevance of this approach, we discovered that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myeloid progenitor cells display a similar engraftment potential following brain-restricted conditioning. Our results overcome current limitations of conventional HCT and may pave the way for the development of allogeneic microglial cell therapies for the brain.",

We recently discovered that small RNAs undergo N-glycosylation2 at the modified RNA base 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine (acp3U)3. However, the functional significance of N-glycosylation of RNAs is unknown. Here we show that the N-glycans on glycoRNAs prevent innate immune sensing of endogenous small RNAs. We found that de-N-glycosylation of cell-culture-derived and circulating human and mouse glycoRNA elicited potent inflammatory responses including the production of type I interferons in a Toll-like receptor 3- and Toll-like receptor 7-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that N-glycans on cell surface RNAs prevent apoptotic cells from triggering endosomal RNA sensors in efferocytes, thus facilitating the non-inflammatory clearance of dead cells. Mechanistically, N-glycans conceal the hypermodified uracil base acp3U, which we identified as immunostimulatory when exposed in RNA. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of an enzyme (DTWD2) that synthesizes acp3U abrogated innate immune activation by de-N-glycosylated small RNAs and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, synthetic acp3U-containing RNAs are sufficient to trigger innate immune responses. Thus, our study has uncovered a natural mechanism by which N-glycans block RNAs from inducing acp3U-dependent innate immune activation, demonstrating how glycoRNAs exist on the cell surface and in the endosomal network without inducing autoinflammatory responses.",

Here we uncovered the microglial regulation of the sustained proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE). We showed that microglia are preferentially distributed in the proliferating zone and identified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor IGR1R as the predicted top ligand–receptor pair underlying microglia–progenitor communication in the prenatal hMGE. Using our newly developed neuroimmune hMGE organoids, which mimic the hMGE cytoarchitecture and developmental trajectory, we demonstrated that microglia-derived IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation and production of GABAergic neurons. Conversely, IGF1-neutralizing antibodies and IGF1 knockout human embryonic stem-cell-induced microglia abolish the induced microglia-mediated progenitor proliferation.

Previously, the oldest indication of hominins in Wallacea, the oceanic island zone east of Sunda, comprised flaked stone artefacts deposited at least 1.02 ± 0.02 million years ago (Ma) at Wolo Sege on Flores5. Early hominins were also established on the oceanic island of Luzon (Philippines), as indicated by both stone artefacts and cut marks on faunal remains dating to between 777 and 631 thousand years ago (ka) at Kalinga6. Moreover, fossils of extinct, small-bodied hominins occur on Flores (Homo floresiensis)7,8,9,10,11,12 and Luzon (Homo luzonensis)13. On Sulawesi, the largest Wallacean island, previous excavations revealed stone artefacts with a minimum age of 194 ka at the open site of Talepu in the Walanae Depression14, long preceding the earliest known presence of modern humans (Homo sapiens) in the region (73–63 ka in Sunda)15. Here we show that stone artefacts also occur at the nearby site of Calio in fossiliferous layers dated to at least 1.04 Ma and possibly up to 1.48 Ma, using palaeomagnetic dating of sedimentary rocks and coupled Uranium-series (U-series) and electron-spin resonance (US–ESR) dating of fossil teeth.

          "abstract": "As tissue resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, microglia perform diverse essential functions during homeostasis and perturbations1. They primarily interact with neurons via synaptic engulfment and through the rapid elimination of apoptotic cells and nonfunctional synapses2. Here, by combining unbiased lipidomics and high resolution spatial lipid imaging, deep single-cell transcriptome analysis and novel cell type-specific mutants, we identified a previously unknown mode of microglial interaction with neurons. During homeostasis, microglia deliver the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase (Hex) to neurons for the degradation of the ganglioside GM2 that is integral to maintaining cell membrane organization and function. Absence of Hexb, encoding the β subunit of Hex, in both mice and patients suffering from neurodegenerative Sandhoff disease leads to a massive accumulation of GM2 derivatives in a characteristic spatiotemporal manner3. In mice, neuronal GM2 gangliosides subsequently engage the macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL)2 receptor on microglia via N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, leading to lethal neurodegeneration. Notably, replacement of microglia with peripherally derived microglia-like cells (MLCs) is able to break this degenerative cycle and fully restore CNS homeostasis. Our results reveal a novel mode of bidirectional microglia-neuron communication centred around GM2 ganglioside turnover, identify a novel microgliopathy and offer novel therapeutic avenues for these maladies.",

          "abstract": "The periodic table provides an intuitive framework for understanding chemical properties. However, its traditional patterns may break down for the heaviest elements occupying the bottom of the chart. The large nuclei of actinides (Z > 88) and superheavy elements (Z ≥ 104) give rise to relativistic effects that are expected to substantially alter their chemical behaviours, potentially indicating that we have reached the end of a predictive periodic table1. Relativistic effects have already been cited for the unusual chemistry of the actinides compared with those of their lanthanide counterparts2. Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand the full impact of relativistic effects, as research on the later actinides and superheavy elements is scarce. Beyond fermium (Z = 100), elements need to be produced and studied one atom at a time, using accelerated ion beams and state-of-the-art experimental approaches. So far, no experiments have been capable of directly identifying produced molecular species.

          "abstract": "There is ongoing debate about the vulnerability of arthropods to climate change1,2. Long-term impacts of climate change on arthropod communities could manifest through short-term weather patterns3. Arthropods in the tropics are hyper-diverse4,5 and contribute many crucial ecosystem functions6,7, but are comparatively less studied than in temperate regions1,8,9. Tropical forest arthropods and the functions that they provide may be vulnerable to intensified El Niño events under climate change10,11,12. Here we perform time-series analysis of data from primary tropical forests, which reveal long-term declines in arthropod diversity and function that were linked to El Niño occurrence. In the Americas, species losses correlated with El Niño sensitivity, and abundant species fluctuated according to feeding traits and level of ecological specialization. Parallel declines in butterflies in Southeast Asia suggested that impacts spanned continents. Predicted arthropod diversity changes correlated with observed rates of invertebrate-mediated decomposition and leaf herbivory, which were oscillating and crashing, respectively, across the tropics. Our analyses suggest that an intensified El Niño immediately threatens tropical forest arthropods and the ecosystem functions that they provide. The broader consequences remain unknown, but such widespread changes could fundamentally alter tropical forest ecosystems13. Long-term monitoring of arthropod diversity and forest functioning across the tropics is paramount, as is researching the potential mechanisms that underly this novel threat.",

          "abstract": "The aridity index is widely used to indicate water availability on land. Balancing climatic water supply (precipitation, P) against demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET), it is often expressed as the P/PET ratio1 or humidity index. Water also flows laterally by rivers and groundwater, from hills to valleys and from mountains to plains, subsidizing the receiving lowlands2. Here, we show that this lateral subsidy reduces aridity in the receiving lowlands. We first estimate monthly subsidies (Qlat) by surface and groundwater at 30″ global grids with a global hydrology model. We then calculate the conventional global humidity index (GHI) as P/PET and a new GHI including Qlat as (P + Qlat)/PET. Termed GHI_topo, the latter reflects land topography, higher in hydrologically convergent lowlands. It also exhibits a delayed and dampened seasonality (relative to P) owing to delayed and diffused Qlat arrival at the receiving lowlands. Such spatiotemporal features of Qlat, arising from both the climate and the terrain, make GHI_topo a more realistic indicator of local water availability in downgradient societies and ecosystems, enabling life in arid locations and times. Global land area with GHI_topo ≥ 1 (supply meets or exceeds demand) is 33% greater than GHI ≥ 1 and far higher in arid and season-arid climates.",

Experiments and observations also link it to the emergence of energetic particles and X-rays3. However, how this multi-scale physics affects the abrupt onset of reconnection remains unknown. Here we report observations from laboratory experiments involving two flux ropes with electron beams that induce magnetic turbulence and then abruptly merge into a single structure, altering the magnetic topology in the MHD regime. Two separate electron beams are launched along magnetic field lines and form individual flux ropes with a drift velocity higher than the ambient Alfvén velocity, effectively driving magnetic turbulence through beam-driven instabilities, as inferred from the increased level of the turbulent power spectrum. Experimental observations, including the appearance of energetic particles, increased ion temperature and changes in the characteristics of the flux ropes, suggest that beam-driven turbulence drives three-dimensional (3D) reconnection. 3D particle-in-cell simulations are performed, which successfully reproduce the key aspects of the experiment. These results directly explain how non-MHD kinetic processes progress through multiple scales to induce global MHD changes.",

However, the lamprey-like internal anatomy8,9,10,11,12,13 reconstructed for osteostracans, the sister group of jawed vertebrates, seem to lack these gnathostome traits, implying a morphological gap despite phylogenetic proximity. Here, using synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography on the model osteostracan Norselaspis glacialis, we reveal derived gnathostome traits straddling a uniquely ossified head–trunk interface in this jawless fish. The inner ear of Norselaspis shows sensory elaborations (enlarged pars inferior and sinus superior) acquired well before the origin of jaws. As in crown gnathostomes, paired venous drainage channels blood into a high-volume cardiac tract. We also confirm a feature not yet demonstrated in any other vertebrate, to our knowledge: the most anterior trunk nerve extends its single trunk to the pectoral fin. In this respect, our reconstruction challenges the hypotheses14,15,16 that the gnathostome shoulder evolved from the gill apparatus. Our observations highlight Norselaspis as a prelude to the intercalation of the muscular neck and throat that would power the early jaw apparatus. Therefore, the vertebrate jaw—often considered the functional driver for ‘gnathostome’ innovations1,2,3—evolved instead as a follower to the sensory enhancement, increased cardiac output and greater locomotory control now inferred in the jawless sister group.",

Effector memory CD8+ T cells and CD4+ TH1 cells as well as CD4+ TH17 cells co-migrate to the brain of EBV-infected humanized mice. T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells can colonize submeningeal brain regions in the absence of other lymphocytes and attract T cells.

          "abstract": "The earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are poorly understood1,2,3,4,5. Here we show that endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. Of the metals we analysed, Li was the only one that was significantly reduced in the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Li bioavailability was further reduced in AD by amyloid sequestration. We explored the role of endogenous Li in the brain by depleting it from the diet of wild-type and AD mouse models. Reducing endogenous cortical Li by approximately 50% markedly increased the deposition of amyloid-β and the accumulation of phospho-tau, and led to pro-inflammatory microglial activation, the loss of synapses, axons and myelin, and accelerated cognitive decline. These effects were mediated, at least in part, through activation of the kinase GSK3β. Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in AD. Replacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD.",

We demonstrate that a single tree hosts approximately one trillion bacteria in its woody tissues, with microbial communities distinctly partitioned between heartwood and sapwood, each maintaining unique microbiomes with minimal similarity to other plant tissues or ecosystem components. The heartwood microbiome emerges as a particularly unique ecological niche, distinguished by specialized archaea and anaerobic bacteria driving consequential biogeochemical processes. Our findings support the concept of plants as ‘holobionts’3,4—integrated ecological units of host and associated microorganisms—with implications for tree health, disease and functionality.

Coupling this dataset with rich phenotypic data, we surveyed within- and cross-ancestry genomic associations and identified novel genetic and clinical insights. Although most associations with disease traits were primarily observed in individuals of European ancestries, strong or novel signals were also identified in individuals of African and Asian ancestries.

However, both methods face fundamental limitations, such as a limited Q factor and near-field enhancement control and the inability to achieve resonance on–off switching by completely coupling and decoupling the mode from the far field. Here we demonstrate temporal symmetry breaking in metasurfaces through ultrafast optical pumping, providing an experimental realization of radiative-loss-driven resonance tuning, allowing resonance creation, annihilation, broadening and sharpening. To enable this temporal control, we introduce restored symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum. Even though their unit cells are geometrically asymmetric, coupling to the radiation continuum remains fully suppressed, which, in this work, is achieved by two equally strong antisymmetric dipoles. By using selective Mie-resonant pumping in parts of these unit cells, we can modify their dipole balance to create or annihilate resonances as well as tune the linewidth, amplitude and near-field enhancement, leading to potential applications in optical and quantum communications, time crystals and photonic circuits.",

This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems—the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin–orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars4, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is ‘primordial’—imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages—including the Sun’s modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System—could originate from initial conditions of their formation.",

          "abstract": "Parent-of-origin effects (POEs) occur when the effect of a genetic variant depends on its parental origin 1 . Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, POEs are believed to occur due to parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, resulting in opposing parental influences 2 . Despite their importance, POEs remain underexplored in complex traits, owing to the lack of parental genomes. Here we present an approach to infer the parent of origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging interchromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and X chromosome data, and sex-specific crossover in siblings. Applied to the UK Biobank, this enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 109,385 individuals. Genome-wide association study scans for 59 complex traits and over 14,000 protein quantitative trait loci contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 POEs and confirmed more than 50% of known associations. More than one third of these showed opposite parental influences, especially for traits related to growth (for example, IGF1 and height) and metabolism (for example, type 2 diabetes and triglyceride levels). Replication in up to 85,050 individuals from the Estonian Biobank and 42,346 offspring from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) validated 87% of testable associations. Overall, our findings highlight the contribution of POEs to complex traits and support the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.",

          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "Attached to the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) allows researchers to probe the most distant galaxies. It’s a popular instrument: for its next observing session, from October to April, scientists have applied for more than 3,000 hours of observation time. That’s a problem. Even though it’s dubbed a cosmic time machine, not even MUSE can squeeze 379 nights of work into just seven months.\n\nThe European Southern Observatory (ESO), which runs the Chile telescope, usually asks panels of experts to select the worthiest proposals. But as the number of requests has soared, so has the burden on the scientists asked to grade them.\n\n“The load was simply unbearable,” says astronomer Nando Patat at ESO’s Observing Programmes Office in Garching, Germany. So, in 2022, ESO passed the work back to the applicants. Teams that want observing time must also assess related applications from rival groups.\n\nAI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried\n\nThe change is one increasingly popular answer to the labour crisis engulfing peer review — the process by which grant applications and research manuscripts are assessed and filtered by specialists before a final decision is made about funding or publication.\n\nWith the number of scholarly papers rising each year, publishers and editors complain that it’s getting harder to get everything reviewed. And some funding bodies, such as ESO, are struggling to find reviewers.\n\nAs pressure on the system grows, many researchers point to low-quality or error-strewn research appearing in journals as an indictment of their peer-review systems failing to uphold rigour. Others complain that clunky grant-review systems are preventing exciting research ideas from being funded.\n\nThese are long-standing concerns. Peer review has been accused of being a sluggish, gatekeeping, bias-laden enterprise for as long as it has existed. But some data show that dissatisfaction is growing. Added strain on the system, such as the explosion of publications following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, has prompted interest in methods to boost the speed and effectiveness of peer review, with experiments at journals ranging from paying reviewers to giving more structured guidance.\n\nOthers argue that peer review has become too unreliable. They suggest radical reform, up to and including phasing out the practice entirely.\n\nMore recent than you think\n\nAlthough it is often described as the bedrock of scientific endeavour, peer review as it is performed today became widespread among journals and funders only in the 1960s and 1970s. Before then, the idea of refereeing manuscripts was more haphazard. Whereas some journals used external review, many editors judged what to publish entirely on the basis of their own expertise, or that of a small pool of academic experts, says Melinda Baldwin, a historian of science at the University of Maryland in College Park who has studied the development of peer-review systems in academia.\n\nBut with massive increases in public funds for research, the volume of manuscripts pushed editors at all journals towards external review, to avoid overwhelming a small pool of reviewers. Even now, external reviewing is far from a monolithic standard. Rather, it is a diverse collection of checking and selection practices that differ between journals, scholarly fields and funders.\n\nPeer reviewers unmasked: largest global survey reveals trends\n\nWhat emerged in the late twentieth century is now facing a similar crisis: too many manuscripts and not enough reviewers. The science system is churning out ever more research papers1, but the reviewer pool doesn’t seem to be growing fast enough.\n\nEvidence for the problem is largely anecdotal, because journals tend to keep their information private. But some data have emerged. In 2018, a report by the website Publons (now owned by the analytics firm Clarivate) analysed anonymized information from more than ten million manuscripts submitted during 2013–17 in a widely used peer-review workflow tool. The report found that, over time, editors had to send out more and more invitations to get a completed review (see go.nature.com/4k8xbfp). Publons, which also surveyed 11,000 researchers, warned of a rise in “reviewer fatigue”. More recently, fields from ophthalmology2 to microbiology3 have reported that more scientists are rejecting invitations to review. In a blog posted last month, analyst Christos Petrou, founder of the consultancy firm Scholarly Intelligence in Tokyo, analysed turnaround times for manuscripts across 16 major science publishers. He found that the average turnaround time from manuscript submission to acceptance is increasing — it is now at 149 days, compared with 140 in 2014: a rise of about 6% over the decade (see go.nature.com/4mkm29d).\n\nIOP Publishing, the publishing arm of the UK Institute of Physics in London, surveyed the experiences of researchers (mostly in the physical and environmental sciences) in 2020 and again in 2024. In 2024, half of the 3,000 or so respondents said that the number of peer-review requests they received had gone up over the previous three years (see go.nature.com/4h7gagv). On the encouraging side, only 16% said they received too many requests (down from 26% four years ago), but respondents from Europe and the United States were more likely to say this (see ‘Pressure on reviewers’).\n\nSource: State of Peer Review 2024/IOP Publishing (https://go.nature.com/4JYSDTS)\nReview rewards\n\nMany experiments by funders and journals are aimed at incentivizing researchers to do more reviews, and getting them to send in their assessments more quickly.\n\nSome journals have tried publicly posting review turnaround times, leading to a modest reduction in review completion time, mainly among senior researchers. Others hand out awards for productive reviewers, although there’s some evidence that such prizes led to reviewers completing fewer reviews in subsequent years, possibly because they felt they had done their bit4. Another idea is to change research-assessment practices: an April survey of more than 6,000 scientists by Springer Nature, which publishes Nature, found that 70% wanted their work evaluations to consider their peer-review contributions, but only 50% said they currently did so. (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\nThe ultimate incentive might be financial. A debate about paying reviewers has swung to and fro for years. Supporters argue that it’s a fair reflection of the work and value that reviewers provide. In 2021, Balazs Aczel, a psychologist at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, and his colleagues estimated that reviewers worked for more than 100 million hours on reports in 20205. On the basis of the average salaries of academics, that’s a contribution worth billions of dollars. Critics, however, warn of conflicts of interests and perverse incentives if researchers are paid to review, and point out that most academics say they carry out reviewing duties in their salaried work time.\n\nPotential reviewers rarely indicate why they refuse to review. But Aczel suggests that a growing number resent providing a free service that commercial publishers turn into profits. That point was made strongly by James Heathers, a science-integrity consultant based in Boston, Massachusetts, who in 2020 posted on a blog that he would accept unpaid review invitations only from society, community and other non-profit journals. Big publishers would receive an invoice for $450.\n\nThe move backfired, he jokes now. Although requests from commercial publishers stopped, those from the other categories went up.\n\nPublishers trial paying peer reviewers — what did they find?\n\nThis year, two publications reported on the results of experiments to pay journal reviewers. Critical Care Medicine offered US$250 per report. Its trial, funded by the Canadian government, showed that the offer of payment made reviewers slightly more likely to take up requests (the proportion of invitations accepted rose from 48% to 53% ), with turnaround time boosted slightly from 12 to 11 days. Review reports were of comparable quality6. But the journal doesn’t have the resources to keep paying for reviews, says David Maslove, an associate editor on the journal and a critical-care physician at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada.\n\nBy contrast, the Company of Biologists, a non-profit organization in Cambridge, UK, is continuing with paid review on its journal Biology Open after a successful trial. The journal paid reviewers £220 (US$295) per review, and — unlike Critical Care Medicine — told them it expected a first response within four days, to allow editors to decide on manuscript acceptance or rejection within a week of submission.\n\nEvery manuscript in the trial received a first decision within seven working days, with an average turnaround time of 4.6 business days7. That’s compared with the 38 days the journal was seeing with the standard review process. Journal staff agreed that review quality was upheld, says Biology Open’s managing editor, Alejandra Clark.\n\n“If it is scalable, then we need to figure out how to finance it,” Clark says. “We would obviously like to avoid putting the burden on authors by increasing the APCs [article processing charges] to adjust some of the costs, but these are the discussions we’re having.”\n\nExpanding the reviewer pool\n\nSome funders are also struggling to get reviewers. “It has become increasingly difficult to find people who have the time or ability or want to assess our proposals,” says Hanna Denecke, a team leader at the Volkswagen Foundation, a private funder in Hanover, Germany. That’s despite reviewers being offered almost €1,000 (US$1,160) for a day’s work.\n\nLike ESO, the Volkswagen Foundation has addressed this issue by asking applicants to review other proposals in the same funding round, a system called distributed peer review (DPR).\n\nAnd on 30 June at a conference in London, UK funders announced a successful trial of DPR, which they showed could review grants twice as fast as a typical review process. To get around concern that reviewers might be negative about competitors, applications were split into pools. Researchers don’t review applications from their own pool and so can’t affect the chances of their own applications being accepted.\n\nOne reason the Volkswagen Foundation is keen on DPR is that it moves the decision-making away from senior and more established scientists. “One might say these are kind of gatekeepers who might keep other people out,” Denecke says.\n\nStop the peer-review treadmill. I want to get off\n\nStraining under the weight of increased applications, some funders have turned to ‘demand management’ and will consider only one bid per university for a particular grant. But this just pushes the load of reviewing elsewhere, points out Stephen Pinfield, an information expert at the University of Sheffield, UK. “Institutions then have to run an informal peer-review process to choose which bid they can put forward. It’s just shifting the burden,” he says. Then there are the extra reviews of work and individuals that institutions must conduct to prepare for quality-assurance exercises, such as the UK Research Excellence Framework.\n\n“Very few analyses of the peer-review system take this informal stuff into account at all. And yet it’s enormously time consuming,” Pinfield says.\n\nUltimately, the most scalable solution to the labour problem at funders and journals is to widen the pool of reviewers. The bulk of the growth in research papers that need reviewing comes from authors in less-established scientific nations, points out Pinfield, whereas reviewers tend to be drawn from the same pool of senior academic experts in the West.\n\nA 2016 study suggested that 20% of scientists did between 69% and 94% of the reviewing the previous year8. “The peer-reviewer pool is smaller than the author pool,” Pinfield says. “I think people are feeling that pressure.”\n\nOne issue is that editors naturally gravitate towards asking reviewers who they think do a good job and send reports on time. By expanding their pool of reviewers, they might end up with reviews that are of lower quality or less accurate — a point made by biologist Carl Bergstrom at the University of Washington in Seattle and statistician Kevin Gross at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, in an analysis of the pressures on peer review. Their work was posted as a preprint in July9.\n\nMany science publishers are now using technology to help automate the search for a wider pool of reviewers. In 2023, for instance, a tool that allows editors to search the Scopus database to find reviewers on the basis of subject expertise and other criteria was integrated into the Editorial Manager manuscript system used by many journals worldwide. Other publishers have launched similar software.\n\nAnother idea that’s catching on is joint review: an established academic is paired with an early-career researcher, which brings in a new reviewer and trains them at the same time.\n\nImproving efficiency and quality\n\nOne way to make reviewing more efficient — and perhaps improve quality — is to give referees a series of clear questions to address. This format is known as structured peer review.\n\nLast year, researchers published the results of a rigorous test of how referees respond to this idea.\n\n“As an editor, you get peer-review reports that are not always thorough. Structured peer review is an attempt to actually focus them on questions that we want answers to,” says Mario Malički, a publication-practices specialist at Stanford University in California and co-editor-in-chief of the journal Research Integrity and Peer Review. He did the research with Bahar Mehmani, a publishing-innovation manager at Elsevier in Amsterdam.\n\nIn August 2022, Elsevier ran a pilot in which it asked reviewers to address nine specific questions when they assessed papers submitted to 220 journals. Malički and Mehmani looked at a sample of these manuscripts that had been assessed by two independent reviewers. They found that reviewers were more likely to agree with each other on final recommendations, such as whether the data analysis was correct and the correct experiments carried out, than in manuscripts assessed before the trial started10. (Reviewers still didn’t agree often, however: agreement was 41%, up from 31% before the trial.)\n\nElsevier now uses structured peer review at more than 300 of its journals. Other journals have instituted variants on the idea.\n\nAsking questions seems to help expose gaps in review knowledge, Malički adds, with referees more likely to say that someone else should check technical aspects such as the statistics or the modelling.\n\nBoosting the quality of reviews is also an argument made by those pushing for greater transparency in the peer-review system – by encouraging journals to publish reports alongside published papers, and referees to put their name to them.\n\nTransparent peer review to be extended to all of Nature’s research papers\n\nAdvocates argue that this could boost the status of review reports and so encourage more people to agree to write them. And it could also help to address the criticism that many journals publish shoddy research, which lessens trust in the rigour of the peer-review process writ large. Working out whether reviewers have made an honest attempt to examine a paper or simply waved it through with little scrutiny is hard, because peer review at journals has conventionally been confidential.\n\nPinfield agrees that publishing reviews could boost quality: “If reviewers know their work is going to be made publicly available, it is reasonable to assume that they will ensure the quality of the review is good.”",

          "title": "Why suppressing all wildfires has made today’s megafires worse",
          "authors": "Jason Sharples",
          "abstract": "Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms — reigniting discussions on how to better manage fire risks. And the nature of wildfires is also changing. To avoid the worst damage, the development and behaviour of the most extreme wildfires need to be better understood.\n\nThe idea that wildfires can be managed simply by detecting — using satellites and drones, for example — and suppressing them early has become widespread. That might seem reasonable at first glance, but history tells us otherwise. It could even make things worse in the long run.\n\nYou’re not imagining it: extreme wildfires are now more common\n\nWe have been here before. In 1910, after a series of catastrophic wildfires in the northwestern United States, fire managers adopted a policy of total suppression: preventing ignitions as much as possible. The aim was to extinguish any blaze by 10 a.m. the next day. The policy was implemented using emerging technologies of the time: aircraft and chemical retardants. ‘Smokejumpers’ were trained to parachute into remote areas to quickly smother flames.\n\nThe exclusion of fires in various countries for decades protected homes and businesses to some extent — but it drove key changes in ecosystems. In the western United States, for example, Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests that had been shaped by millennia of frequent low-intensity fires were disrupted. Accumulation of dense thickets of young trees and shrubs increased the frequency of high-intensity fires that propagated through the crowns of trees and shrubs, which these forests were not adapted to withstand. Over time, such intense burning caused loss of biodiversity and altered the structure and composition of the forests in ways that increase the risk of large fires — the very thing the policy was intended to prevent.\n\nFire exclusion has also led to a loss of Indigenous culture and knowledge about managing landscapes with fire. In Australia, for example, Indigenous burning — the practice by Indigenous communities of stewarding ecosystems with controlled, low-intensity fires — was halted by colonizers in the late eighteenth century, leading to the emergence of a more flammable landscape dominated by eucalypt forests.\n\nThe causes of wildfires are clear. How they burn through communities is not\n\nIndeed, the emergence of megafires — those that burn more than 10,000 hectares — in the late twentieth century has been attributed to fire-exclusion policies. The accumulation of fuels combined with a warming climate and urban expansion favours fires that consume vast tracts of land and demand extensive and costly suppression resources.\n\nThe end of the twentieth century also saw a rise in the prevalence of extreme wildfires. Whereas megafires are defined by their size, extreme wildfires are characterized by their behaviour and intensity. They burn hotter than typical wildfires do and develop and propagate differently. For example, they can affect urban areas predominantly through showers of embers, burning leaves or twigs, carried by winds that have been strengthened by the fire’s influence on the atmosphere.",

Last year, we launched our second generation of vehicles, called E2, which have more features, including better range and an on-board charger, which enables charging from standard outlets. We’ve sold 200 E2s so far.\n\nAs a technician, I assemble the electric three-wheelers and fix any mechanical or electrical issues that arise in those that we’ve sold.

          "authors": "Nikita Bezrukov",
          "abstract": "Looking at a document’s history shows how the writer’s thought process evolved — and spotlights AI shortcuts, says Nikita Bezrukov.\n\nI was grading papers for my writing‑heavy seminar on fairness in machine learning, when the references started to get weird. The first DOI I checked returned a 404 error; the second opened a blank page; and a journal article with a plausible title didn’t appear in any database I searched. The same glitches cropped up across several submissions, making it clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI), not the students, was the first author.\n\nThe pattern was easy to spot. The prose was immaculate, yet somehow stilted — the paragraph structure was too precise. The pieces lacked a sense of struggle that signals genuine thought. Each time I opened a file, I asked the same questions: is this data set real? Does this specialist exist? Did the student write any of this? After spending weeks verifying quotations, sources and even author identities, I felt less like a teacher and more like a forensic investigator.\n\nThen a typo jumped off the page of one essay. That paper referred to a “monolinguistic speaker” (as opposed to the standard term, ‘monolingual speaker’). The mistake was small, but it indicated that a person, not a chatbot, had drafted the text. I breathed a sigh of relief. I realized I wanted to see more imperfection.\n\nTracking changes\n\nThe next morning, I announced a new rule to my students, in an attempt to bake that moment into my teaching: assignments could not be submitted as single PDFs showing only the final version. Every document had to have a version history, so that I could see the writing process, not just the final product. I called the resulting score the trajectory grade: 60% of the mark would reflect how ideas developed across drafts, and 40% would cover the quality of the completed version. It was my last semester teaching first-year writing-in-the-disciplines seminars at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, so I was open to experimentation. And the class was small — only 12 students, so it was easy to change course if anything went wrong.\n\nAt first, my students were sceptical, assuming this was a tactic to police their work. A colleague suggested that I use a blockchain analogy to explain my reasoning. That framing changed the mood. Most students already knew that blockchain keeps a transparent, tamper‑resistant ledger of changes: each block stores data, such as transactions, and is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a continuous, verifiable chain. Any attempt to alter a block stands out immediately, so the record is trustworthy. Seeing version‑tracking tools as a classroom‑scale blockchain made sense to the students — and the requirement suddenly felt intuitive, rather than punitive.\n\nBy the end of the semester, I had learnt more from the version histories than I could have from any static paper. In my seminar, first‑year engineering and computer‑science majors choose a topic in emerging technology — for instance, fairness in drone warfare or AI‑driven admissions. Each step builds on the last: they create a literature map and develop it into a data‑rich research paper, which they refashion into public pieces, such as opinion articles and policy briefs. Because every revision was captured, my suspicions around plagiarism disappeared, and AI shortcuts stood out. I could see in detail how each chunk of text evolved over time, quantitatively by how long it took to write as well as by its length, and qualitatively by how its ideas unfolded.\n\nMy own workload improved tremendously. Grading sessions no longer felt like crime‑scene analyses, and I spent less time hunting for signs of AI assistance and more time coaching academic writing strategy. The version-control rule encouraged many students to start earlier and revise steadily, because the transparent history left no way to hide a rushed job uploaded at the deadline. It restored the habits that our writing‑in‑the‑disciplines courses are designed to teach young researchers: incremental progress and thoughtful redrafting. Their final submissions felt earned, rather than delivered by an algorithm.\n\nRevise your rubric",

          "authors": "Melissa Hobson",
          "abstract": "Growing up in the forests of Chicago, Illinois, and the deserts of Phoenix, Arizona, Jaida Elcock never had much access to the ocean — and was even afraid of sharks. But the more she learnt on TV documentaries, the more she realized that we should be advocating for their conservation. “I really don’t want to know what an ocean without sharks looks like,” she says.\n\nHaving earnt a biology degree at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and worked her way up through various internships and laboratory technician positions, Elcock is now a graduate student based in Falmouth, Massachusetts, studying the movement ecology of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus). Along the way, she faced racism, sexism and discrimination, she says.\n\nIn 2020, the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, sparked civil unrest in the United States. On the same day as Floyd’s murder, a white dog walker falsely reported Black birdwatcher Christian Cooper after he asked her to put her dog on a lead. This inspired many Black naturalists, including Elcock, to speak out on social media about their right to exist and occupy outdoor spaces, she says. It also led to the #BlackInNature hashtag, through which Elcock started chatting with fellow shark researchers Amani Webber-Schultz, Jasmin Graham and Carlee Jackson-Bohannon.\n\nPleasantly surprised to realize there were other Black women working in shark science, the four came together and founded Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS), registered in Bradenton, Florida. Its mission is to advance marine sciences by challenging the status quo of what people think a scientist looks like. MISS works to support under-represented and historically excluded communities to help them to feel confident and accepted in science by providing them with access to a community, knowledge and training opportunities. Five years later, the organization has around 400 members in more than 30 countries.\n\nWhat was it like for you as a young Black shark scientist?\n\nI got a lot of pushback for wanting to become a marine scientist. I was once told that I got my university scholarship because of affirmative action, not because I deserved it. People would say things like “Black people can’t swim. How are you going to work with sharks?”. These ridiculous stereotypes exist because of systemic racism that has led to a generational fear of water in a lot of Black communities, and that is not our fault. (When public swimming pools became popular in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, segregation meant that Black people had less access and so less opportunity to learn to swim.)\n\nI was also told that, as a woman, I wouldn’t be strong enough to handle sharks and I should be in the kitchen or raising a family.\n\nThe Minorities in Shark Science team.Credit: Julia Wester, Field School\n\nFor many people, encountering racism and sexism is incredibly discouraging. Why would you want to start a career in which you might hear those things all the time? But I used this pushback as fuel. If you tell me I can’t do something because of a terrible and irrational reason that’s based in hate, racism and sexism, I’m going to say: ‘Okay, watch me’.\n\nWhen we co-founded MISS, we wanted to create a community of people with shared experiences who would support each other, provide a safe space and create opportunities to help them further their careers. Breaking down the social and financial barriers to getting opportunities in the field of marine science was a key goal.\n\nWe launched on Juneteenth (19 June) 2020. This is a really important day for the Black community in the United States: it’s the day that the last enslaved people received word that they had been freed, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, in which president Abraham Lincoln declared that all slaves in the Confederate states were now considered free. Launching on this day was a way of showing our dedication, support and pride in who we are.\n\nDo you feel like the perception of what a shark scientist looks like is changing?\n\nYes, at least in the spaces I’m in. With MISS, we now have a community of minority scientists that people can contact when they want to highlight certain people in science, whether that’s for a TV show or a school talk.\n\nTV production teams now have somewhere to go to when most shark scientists on their shows are white dudes and they want to highlight the amazing work of other scientists as well. That’s not to say that these white guys aren’t also good at their job, but we want to remind people that there are other scientists out there.\n\nFor younger people, seeing themselves represented is so important, and I think we’re seeing a shift. Young people are now more exposed than before to all these diverse people in science. Seeing someone else who looks like them doing it shows that it could be an option for them, too.\n\nDo you see any parallels between the stereotypes of who can be a shark scientist and which of the 500 or so shark species typically get more attention, such as great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias)?\n\nOn nature shows, you always see the same thing — great whites breaching — and that’s cool. But what about the swell shark (Cephaloscyllium ventriosum), which swallows seawater to prevent itself from getting eaten by predators? What about the pocket shark (Mollisquama parini) that spews bioluminescent goo out of a pocket behind its fins?\n\nThere are parallels with diversity in science, for sure. You often see this one type of scientist — in the same way you see this one type of shark — but there are so many other cool options. We can show appreciation for all these other sharks and shark scientists as well. The more diversity we have in people, the more diversity we’ll get in thought. That’s going to lead to more innovation, more discovery and better science as a whole.\n\nHow does MISS help its members?\n\nWe run webinars and pair people up with mentors to help them apply for funding opportunities, fellowship programmes or graduate school. We also fundraise and apply for grants to support marine scientists from minority groups. We also run collaborative working groups, opportunities such as shark-tagging workshops and our Diversifying Ocean Sciences programme, in which people can learn lab and fieldwork techniques.\n\nJaida Elcock handling a shark tail while at sea.Credit: Jackson Coles, Field School",

          "title": "Environmental politics is doomed to fail — unless we tell better stories",
          "authors": "Philip Macnaghten",
          "abstract": "Captured Futures: Rethinking the Drama of Environmental Politics Maarten A. Hajer and Jeroen Oomen Oxford Univ. Press (2025)\n\nEvery now and again, you look forward to a book. You follow the pre-publication talks, the promise, the drama. I have known political scientist Maarten Hajer for three decades as an academic, policymaker and activist. If anyone has the skills and know-how to deeply understand the logic of environmental politics, it’s him.\n\nAnd this book exceeded my expectations. Written with rising-star social scientist Jeroen Oomen, Captured Futures is powerful, timely and consequential. It is arguably the most important book on environmental politics in the past decade. The concept of a ‘captured future’ shows brilliantly how environmental politics has become trapped in ways that both reproduce its own failure and restrict people’s ability to imagine alternatives.\n\nScience’s big problem is a loss of influence, not a loss of trust\n\nThe book starts by marshalling evidence that environmental politics is falling short on global environmental health. It’s a familiar list, including unmet targets for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and continuing losses of biodiversity, fertile soils and fresh water.\n\nThen, the authors present a radical idea: that environmental politics, as it is currently configured and practised, is bound to fail. This is not because of a lack of political will, or regulatory or state obstacles, but because of the conceptual framework — the ‘dramaturgical regime’ — through which the rules and conventions of environmental politics are being enacted and performed.\n\nFailed system\n\nAt the heart of this regime is ecological modernization: a set of convictions that has held sway for three decades. These include that technological and market-based solutions can remediate environmental crises; that natural science, with its value-neutral ‘facts’, can provide the necessary knowledge to create these solutions; and that policymakers, in their ‘pilot’ role, define global options, goals and targets.\n\nIn this system, if targets go unmet despite the presentation of scientific evidence, the only response available to those in the political cockpit is to escalate the urgency of their language. Ever-stronger images of impending catastrophe further diminish citizens’ feelings of political agency and exacerbate many people’s already pronounced senses of despair, despondency and alienation. As the ultimate technocratic solution, climate geoengineering represents ecological modernization’s last stand.\n\nThe common narrative of ‘win–win solutions’ and ‘positive-sum games’ is over. The authors describe how environmental policy’s increasing effects on everyday life — through mobility, energy and housing — are generating political responses. This as an “age of backlash”, they write, pointing to the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement in France and farmers’ street protests across Europe.\n\nA gilet jaunes protester at a demonstration in Lyon, France in 2019.Credit: Romain Costaseca/Hans Lucas/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty\n\nWorse, the dramaturgical regime is unwittingly contributing to political polarization. Many people, including populists and some on the right, increasingly view the climate-change community, and universities more broadly, as part of a globalist and elitist system pitted against ordinary people. This dynamic has intensified this year, particularly in the United States, where the Trump administration has attacked elite universities including Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and slashed funding for federal environmental and health agencies.\n\nTurning the tide\n\nEcological politics needs to tell a more aspirational story. We need to move from stories that evoke fear and despair towards ones that give hope and renewal. And we need to raise awareness of potential futures that are just as desirable as the consumer-based dreams we have become so attached to. To convey the task ahead, the authors analyse how fossil fuels and the lifestyles they enable are deeply and seductively embedded in most people’s senses of personal freedom, lifestyle and identity. The ‘American dream’ is alive, and it’s global.\n\nTo learn about what might work, Hajer and Oomen analyse two historical examples of intellectual discourses that have shifted the societal mood. UK economist and social reformer William Beveridge laid out the principles of the modern welfare state in a 1942 report, with radical ideas about how to eradicate poverty that were strong enough for people to fight for. Efforts by think tanks and others shifted conservative thought in the 1960s and 1970s towards neoliberal concepts such as property ownership, deregulation, privatization and free markets.\n\nToday, three eco-political discourses are bubbling: ‘beyond growth’ questions the necessity for economic growth; decolonization scholars critique models of development that reinforce the dominance of former colonial powers; and eco-conservatism focuses on one’s duty as a steward to protect the natural world. But these debates, although valuable, remain mainly intellectual and resonate only marginally with the public.\n\nTrump supporters gathering in Nashville, Tennessee, during his 2024 presidential campaign.Credit: Sergio Flores/AFP/Getty\n\nWhere else might someone look? One approach that Hajer and Oomen don’t discuss is closer examination of shifts in everyday lived experiences, and the social, cultural and political trends that underpin them. Think of four brilliant sociologists: Ulrich Beck, John Urry, Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells. Rather than extolling vanguard visions that could be rolled out into political projects, each of them sought to see the world around them with acute sensitivity and then develop concepts and theories attuned to what they saw.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nBeck’s ‘risk society’ reflected a globalized world that is imbued with invisible, uninsurable, unattributable and potentially irreversible risks. Urry’s ‘disorganized capitalism’ describes the shift away from the structured, hierarchical and relatively stable form of ‘organized capitalism’. Giddens’s ‘reflexive modernization’ unpacks the double-edged nature of modernity in relation to science, individualism, capitalism and industrialism. Castells’ ‘network society’ describes the growth of forms of social organization based on networks rather than conventional hierarchies.\n\nSuch on-the-ground thinking could be applied, for example, to the wave of conservatism manifesting in global politics, from the United States to Argentina, Finland and Italy. On the night of US President Donald Trump’s election, when it was becoming clear that he not only won the election but had increased his majority across key demographics (including Black and Hispanic voters, rural voters, religious voters, men under 50 and even naturalized citizens), I asked myself, why? Since then, I have sought to understand, and empathize with, the structure of feeling that underpins this new form of conservatism.\n\nAsk the people\n\nSociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild’s Strangers in their Own Land (2016) offers some insights. Her ethnographic look at the emotional lives of arch-conservatives in Bayou country, Louisiana, based on fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2016, explores why increasingly disaffected people tend to move to the political right and not the left.",

          "title": "How researcher visa curbs threaten science careers",
          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "Credit: Steven Puetzer/Getty\n\nFatemeh Ajallooeian was thrilled when, in June 2024, she received a Swiss National Science Foundation mobility fellowship to go abroad to continue her palaeoclimate research. Ajallooeian, then a biogeochemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, wrote a proposal with a colleague at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, because, she told Nature, Harvard was the only institution with the state-of-the-art mass spectrometry equipment she needed to trace the microbial lipids that can act as indicators of past temperatures.\n\nOn 22 August that year, Ajallooeian, a postdoctoral researcher, applied to the US State Department for a category J visa, which is meant for exchange scholars with funds to cover their research and salary. Following Donald Trump’s re-election as US president in November 2024, she has been on an emotional rollercoaster. First there was the arrest of scholars who protested about the war in Gaza. Then, the attacks on Harvard began. But the truly heart-sinking moment occurred when Iran, her country of birth, appeared on the Trump administration’s updated travel ban list in June.\n\nOver the past few months, Ajallooeian and her partner have e-mailed the US embassy in Bern 18 times, seeking updates on her visa application.\n\n“I have had a lot of panic attacks,” she says. “I don’t have family in Iran. My research is not political.”\n\nAn Iranian citizen trying to get a visa to do palaeoclimate research at Harvard University is probably one of the most politically fraught combinations at this moment. On 28 July, Harvard terminated Ajallooeian’s application, citing the new travel ban. Her struggle is a microcosm of the uncertainties and mobility challenges that international scholars currently face amid anti-immigration sentiment in many countries.\n\nEconomic consequences\n\nThe visa bans and delays promise not only to upend the careers of international students but also to cause drastic economic impacts to the United States. In addition to the 4 June visa bans targeting 19 countries, visa interviews were paused between 27 May and 18 June 2025 — normally the peak period for issuing visas — for students seeking to enrol in a US institution this autumn.\n\nChina, India and Japan were among the countries reporting limited US appointments for their students during that period. If the issuing of visas does not recover significantly in July and August, up to 150,000 fewer international students will arrive in the United States this autumn, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a non-profit organization, based in Washington DC, that is dedicated to international education and exchange. If those numbers materialize, the potential economic impact could reach US$7 billion in lost spending and lead to the loss of more than 60,000 jobs.\n\nImmigration was already a hot topic in not just the United States, but also Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. All four countries are heavily involved in training early-career researchers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and their policies have already, or could soon, set caps on visa numbers or raise visa fees.\n\nAt the same time, some countries are streamlining visa applications to attract coveted skilled workers. Last December, the Australian government introduced the national innovation visa: a permanent visa available to migrants, including global researchers, who have a demonstrated ability to benefit Australia’s prosperity. France, Germany and Ireland are increasing their international student recruitment. Later this year, the European Commission is expected to present a visa strategy for the European Union that will include measures to support the arrival of top students and researchers.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to students, academics and immigration-policy specialists in the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and Australia to take the pulse of student-visa challenges. Several early-career researchers requested anonymity for fear of visa reprisals.\n\nUS crackdown\n\nThe burdens on international visa holders in the United States are already considerable. A survey, conducted last year, of more than 700 international postdocs at Harvard Medical School found that many spent more than a month in their home country to renew their visa, at a cost of more than $2,000 in some cases1. Individuals from Asian countries, however, were especially likely to report that visa renewals can take up to six months and cost up to $5,000. As a consequence, nearly 75% of respondents reported anxiety and burnout; 30% reported taking time off work as a result.\n\nThe Trump administration has rolled out a number of controversial initiatives in a bid to curtail visas for international researchers. In April, at least 1,680 students had their international status terminated in a database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. Almost 300 international students filed dozens of lawsuits aimed at challenging their visa terminations.\n\nThat same month, the US State Department announced that it would scrutinize the social-media activity of visitors to the country. In May, US secretary of state Marco Rubio announced that the department would vigorously revoke visas issued to students from China.\n\nHarvard computational biologist John Quackenbush likens the US visa uncertainty that many foreign students face to a self-inflicted wound for the country.Credit: Kent Dayton/Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\n\nBut 4 June proved most consequential for Ajallooeian. On that day, the Trump administration not only restricted international students from attending Harvard University, but also issued a travel ban on the citizens of twelve countries, including Iran, Libya, Sudan and Yemen, and strict travel restrictions on another seven countries, including Venezuela, Cuba and Turkmenistan.\n\nAn ongoing lawsuit filed by Harvard University has temporarily halted the ban on the attendance of international students. John Quackenbush, a computational biologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Heallth in Boston, Massachusetts, says that Harvard’s biostatistics programme admitted eight PhD students this year, roughly half the typical number, owing to concerns over funding. But only four students accepted; two international and two domestic. And the university is concerned that the two international students might not be able to attend because of current visa policies.\n\nQuackenbush also oversees a two-year master’s in computational biology and quantitative genetics, one of three biostatistics master’s programmes that have grown in recent years to admit roughly 80 students annually, many of them from abroad.\n\nFlurry of concern\n\nBut with the uncertainty about how many students will arrive in the autumn, it’s challenging to determine which classes to offer. “It’s so short-sighted, it’s a self-inflicted wound,” Quackenbush says. “If we want to make America great again, shouldn’t we accept the best and brightest from overseas?”\n\nBy 11 June, following a trade deal with China, however, President Trump signalled that students from China were now welcome — a sign that politics is playing a more prominent part in student exchange.\n\nVisa denials for international scholars had already reached a high in 2024 — a trend that is anticipated to increase, according to the Cato Institute, a think tank based in Washington DC. The end result, it predicts, will be fewer visa applications.\n\nThe moves have caused a flurry of concern among overseas scholars. A student in China, who has just accepted an offer to do a master’s in biomedical informatics at the University of Washington in Seattle, says she was asked before her visa interview to supply information about her social-media accounts.\n\n“It wasn’t a smooth process,” she says. Even though she has been accepted into the two-year master’s programme and certified as such by the university, she was only granted a one-year F-1 academic visa. She plans to take up the offer, knowing that she probably won’t be able to travel outside of the United States during the course. “I just feel so insecure about my future,” she says.\n\nUndue stress\n\nA fifth-year PhD student from China, who studies cancer immunotherapies at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, had come to the United States as an undergraduate during the first Trump administration. She stayed to take advantage of what she describes as “top-notch US biomedical research training”. Even though the new travel restrictions don’t specifically target China, they add undue stress to her life.\n\n“I haven’t visited home in four years,” she says — and she doesn’t plan to until she’s completed her PhD. “I can’t take the risk.” The university’s international office has advised students from countries on the travel-ban list, and China, not to leave the country unless absolutely necessary. Not only can she not visit her family, she cannot travel to international conferences to present her work, build her professional network or find job leads. As a result, she feels isolated.\n\nTo feel more empowered, she engages with the university’s student union on visa issues. She’s helped to draft recommendations for international student protections, including paid visa leave to deal with the paperwork and interviews involved, and the setting up of a hotline for international-student visa issues (the university administration has so far rejected their proposals). Because international students cannot vote in US elections, “the union offers what few civil rights that international students have”, she explains.\n\nBleak outlook\n\nBefore the second Trump administration, she thought she would apply for a job at a US-based pharmaceutical company. Now, she plans to conduct a global job search because the US outlook is bleak as a result of visa issues and drastic cuts to research funding. “How am I, as an international worker, going to compete with laid-off US citizens?” she asks. “I want to work somewhere where I feel seen, valued and appreciated.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to use international research visas from particular countries as a bargaining chip during trade negotiations are expected to further erode scientific exchange between the United States and China — and to have wide-ranging impacts. “I can think of few other policy levers you could pull to bring global science to a halt,” says Brendan Cantwell, a higher-education researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing. US–China research collaborations, which are particularly important in the physical and natural-science fields, have been more difficult since the COVID-19 pandemic, he adds.\n\nCantwell predicts that international scholars will experience mixed messages, with universities seeking to reassure students amid the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. At the end of the day, however, one factor is likely to be the biggest concern — money. “Visas will be tougher to get but universities will still try to recruit and support students. But if research funding falls off a cliff, they will not be able to fund students or research projects,” he says.\n\nShifting global landscape\n\nIn recent years, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom have also been grappling with how to balance immigration concerns with the desire to attract top scientific talent.\n\n“The concerns about the numbers of international students in general pre-date the second Trump administration,” says Cantwell. And, he adds, concerns about rising housing costs and demands on public services that accompany influxes of immigrants have been the focus of lengthy political discussions in all three countries. In Canada, for example, the vast majority of international students end up at universities in the three largest cities — Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal — which has contributed to a spike in unaffordable housing.\n\nCanada and Australia have imposed caps on incoming international students. In January 2024, for example, the Canadian government announced that it wanted to achieve zero net growth in its international student population — amounting to a 35% reduction in study permits that would be approved. Both countries, as well as the United Kingdom, have seen declines in international student applications.\n\nThe policy shifts have had a direct impact in Canada, says Larissa Bezo, president and chief executive of the Canadian Bureau of International Education, a non-profit organization of international education professionals based in Ottawa. “It sent the message that we were closing the door to international students — which we really have not,” she says. “We have room for hundreds of thousands of students and world-class STEM institutions keen to host them,” she adds, noting that study permits at universities located outside the big cities are often easier to obtain.\n\nThe student response has been immediate. Canada has seen a 32% drop in international student applications and a 48% decline in new study permits issued since 2023 — much more than its original 35% reduction target, according to ICEF Monitor, a website tracking international education and student recruitment. In the first quarter of 2025, there was a significant decline in applications from India, says Bezo.\n\nCanada has not closed the door to foreign students, says Larissa Bezo.Credit: Gregory Abraszko\n\nSimilarly, Australia’s effort to slow the flow of foreign students, its total population of which sits at roughly 825,000, seems to have worked. A now-revoked policy known as Ministerial Direction 107, which gave Australia’s top universities priority in the processing of student-visa applications and doubled visa fees, effectively capped the number of international students at 270,000 last year — an annual decline of nearly 40%.",

          "title": "Is your AI benchmark lying to you?",
          "authors": "Michael Brooks",
          "abstract": "Anshul Kundaje sums up his frustration with the use of artificial intelligence in science in three words: “bad benchmarks propagate”.\n\nKundaje researches computational genomics at Stanford University in California. He is keen to incorporate any form of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps to accelerate progress in his field — and countless researchers have stepped up to offer tools for this purpose. But finding the ones that work best is becoming ever harder because some researchers have been making questionable claims about the AI models they have developed. These claims can take months to check. And they often turn out to be false — mainly because the benchmarks used to demonstrate and compare performance of these tools are not fit for purpose.\n\nBy then, it’s often too late: Kundaje and his colleagues are left playing whack-a-mole after the flawed benchmarks have been adopted and ‘improved’ by enthusiastic, but naive, users. “In the meantime, everyone has been using these [benchmarks] for all kinds of wrong stuff, and then you have wrong information and wrong predictions out there,” he says.\n\n‘Another DeepSeek moment’: Chinese AI model Kimi K2 stirs excitement\n\nThis is just one reason why a growing number of scientists worry that, until benchmarking is radically improved, AI systems designed to accelerate progress in science will have the opposite effect.\n\nA benchmark is a test that can be used to compare the performance of different methods, just as the standard length of a metre provides a way to assess the accuracy of a ruler. “It’s the standardization and definition of what we mean by progress,” says Max Welling, a machine-learning researcher and co-founder of CuspAI, an AI company based in Cambridge, UK. Good benchmarks allow a user to choose the best method for a particular application, or to determine whether more conventional algorithms might give a better result. “But the first question,” says Welling, “is, what do we mean by ‘better’?”\n\nIt’s a surprisingly deep question. Does ‘better’ mean faster? Cheaper? More accurate? If you’re buying a car, you’ll need to consider a wide range of factors, such as acceleration, boot capacity and safety, each with its own degree of importance to you. AI benchmark tools are no different — for some applications, speed might not matter as much as accuracy, for instance.\n\nBut it’s even more complicated than that. If your benchmark is badly designed, the information it gives you could be misleading. If there’s ‘leakage’, in which the benchmarking relies on data that were used to train the algorithm, the benchmark becomes more of a game of memory than a test of problem-solving. Or the test might just be irrelevant to your needs: it might be overly specific, for instance, hiding a system’s inability to answer the broad swathe of questions you’re interested in.\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide\n\nThis is a problem that Kundaje and his colleagues have identified with DNA language models (DNALMs), which AI developers think could assist the discovery of interesting regulatory mechanisms in a genome. Around 1.5% of the human genome is made up of protein-coding sequences that provide templates for creating RNA (transcription) and proteins (translation). Between 5% and 20% of the genome is made up of non-coding regulatory elements that coordinate gene transcription and translation. Get the DNALMs right, and they could help to interpret and discover functional sequences, predict the consequences of altering those sequences, and redesign them to have specific, desired properties.\n\nSo far, however, DNALMs have fallen short of these goals. According to Kundaje and his colleagues, that is partly because they are not being used for the right tasks. They are being designed to compare favourably against benchmark tests, many of which evaluate usefulness not to key biological applications but rather to surrogate objectives that the models can meet1. The situation is not unlike schools that ‘teach to the test’ — you end up with students (or AI tools) that are qualified to pass a test, but do little else.\n\nKundaje and his colleagues at Stanford University have found these crucial shortcomings in several popular DNALM benchmarks, data sets and metrics. For example, one key task is evaluating a model’s ability to rank functional genetic variants: changes in DNA sequences that can influence disease risk or molecular function in cells. Although some DNALMs are simply not evaluated on this task, others use flawed benchmark data sets that fail to account for ‘linkage disequilibrium’, the non-random association of genetic variants.\n\nThat makes it harder to isolate the true functional variants, a flaw that yields unrealistic estimates of these models’ abilities to pinpoint such variants. It’s a rookie error, Kundaje says. “This doesn’t require deep domain knowledge — it’s genetics 101.”\n\nTransparency and puffery\n\nInadequate benchmarks are creating a similar teaching-to-the-test problem in a range of scientific disciplines. But the failures don’t happen only because it is challenging to create a good benchmark: it’s often because there’s not enough pressure to do better, according to Nick McGreivy, who completed his PhD in the application of AI in physics last year at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nMost people who use AI for science seem content to allow the developers of AI tools to evaluate their usefulness using their own criteria. That’s like letting pharmaceutical companies decide whether their drug should go to market, McGreivy says. “The same people who evaluate the performance of AI models also benefit from those evaluations,” he says. That means that, even if research isn’t deliberately fraudulent, it can be biased.\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society\n\nLorena Barba, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at the George Washington University in Washington DC, has a similar perspective. Science is suffering because of “poor transparency, glossing over limitations, closet failures, overgeneralization, data negligence, gatekeeping and puffery” in attempts to put AI to work in real-world settings, as she put it in a 2023 talk at the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nBarba’s own field is fluid dynamics — which involves the study of problems such as smoothing the flow of air over an aircraft’s wings to improve fuel efficiency. Doing that involves solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but that isn’t straightforward: most PDEs can’t be solved through numerical analysis. Instead, the solutions must be approximated through a process that is similar to (expertly guided) trial and error.\n\nThe mathematical tools that accomplish this are known as standard solvers. Although they are relatively effective, they also require significant computational resources. That’s why many people in fluid dynamics hope that AI — specifically machine-learning approaches — can help them to do more with fewer resources.\n\nMachine learning is the form of AI that has seen the most progress in the past five years — mainly because of the availability of training data. Machine learning involves feeding data into an algorithm that looks for patterns or makes predictions. The parameters of the algorithm can be tweaked to optimize the usefulness of the predictions.\n\nIn theory, machine learning could deliver solutions to PDEs faster and using fewer computing resources than conventional methods. The trouble is, if you cannot trust that the benchmarks used to evaluate performance are useful or reliable, how can you trust the output of the models they validate?\n\nNick McGreivy found that some published improvements to AI models made misleading claims.Credit: Nicholas McGreivy\n\nMcGreivy and his colleague Ammar Hakim, a computational physicist at Princeton University, have conducted an analysis of published ‘improvements’ to standard solvers and found that 79% of the papers they studied make problematic claims2. Much of that is to do with benchmarking against what they term weak baselines. This can come from unfair comparisons: machine learning for PDE could be seen as more efficient in terms of computing resources — a shorter runtime, for example — than a standard solver. But unless the solutions have similar accuracy, the comparison is meaningless. The researchers suggest that comparisons must be made at either equal accuracy or equal runtime.\n\nAnother source of weak benchmarking is comparing an AI application with non-AI numerical methods that are relatively inefficient. In 2021, for instance, data scientist Sifan Wang, who is now at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and computer scientist Paris Perdikaris at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia claimed that their machine-learning-based solver for a different class of differential equations yielded a 10-to-50-fold speed-up compared with a conventional numerical solver3. But as Chris Rackauckas, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, pointed out in a video, the pair weren’t comparing it with state-of-the-art numerical solvers, some of which could do the job 7,000 times faster — just running on a standard laptop — than Wang and Perdikaris’ approach.\n\nReady or not, AI is coming to science education — and students have opinions\n\n“To be fair to [Perdikaris], after I had pointed this out, they did edit their paper,” Rackauckas says. However, he adds, the original paper is the only version that is accessible without a paywall, and so still engenders false hope concerning AI’s promise in this area.\n\nThere are many such misleading claims, McGreivy warns. The scientific literature is “not a reliable source for evaluating the success of machine learning at solving PDEs”, he says. In fact, he remains unconvinced that machine learning has anything to offer in this area. “In PDE research, machine learning has been and remains a solution looking for a problem,” he says.\n\nJohannes Brandstetter, a machine-learning researcher at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, and co-founder of an AI-driven physics simulation start-up company called Emmi AI, is more optimistic. He points to the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) competition that enabled machine learning to assist with the prediction of 3D protein structures from their amino-acid sequences4.",

          "abstract": "Collisions: A Physicist’s Journey from Hiroshima to the Death of the Dinosaurs Alec Nevala-Lee W. W. Norton (2025)\n\nPhysicist Luis Alvarez (1911–88) led such a vivid life that he is a biographer’s dream. Agile and daring, Alvarez was also pitiless, egotistical and abrasive. He flew in one of the aeroplanes that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, on 6 August 1945. He engaged publicly with controversial topics, including whether unidentified flying objects (UFOs) existed, and who might have been behind the assassination of US president John F. Kennedy on 22 November 1963. He also came up with a persuasive explanation for what killed the dinosaurs.\n\nNuclear-weapons risks are back — and we need to act like it\n\nThe challenge, for a biographer, is how to describe the science that drove Alvarez. As revealed in Collisions, Alec Nevala-Lee, who has written novels as well as biographies, is up to the task. Beyond Alvarez’s personality and his moments in the public eye, Nevala-Lee expertly conveys his path through an extraordinary era of US particle physics — a turbulent time that required courage, luck and skill.\n\nThe dramatic opening scene, at a California shooting range in 1970, is unforgettable. The only person charged with Kennedy’s assassination fired his gun from behind the president, but a video showed Kennedy’s head snapping backwards. To some people, this suggested that a second gunman fired from the front, and that a conspiracy was involved. Alvarez realized that this need not be the case.\n\nFrom a physics perspective, Alvarez thought, a bullet fired from behind could have shattered Kennedy’s skull in such a way that the momentum of the resulting jet of bone fragments pushed the head back. Alvarez enlisted a sharpshooter to fire bullets at a series of melons to test this idea, which the results supported. Nevala-Lee manages to capture the drama, physics, gruesomeness and political importance of this episode, all at once.\n\nDiverse talents\n\nAlvarez owed his Hispanic surname to his grandfather, an immigrant from Spain. After earning his PhD in 1936 at the University of Chicago, Illinois, he went to work for accelerator builder Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, Berkeley. Four years later, after the start of the Second World War, Alvarez went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge to work on radar technology. The knowledge he gained allowed him to help develop the first system that enabled pilots to land during limited visibility using only instrumentation. Alvarez also designed pressure gauges to measure the strength of explosives, earning him a seat on one of the planes bound for Hiroshima.\n\nAlvarez witnessed the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, from a plane in August 1945.Credit: US Government/Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory\n\nThe book’s description of Alvarez’s flight to Hiroshima and back is haunting: meeting the other planes over Iwo Jima, seeing the flash of white light as the bomb exploded and the telltale N-shaped pulse on the oscilloscope screen and experiencing the first shock wave followed by a second one, reflected from the ground.\n\nIn the 1950s, after returning to Berkeley as a physics professor, Alvarez developed bubble chambers — instruments that recorded on film the tracks of particles created by particle accelerators. This work earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968. His research contributed to substantial changes in US high-energy physics, which transformed from being a field with a few creative individuals to one involving large teams working in industrial facilities.\n\nControversial decisions\n\nMany scientists might find making discoveries an end in itself, but Nevala-Lee identifies Alvarez’s particular talent of using inventions to unlock practical puzzles that seem far from physics. “If someone thinks of a key,” Alvarez said, “I can fit it into something.”",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "McMurdo station is the largest US Antarctic research base.Credit: Hubertus Kanus/Science Photo Library\n\nAround 40% of people who filled out a survey about working at US Antarctic research bases in the past two years reported experiencing sexual harassment or assault during their time on the ice. Almost half of those were people working there for the first time.\n\nScientists say harassment in the Antarctic must stop — but US plan falls short\n\nThese and other statistics come from an extensive new questionnaire commissioned by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) about sexual misconduct in the US Antarctic research programme. It is the most thorough look yet at a persistent and pervasive problem that has affected the careers of many polar scientists and triggered investigations by the US Congress.\n\nScientists who have worked with the US Antarctic Program say they are tentatively hopeful that the survey will bring about lasting change at the NSF and the polar programmes it oversees. It is “an important step towards addressing these challenges”, says Asa Rennermalm, a physical geographer and polar scientist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. “Surveys like this play a critical role in documenting lived experiences that have too often been ignored or minimized.”\n\n“Our biggest takeaway is we have our work cut out for us,” says an NSF spokesperson.\n\nThe agency says it will use the findings of the 18 July report to strengthen safety plans for scientists and others working in Antarctica. “The survey made clear that meaningful change is happening, but that it also needs to continue,” said Renée Ferranti, special assistant to the director of the NSF for sexual assault and harassment prevention, at a webinar last week to disseminate the survey results.\n\nBut with US President Donald Trump calling for huge budget cuts at the agency and targeting issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, it is unclear what capacity the NSF will have to respond. “We are carefully reviewing the recommendations and considering our next steps to ensure that we can take effective actions within our available resources,” says the agency spokesperson.\n\nIf the NSF’s Antarctic programmes have to scale back because of budget cuts, that, “combined with a diminished political emphasis on workplace safety and community, will significantly slow progress”, says Leigh Stearns, a glaciologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. But the new report does suggest that awareness of sexual misconduct in Antarctica and support for stopping it is improving, she says.\n\nRemote work\n\nThe agency commissioned the survey from an independent firm, which sent invitations to everyone who was deployed with the US Antarctic Program between 2022 and 2024. That included scientists, students, contractors, military personnel and others who worked on bases such as the sprawling McMurdo station on the Ross Sea.\n\nDoes US science have a future in Antarctica? Trump cuts threaten to cancel fieldwork and more\n\nOf the 679 people who responded, 521 completed a ‘victimization inventory’ to provide further details on their experiences. Of those, 41% reported experiencing at least one incident of sexual assault or harassment, such as unwanted touching or sexual comments. Nearly 69% of the 572 people who responded to detailed questions about being a bystander said they had witnessed at least one such incident. The harassment spanned genders, with 59% of victims being female and 36% men, and came from a variety of sources, with 51% perpetrated by a contractor and 18% by a supervisor.",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "In 2022, PLoS ONE retracted more than 100 papers after an editor noticed an unusual spike in submissions. An independent study has now looked at the journal's retraction history more in depth. Credit: Getty\n\nNearly one-third of all retracted papers at PLoS ONE can be traced back to just 45 researchers who served as editors at the journal, an analysis of its publication records has found.\n\nThe study1, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on 4 August, found that 45 editors handled only 1.3% of all articles published by PLoS ONE from 2006 to 2023, but that the papers they accepted accounted for more than 30% of the 702 retractions that the journal issued by early 2024. Twenty-five of these editors also authored papers in PLoS ONE that were later retracted.\n\nThe PNAS authors did not disclose the names of any of the 45 editors. But, by independently analysing publicly available data from PLoS ONE and the Retraction Watch database, Nature’s news team has identified five of the editors who handled the highest number of papers that were subsequently retracted by the journal. Together, those editors accepted about 15% of PLoS ONE’s retracted papers up to 14 July.\n\n“The footprints that systematic fraud leaves in the literature are so massive that there’s no way that it’s just a couple of bad authors,” says PNAS study co-author Reese Richardson, a metascientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “There is complicity from within the journal-appointed editors that allows for this to happen.”\n\n“PLOS has long been aware of the issue addressed in this article,” says Renee Hoch, head of publication ethics at the publisher. “In each case we promptly removed the people of concern from PLOS editorial boards and took action as needed on the affected articles.” She adds that “the issues discussed in this article are not specific to PLoS One and have been affecting journals and publishers across the industry”.\n\nCassidy Sugimoto, a science-policy researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, calls the findings “disheartening”. But, she says, they show “that we have the tools and mechanisms to identify misconduct at scale, and begin to uproot some of the poor behaviours that are happening in science”. Sugimoto adds that the study cannot not determine whether all flagged editors acted deliberately to slip problematic work through peer review, or whether they were “negligent in their duties”. Papers can be retracted by their authors or publishers for myriad reasons, including honest errors, authorship disputes or problems that arise from research misconduct.\n\nEditors with high retraction rates\n\nPLoS ONE is published by the open-access Public Library of Science (PLOS) in San Francisco, California. The journal relies on thousands of volunteer academic editors, who handle submissions and oversee peer review, with support from 22 staff editors.\n\nIn the PNAS study, researchers examined 276,956 articles published in PLoS ONE from its launch in 2006 to late 2023, and tracked 134,983 authors and 18,329 handling editors. They identified 22 editors who disproportionately accepted papers that were later retracted, and 33 others who accepted papers that had been flagged on PubPeer — a site for post-publication peer review — more frequently than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, the analysis identified 21 authors who seemed to steer their submissions towards the group of 22 editors flagged for high retraction rates.\n\nThe study reveals how individuals can form coordinated networks and work under the guise of editorial duty to push large amounts of problematic research into the scientific literature, in some cases with links to paper mills — businesses that churn out fake papers and sell authorship slots.\n\nHoch denies that PLoS ONE systematically allows authors to choose who is assigned to handle their submission. “Editor assignment at PLoS One is done via an algorithm that matches submissions to editors with suitable expertise, or in a minority of cases PLOS staff manually research and assign editors. Author requests for specific editors are not honoured or even considered in most cases, and when they are considered they are carefully vetted for potential competing interests.”\n\nConflicting interests\n\nIn 2022, PLoS ONE retracted more than 100 papers after an editor noticed an unusual spike in submissions, many in agricultural research, from one author. The journal’s investigation found that some academic editors had handled manuscripts from the same authors repeatedly, co-authored papers with them and manipulated peer review.\n\nIn their analysis of PLoS ONE’s publication records, Richardson and his colleagues identified 19 researchers — based in 4 countries — who served as academic editors between 2020 and 2023, and repeatedly handled each other’s submissions. More than half of the papers they accepted were later retracted, with nearly identical notices citing concerns about authorship, peer review and competing interests.\n\nNature’s analysis identified 3 of those 19 editors. Shahid Farooq, a plant biologist at Harran University in Şanlıurfa, Turkey, topped the list of PLoS ONE editors ordered by the number of retracted papers that they handled. Between 2019 and 2023, Farooq was responsible for editing 79 articles, 52 of which were subsequently retracted. All of the retraction notices stated that the papers were “identified as one of a series of submissions” for which the journal had concerns about authorship, competing interests and peer review. Farooq also co-authored seven articles in PLoS ONE that were later retracted with identical retraction notices.\n\nFarooq told Nature in an e-mail statement that he relied on reviewers’ reports to make his editorial decisions, and that editors had limited tools to detect conflicts of interest. In a 2022 press release, PLOS’s Hoch said that “internal competing interest checks” were not “equipped to identify co-publication histories” at the time. PLOS introduced new policies in 2023 to try to prevent manipulation of the publication process. More recently, journals have started using automated tools for analysing co-authorship patterns and flagging potential paper-mill issues.\n\nFarooq says that PLoS ONE removed him from the editorial board in 2022, and that he subsequently resigned from his editorial positions in other journals, including Frontiers in Agronomy and BMC Plant Biology. “My editing experience has changed to not editing any paper for any publisher, as the publishers become innocent once any issues are raised on the published papers,” he added.\n\nAnother editor flagged in Nature’s analysis is Zhihan Lv (also known as Zhihan Lyu), a researcher in virtual reality, who ranked second in the list of editors who handled high numbers of retracted PLoS ONE papers. Between 2017 and 2021, Lv edited 54 papers, and 43 of these have been retracted, including 31 this year. All notices cited concerns about peer-review integrity and potential manipulation of the publication process.\n\nLv was also an editor for more than 400 papers in journals published by Hindawi — a subsidiary of New Jersey-based publisher Wiley that has now ceased activity. Many of these papers have been retracted. In 2024, the journal Neural Computing and Applications — published by London-based Springer Nature — retracted 24 of 26 papers in a 2018 special issue for which Lv was the managing guest editor (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher). The retractions, which included one research article co-authored by Lv, referred to compromised editorial handling and peer review, irrelevant citations, image manipulations, tortured phrases and content outside the scope of the journal and its special issue.\n\nLv told Nature he did not know at the time that there was a conflict of interest in submitting a paper to a special issue for which he was the handling editor.\n\nIn 2022, PLoS ONE removed Lv from its editorial board and retracted three papers co-authored by him in later years. “I was listed as a co-author in these three articles without my consent. I have no knowledge of the details of these articles,” Lv told Nature. “I remember informing the journal of this when they contacted me before retracting the papers,” he added.\n\nBut in 2023, sleuth Alexander Magazinov and later PLOS alerted Uppsala University in Sweden — where Lv worked from 2021 until his resignation in September 2024 — citing concerns about his involvement in paper-mill activities. The university’s investigation concluded that there were “grounds for suspecting research misconduct” on one of his papers, and referred a separate matter, involving an ethics review it said Lv had fabricated, to the Swedish police. The findings were reported by the blog For Better Science last year. Lv has since moved to Xidian University in Xi’an, China.\n\nAuthorship concerns\n\nHaibin Lv, a marine geologist at the North Sea Bureau in China’s Ministry of Natural Resources in Qingdao, ranked third in Nature’s list of editors. Between 2021 and 2022, Haibin Lv edited 28 papers for PLoS ONE. All but one of the 28 papers have been retracted, and the journal noted that they were part of a series of submissions for which it had concerns about peer-review integrity, similarities across articles and potential manipulation of the publication process. PLoS ONE issued an expression of concern for the remaining paper in June, citing issues with peer review and citations.\n\nNature also identified 113 papers published in Hindawi’s Journal of Sensors between 2021 and 2023 that Haibin Lv edited, 88 of which have been retracted.\n\nTwo of the retracted papers in PLoS ONE that Haibin Lv edited were co-authored by Zhihan Lv, who told Nature he was listed as an author without his consent. “Zhihan Lv and I are collaborators on multiple research projects. My handling of the two PLoS ONE papers he co-authored was no different than handling papers from strangers,” Haibin Lv told Nature.\n\nNature also identified ten articles that Haibin Lv and Zhihan Lv co-authored and published between 2022 and 2024 — six of which appeared in journals run by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a professional association and publisher based in New York City. None have been retracted. The IEEE declined to comment on the matter.\n\nZhihan Lv and Haibin Lv both told Nature that they are not brothers. Zhihan said they were not blood relatives, and Haibin described their relationship as “private”.\n\nFourth on Nature's list is Adnan Noor Shah, an agronomist at Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology in Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan, who handled 24 papers published in PLoS ONE between August 2021 and May 2022. Eighteen of those papers have been retracted, and the retraction notices for 17 of them said that they were part of a series of submissions for which the journal had concerns about authorship, competing interests and peer review. Shah also co-authored five articles that PLoS ONE later retracted, citing similar concerns, as well as issues with reference citations and overlap with other publications.\n\nNature’s analysis found that, in 2022, Shah co-authored two papers in two journals, including Frontiers in Plant Science. His co-authors on these papers included three researchers who appeared as authors in four other papers that Shah edited for Frontiers in Plant Science. The journal’s publisher, Frontiers (based in Lausanne, Switzerland), told Nature that it is investigating 20 publications across the journals that Shah edited. Shah did not respond to Nature’s emails.\n\nNature’s investigation also identified cancer researcher Aamir Ahmad as the most prolific PLoS ONE editor. Ahmad is the editor-in-chief of Non-coding RNA Research, an open-access journal published by Beijing-based KeAi. He has also been a cancer editor at Springer Nature’s Scientific Reports since 2017.",

          "abstract": "Close to 110,000 heat-related deaths are estimated to have occurred in Europe during the summers of 2022 and 2023 combined1. That’s roughly the same number of people as if a fully occupied jumbo jet crashed every day for 16 weeks. Meanwhile, a vast array of heat-related impacts disrupt people’s lives. Hot weather worsens mental-health problems2, increases the likelihood of violence3 and makes pregnant women more likely to give birth prematurely4. In classrooms, it impairs children’s ability to learn5.\n\nShade is an essential solution for hotter cities\n\nThe problems are expected to get much worse. Without better adaptation, heat-related deaths are projected to rise 3.7-fold by mid-century if global temperatures reach 2 °C above pre-industrial levels6. (In 2024, the average global temperature exceeded 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for the first time.) And heat stress in the workplace is expected to cost the global economy US$2.4 trillion each year in lost productivity by 2030.\n\nCurrently, most approaches that alert the public to heat-health risk worldwide use ambient (air) temperature thresholds to trigger warnings — usually broad recommendations to reduce activity, stay hydrated and so on. These thresholds are generally based on overall statistical correlations between ambient temperatures and regional increases in death and disease7. But heat stress is defined by more than just temperature, and can affect multiple physiological systems, including the heart and kidneys4. The risk to individuals varies enormously, and depends on factors such as their age, the health of their kidneys and heart, what they are wearing and their level of activity.\n\nTwo of us (O.J. and F.T.) are piloting the integration of physiological models and weather data to estimate people’s ‘heat-health risk’. We think that heat adaptation could be vastly enhanced by using a physiology-based approach that focuses on hot people, rather than just on hot weather.\n\nHow hot is too hot?\n\nMost people can safely tolerate core body temperatures of up to about 39 °C. If body temperature exceeds this value, the risk of heat exhaustion increases, with symptoms including nausea, dizziness and vomiting. At core temperatures above 40 °C, heat stroke can occur. Here, an increase in gut permeability, caused by reduced delivery of oxygen by the blood, allows toxic molecules associated with certain bacteria to leak into the bloodstream. This can trigger an inflammatory response that cascades to cause blood clotting, multiple organ failure and, ultimately, death4.\n\nWater sprays from a crane to help cool down construction workers in Nanjing, China, during high temperatures last month.Credit: Liu Jianhua/VCG via Getty\n\nWhether and how much any one person is harmed by hot weather depends on a mix of environmental factors and characteristics specific to that individual. Besides air temperature, three features of the thermal environment are important: radiation, humidity and wind speed8. Someone in direct sunlight can be exposed to mean radiant temperatures that are more than 20 °C greater than shade temperatures. (Air temperatures used to trigger health warnings are measured in the shade.) High humidity and low wind speed impair the effectiveness of sweating, which is a person’s only effective physiological cooling mechanism at air temperatures above 35 °C. The ability to lose heat through the evaporation of sweat is also affected by the thermal and evaporative properties of clothing8, age, body size and some medications9. Even light activity such as walking more than doubles internal heat production, and so increases a person’s risk of experiencing health problems in hot weather.\n\nThe body’s thermoregulation is underpinned by a vast redistribution of blood to the skin. And in hot weather, the need to lose heat increases, meaning that to maintain blood pressure, the heart must pump more often and with greater force. People with heart disease are less able to compensate for the increased strain, and so face higher cardiovascular risk4. The redistribution of blood can also damage organs such as the kidneys by reducing how much oxygen is delivered to them. A depleted blood volume from dehydration in hot weather forces the heart to work harder still, and repeated dehydration can contribute to kidney fibrosis (the accumulation of scar tissue in the kidney) and chronic kidney disease4. People with kidney disease face a higher risk of renal failure in extreme heat.\n\nA physiology-based approach\n\nWhen air temperatures are expected to exceed a certain threshold, warnings are triggered that help to prepare health and energy systems for bouts of extreme heat1. But the health-related warnings are limited by the quality of available data on heat-related deaths and disease10, and they don’t enable precise tailoring of protective measures for groups that are at higher risk.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change\n\nThe narrow focus on air temperature also strengthens an entrenched belief that reducing ambient temperatures is the only way to lessen the impacts of heat on health11. But attempts to do this can be unsustainable or ineffective. Coating hot surfaces such as roads with reflective paint, for example, will probably have little impact on physiological heat strain or even on perceived discomfort unless people are lying on the ground, and might even intensify heat loads on people. The benefit of increasing green areas and tree cover in cities is similarly often evaluated according to how much it can reduce the temperature of pavements or the mean air temperature, even though the main thermal benefit of urban greening is increasing people’s access to shade.\n\nIn a physiology-based approach, all the parameters with sufficiently high-quality data can be integrated into models to estimate three factors: a person’s core body temperature, their level of dehydration and the strain on their heart and circulatory system8. In our pilot studies in Sydney, Australia, we incorporated six parameters: ambient temperature, thermal radiation level, humidity level, wind speed, a person’s level of activity and the thermal and evaporative properties of their clothing. (Physiological acclimatization — the well-understood physiological adjustments that occur when a person is repeatedly exposed to a hot environment — can also be incorporated.)\n\nEstimates of physiological strain can then be compared with long-established physiological safety thresholds for different groups, on the basis of characteristics such as age, whether the person has a pre-existing condition, what medications they are taking and so on. For example, people with coronary artery disease can tolerate much less cardiovascular strain than healthy individuals can12, and those with heart failure or kidney disease can tolerate less dehydration. The final aggregated score is an individual’s ‘heat-health risk’ (see ‘Assessing heat-induced health risks using physiology’).\n\nSource: O. Jay et al.\nMaking it happen\n\nThe physiological and biophysical models needed for this sort of approach are already available. To provide individuals with a personalized rating of heat-stress risk that uses a six-point scale, two of us (O.J. and F.T.) have developed a freely available Internet tool called HeatWatch (see go.nature.com/44ymweq). This allows users to create personal profiles by submitting their age, related health conditions, medications, access to air conditioning and so on. It then provides a seven-day forecast of heat-health risk and provides evidence-based cooling advice tailored to each profile.\n\nUltimately, we plan to develop an online interface similar to the dashboards that tracked people’s risk of infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an interface could allow governments, public-health organizations, policymakers and others to better anticipate where and when certain groups will face elevated heat-health risks. This should make measures to reduce those risks, such as the deployment of pop-up cooling hubs for people who are homeless, more targeted and cost-effective.\n\nA hospital in New Delhi has a specialized unit for treating people who have heat stroke.Credit: Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty",

          "abstract": "‘Open-weight’ AI models enable researchers to perform custom training and study how information is represented inside their neural networks. Credit: Getty\n\nOpenAI has launched a large language model (LLM) that lives up to the company’s name. Known as gpt-oss, it is the first ‘reasoning’ artificial intelligence (AI) from the firm that is open-weight, meaning that researchers will be able to download it and customize it.\n\nThe firm, based in San Francisco, California, detailed the system in a blogpost and technical description on 5 August. On some tasks, gpt-oss performs almost as well as the firm’s most advanced models. The LLM is available in two sizes, both of which can be run locally and offline — the smaller of them on a single laptop — rather than requiring cloud computing or an online interface. This means they can be used to analyse — or be trained further on — sensitive data that can’t be transferred outside a given network.\n\n“I’m very excited,” says Simon Frieder, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Oxford, UK. “The competition between open-source large language models is already strong, and this will make the competition even fiercer, which benefits the entire research community.”\n\nThe release of gpt-oss comes at a time when powerful open-weight models from Chinese firms, such as Hangzhou-based DeepSeek and Beijing-based Moonshot AI, are gaining traction among researchers. Chinese open models already perform better than US-developed ones such as Llama (from Meta, based in Menlo Park, California) and are also poised to overtake them in terms of number of downloads, according to an analysis by Nathan Lambert, a machine-learning researcher at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, Washington, that was carried out before gpt-oss was released.\n\nLast month, the administration of US president Donald Trump highlighted open-weight AI models as being “essential for academic research” in its AI Action Plan. OpenAI’s decision to launch an open model has been long in the works and is not a response to the success of Chinese models, said Greg Brockman, one of the firm’s founders, who spoke to journalists ahead of the release of gpt-oss. “It was never a thing that we didn’t want to do,” he added.\n\nAll models come with biases, so diversity among their creators benefits users, says Frieder. “Having a new top-performing model from a Western company is a step in the direction of levelling the playing field in terms of which companies dominate the open-weight model space,” he says.\n\nMaths whizz\n\nUntil now, OpenAI has largely published proprietary models, the exception being GPT-2, a 2019 LLM released by the firm three years before it launched its popular ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nThe latest open models are ‘reasoners’ trained to produce output using a step-by-step process that mimics thought. Previous reasoning models, such as OpenAI’s o3, have been shown to excel on science and mathematics problems. As well as using them to write computer code and review scholarly literature, scientists are experimenting with using LLMs as AI ‘co-scientists’ in the hope of accelerating research.\n\nIn performance, OpenAI’s open models seem to be close to the firm’s most advanced, pay-to-access AIs — the main differences being the open models’ smaller sizes and their being text-only (they do not handle images or video). Gpt-oss can browse the web, execute code and operate software, and it outperforms similarly-sized open models on reasoning tasks, says the firm.\n\nOn the AIME 2025 benchmark, which tasks AIs with solving challenging mathematics problems, the gpt-oss models score better than the best existing open models, such as DeepSeek’s R1, and one of the two is on a par with the leading open competitor on Humanity’s Last Exam, a 3,000-question test that covers expert-level knowledge across a range of subjects.\n\n(Almost) truly open",

          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "A slice from a normal human brain (left, artificially coloured) contrasts with a slice from the brain of a person with Alzheimer’s disease.Credit: Jessica Wilson/Science Photo Library\n\nReplenishing the brain’s natural stores of lithium can protect against and even reverse Alzheimer’s disease, suggests a paper published1 today in Nature.\n\nThe paper reports that analyses of human brain tissue and a series of mouse experiments point to a consistent pattern: when lithium concentrations in the brain decline, memory loss tends to develop, as do neurological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease called amyloid plaques and tau tangles. The study also found evidence in mice that a specific type of lithium supplement undoes these neurological changes and rolls back memory loss, restoring the brain to a younger, healthier state.\n\nA man was destined for early Alzheimer’s — these genes might explain his escape\n\n“This is groundbreaking,” says Ashley Bush, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who was not involved in the study. “We only recently have the first disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer’s disease. But they only target one thing: the amyloid plaques. This approach targets all the major pathologies of concern in the disease.”\n\nIf confirmed in clinical trials, the implications could be profound. Dementia affects more than 55 million people globally; most have Alzheimer’s disease. Anti-amyloid therapies on the market slow cognitive decline, but “they don’t stop it. They don’t restore function,” says co-author Bruce Yankner, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n“We don’t yet have the penicillin for Alzheimer’s,” he says.\n\nOld tonic, new role\n\nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, lithium was touted as a mood-altering health tonic, even appearing as an upper in an early recipe for 7-Up. It re-emerged in the 1970s as the gold-standard treatment for bipolar disorder. Scientists soon noticed that among people with bipolar disorder, brain ageing was slower in those taking lithium than in those who weren’t. Meanwhile, epidemiological studies revealed that regions in which water supplies contained trace amounts of lithium had relatively low dementia rates2. But clinical trials to test lithium’s effects on cognitive decline had mixed results.\n\nIn research to clarify lithium’s role, Yankner and his team showed, for the first time, that the metal is naturally present in the brain — where it has an important physiological role.\n\nThe clues added up. The authors found that lithium levels were lower in parts of the human brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease than in unaffected regions. The team also discovered that in people with mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer’s, brain lithium is tied up in amyloid plaques, leaving less available for essential brain functions. This lithium withdrawal “became more severe as the disease progressed”, says Yankner. Lithium met a similar fate in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nA mouse with normal lithium levels in its brain had fewer amyloid plaques (top left) and tau tangles (bottom left) than did a mouse with lithium deficiency (top and bottom right). Credit: Yankner Lab\n\nIn further experiments using the mice, those with lithium-deficient brains developed more plaques than did animals with normal lithium levels. This kicked off a vicious cycle that might represent the devastating progression of Alzheimer’s disease: less lithium in the brain leads to more amyloid, which leads to even less lithium.\n\nYankner and his team linked lithium loss with other markers of the disease, including a build-up of tau protein tangles and altered activity of Alzheimer-related genes. They even identified a potential means to break the deleterious cycle.\n\nMost clinical trials of lithium have tested the form lithium carbonate. The team showed that amyloid plaques readily trap this form — but others, such as lithium orotate, avoid that fate. When the authors gave mice low doses of lithium orotate, it reversed disease-related brain damage and restored the animals’ memory. Lithium carbonate did not have the same benefits, potentially helping to explain the mixed results of earlier clinical trials.",

          "authors": "Iason Gabriel, Geoff Keeling, Arianna Manzini, James Evans",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are shifting their focus to building agents that can operate independently, with little human intervention. To be an agent is to have the ability to perceive and act on an environment in a goal-directed and autonomous way1. For example, a digital agent could be programmed to browse the web and make online purchases on behalf of a user — comparing prices, selecting items and completing checkouts. A robot with arms could be an agent if it could pick up objects, open doors or assemble parts without being told how to do each step.\n\nCompanies such as the digital-marketing firm Salesforce, based in San Francisco, California, and computer graphics and hardware firm Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, are already offering customer-services solutions for businesses, using agents. In the near future, AI assistants might be able to fulfil complex multistep requests, such as ‘get me a better mobile-phone contract’, by retrieving a list of contracts from a price-comparison website, selecting the best option, authorizing the switch, cancelling the old contract, and arranging the transfer of cancellation fees from the user’s bank account.\n\nCan AI review the scientific literature — and figure out what it all means?\n\nThe rise of more-capable AI agents is likely to have far-reaching political, economic and social consequences. On the positive side, they could unlock economic value: the consultancy McKinsey forecasts an annual windfall from generative AI of US$2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion globally, once AI agents are widely deployed (see go.nature.com/4qeqemh). They might also serve as powerful research assistants and accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nBut AI agents also introduce risks. People need to know who is responsible for agents operating ‘in the wild’, and what happens if they make mistakes. For example, in November 2022 , an Air Canada chatbot mistakenly decided to offer a customer a discounted bereavement fare, leading to a legal dispute over whether the airline was bound by the promise. In February 2024, a tribunal ruled that it was — highlighting the liabilities that corporations could experience when handing over tasks to AI agents, and the growing need for clear rules around AI responsibility.\n\nHere, we argue for greater engagement by scientists, scholars, engineers and policymakers with the implications of a world increasingly populated by AI agents. We explore key challenges that must be addressed to ensure that interactions between humans and agents — and among agents themselves — remain broadly beneficial.\n\nThe alignment problem\n\nAI-safety researchers have long warned about the risks of misspecified or misinterpreted instructions, including situations in which an automated system takes an instruction too literally, overlooks important context, or finds unexpected and potentially harmful ways to reach a goal2.\n\nA well-known example involves an AI agent trained to play the computer game Coast Runners, which is a boat race. The agent discovered that it could earn higher scores not by completing the race, but rather by repeatedly crashing into objects that awarded points—technically achieving an objective, but in a way that deviated from the spirit of the task (see go.nature.com/4okfqdg). The purpose of the game was to complete the race, not endlessly accumulate points.\n\nAs AI agents gain access to real-world interfaces — including search engines, e-mail clients and e-commerce platforms — such deviations can have tangible consequences. Consider the case of a lawyer who instructs their AI assistant to circulate a legal brief for feedback. The assistant does so, but fails to register that it should be shared only with the in-house team, leading to a privacy breach.\n\nHow to harness AI’s potential in research — responsibly and ethically\n\nSuch situations highlight a difficult trade-off: just how much information should an AI assistant proactively seek before acting? Too little opens up the possibility of costly mistakes; too much undermines the convenience users expect. These challenges point to the need for safeguards, including check-in protocols for high-stakes decisions, robust accountability systems such as action logging, and mechanisms for redress when errors occur (see go.nature.com/4iwscdr).\n\nEven more concerning are cases in which AI agents are empowered to modify the environment they operate in, using expert-level coding ability and tools. When the user’s goals are poorly defined or left ambiguous, such agents have been known to modify the environment to achieve their objective, even when this entails taking actions that should be strictly out of bounds. For example, an AI research assistant that was faced with a strict time limit tried to rewrite the code to remove the time limit altogether, instead of completing the task3. This type of behaviour raises alarms about the potential for AI agents to take dangerous shortcuts that developers might be unable to anticipate. Agents could, in pursuit of a high-level objective, even deceive the coders running experiments with them.\n\nTo reduce such risks, developers need to improve how they define and communicate objectives to agents. One promising method is preference-based fine-tuning, which aims to align AI systems with what humans actually want. Instead of training a model solely on examples of correct answers, developers collect feedback on which responses people prefer. Over time, the model learns to prioritize the kind of behaviour that is consistently endorsed, making it more likely to act in ways that match user intent, even when instructions are complex or incomplete.\n\nIn parallel, research on mechanistic interpretability — which aims to understand an AI system’s internal ‘thought process’ — could help to detect deceptive behaviour by making the agent’s reasoning more transparent in real time4. Model builders can then work to find and neutralize ‘bad circuits’, targeting the underlying problem in the model’s behaviour. Developers can also implement guard rails to ensure that a model automatically aborts problematic action sequences.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nNonetheless, a focus on developer protocols alone is insufficient: people also need to be attentive to actors who seek to cause social harm. As AI agents become more autonomous, adaptable and capable of writing and executing code, their potential to conduct large-scale cyberattacks and phishing scams could become a matter of serious concern. Advanced AI assistants equipped with multimodal capabilities — meaning that they can understand and generate text, images, audio and video — open up new avenues for deception. For instance, an AI could impersonate a person not only through e-mails, but also using deepfake videos or synthetic voice clones, making scams much more convincing and harder to detect.\n\nA plausible starting point for oversight is that AI agents should not be permitted to perform any action that would be illegal for their human user to perform. Yet, there will be occasions where the law is silent or ambiguous. For example, when an anxious user reports troubling health symptoms to an AI assistant, it is helpful for the AI to offer generic health resources. But providing customized, quasi-medical advice — such as diagnostic and therapeutic suggestions — could prove harmful, because the system lacks the subtle signals to which a human clinician has access. Ensuring that AI agents navigate such trade-offs responsibly will require updated regulation that flows from continuing collaboration involving developers, users, policymakers and ethicists.\n\nThe widespread deployment of capable AI agents necessitates an expansion of value-alignment research: agents need to be aligned with user well-being and societal norms, as well as with the intentions of users and developers. One area of special complexity and concern surrounds how agents might affect users’ relationship experiences and emotional responses5.\n\nSocial agents\n\nChatbots have an uncanny ability to role-play as human companions — an effect anchored in features such as their use of natural language, increased memory and reasoning capabilities, and generative abilities6. The anthropomorphic pull of this technology can be augmented through design choices such as photorealistic avatars, human-like voices and the use of names, pronouns or terms of endearment that were once reserved for people. Augmenting language models with ‘agentic’ capabilities has the potential to further cement their status as distinct social actors, capable of forming new kinds of relationship with users.",

But as the site approaches its twentieth anniversary, it is facing growing criticism from some scientists who worry that some users are manipulating its metrics to give their papers more visibility and clout.\n\nSavina Kirilova, a research librarian at Sofia University in Bulgaria, co-authored a paper in February1 claiming that some users are allegedly working together to inflate metrics tracked by ResearchGate, such as the number of reads and recommendations that a paper gets.\n\nKirilova spoke to Nature Index about what the site can do to combat misuse of its platform and improve its reputation among the research community. Nature Index approached ResearchGate for comment about her points, but did not receive a response.\n\nWhat concerns you about ResearchGate?\n\nAcademic social-networking sites, such as ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Mendeley and Google Scholar, play a key part in the way academics share, collaborate and communicate their research. ResearchGate sets itself apart by offering features such as user recommendations, which can be a valuable tool for driving discussions about papers in the scientific community.\n\nBut there are many issues with ResearchGate that can undermine research integrity. For example, the platform — which hosts both peer-reviewed and preprint articles — does not have a formal vetting process for most of the content it hosts. Its open upload policy — in which users are free to upload their own research-related work, as long as it does not break any copyright stipulations — increases the risk of users submitting plagiarized or low-quality research.\n\nResearchGate uses metrics such as the number of reads, recommendations and citations that a paper gets, which should reflect its quality. But these metrics can be easily manipulated, and in some cases inflated to the point of absurdity.\n\nFor example, in our paper, we cite the case of Larry, a cat that belonged to the grandmother of Reese Richardson, a graduate student in metascience and computational biology at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Illinois. Last year, Larry the Cat got many citations from Richardson posting a fake profile and some fake article titles on ResearchGate, with Larry as the author. Larry went on to garner more than 100 fake citations on Google Scholar. (ResearchGate has since deleted the profile and Google Scholar has deleted the citations.)\n\nThese metrics feed into other bibliometric indicators, such as ResearchGate’s own Research Interest score (RI score), which is intended to measure the impact of a person’s research.\n\nWhat are the risks in not regulating uploads and user activity?\n\nThe concern is that researchers might artificially inflate their indicators or share their publications in ways that boost their visibility unfairly. Unethical researchers could use generative artificial intelligence (AI) programs to write hundreds of articles, post them on ResearchGate, and create fake metrics for them, for instance.\n\nIn our paper, we describe a case of small groups of researchers that are deliberately inflating each other’s metrics to enhance their reputation. Allowing these systems to be abused risks putting reputable researchers and fraudsters at the same level on the platform, because a peer-reviewed paper and an obscure pseudoscientific rant could be presented in the same manner, with equivalent credibility.\n\nWhat is ResearchGate doing to address these issues and what actions do you recommend it takes?",

The non-profit publisher, which produces ten titles, including the world’s first peer-reviewed journals, announced the decision today.\n\nThe S2O model makes the content a journal publishes in a given year free to access and publish, as long as enough libraries commit to paying an annual subscription fee. Without sufficient subscriptions, a journal will continue to charge publishing fees — known as article-processing charges (APCs).\n\nIn 2020, only 17% of articles published by the Royal Society were open access. That figure rose to 60% in 2024, but dropped to 55% for those published so far this year. The S2O model “is as clean and as simple a transition to open access as you can do. It gets us to 100% open access in one stroke,” says Rod Cookson, the Royal Society’s publishing director, who is based in Oxford, UK.\n\nAndré Gaul, chief executive of EMS Press in Berlin, the publishing house of the European Mathematical Society, calls the Royal Society’s announcement “a fantastic move” and hopes that more publishers will follow suit.\n\nIf there are not enough subscriptions to cover the publication costs, the Royal Society will continue charging APCs and try again in 2027. The society’s two remaining journals will continue to be published under the APC-based open-access model.\n\nJoining a movement\n\nThe Royal Society is joining a growing wave of scientific publishers that are implementing the S2O model. This year, 378 journals are published under this model — up from 192 last year.\n\nAnnual Reviews, a non-profit publisher in San Mateo, California, pioneered the model with five journals in 2020. By 2023, all of its 51 journals had switched to S2O.\n\nEMS Press was one of the early publishers to follow suit. It trialled the model with 10 journals in 2021, and expanded it to all 22 journals by 2024. The publisher currently has just under 1,600 subscribers from 58 countries.\n\n“So far, we found it to be very sustainable, because it repurposes traditional library spending. There’s no additional budget needed. There’s no kind of extra component on top of what they’re already spending,” says Laura Simonite, head of business development at EMS Press.\n\nEDP Sciences, a publisher in Les Ulis, France, also began its S2O programme in 2021. It now publishes eight journals under the model, including its largest one, Astronomy & Astrophysics; Radioprotection; and six mathematics journals.\n\nIn 2023, EDP Sciences had to keep Radioprotection paywalled because subscriptions did not reach the threshold needed for S2O. The publisher said that “this decision was not a failure of the model, but rather a result of its conditional nature”. With renewed subscriptions and extra financial support from the French Society for Radioprotection, the journal became open access again last year.\n\nThe publisher also struggled to keep its six mathematical journals open access this year. But it received financial backing from the French Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics and France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, allowing the journals to remain free to all.\n\nFor Astronomy & Astrophysics, “the sustainability of this model is precarious, and required a very strong collaboration with [the journal’s] executive board to maintain open access”, says Selina La Barbera, the journal publishing director at EDP Sciences.",

Meanwhile, emperor Hirohito encouraged the country’s slowly starving civilians to gird for imminent invasion by Allied forces and to be prepared to give up their lives in the upcoming decisive battle that would determine Japan’s fate.\n\nA five-month-long campaign of nightly US incendiary raids had reduced all but a handful of cities, in which most civilians lived, to cinders and rubble. One of the few urban areas to have escaped this storm of napalm and thermite was Hiroshima, a regional transport and manufacturing hub on the Seto Inland Sea.\n\nMany of its 250,000 residents ascribed this run of luck to divine intervention by Buddhist or Shinto deities. But a pessimistic thread of gossip, shared in whispers and behind closed doors, posited — correctly, as it would turn out — that Hiroshima’s stay of incendiary execution was merely temporary, and in place only because the US government had something much worse in store for the city.\n\nAll hands on deck\n\nLocal authorities were not going to leave the city’s fate to chance. In late July, Hiroshima’s garrison ordered a massive municipal effort to clear areas for firebreaks in the central business district as a countermeasure to the sweeping fires that were expected once the US bombers finally got around to crossing the city off their rapidly dwindling target list.\n\nHow to avoid nuclear war in an era of AI and misinformation\n\nIn practice, this meant tearing down wooden houses and stores along designated thoroughfares and around key military and government buildings.\n\nProviding the muscle on site were some 20,000 civilian volunteers. Most were farmers, men too old for military service and members of women’s patriotic associations. The adults were joined by Hiroshima’s cohort of 12- and 13-year-olds, born between 1 April 1932 and 31 March 1933.\n\nDuring previous drives, children this young had been deemed too physically immature to join the city’s older schoolchildren, who, for nearly a year, had been toiling in area-munitions and aircraft plants, their education officially suspended. Now, however, the younger students represented a pool of workers too valuable to leave fallow any longer.\n\nAlthough local school-board members and education officials had initially resisted putting their prepubescent charges in harm’s way, they eventually caved to army demands. On the morning of Monday 6 August 1945, commuters hurried into Hiroshima’s central business district along streets ringing with the high-pitched singing and call-and-response chanting of thousands of secondary-school students working on the firebreaks alongside their adult counterparts.\n\nIn the downtown district of Zakoba, some 300 first-grade students from the elite Hiroshima Prefectural Junior High were helping to clear wooden structures around city hall. That day, however, one boy was not on the job: 13-year-old Ōiwa Kōhei had woken up that morning with a stomach ache, and his mother agreed to let him stay at home.\n\nOut of the blue\n\nIn the minutes before 8:15, observation posts in the prefecture’s eastern part began calling in reports to the regional air-defence headquarters bunker in Hiroshima Castle: two unidentified aircraft were approaching the city at high altitude. This seemed no cause for urgent alarm — B-29 aeroplanes had been flying over the city all summer, alone or in small formations, not dropping even a cigarette butt or an empty coke bottle on the way. Still, going by the standard civil-defence protocol, the intruders’ presence should have merited an air-raid warning to alert the populace and give people time to take cover — in a proper bomb shelter, or at least under a roof somewhere.\n\nŌiwa Kōhei was the only child his age to survive in his neighbourhood.Credit: Credit: M.G. Sheftall\n\nIndeed, one hour earlier, sirens had sounded when a single B-29 had flown a couple of lazy circuits high over Hiroshima, and people across the city — mainly women, children and older people — had remained hidden until the all-clear signal, 30 minutes later. This time, however, when reports about the second contact began to come in, the day’s air-defence duty officer — the only bunker staff member with the authority to activate the city’s air-raid sirens — was away from his desk, consulting with colleagues at headquarters. Hiroshima’s sirens remained silent, and its residents went about their business as they would on any Monday morning.\n\nAt 8:14, the inbound aircraft abruptly went into a dive, made a full-throttled U-turn and flew away at maximum speed. People on the ground — alerted by the growl of straining engines overhead — stopped what they were doing and looked up to see three white parachutes trailing one of the bombers. Thinking that these were US crew members bailing out of a stricken aircraft, many let out cheers.\n\nPhysicists unleashed the power of the atom — but to what end?\n\nFew people, however, had noticed a long grey cylinder — dropped by the second plane — that had already been falling for half a minute or so by the time the sound of the steeply banking aircraft reached the ground.\n\nDuring a free fall of 45 seconds, this sarcophagus-like object — called Little Boy by its US makers — plummeted some 9.5 kilometres before its onboard sensors detected an altitude of 600 metres, the designated air-burst height carefully calculated by scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico to maximize the effect of the blast. At this point, the two halves of Little Boy’s nuclear core slammed together to form a supercritical mass of 64 kilograms of the radioactive isotope uranium-235.\n\nAlthough only one kilogram of the core underwent fission before the bomb exploded, the chain reaction that took place during this blink of an eye produced a kinetic-energy pulse equivalent to 15,000 tonnes of exploding TNT.\n\nTotal devastation\n\nTo witnesses on the ground, this release of energy was initially expressed as a blinding flash of light ‘brighter than a thousand Suns’. Some 0.2 seconds later, it became a fireball — a roiling, 300-metre-wide sphere of air superheated and hyper-pressurized into ionized plasma.\n\nThis fireball assailed the crowded wooden city below with two vectors of immediate destruction. The faster of these was a burst of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum — γ rays, X-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light and thermal rays — that reached the city at the speed of light, baking every surface it touched to temperatures ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 °C for up to eight seconds. In a combustion zone with a radius of about 1.5 kilometres from Little Boy’s hypocentre, every bit of organic matter directly exposed to this heat (twice the melting point of steel) immediately burst into flames.\n\nContrary to post-war US narratives about the bombing, no one caught out in the open in the combustion zone was ‘instantly vaporized’ — not even someone hypothetically standing at the hypocentre, directly under the air burst. Instead, people were essentially burnt alive for several seconds until Little Boy’s briefly supersonic shock wave front — the bomb’s second vector of fast-acting destruction — ended their agony by blowing their rapidly carbonizing bodies to pieces.\n\nSurvivors of the Hiroshima bombing, pictured 60 years later in 2005.Credit: Gerard Rancinan/Polaris/eyevine\n\nThis blast of hyper-compressed air smashed and flattened everything in the roughly 1.5-kilometre radius of total destruction. In the process, it also initiated a massive atmospheric displacement centred over the explosion’s hypocentre. After the dissipation of the shock-wave front, air from the surrounding area rushed back in to fill the temporary vacuum. This allowed thermal radiation from the still-burning fireball to promptly ignite central Hiroshima’s splintered wooden remains.\n\nIn short order, thousands of blazes merged into a fire storm so powerful that it created its own localized weather system and spread far into the parts of the city that had otherwise escaped Little Boy’s initial fury. This conflagration would rage for 24 hours and consume most of Hiroshima.\n\nWith the fireball’s brief existence having run its course and its incendiary mission accomplished, it was subsumed and sucked up and away into a skyrocketing, kilometres-high pillar of fire, smoke, dust and ash produced by the pyre of the dying city. Although this rising column of airborne debris had yet to reach its terminal altitude and flatten out into its iconic ‘mushroom cloud’ cap, tens of thousands of people already lay dead across Hiroshima, killed by the combined effects of the bomb’s electromagnetic burst and blast effect.\n\nHow a small nuclear war would transform the entire planet\n\nTens of thousands more would die across the city in the fire storm of 6 and 7 August. They perished in burning, crowd-crushed streets and alleys, or trapped under the wreckage of collapsed houses, or because they jumped into the city’s many waterways and drowned. By nightfall, 80,000 people had died, including almost the entirety of the firebreak work force.\n\nIn the subsequent days, weeks and months, tens of thousands of people (including first responders and carers) would die agonizing, effluvia-spewing deaths at the hands of a third, slower-acting vector of destruction: acute radiation syndrome. By the end of the year, 140,000 people had died from bomb-related causes, with another 74,000 dead in Nagasaki during the same period, because of a second atomic bomb, dropped on the city on 9 August.\n\nNarrow escape\n\nAt the instant of Little Boy’s air burst, Ōiwa had seen a flash of light so bright that, for a few startled seconds, he thought that the Sun had fallen to Earth and landed in his mother’s flower beds. As his mind scrambled to process this thought, a whirlwind abruptly blew in all the windows in his house, lifted him from the tatami flooring and threw him across the living room and into the wall.",

However, the co-evolution of plasmas and magnetic fields is complex and challenging to understand. Writing in Nature, Park et al.1 report an ingenious experiment that studies the merging of large magnetic plasma structures called flux ropes.

          "title": "This company claimed to ‘de-extinct’ dire wolves. Then the fighting started.",
          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "For months, researchers in a laboratory in Dallas, Texas, worked in secrecy, culturing grey-wolf blood cells and altering the DNA within. The scientists then plucked nuclei from these gene-edited cells and injected them into egg cells from a domestic dog to form clones.\n\nThey transferred dozens of the cloned embryos into the wombs of surrogate dogs, eventually bringing into the world three animals of a type that had never been seen before. Two males named Romulus and Remus were born in October 2024, and a female, Khaleesi, was born in January.\n\nA few months later, Colossal Biosciences, the Texas-based company that produced the creatures, declared: “The first de-extinct animals are here.” Of 20 edits made to the animals’ genomes, the company says that 15 match sequences identified in dire wolves (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago.\n\nAncient proteins rewrite the rhino family tree — are dinosaurs next?\n\nThe company’s announcement of the pups in April, which described them as dire wolves, set off a media maelstrom. The ensuing debates over the nature of the animals — and the advisability of doing such work — have opened a chasm between Colossal’s team and other scientists.\n\n“I don’t think they de-extincted anything,” says Jeanne Loring, a stem-cell biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. She and many others say that the hype surrounding Colossal’s announcement has the potential to confuse the public about what de-extinction technologies can achieve.\n\nColossal, meanwhile, has taken an increasingly combative tone in addressing criticisms, issuing rapid rebuttals to researchers and conservationists who have publicly questioned the company’s work. The firm has also been accused of taking part in a campaign to undermine the credibility of some critics. The company denies having played any part in this.\n\nColossal stands by its claims and insists that it is listening to dissenters and seeking advice from them. “We have had this attitude of running towards critics, not away,” says Ben Lamm, a technology entrepreneur and co-founder of the company.\n\nColossal ambitions\n\nDe-extinction is an emerging field that represents the meeting point of several groundbreaking biotechnologies: ancient genomics, cloning and genome editing, ostensibly in the service of conservation. The field has roots in science fiction, with the term seeming first to have appeared in a 1979 novel by Piers Anthony called The Source of Magic. And Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel Jurassic Park — itself inspired by ancient-DNA investigations — popularized the possibility that long-dead organisms could be cloned from preserved DNA.\n\nThere has never been perfect agreement on what counts as de-extinction — such as whether it means cloning exact replicas of extinct species, creating proxies that fulfil their roles in ecosystems, or something in between. Some count the birth of a cloned bucardo (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica), a type of wild goat, as a first example. The animal’s genome was transferred into goat (Capra hircus) egg cells from frozen cell samples taken from one of the last living bucardo specimens in 2000. (The resulting creature died within minutes of birth1.) But this pathway to de-extinction isn’t an option for most species. DNA degrades over time, and without a sample of carefully preserved DNA, researchers would have to engineer the whole genome.\n\nThe advent of CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in 2012 provided another option. Researchers can identify genetic variants that contribute to key traits of extinct animals and edit these variants into cells of living relatives. They can then use that manipulated DNA to create a new animal through cloning.\n\nPlans to bring back animals such as the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) began to flourish. Even though there was interest among researchers and the public, funding was an issue. “We had been unable to get really any philanthropic interest in de-extinction,” says Ben Novak, who leads a passenger-pigeon de-extinction effort at the non-profit organization Revive & Restore in Sausalito, California.\n\nBut in 2021, geneticist George Church at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who was working with Revive & Restore, caught a break. He teamed up with Lamm to launch Colossal Biosciences with US$15 million in funding, much of which came from venture capitalists. De-extinction of the woolly mammoth would be the firm’s flagship project, using elephants as surrogates.\n\nBeth Shapiro joined US firm Colossal Biosciences in 2024 to focus on de-extinction work.Credit: Shelby Tauber/The Washington Post/Getty\n\nBeth Shapiro, an evolutionary geneticist who is chief scientific officer at Colossal, was initially sceptical that there was a strong conservation argument for creating elephants that had key mammoth traits. In 2015, she told Nature that her book on de-extinction, called How To Clone A Mammoth, might have been more accurately titled ‘How One Might Go About Cloning a Mammoth (Should It Become Technically Possible, And If It Were, In Fact, a Good Idea, Which It’s Probably Not)’.\n\nShapiro turned down an offer to join the company at first, but started seriously entertaining the idea when Colossal expanded its de-extinction ambitions. It began projects to bring back the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), which was wiped out in the seventeenth century, and to restore thylacines (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the Australian marsupials that are sometimes referred to as Tasmanian tigers and that were hunted to extinction in the 1930s.\n\nShe was especially interested in seeing de-extinction technologies applied to existing endangered species. Shapiro joined Colossal in 2024 as its chief scientist. “This is an opportunity to scale up the impact that I have the potential to make,” she says. “Maybe it’s a mid-life crisis.”\n\nThe company, now valued at around US$10 billion, has attracted celebrity investors, including the media personality Paris Hilton and film director Peter Jackson, alongside a handful of leading scientists as staff and advisers.\n\nDire disagreements\n\nThe dire-wolf project was different from many of Colossal’s other efforts because it proceeded quietly. Few people knew about the work until this year, and that irked some researchers. “They didn’t invite any kind of conversation about whether or not that is a good use of funds or a good project to do,” says Novak.\n\nShapiro says the secrecy around the dire-wolf project was designed to generate surprise, and to counter public perceptions that the company overpromises and under-delivers. She also says that the company talked extensively to scientists, conservationists and others about the project and how it should proceed.\n\nThe firm has not released the full list of edits that it made — 20 changes to 14 genome locations. Fifteen of the changes were identified in two dire-wolf genomes obtained from the remains of animals that lived 13,000 and 72,000 years ago. The genome differs from that of the grey wolf (Canis lupus) by about 12 million DNA letters.\n\nThe dodo (Raphus cucullatus) went extinct in the seventeenth century. Colossal Biosciences aims to edit the genome of a related pigeon species to mimic the dodo’s traits.Credit: Klaus Nigge/Nature Picture Library\n\nColossal says that other edits, including changes that led to the creatures’ white coats and contributed to their large size, were intended to replicate dire-wolf traits using gene variants found in grey wolves. Many scientists say that the coat colour in particular was probably inspired more by the animals’ appearance in the fantasy television series Game of Thrones than by reality.\n\n“There is no chance in hell a dire wolf is going to look like that,” says Tom Gilbert, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen and a scientific adviser to Colossal. He says he agrees with other scientists who have argued that, on the basis of what is known about the dire wolf’s range, it “basically would have looked like a slightly larger coyote”. Colossal notes that the coat colour is based on the discovery of variants in two dire-wolf genomes that it says would have resulted in light-coloured fur.\n\nAccording to an update from Colossal in late June, Romulus and Remus weigh around 40 kilograms, around 20% heavier than a standard grey wolf of the same age, and Khaleesi is about 16 kilograms. They live on an 800-hectare ecological preserve surrounded by a 3-metre wall. Colossal plans to make more of the animals, and to study their health and development in depth. It says it will not release them into the wild.\n\nThe mysterious extinction of the dire wolf\n\nShapiro argued in her 2015 book that forming a wild population is a requirement for successful de-extinction. She nevertheless considers the dire wolves to be an example of de-extinction, and says that creating them will have conservation benefits for wolves and other species.\n\nMany scientists disagree. A group of experts on canids that advises the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) issued a statement in mid-April rejecting Colossal’s claim that gene-edited wolves could be considered dire wolves, or even proxies for the extinct species. The statement cites a 2016 IUCN definition for de-extinction that emphasizes that the animal must fill an ecological niche. The work, the group said, “may demonstrate technical capabilities, but it does not contribute to conservation”. Colossal has disputed this on the social-media platform X (formerly Twitter) saying that the dire-wolf project “develops vital conservation technologies and provides an ideal platform for the next stage of this research”.\n\nNovak says: “The dire wolf fits the Jurassic Park model of de-extinction beautifully.” The animals have the traits of extinct species and are, to his knowledge, not intended for release into the wild, he says. “It is clearly for spectacle.”\n\nGilbert, who was a co-author of a preprint describing the ancient dire-wolf genomes2, says he is concerned that Colossal is not being sufficiently clear to the public about what it has done. “It’s a dog with 20 edits,” he says. “If you’re putting out descriptions that are going to be so easily falsified, the risk is you do damage to science’s reputation.”\n\nThe Tasmanian tiger or thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was a carnivorous marsupial that once roamed Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. The last known specimen died in the 1930s. Credit: Chronicle/Alamy\n\nLamm rejects the idea that Colossal’s messaging undermines public credibility in science, pointing to what he says was an overwhelmingly positive reaction.\n\nLoring, who is part of an effort to use stem-cell technology in conservation, says that she sees merit in Colossal’s work. It has, she says, changed her views on how to repopulate northern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum cottoni). But she worries that Colossal’s messaging overshadows those contributions. “It may create an opportunity for us to educate the public,” she says. “More often, it creates an opportunity for us to be ignored.”\n\nTo Love Dalén, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Stockholm and a scientific adviser to Colossal, the controversy is “a storm in a teacup” that detracts from Colossal’s achievement. “It makes me a little bit sad there is this huge debate and angry voices about the common name,” he says.\n\nDogfight\n\nShapiro says she was surprised and saddened by the strength of reactions to Colossal’s announcement. “It was harder than I thought it would be, and the questions were getting meaner and meaner,” she says.",

          "abstract": "Consuming minimally processed foods — such as those home-cooked from raw ingredients — could make it easier to shed weight while on a diet.Credit: Filippo Carlot/Alamy\n\nEating ultra-processed foods (UPFs) might hinder attempts to lose weight even when the diet accords with national healthy-eating recommendations, a study has found.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Medicine on 4 August1, highlights a lack of focus on the impact of UPFs in national dietary recommendations in the United Kingdom — where the study was conducted — and elsewhere, the authors say.\n\nUPFs are products that have been developed by combining food extracts with additives and industrial ingredients. The result is food items that are cheap, profitable and widely accessible.\n\nIt is well established that the high salt and sugar content of many UPFs makes the products unhealthy, but some research has suggested that how they are processed could also have a role.\n\nSamuel Dicken, an obesity and behaviour researcher at University College London and lead author of the paper, says that the motivation behind this study was to address a gap in national dietary recommendations, and to do so in the participants’ everyday environment. “It will be the longest-ever trial of a UPF diet to date. It’s the first one to do it in the real world to try and apply all those behavioural influences” associated with daily life, he says.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, more than half of the energy in the average person’s diet comes from UPFs, with similar figures elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.\n\nSocio-economic factors\n\nThe wider availability of affordable UPFs over less-processed alternatives could have a disproportionate effect on people from low-income areas. “Issues around diet and obesity related to these [UPFs] are very much related to socio-economic inequalities,” says Dicken, adding that people might have unhealthy diets not because they aren’t trying to eat healthily, but “because our food environment is just setting us up to fail”.\n\nThe study examined the impacts of UPFs on 55 adults on a diet based on UK national dietary guidelines. Participants followed an eight-week diet based on minimally processed foods (MPFs) and an eight-week diet based on UPFs, with a four-week period between the two, during which participants returned to their usual diet. Both diets followed the UK Eatwell Guide, which focuses on food groups and macronutrients including fat, protein and carbohydrate content. During both phases, the participants had all meals, snacks, and drinks delivered to their homes, but could choose how much to eat at any one time, and when it was consumed.\n\nThe researchers found that participants’ weight and body-mass index decreased during both phases. However, participants lost more than twice as much weight — 1.84 kilograms on average, compared with 0.88 kilograms — while following the MPF diet. Changes in body composition, such as decreases in fat mass, body-fat percentage and visceral-fat rating, occurred on the MPF diet but not on the UPF one. Cravings were also decreased on the MPF diet.",

          "title": "Nuclear-weapons risks are back — and we need to act like it",
          "authors": "Ankit Panda",
          "abstract": "At a time of growing catastrophic risks posed by climate change, pandemics and advances in artificial intelligence (AI), and more than 30 years after the end of the cold war, many people consider nuclear weapons to be relics of the twentieth century. Eighty years into the nuclear age, which began in 1945 with the first test — called Trinity — of an atomic weapon in the New Mexico desert, and the bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, these devastating weapons have, fortunately, never since been used in war.\n\nBut amid a rise in geopolitical rivalries, technological advancements and civic discord, the shadow cast by nuclear weapons over international politics is growing once again. It is also manifesting in unprecedented ways, as the past few months show starkly.\n\n‘The Sun had fallen to Earth’ — a survivor’s recollection of the Hiroshima bombing\n\nIn May, intense, albeit brief, fighting broke out between two nuclear-armed rivals when India and Pakistan traded air strikes, missile attacks and more; the scope of the violence was unprecedented between two nuclear-armed states. In June, Russia became the first nuclear-armed state to lose a significant number of nuclear-capable platforms after Ukraine carried out a daring attack, using drones to destroy bombers on Russian soil.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Israel, an undeclared nuclear-armed nation, carried out the most ambitious military action to stem nuclear proliferation in history, striking at Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran’s retaliation with hundreds of missiles constituted the largest-ever attack against the heartland of a country possessing nuclear weapons.\n\nThe conversation around nuclear weapons has also shifted. From East Asia to Europe, allies of the United States are asking whether they can continue to rely on its guarantees of nuclear deterrence or might need a plan B, possibly involving nuclear weapons of their own. South Koreans are watching with trepidation as North Korea’s nuclear arsenal grows in number and sophistication. Meanwhile, eastern European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are concerned as Russian nuclear weapons enter Belarus, and Moscow’s reliance on its own nuclear capabilities to project power seems to grow.\n\nHow to avoid nuclear war in an era of AI and misinformation\n\nAlthough non-nuclear states are unlikely to sprint to the bomb any time soon, loose talk around the pursuit of nuclear weapons speaks to growing malaise about a world that is more primed for conventional wars and about a less consistent United States, as well as to the reduced unease about the prospect of nuclear war.\n\nRelations between China, the United States and Russia encapsulate this dynamic. China, for reasons that remain uncertain, has embarked on an ambitious build-up of its nuclear arsenal, which, US intelligence suggests, could go from roughly 200 warheads in 2019 to 1,500 by 2035. Meanwhile, Washington and Moscow will soon find themselves unburdened by numerical limits on their nuclear forces for the first time since the 1970s, when the 2011 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, expires in February 2026.\n\nUnnerved by increased competition with both of these nuclear-armed rivals, the United States is likely to deploy more nuclear weapons on its existing submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles, while pursuing an ambitious approach to missile defence in what has been dubbed Golden Dome. A three-way arms race is all but certain to ensue. Governments and scientists need to be prepared for the consequences.\n\nTrends are reversing\n\nThe global outlook was very different back in 1991 when the cold war ended, giving way to a period of broader global optimism about the part that nuclear weapons would play in world politics. Coinciding with the Soviet Union’s collapse, both Washington and Moscow withdrew thousands of nuclear weapons that they had deployed abroad (see ‘Global nuclear-warhead inventory’).\n\nSource: The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Nuclear Notebook (go.nature.com/4JQYHWT)\n\nIn the years that followed, both the United States and Russia made sharp reductions in their strategic nuclear weapons — those that could hit the other’s territory — acknowledging a transformed security environment. Arsenals numbering in the tens of thousands in the 1980s were reduced by an order of magnitude by the following decade. Still, nuclear weapons and their risks didn’t evaporate: crises in South Asia and the Korean Peninsula have persisted. But the oppressive shadow of nuclear Armageddon involving the United States and the Soviet Union receded.\n\nDuring the 1990s, there were significant efforts to universalize international norms against the spread, and testing, of nuclear weapons: the 1970 Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was extended indefinitely in 1995, and, the following year, a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was opened for signature. The goal of global nuclear disarmament seemed viable for the first time.\n\nPhysicists unleashed the power of the atom — but to what end?\n\nYet, today, even as trend lines head in the opposite direction, members of the public around the world are paying little heed. They are aware of nuclear weapons but have largely not yet grasped that the risks these represent are multiplying.\n\nFor the past 30 years, the relatively benign post-cold-war nuclear environment has allowed global attention to turn elsewhere: to the liberalization of trade, the pursuit of multilateralism and sustainable development, and counterterrorism after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, for example.\n\nFor those who came of age in this calmer world, nuclear weapons are something seen in films set in the cold war, or referenced in works of music from previous eras. By contrast, for those who lived through the cold war, almost everyone — whether citizen or soldier or politician — needed to know at least a little about nuclear weapons. By the 1980s, such knowledge and fear of nuclear war had permeated so deeply that large protests against the bomb proliferated. Today, people need to reacquire that literacy.",

          "authors": "Mariana Lenharo",
          "abstract": "Protein powders are a booming industry.Credit: Andrii Shevchuk/Alamy\n\nProtein has become a buzzword in health and wellness circles, with social-media influencers touting high-protein diets as the ultimate solution for weight loss and muscle gain. A search on the social-media platform TikTok for “200 grams of protein a day” yields dozens of videos offering tips on how to stay fit by reaching that target, the equivalent of more than seven servings of cooked steak. The market has responded with a flood of products promising to boost protein intake, including powders, bars, cookies, yogurt and even popcorn.\n\nBut the scientific evidence supporting the protein craze is mixed. Nature spoke to researchers about what’s behind this trend and who might benefit from protein supplements.\n\nFrom meat extract to whey protein\n\nIt’s unclear what sparked the current protein obsession. But products marketed for their protein content have been around since the 1860s, says Hannah Cutting-Jones, a food historian at the University of Oregon in Eugene. The concept of macronutrients — carbohydrates, fat and protein — had just been introduced when one of the first scientists to study them, German chemist Justus von Liebig, launched a product called Liebig’s Extract of Meat as a cheap substitute for the real thing. (Its nutritional value was later shown to be negligible.)\n\nWhat humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet\n\nSince then, “proteins have been the only macronutrient that has never been vilified”, says Cutting-Jones, referring to the bad reputations that fat and carbs have acquired over the decades.\n\nIn the early 2000s, scientists published a spate of studies1,2 linking high-protein intake with weight loss. Around that time, Cutting-Jones says, a growing number of food manufacturers started turning whey, a by-product of cheesemaking, into protein powders.\n\nMore recently, social media has hyped protein supplements as a staple of the healthy lifestyle. Such promotion matters: a small survey3 about protein-supplement use among non-professional athletes found that 40% of participants listed social media as their main source of information about the supplements. “You have these influencers who are not trained in nutrition, but are promoting these protein-rich products,” Cutting-Jones says.\n\nProtein push\n\nMost dietary guidelines recommend that healthy adults consume around 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. But many health influencers suggest that’s not enough, especially for those engaged in resistance training, a type of exercise that focuses on building strength, such as by lifting weights.\n\nWhy is exercise good for you? Scientists are finding answers in our cells\n\nIn that context, consuming protein after a workout provides the building blocks that the body needs to repair and rebuild the muscles. “What you see a lot on TikTok are people suggesting a gram of protein per pound of body weight,” says Ethan Balk, a clinical dietitian at New York University. That’s 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight — close to three times the standard recommendation.\n\n“The bodybuilding community kind of swears by that,” Balk says. “But there’s been less, if any, support from research on that.”\n\nA large systematic review4 found that protein supplementation was associated with increased strength and muscle size among healthy adults doing resistance training. But the benefits plateau at a total protein intake of 1.6 grams per kilogram per day. Consuming more than that offers no extra advantage, the review found. More is “just wasteful”, says Nancy Rodriguez, a nutritional scientist and registered dietitian at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.\n\nWho benefits?\n\nSome studies suggest that older people, especially post-menopausal women5, need more protein than younger adults do to maintain healthy bones and muscles. But older adults don’t necessarily need to take supplements to reach their protein goals: a balanced diet is often enough, says Rodriguez.",

This Perspective takes a complex systems view on physical activity, proposing that at least two layers of complexity should be considered: (1) interactions between various physiological, psychological, social and environmental systems; and (2) their dynamic interactions across time. To address this complexity, all stages of the research process—from theory and measurement to study design, analysis and interventions—must be aligned with a complex systems perspective. This alignment requires intensive interdisciplinary collaboration and an integration of basic and applied research beyond current research practices to create transdisciplinary solutions. We offer actionable insights that bridge the gap between abstract theoretical approaches (for example, complex systems and attractor landscape frameworks of behaviour change) and practical research on physical activity, thereby laying a foundation for more effective behaviour change interventions.",

          "abstract": "What determines who becomes and stays friends? Many factors are linked to friendship, including physical proximity and interpersonal similarities. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends by capturing how people process the world around them. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips—acquired before participants met one another—predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (that is, participants with similar responses were more likely to be friends rather than several degrees of separation apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after they met each other. Compared with people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this six-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in deeper interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.",

          "abstract": "Extinction learning—the suppression of a previously acquired fear response—is critical for adaptive behaviour and core for understanding the aetiology and treatment of anxiety disorders. Electrophysiological studies in rodents have revealed critical roles of theta (4–12 Hz) oscillations in amygdala and hippocampus during both fear learning and extinction, and engram research has shown that extinction relies on the formation of novel, highly context-dependent memory traces that suppress the initial fear memories. Whether similar processes occur in humans and how they relate to previously described neural mechanisms of episodic memory formation and retrieval remains unknown. Intracranial EEG recordings in epilepsy patients provide direct access to the deep brain structures of the fear and extinction network, while representational similarity analysis allows characterizing the memory traces of specific cues and contexts. Here we combined these methods to show that amygdala theta oscillations during extinction learning signal safety rather than threat and that extinction memory traces are characterized by stable and context-specific neural representations that are coordinated across the extinction network. We further demonstrate that context specificity during extinction learning predicts the reoccurrence of fear memory traces during a subsequent test period, while reoccurrence of extinction memory traces predicts safety responses. Our results reveal the neurophysiological mechanisms and representational characteristics of context-dependent extinction learning in the human brain. In addition, they show that the mutual competition of fear and extinction memory traces provides a mechanistic basis for clinically important phenomena such as fear renewal and extinction retrieval.",

          "abstract": "Among the most significant modes of human creative expression is style: the capacity to represent objects, events and scenes (for example, lilies dotting a pond) in some distinctive manner (for example, Monet’s broken brushstrokes and blended colours). Diverse research traditions analyse the social, political and aesthetic significance of stylistic representation. But what are the cognitive and computational foundations of this capacity? Here we characterize style perception as a process that ‘parses’ form from content, and adapt classic psychophysical paradigms to discover multiple new phenomena of style perception. Using both naturalistic images and synthetic stimuli, ten experiments reveal perceptual ‘tuning’ to stylistic information, representational constancy over stylistic variation, and mental rendering of novel styled objects. Moreover, an object recognition model further grounds style perception by capturing human judgements of image similarity over different styles. Together, this work illuminates the psychological foundations of stylistic perception and opens the door to further investigation of styled media.",

Our findings suggest a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth estimated for computer science papers (up to 22%). By comparison, mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed lower evidence of LLM modification (up to 9%).

          "abstract": "Authorities, from parents of toddlers to leaders of formal institutions, use punishment to communicate disapproval and enforce social norms. Ideally, from whether and how severely a transgression is punished, targets and observers infer shared social norms. Yet in light of every punitive choice, observers also evaluate the motives and legitimacy of the authority. Here, we show that the effects of punishment can only be understood by considering these inferences simultaneously. We measured human observers’ joint inferences empirically in three preregistered experiments ( N = 1 , 254 ) and developed a rational Bayesian model using an inverse planning framework that captures and explains these inferences and their interactions quantitatively and parsimoniously. When people have different priors about norms or authorities, the model predicted and we experimentally confirmed that observing punishment by the authority can sustain polarization. This work reveals the rational logic behind how people learn from punishment and a key constraint on the function of punishment in establishing shared social norms.",

          "abstract": "People and cultures differ in the extent to which they view the world as a zero-sum environment (where one person’s gain is another’s loss) or a positive-sum environment (where certain actions can benefit everyone). These beliefs shape individuals’ willingness to work, invest, collaborate, or show hostility toward out-groups, and accept or reject various social policies. We model dyadic interactions in a heterogeneous population where individuals biased toward a zero-sum worldview are more likely to invest in competition, while those biased toward a positive-sum worldview are more likely to invest in cooperation. The environment alternates stochastically between cooperative and competitive states. Without social influence, the more accurate worldview yields higher utilities and spreads throughout the population. However, assortative matching by bias can favor the positive-sum worldview even if a positive-sum environment is somewhat less likely. With peer conformity, inaccurate worldviews can persist after a structural change in the environment, leading to cultural evolutionary mismatch. In the presence of cultural authorities who can alter beliefs, either both worldviews can coexist or one excludes the other. Moreover, when assortative matching and conformity interact, authorities may profit by amplifying individuals’ biases, creating enclaves of similarly biased people who can pay the authorities enough to make investment in persuasive technology economically viable. Cultural evolutionary mismatch is more likely in cultures marked by strong peer conformity and high responsiveness to authority when the authority promotes a suboptimal worldview. This study demonstrates how real-world conditions, peer influence, and authority interventions can perpetuate or shift zero-sum and positive-sum worldviews-at times leading to inaccurate beliefs.",

Recently, however, reports of coordinated scientific fraud activities have increased. Some suggest that the ease of communication provided by the internet and open-access publishing have created the conditions for the emergence of entities—paper mills (i.e., sellers of mass-produced low quality and fabricated research), brokers (i.e., conduits between producers and publishers of fraudulent research), predatory journals, who do not conduct any quality controls on submissions—that facilitate systematic scientific fraud. Here, we demonstrate through case studies that i) individuals have cooperated to publish papers that were eventually retracted in a number of journals, ii) brokers have enabled publication in targeted journals at scale, and iii), within a field of science, not all subfields are equally targeted for scientific fraud. Our results reveal some of the strategies that enable the entities promoting scientific fraud to evade interventions. Our final analysis suggests that this ability to evade interventions is enabling the number of fraudulent publications to grow at a rate far outpacing that of legitimate science.",

During this task, we recorded eye-gaze with participants’ webcams. Results show substantial variation in behavioral in-group favoritism across cultures, linking discrimination based on group membership to higher societal uncertainty. Individual preferences for prosociality conditioned differences in visual search effort, but the directionality of the effect differs between countries. Individual-level predictors explained participants remaining colorblind toward others’ group membership, where society-level predictors did not. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of taking culture into account when assessing cognitive processes underlying behavior.

          "abstract": "What will it take to eliminate hunger in a world that is increasingly serious about climate change mitigation? For the past two decades, climate activism and mitigation efforts have largely focused on energy, industry, and transportation as the main contributors to anthropogenic warming. Although there is a long way to go to eliminate emissions from these sources, increasing international ambition means that attention is now turning to other hard-to-decarbonize sectors. Net zero food systems in particular pose unique challenges for humanity, given the moral dimensions of food security and the strong potential for vicious cycles: Globally hunger is back on the rise, the changing climate is already making food production for a growing population more difficult, and food shocks could lead to more land use change emissions that accelerate warming and feed back to negatively impact agricultural productivity and hunger. The dynamics of food production and consumption differ from other sectors and reveal several dimensions in which it will be critical to get policy right. Recent science suggests that two coordinated efforts will be needed to meet this challenge—a revamped focus on smallholder adaptation and productivity, and new “safety valve” institutions that sit at the intersection of food production and climate mitigation efforts and can operate at the relevant spatial and temporal scales to avoid negative tradeoffs in the quest to eliminate hunger and stabilize earth’s climate.",

AA-20 reduces polyglutamine aggregation in an autophagy-dependent manner in both human cells and C. elegans , where it also promotes fitness. Consistently, we found that AA-20 extends lifespan in WT C. elegans, but not in autophagy-deficient mutants. Interestingly, our findings suggest that AA-20 acts, at least in part, through a mechanism involving the transcription factor EB, but without inhibiting the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Collectively, our results identify an autophagy activator AA-20 , which may have potential therapeutic implications for aging-related proteinopathies and lipid storage disorders.",

          "abstract": "Topological states of matter, first discovered in quantum systems, have opened new avenues for wave manipulation beyond the quantum realm. In elastic media, realizing these topological effects requires identifying lattices that support the corresponding topological bands. However, among the vast number of theoretically predicted topological states, only a small fraction has been physically realized. To close this gap, we present a strategy capable of systematically and efficiently discovering metamaterials with desired topological state. Our approach builds on topological quantum chemistry, which systematically classifies topological states by analyzing symmetry properties at selected wavevectors. Because this method condenses the topological character into mathematical information at a small set of wavevectors, it encodes a clear and computationally efficient objective for topology optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that, for certain lattice symmetries, this classification can be further reduced to intuitive morphological features of the phonon band structure. By incorporating these band morphology constraints into topology optimization algorithms and further fabricating obtained designs, we enable the automated discovery and physical realization of metamaterials with targeted topological properties. This methodology establishes a paradigm for engineering topological elastic lattices on demand, addressing the bottleneck in material realization and paving the way for a comprehensive database of topological metamaterial configurations.",

          "abstract": "Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) results in spin polarization of electrons transmitted through chiral molecules and materials. Since CISS results in spin polarization even at room temperature, it affords the possibility of using it to develop quantum technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. We have shown previously that photo-driven hole transfer within DNA hairpins provides a facile route to generate spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs). To study the effect of CISS on the spin dynamics of SCRPs in DNA hairpins, we prepared a series of electron donor—chiral bridge—acceptor molecules where the chiral bridge is a B-form DNA helix consisting of 4 to 6 base pairs. Naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) serves as the hairpin linker chromophore and electron acceptor. Photoexcitation of NDI results in rapid hole transfer through the π-stacked purine bases of the DNA and trapping of the hole on a terminal stilbene diether (Sd) to generate the NDI •− - Sd •+ SCRP. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the SCRPs at X- (9.6 GHz), Q- (34 GHz), and W- (94 GHz) bands show that the CISS effect imparts significant triplet character to the SCRP. We do not observe a significant dependence of CISS on DNA length, likely resulting from hole delocalization over the guanine bases in the G-tract. Interestingly, we find that the CISS contribution significantly increases with magnetic field strength. These findings should be considered in any future modeling of CISS.",

          "abstract": "Memory generalization allows an organism to adapt to new conditions, but overgeneralization of fear or traumatic experiences can be detrimental to survival and contributes to the development of various mental disorders. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fear memory generalization, especially in the hippocampus, remain largely unknown. In this study, utilizing a well-established mouse model of fear memory generalization, we investigated the role of endocannabinoids (eCBs)-mediated GABAergic synaptic inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in regulating contextual fear memory generalization. Our results revealed that pharmacological or genetic blockade of CB1R in hippocampal CA1 resulted in overgeneralization of contextual fear memory but not fear memory expression. Subsequent investigations in conditional knockout mice revealed the involvement of CB1R in GABAergic neurons, but not those in glutamatergic neurons or astrocytes, in this overgeneralization. In addition, activation of GABA A receptors on pyramidal neurons was required for inducing overgeneralization via AM281, a CB1R antagonist. Neural mechanistic studies showed that eCBs/CB1R signaling regulates both the activity and plasticity of inhibitory synapses during generalization, highlighting the prominence of the disinhibition of CB1R in interneurons during this process. Subsequently, we delved into the downstream effects and found that eCB-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons was regulated by the aforementioned mechanisms. Our findings illustrate that the eCBs/CB1R signaling pathway modulates the balance between fear memory discrimination and generalization by controlling inhibitory inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons, accompanied by alterations in excitatory plasticity within this region.",

          "abstract": "HvAACT1 is a major aluminum (Al)-tolerance gene in barley, encoding a citrate transporter that belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. This transporter facilitates citrate secretion from the roots, thereby detoxifying external Al ions—a major constraint of crop production on acidic soils. In this study, we present the outward-facing crystal structure of HvAACT1, providing insights into a citrate transport mechanism. The putative citrate binding site consists of three basic residues—K126 in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2), R358 in TM7, and R535 in TM12—creating substantial positive charges in the C-lobe cavity. Proton coupling for substrate transport may involve two pairs of aspartate residues in the N-lobe cavity, one of which corresponds to the essential Asp pair found in prokaryotic H + -coupled MATE transporters belonging to the DinF subfamily. Structural coupling between proton uptake in the N-lobe and citrate extrusion in the C-lobe can be enabled by an extensive, unique hydrogen-bonding network at the extracellular half of the N-lobe. Mutation-based functional analysis, structural comparisons, molecular dynamics simulation, and phylogenic analysis suggest an evolutionary link between citrate MATE transporters and the DinF MATE subfamily. Our findings provide a solid structural basis for citrate transport by HvAACT1 in barley and contribute to a broader understanding of citrate transporter structures in other plant species.",

In the high-latitude regions of Northern Europe that are currently subject to rapid climate warming, we lack a comprehensive understanding of faunal biodiversity in the last glacial period due to the extreme rarity of preserved organic remains. Here, we present a stratified sediment deposit with a diverse faunal composition preserved in a bone-bearing layer in Arne Qvamgrotta, part of the Storsteinhola cave system (68.10° N 16.38° E) in Northern Norway. Chronological analyses of sediments and bones including radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, uranium–thorium, and phylogenetic dating place the faunal assemblage in Marine Isotope Stage 5a (MIS 5a, Odderade interstadial, ~85 to 71 ka). Combining comparative osteology and bulk-bone metabarcoding, we identify 46 taxa, including mammals, birds, and fish, with several species not previously found in Fennoscandia. The fauna implies a nonanalogous cold-adapted coastal community, with close proximity to sea ice and nearby freshwater bodies. Mitogenome analyses of a subset of taxa identify extinct lineages which attest to a lack of habitat tracking and the absence of a local refugium during the subsequent fully glaciated periods. This faunal record demonstrates long-term faunal dynamics and coastal environmental conditions during MIS 5a in the European Arctic.",

The N-terminal helix α0 of PspA (and other ESCRT-III members) has been suggested to act as a membrane anchor; the detailed mechanism, however, of how it binds to membranes and eventually triggers membrane fusion and/or fission events remains unclear. By solving a total of 15 cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PspA and a truncation lacking the N-terminal helix α0 in the presence of Escherichia coli polar lipid membranes, we show in molecular detail how PspA interacts with and remodels membranes: Binding of the N-terminal helix α0 in the outer tubular membrane leaflet induces membrane curvature, supporting membrane tubulation by PspA. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy computations of interactions between the helix α0 and negatively charged membranes suggest a compensating mechanism between helix-membrane interactions and the energy contributions required for membrane bending. The energetic considerations are in line with the membrane structures observed in the cryo-EM images of tubulated membrane vesicles, fragmented vesicles inside tapered PspA rods, and shedded vesicles emerging at the thinner PspA rod ends. Our results provide insights into the molecular determinants and a potential mechanism of vesicular membrane remodeling mediated by a member of the ESCRT-III superfamily.",

Long-term data have illuminated butterfly declines across geographic regions. However, critical questions remain on how butterfly declines are distributed across species and functional groups, limiting effective conservation. Here, we show unprecedented changes in butterfly biodiversity resulting from 32 y of species levels declines throughout the Midwestern United States. No species increased over the three-decade study period and abundance declined across every functional group (e.g., rare, common, migratory, resident; annual mean trend: −0.9 to −2.3% per year). Species richness declined across all but one functional group, with concomitant increases in evenness (e.g., abundance among species) in several groups resulting from steeper losses in abundance for common species (abundance: −1.9% per year; richness: −0.04% per year) as compared to rare species (abundance: −0.9% per year; richness: −1.33% per year). Our results paint a bleaker picture than other butterfly studies likely due to our long time series of data and ability to include rare species. Such widespread declines undoubtedly affect other trophic levels and ecosystem services. Focusing risk assessments and management interventions only on rare species is likely to be insufficient given broad declines across species, which have fundamentally restructured butterfly communities in the region. As such, conservation efforts should shift focus to species assemblages and entire communities when possible.",

We previously reported that cancer cells can rapidly remodel their actin cytoskeleton upon NK cell engagement, leading to F-actin accumulation at the synapse. Here, we show that this process inhibits NK cell activation as indicated by impaired MTOC and lytic granule polarization. Exploring the underlying mechanism, we demonstrate that actin remodeling drives the recruitment of inhibitory ligands, such as HLA-A, -B, and -C, to the synapse. Disrupting HLA interaction with their cognate inhibitory receptors KIRs restores NK cell activation. Using NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR receptors, matched or unmatched to HLA molecules on cancer cells, we show that synaptic F-actin accumulation and matching KIR–HLA interactions jointly suppress NK cell cytotoxicity. Our findings reveal an immune evasion strategy in which cancer cells impair NK cell activation by altering synaptic signaling through actin cytoskeleton–driven recruitment of inhibitory signals to the IS.",

Despite their therapeutic importance, key aspects of AAV natural biology remain obscure, complicating efforts to explain rare AAV-associated diseases and optimize gene therapy vectors. By analyzing sequence data from virus isolates and endogenous viral elements (EVEs), I reveal a striking evolutionary pattern: While AAV sublineages, defined by the replication-associated ( rep ) gene, have broadly codiverged with host groups over millions of years, capsid ( cap ) diversity has been shaped by extensive recombination. In particular, one capsid lineage, Mammalian-wide ( M-wide ), has spread horizontally across diverse rep lineages and host taxa through multiple recombination events. Furthermore, several AAVs with M-wide capsids—including AAV-4, AAV-12, and bovine AAV (BAAV)—originate from historical adenovirus (Ad) stocks, raising the possibility that laboratory conditions contributed to capsid transfer. Distinguishing natural from laboratory-driven recombination is essential for understanding AAV ecology and its implications for gene therapy. A systematic sequencing effort in human and primate populations is needed to assess the extent of recombinant capsid acquisition, determine the impact of laboratory-driven recombination on circulating AAV diversity, and track ongoing recombination events that could affect vector safety and efficacy.",

The liquid–liquid phase transition hypothesis, which posits the existence of distinct low-density and high-density liquid states separated by a first-order phase transition terminating at a critical point, has gained increasing experimental and computational support and offers a thermodynamically consistent framework for many of water’s anomalies. However, experimental challenges in avoiding crystallization near the postulated liquid–liquid critical point have focused attention to water’s canonical glassy states: low-density and high-density amorphous ice. Here, we use two Deep Potential machine-learning models, trained on the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed density functional and the highly accurate Many-Body Polarizable potential, to conduct an investigation of water’s glassy phenomenology based on quantum mechanical calculations. Despite not being explicitly trained on amorphous ices, both models accurately capture the structure and transformation of the water glasses, including their interconversion along different thermodynamic paths. Isobaric quenching of liquid water at various pressures generates a continuum of intermediate amorphous ices and density fluctuations increase near the liquid–liquid critical pressure. The glass transition temperatures of the amorphous ices produced at different pressures exhibit two distinct branches, corresponding to low-density and high-density amorphous ice behaviors, consistent with experiment and the liquid–liquid transition hypothesis. Extrapolating transformation pressures from isothermal compressions to experimental compression rates brings our simulations into excellent agreement with data. Our findings demonstrate that machine-learning potentials trained on equilibrium phases can effectively model nonequilibrium glassy behavior and pave the way for studying long-timescale, out-of-equilibrium processes with quantum mechanical accuracy.",

These functions are driven by contraction of the orbicularis oculi (OO), which is a unique skeletal muscle with a circular geometry and diffuse innervation. It is thought that this distributed innervation may allow for differential segmental activation and contraction, but it is not currently understood how sequenced activation patterns relate to differential muscle contraction, nor how segmental contraction creates the kinematics that drive the eyelid’s critical functions. In fact, motion of the eyelid has predominantly been modeled in only a single dimension (open–close). Here, we show that eyelid motion has important two-dimensional features that vary between eyelid behaviors. Using distributed intramuscular electromyography, we further show that activation differs segmentally across the OO, and that patterns of activation change to produce different behavior-specific eyelid kinematics. Our results demonstrate the role of segmental activation in eyelid motion, highlighting the importance of precise neural control in producing natural eyelid behavior. We anticipate that this research is a starting point for robust mechanistic models of eyelid function. This knowledge has critical implications for diagnosis and treatment of eyelid paralysis.",

Spectroscopic techniques are instrumental in this identification process. The capacity of AI to establish the correlations between spectra and chemical substances renders it a suitable tool for spectra analysis. However, the presence of limited data, or even the absence of data, is a common occurrence for intermediates with transient characteristics. This poses a significant challenge in meeting the data requirements of AI models. Herein, we propose a generalizable machine learning model that utilizes zero-shot learning to identify chemical reaction intermediates by their spectra in unseen catalytic systems. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and visual dimensionality reduction, it was determined that the model’s superior generalizability is attributable to its capacity of learning common patterns of spectra-intermediates, effectively mapping disparate catalytic systems to analogous digital spaces. Therefore, the model can be directly used without fine-tuning parameters for unseen systems even in the presence of noise or solvents. This work demonstrates the application of zero-shot learning in machine learned spectroscopy and illustrates the prediction mechanism, providing a perspective for interpretable and robust cross-system prediction. It lays a solid foundation for the application of spectral descriptors in real reaction systems and the comprehension of chemical reaction mechanisms.",

We show that the nonequilibrium kinetics at which these elongated links, or spaghetti, adhere to the available volume without mutual crossings is logarithmic in time, as opposed to the algebraic growth in lower dimensions for needle-like packings. We attribute this qualitatively different behavior to a delay in the activation of depletion forces caused by the 3D nature of the problem. Equally important, we find that this slow kinetics is metastable, allowing us to analytically predict the kinetic scaling characterizing an algebraic growth due to the nucleation of local bundles.

Utilizing the pangenome, 1,807 strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (ssGEMs) were generated, which performed well in quantitative predictions of cellular phenotypes, thus helping to examine the metabolic disparities among all S. cerevisiae strains. Integrative analyses of fluxomics and transcriptomics with ssGEMs showcased ubiquitous transcriptional regulation of metabolic flux in specific pathways (i.e., amino acid synthesis) at a population level. Additionally, the gene/reaction inactivation analysis through the ssGEMs refined by transcriptomics showed that S. cerevisiae strains from various ecological niches had undergone reductive evolution at both the genomic and metabolic network levels when compared to wild isolates. Finally, the compiled analysis of the pangenome, transcriptome, and metabolic fluxome revealed remarkable metabolic differences among S. cerevisiae strains originating from distinct oxygen-limited niches, including human gut and cheese environments, and identified convergent metabolic evolution, such as downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Together, these results illustrate how yeast adapts to distinct niches modulated by genomic and metabolic reprogramming, and provide computational resources for translating yeast genotype to fitness in future studies.",

          "abstract": "The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus performs a broad variety of proviral activities in the infected cell, primarily mediating evasion from the host innate immune response by being the main viral interferon antagonist. However, there are several interactions whose biological relevance remains obscure, such as the ability of NS1 to bind and activate class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). PI3Ks are highly regulated lipid kinases that act as critical nodes in multiple cell signaling networks and are also important proto-oncogenes. This activation is mediated by NS1 binding specifically to the p85β subunit. To better understand the consequences of this interaction, we developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to selectively track the different PI3K heterodimers and, using this system, we found that NS1 induces an isoform-specific relocation and activation of the different PI3K heterodimers. We found that clinically relevant oncogenic mutations in both catalytic and regulatory subunits of PI3K could mimic the effect caused by NS1, and partially rescue the loss of viral fitness in a recombinant virus encoding a p85β-binding deficient NS1.",

In this study, we developed a computational workflow to identify viral introductions and trace locally circulating clusters. We analyzed over 26,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and their associated metadata, collected between January and October 2021, to explore introduction and local dispersal patterns in Greater Houston, a major metropolitan area known for its demographic diversity. Our analysis identified more than 1,000 independent introduction events, resulting in clusters of varying sizes. The majority of introductions originated from domestic sources, while international introductions occurred earlier and were associated with larger cluster sizes. An analysis of locally circulating clusters revealed age-structured transmission dynamics. Geographic reconstruction of cluster spread identified Harris County as the primary viral source for surrounding areas. The outbreak in the source population was characterized by 1) a smaller proportion of new cases associated with external viral imports and 2) longer persistence times of circulating lineages. Overall, our high-resolution spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic provides essential insights into the local-scale transmission landscape, supporting outbreak-specific, regional response strategies and public health planning.",

In this article, we show that the Fermi liquid parameters of a two-dimensional metal are modified by cavity polariton modes, and that these changes can be monitored by measuring a paradigmatic magneto-transport phenomenon, Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in a weak perpendicular magnetic field. This effect is intrinsic, and totally unrelated to disorder. As an illustrative example, we carry out explicit calculations of the quasiparticle velocity of graphene in a planar van der Waals cavity formed by natural hyperbolic crystals and metal gates. The largest effects of the cavity occur when the phonon polariton modes of the former match energetically the graphene plasmon. For typical graphene carrier densities this occurs in the Terahertz spectral range.",

          "abstract": "Efficient gene expression depends on the tightly regulated export of messenger RNA (mRNA) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which are densely modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Although dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to a variety of human diseases, the precise distribution of O-GlcNAc within the NPC and its effects on mRNA export remain poorly understood. Here, we combined single-point edge-excitation subdiffraction (SPEED) microscopy with stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to map the nanometer-scale distribution of an O-GlcNAc analog (GlcNAz) within NPCs and to quantify the export kinetics of mRNA–protein complexes (mRNPs) under both normal and perturbed O-GlcNAcylation conditions. Under basal conditions, GlcNAz is predominantly localized around the central channel of the NPC. However, both hypo- and hyper-O-GlcNAcylation cause GlcNAz to redistribute toward the nuclear and cytoplasmic peripheries. This shift is paralleled by changes in mRNP localization and altered distributions of key, highly O-GlcNAcylated, phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins. These architectural rearrangements are accompanied by functional consequences: Elevated O-GlcNAcylation nearly doubles mRNA export efficiency (~61%), while reduced O-GlcNAcylation lowers it to ~16%, along with reduced NPC engagement. The transport receptor TAP exhibits analogous efficiency changes, reinforcing the role of O-GlcNAcylation as a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Together, these results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation modulates NPC architecture and transport dynamics to fine-tune mRNA export, and indicate that targeted modulation of NPC O-GlcNAc levels may offer a promising strategy for addressing diseases associated with nuclear transport dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "X-succinate synthases (XSSs) are glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) that catalyze the addition of hydrocarbons to fumarate via radical chemistry, thereby activating them for microbial metabolism. To date, the only structurally characterized XSS is benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS), which functionalizes toluene. A distinct subclass of XSSs acts on saturated hydrocarbons, which possess much stronger C(sp 3 )–H bonds than toluene, suggesting mechanistic and structural differences from BSS. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of one such enzyme, (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase (MASS) from Azoarcus strain HxN1, which functionalizes n -alkanes (C6–C8). The structure reveals an asymmetric dimer in which both sides contain a catalytic α-subunit and accessory γ-subunit. One α-subunit also binds two additional subunits, β and δ. The β-subunit binds a [4Fe–4S] cluster and adopts a fold similar to BSSβ. The β-subunit appears to regulate the flexibility of the α-subunit to enable opening of the active site, affording the binding of n -alkane substrates. The δ-subunit, which lacks homology to known GRE subunits, adopts a rubredoxin-like fold that binds a single Fe ion, an architecture not previously reported for GREs. MASSδ occupies the same region of the α-subunit as the activating enzyme (AE) and may regulate the conformational changes required for glycyl radical installation. Structural comparisons between MASS and BSS reveal differences in how fumarate is bound and show amino acid substitutions that could account for the binding of alkanes versus toluene. Together, this structure offers insight into anaerobic alkane activation via fumarate addition.",

          "abstract": "During development, groups of cells generate shape by coordinating their mechanical properties through an interplay of self-organization and prepatterning. Hydra displays a striking planar pattern of actin fibers at the organism scale, and mechanics influence the morphogenesis of biological structures during its prepatterned regeneration. However, how mechanics participate in the formation of an ordered pattern from a totally disordered state remains unknown. To study this, we used cellular aggregates formed from dissociated Hydra cells, which initially lose all actin polarity yet regenerate a long-range actin pattern. We showed quantitatively that the actin meshwork evolves from a disordered symmetric state to an ordered state in which rotational symmetry is broken, and translation symmetry is partially broken, with the nematic and smectic order parameters increasing over days. During the first hours, the actin meshwork displayed spatial heterogeneity in the nematic order parameter, and ordered domains separated by line defects progressively grew and fused. This suggests that local cell–cell interactions drive the transition from disorder to order. To understand the mechanism of ordering, we perturbed the tissue’s physical constraints. We showed that while topology and geometry do not have a direct effect, anisotropic stretch biases the emerging orientation of the actin meshwork within hours. Surprisingly, although a Wnt head organizer is expected to play a role in the actin ordering, the stretch-associated alignment happened without the prior formation of a head organizer. This demonstrates the role of tissue mechanics in the alignment of the actin fibers during the disorder-to-order transition.",

          "abstract": "Small open reading frames (smORFs) encode microproteins that play crucial roles in various biological processes, yet their functions in adipocyte biology remain largely unexplored. In a previous study, we identified thousands of smORFs in white and brown adipocytes derived from the stromal vascular fraction of mice using ribosome profiling. Here, we expand on this work by identifying additional smORFs related to adipocytes using the in vitro 3T3-L1 preadipocyte model. To systematically investigate the functional relevance of these smORFs, we designed a custom CRISPR/Cas9 single guide RNA (sgRNA) library and screened for smORFs influencing adipocyte proliferation and differentiation. Through a dropout screen and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting of lipid droplets, we identified dozens of smORFs that regulate either cell proliferation or lipid accumulation. The smORFs on the 5’- and 3’-untranslated regions (i.e., upstream smORFs (uORFs) and downstream smORFs (dORFs)) of functional genes can exert activity through cis-regulatory effects of the main ORF on these messenger RNAs (mRNAs), such as uORFs of MDM2 that impact proliferation. However, other smORFs, especially those from mRNAs with no other ORFs, point to a functional microprotein. Indeed, we tested a candidate smORF 1183 from a long noncoding RNA 923011K14Rik and demonstrated that the microprotein regulates adipocyte differentiation. These findings highlight the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based screening to uncover functional smORFs and provide a framework for further exploration of microproteins in adipocyte biology and metabolic regulation.",

However, this notion has proven difficult to test given the overall uncertainty about both geographic locations and paleoclimates of ancestral species. By the resolution of both challenges, we reveal that early primates dispersed and radiated in higher latitudes, through diverse climates, including cold, arid, and temperate conditions. Contrary to expectations of the warm tropical forest hypothesis, warmer global temperatures had no effect on dispersal distances or the speciation rate. Rather, the amount of change in local temperature and precipitation substantially predicted geographic and species diversity. Our results suggest that nontropical, changeable environments exerted strong selective pressures on primates with higher dispersal ability – promoting the primate radiation and their subsequent colonization of tropical climates millions of years after their origin.",

Orally administered ADRIANA has potent analgesic effects in several nociceptive pain models of mice and nonhuman primates without cardiovascular effects. Mice with genetic loss of the α2B adrenoceptor showed normal responses to mechanical pain, but the analgesic effect of ADRIANA was not significantly detected.

However, the template RNA species that undergoes RAN translation endogenously remains unclear.

To assess endogenous repeat-containing lariat RNA contributions to RAN translation, we enhanced endogenous lariat stability by knocking down the lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1.

Moreover, existing Acr delivery methods are long-lived and operate within hours (e.g., viral and nonviral vectors) or require external devices (e.g., electroporation), limiting therapeutic applications. To address these problems, we developed a protein-based anti-CRISPR delivery platform, LF N -Acr/PA, which delivers Acrs into cells within minutes. LF N -Acr/PA is a nontoxic, two-component protein system derived from anthrax toxin, where protective antigen (PA) proteins bind receptors widespread in human cells, forming a pH-triggered endosomal pore that an engineered Acr (LF N -Acr) binds and uses to enter the cell. In the presence of PA, LF N -Acr enters human cells (e.g., immortalized cell lines, embryonic stem cells, and 3D cell cultures) at concentrations as low as 2.5 pM to inhibit up to 95% of Cas9-mediated knockout, knock-in, transcriptional activation, and base editing.

Here, we address this issue by presenting a crustal-scale analytical signal-amplitude model obtained from high-resolution airborne and shipborne magnetic data across cratons within East Asia. Magmatic, magnetic, and basin-history constraints show that the eastern North China craton experienced focused weakening, thickening, and catastrophic destruction of its mantle lithosphere due to a unique combination of circum-craton subduction and subsequent collision since the Paleozoic. By contrast, the adjacent South China craton was not impacted in this way, and thus, its mantle root was spared from destruction. The long-term survival of cratons may stem from the infrequent occurrence of sustained circum-cratonic subduction or collisional processes capable of destabilizing their lithospheric roots.",

Here, we present vertical profiles of carbonate ion concentration ([CO 3 2 − ]) from the Southwest Atlantic to investigate oceanic carbon sequestration during key intervals of atmospheric CO 2 change. During the first major decline in atmospheric CO 2 (115 to 109 ka), enhanced carbon storage occurred in the abyssal Atlantic (&gt;3,500 m water depth). During the second decline in CO 2 (72 to 68 ka), enhanced carbon storage occurred throughout the deep Atlantic (&gt;2,000 m water depth). Paired with δ 13 C and δ 18 O vertical profiles from the same locations, the [CO 3 2 − ] results suggest progressively greater sequestration of biological carbon occurred in the South Atlantic as the volume of Southern Source Water expanded during glacial inception. Shoaling of the carbonate ion saturation horizon during the second decline in pCO 2 resulted in seafloor calcium carbonate dissolution and enhanced alkalinity, likely contributing to further draw down of atmospheric CO 2 . We also document carbon release from the deep South Atlantic during glacial Terminations I and II when atmospheric CO 2 was rising.

          "abstract": "Air-breathing vertebrates incorporate a fraction of isotopically anomalous air O 2 in their body water. The 17 O isotope anomaly of air O 2 (expressed as Δ’ 17 O air ) is related to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations ( p CO 2 ) and gross primary production (GPP). Tooth enamel records the Δ’ 17 O of body water and can thus preserve such paleo- p CO 2 or paleo-GPP information over geological time periods. Here, we demonstrate the potential of respective reconstructions of atmospheric p CO 2 or GPP from the triple oxygen isotope composition of fossil dinosaur tooth enamel. The data from unaltered enamel samples, along with an assumed modern GPP t /GPP 0 ratio of 1 for the Mesozoic, suggest a mean Late Jurassic p CO 2 = 1,200 ± 150 ppmv and Late Cretaceous p CO 2 = 750 ± 200 ppmv. These estimates are in good agreement with other p CO 2 proxy data for the same time intervals. When utilizing a p CO 2 inferred from other proxies, tooth enamel Δ’ 17 O PO4 may also serve as a proxy for GPP. Using published p CO 2 data, we reconstructed GPP t /GPP 0 ratios with 1.20 ± 0.17 for the Late Jurassic and 2.24 ± 0.96 for the Late Cretaceous, which would imply a 20 to 120% higher GPP in the Mesozoic than today. Overall, triple oxygen isotope analysis of fossil teeth of terrestrial amniotes can provide insights into past atmospheric greenhouse gas content and global primary productivity.",

Through RNA-seq analysis of primary brain glial cells, we identified immune-responsive gene 1 ( Irg1 ) as one of the highly upregulated genes under inflammatory conditions. Validation in the spinal cords of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical MS model, confirmed elevated Irg1 levels in myeloid, CD4, and B cells in the EAE group, raising concerns as to whether Irg1 is detrimental or protective. Irg1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited severe EAE disease, increased mononuclear cell infiltration, and increased levels of triple-positive CD4+ T cells expressing IL17a, GM-CSF, and IFNγ. Adoptive transfer in Rag-1 KO and single-cell RNA sequencing highlighted the crucial role of Irg1 in shaping pathogenic Th17 cells. A lack of Irg1 in macrophages elevates Class II expression, promoting the polarization of myelin-primed CD4+ T cells into pathogenic Th17 cells via the NLRP3/IL-1β axis. Moreover, bone marrow chimeras revealed that immune cells lacking Irg1 maintained pathogenic and inflammatory phenotypes, suggesting its protective role in autoimmune diseases, including MS.",

Whether this functional coupling is universally conserved across eukaryotes is unclear. Here, we show using long read RNA sequencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that splicing inactivation does not result in widespread CPA impairment, and that inactivation of CPA has limited impact on splicing efficiency. The negative impact of CPA inactivation on splicing is mainly due to transcription termination defects that promote readthrough transcription, leading to splicing inhibition for downstream intron-containing genes. The deleterious effect of 5′ extensions on splicing is length-dependent and can be detected independently from CPA inactivation for endogenous or synthetic genes. Deficient termination can also promote usage of cryptic splice sites and long-range intergenic splicing events. These results argue against a broad coupling between splicing and CPA in S. cerevisiae but show that efficient CPA-mediated transcription termination is critical for splicing fidelity and efficiency in a compact genome.",

          "abstract": "DNA loop extrusion by cohesin has emerged as a critical pathway for chromosome organization. In vitro single-molecule experiments indicate that loop extrusion requires the assembly of a heteropentameric complex consisting of the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer, STAG1, NIPBL, and the kleisin SCC1. The complexity of the complete extrusion machinery, consisting of multiple subunits, DNA binding sites, and ATPases poses substantial challenges for revealing the underlying biomolecular mechanism. As a result, a number of different models have been proposed, many of which do not agree on key mechanistic aspects, such as the details of DNA loading, holoenzyme assembly, or the consequences of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Here, we use mass photometry to comprehensively quantify all the key biomolecular interactions required for DNA loop extrusion. We find that STAG1 binds tightly to the trimeric complex formed by the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer and SCC1, and together they weakly, but cooperatively, bind the DNA. Full-length NIPBL tightly binds DNA, acting as a DNA anchor during the mechanochemical loop extrusion cycle. Cohesin mutants incapable of head engagement, and those lacking DNA-binding domains in the ATPase heads show negligible differences in overall DNA-affinity, suggesting a minor role of these features for DNA binding. Instead, we find an ATP-modulated DNA binding site created by the interaction of STAG1 with SMC1/SMC3/SCC1, important for repeated grabbing and release of DNA critical to extrusion. Our results call for a careful reexamination of the proposed mechanisms and set energetic boundaries for future proposals.",

Here, we demonstrate this link for the important problem of thermal convection. We show how the hierarchical plume network in the near-wall region of the flow, which becomes increasingly sparse with increasing distance away from the wall, is connected to the marginal stability of the thermal boundary layer and the resulting global heat transport. Our results, which are based on a series of direct numerical simulations for Rayleigh numbers up to R a = 10 11 in a relatively shallow layer, suggest a highly fluctuating thermal boundary layer that is composed of local building blocks in terms of plumes, which are the essential drivers of turbulent heat transport. These thermal plumes are found in a dynamically perpetual process of formation and aggregation that can be described, particularly well for Rayleigh numbers R a ≳ 10 9 , by a von Smoluchowski equation resulting in a gamma distribution of the local plume spacing, consistent with measurements. Similarity manifests with respect to the horizontal extension of the network, the vertical hierarchical plume clustering away from the wall and the number of plumes, over an order of magnitude of the thermal boundary layer thickness. Our findings suggest the dominance of dynamical local processes near the wall, rather than a global boundary layer instability.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the expression of CD45 isoforms on human yellow fever virus vaccine (YFV-17D) specific CD8 T cells longitudinally after vaccination. As expected, effector CD8 T cells at day 14 express CD45RO but within 4 to 6 wk these virus-specific CD8 T cells become CD45RA positive and remain CD45RA for &gt;10 y. The journey for these YFV-specific CD8 T cells goes from naive (CD45RA+ CCR7+) to effector/effector memory (CD45RO+ CCR7−) to Temra (CD45RA+ CCR7−) to stem-cell memory (CD45RA+ CCR7+). These YFV-specific CD8 T cells rarely acquire the canonical Tcm phenotype (CD45RO+ CCR7+). This CD45RO to RA switch coincides with clearance of YFV, so we hypothesized that antigen may be playing a role in regulating CD45 expression. We addressed this issue by ex vivo analysis and provide evidence that this switch is indeed regulated by antigen. Sorted YFV-specific CD45RO effector CD8 T cells reexpress CD45RA when cultured ex vivo in the absence of antigen and retain CD45RO in the presence of cognate peptide. We also extended these ex vivo analysis to human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD8 T cells and show that CD45RO cells transition to CD45RA in the absence of antigen and CD45RA cells become CD45RO when stimulated with CMV peptide. We then show that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike-specific CD8 T cells can repeatedly undergo the same CD45RA to RO to RA transition in vivo after the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Again, the canonical Tcm phenotype spike-specific memory CD8 T cells were not readily detectable. These studies warrant a reevaluation of how human memory CD8 T cells are defined.",

Inside the protein matrix, chromophore nonplanarity and flexibility have long been argued to govern the fluorescence efficiency of FPs, yet their fundamental roles and relative importance have been elusive which hinder the rational design of versatile FPs and biosensors. Herein, we tackle this central question by investigating two recently engineered FP-based turn-on chloride (Cl – ) sensors, ChlorON1 and 3, using an ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopic toolset together with advanced multireference simulations for both structure and spectrum. We elucidate that fluorescence enhancement of the chloride-bound ChlorON3 stems from a substantially more twisted chromophore than ChlorON1 via comprehensive simulations starting from the available crystal structure of parent protein (mNeonGreen), also featuring an enhanced radiative pathway due to an adjacent leucine residue in the emissive population. This finding indicates that the commonly stated chromophore planarity is not, but conformational rigidity is, the decisive factor for high fluorescence efficiency. Such mechanistic insights into FPs are generalizable to chromoproteins and other photosensitive biomolecules, which can facilitate the targeted design of brighter and/or tunable biosensors.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is the origin of a novel tissue that attracts resources, spreads beyond boundaries, avoids normal controls, and escapes immunity. How does a novel tissue arise? The puzzle is that two seemingly different processes appear to be the primary driving force. On the one hand, overwhelming evidence links (epi)genetic driver mutations to the origin and progression of tumors. Common oncogenic mutations such as KRAS accelerate cell division, and common knockouts of tumor suppressors such as TP53 abrogate cell death or checks on cell division. On the other hand, cancerous tissues create complex traits that require intricate changes in cells and multiple interactions between different cell types. Such novelty often arises by hijacking the developmental plasticity that normally creates the diverse cells and tissues of our bodies from a single original zygotic cell. How can we reconcile the simple genetic changes in carcinogenesis with the complex developmental plasticity that creates novel tissues? This perspective advocates a new model. (Epi)genetic mutations release developmental plasticity. That developmental plasticity creates novel cellular interactions and complex tissues. Initially, novel traits created by developmental plasticity may not be stably heritable, thus subsequent (epi)genetic changes must stabilize the phenotypic novelty. Recent studies show how classic oncogenic and tumor suppressor driver mutations, such as KRAS and TP53 , may primarily act in early carcinogenesis as broad releasers of developmental plasticity rather than as stimulators of cell division or knockout of limitations on cellular clonal expansion. In the new model, genetics releases, plasticity creates, and genetics stabilizes.",

Current treatments are limited to supplemental and/or hyperbaric oxygen to accelerate CO elimination. Even with oxygen therapy, nearly half of CO poisoning survivors suffer long-term cardiac and neurocognitive deficits related to slow CO clearance, highlighting a need for point of care antidotal therapies. Given the natural interaction between CO and ferrous heme, we hypothesized that the hemoprotein RcoM, a transcriptional regulator of microbial CO metabolism, would make an ideal platform for CO-selective scavenging from endogenous hemoproteins. We engineered an RcoM truncate (RcoM-HBD-CCC) that exhibits high CO affinity ( K a,CO = 2.8 × 10 10 M −1 ), remarkable selectivity for CO over oxygen ( K a,O2 = 1.4 × 10 5 M −1 ; K a,CO / K a,O2 = 1.9 × 10 5 ), thermal stability (T m = 72 °C), and slow autoxidation rate ( k ox = 1.1 h −1 ). In a murine model of acute CO poisoning, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC accelerated CO clearance from hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs) and was rapidly excreted in urine. Moreover, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC elicited minimal hypertension in mice compared to infused globins (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and neuroglobin), attributed to a comparatively limited reactivity toward nitric oxide (NO) via dioxygenation [ k NOD (RcoM) = 6 to 8 × 10 6 M −1 s −1 vs k NOD (Hb) = 6 to 8 × 10 7 M −1 s −1 ]. These data suggest that RcoM-HBD-CCC is a safe, selective, and efficacious CO scavenger. By limiting hypertension through minimal NO scavenging, RcoM-HBD-CCC improves end-organ adverse effects compared with other hemoprotein-based therapeutics.",

Here, we investigated the potential for local ribosome maturation in rat neurons using proteomics, RNA sequencing, and imaging methods. We detected an abundance of ribosome biogenesis factors in distal neuronal compartments, particularly those associated with the late stages of ribosome assembly. Moreover, we detected cytosolic pre-ribosomal RNA species in dendrites, as well as the enzymes necessary for their processing, suggesting that local ribosome maturation can occur far from the nucleus. These findings challenge conventional models that confine ribosome biogenesis to nuclear and perinuclear regions and suggest that neurons may fine-tune local protein synthesis by regulating ribosome assembly near synaptic sites.

We scanned participants’ brains with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they performed a skilled motor task for monetary rewards, where outcomes depended on their motor performance and probabilistic events that were not contingent on their performance. Successful motor outcomes increased activity in the ventral striatum (VS), a functional subregion of the BG, whereas unsuccessful motor outcomes engaged the CBL. In contrast, for probabilistic outcomes unrelated to motor performance, the BG and CBL exhibited no differences in activity between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that VS-to-CBL connectivity was inhibitory following successful motor outcomes, suggesting that the VS may suppress CBL error processing for correct actions. Conversely, CBL-to-VS connectivity was inhibitory after unsuccessful motor outcomes, potentially preventing reinforcement of erroneous actions. Additionally, interindividual differences in task preference, assessed by having participants choose between performing the motor task or flipping a coin for monetary rewards, were related to inhibitory VS-CBL connectivity. These findings highlight a performance-mediated functional network between the VS and CBL, modulated by motivation and subjective preferences, that supports goal-directed behavior.",

Here, we revealed that during the larval–prepupal transition in Drosophila melanogaster , the 20E-activated Kr-h1-BR-C axis is a prerequisite for wing disc morphogenesis. Mechanistically, 20E-EcR/USP-Met-Tai directly activates Kr-h1 that upregulates BR-C expression via the positive Kr-h1 binding sites (PKBS) in the BR-C enhancers. Furthermore, we showed that 20E-induced H3K27 acetylation increases chromatin accessibility of the PKBS-containing enhancers, facilitating the maximum of BR-C expression that promotes developmental transitions. Collectively, in response to different hormone stimuli, a single transcription factor either negatively or positively regulates the expression of the same target gene depending on chromatin accessibility of its different enhancer regions, thus manipulating distinct developmental events.",

          "abstract": "Obtaining predictive models of a neural system is notoriously challenging. Detailed models suffer from excess model complexity and are difficult to fit efficiently. Simplified models must negotiate a tradeoff between tractability, predictive power, and ease of interpretation. We present a modeling paradigm for estimating predictive, mechanistic models of neurons and small circuits that navigates these issues using methods from systems theory. The key insight is that membrane currents can be modeled using two scalable system components optimized for learning: linear state space models, and nonlinear artificial neural networks. Combining these components, we construct two types of membrane currents: lumped currents, which are flexible, and data-driven conductance-based currents, which are interpretable. The resulting class of models—which we call recurrent mechanistic models (RMMs)—can be trained in a matter of seconds to minutes on intracellular recordings during an electrophysiology experiment, representing a step change in performance over previous approaches. As a proof-of-principle, we use RMMs to learn the dynamics of two groups of neurons, and their synaptic connections, in the Stomatogastric Ganglion, a well-known central pattern generator. Due to their reliability, efficiency, and interpretability, RMMs enable qualitatively new kinds of experiments using predictive models in closed-loop neurophysiology and online estimation of neural properties in living preparations.",

The disorder features severely thickened, red, and scaly skin at sites of wound healing or repetitive movement including on the face, genitals, flexural areas, and the palms and soles. EMP2 has previously been shown to directly associate with focal adhesion kinase, which links cell junction forces to signaling pathways relevant to proliferation, migration, and wound healing. Using single-cell spatial transcriptomics in affected tissue, we found ectopic suprabasal activation of signaling pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which we confirmed with western blotting in affected cells, supporting a gain-of-function mechanism for mutant EMP2. Remarkably, treatment with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, led to marked clinical improvement underscoring the key role of EMP2 in epidermal differentiation and proliferation.",

Here, we focus on the white shark, for which female philopatry has been previously proposed, and produced a chromosome-level genome, high-coverage whole-genome autosomal, and uniparental datasets to investigate mitonuclear discordance. We first reconstructed the historical population demography of the species based on autosomal data. We show that this species once comprised a single panmictic population, which experienced a steady decline until recent times when it fragmented into at least three main autosomal genetic groups. Mitochondrial data depict a strikingly different picture, inconsistent with the spatial distribution of autosomal diversity. Using the demographic scenario established from autosomal data, we performed coalescent and forward simulations to test for the occurrence of female philopatry. Coalescent simulations showed that the model can reproduce the autosomal variability, confirming its robustness. A forward simulation framework was further built to explicitly account for a sex-biased reproduction model and track both autosomal and uniparental markers (Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA). While our model generates data that are consistent with the observed Y chromosome variation, the mitochondrial pattern is never reproduced even under extreme female philopatry (no female migration), strongly suggesting that demography alone cannot explain the mitonuclear discordance. Our framework could, and perhaps should, be extended to other shark species where philopatry has been suggested. It is possible that the proposed widespread occurrence of female philopatry in sharks should be revisited.",

This substitution reduces the stability of the enzyme, but what functional consequences it has are unknown. Here, we show that when introduced into mice, this substitution causes substrates of the enzyme to accumulate in amounts that correlate negatively with ADSL expression levels. In the brain, where the expression of the enzyme is low, the substitution results in particularly high substrate levels. When the behavior of the mice is analyzed, female mice expressing the modern human-like version of ADSL access water more efficiently for drinking than their wild-type littermates. In addition to the amino acid substitution, a haplotype in the ADSL gene occurs at a carrier frequency of &gt;97% in present-day humans and exhibits evidence of positive selection. It is associated with less ADSL expression as well as with increased concentrations of succinyladenosine, one of the substrates of the enzyme, in cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, two genetic changes have reduced ADSL activity in human tissues since modern and archaic humans separated, affecting purine biosynthesis, particularly in the brain.",

Four distinct IgG1-Fc glycoforms, varying in core fucosylation and nonreducing terminal galactosylation, were generated through a combination of cell engineering and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Stable-isotope-assisted NMR spectroscopy, incorporating both glycan and protein signals, revealed that galactosylation induces chemical shift perturbations extending from the glycan–protein interface to the C H 2–C H 3 domain boundary. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the absence of galactose enhances the mobility of both the glycan and the C H 2 domain, broadening the conformational landscape of the Fc quaternary structure. This increased flexibility likely contributes to a greater entropic penalty upon binding to effector molecules, which constrain the Fc in an asymmetric conformation. Conversely, the effects of fucosylation are more localized, primarily influencing the dynamics of residues involved in Fcγ receptor IIIa binding. These findings provide atomic-level insights into the distinct yet synergistic mechanisms by which galactosylation and fucosylation modulate IgG1-Fc dynamics and effector functions, offering crucial information for the optimization of therapeutic antibodies.",

For very clear reasons, these important “topological” transitions are restricted to 2-dimensions. Here, we present a genuine dipole-induced transition in the 3-dimensional response of (athermal) amorphous solids to applied strain. Similarly to the existence of a hexatic phase between normal solid and fluid, we identify an intermediate phase between a phase of normal elastic response at high pressure, and fluid matter at zero pressure. The mechanical response in the intermediate phase is accompanied by plasticity that is generically associated with “nonaffine” quadrupolar events seen in the resulting displacement field. Gradients of the quadrupolar fields act as dipole charges that screen elasticity, breaking both translational and chiral symmetries. We highlight angular correlations that exhibit diverging correlation lengths at this transition and determine the critical scaling exponents.",

          "abstract": "Identifying the influence of low-density Indigenous populations in paleofire records has been methodologically challenging. In the Southwest United States, well-replicated fire histories suggest that abundant lightning and suitable climate conditions drove frequent low-severity wildfires in dry pine forests independent of human activities even as ethnography provided hints that highly mobile indigenous populations used fire in myriad land use contexts. Here, we leverage published and unpublished tree-ring fire history records from pine forests in Western Apache (Ndee) traditional territory in central and eastern Arizona (N = 34 sites, N = 649 trees) to demonstrate that historical fire regimes were overwhelmingly influenced by Ndee cultural burning. Our tree-ring synthesis shows significantly more frequent fires in Ndee territory than elsewhere in the region for centuries before the establishment of reservations (1600–1870 CE). Despite the heightened fire activity, fires were largely small and asynchronous, occurred disproportionately in late April and May, when Ndee invested significant subsistence activities in these pine forests, and occurred independent of climate drivers. This suggests that Ndee fire stewardship created a patchwork of nearly annual small, spring fires that inhibited natural fire spread and limited the influence of drought on fire activity. Our work shows that even relatively small, highly mobile populations of forager-gardeners had significant influence on some pre-Euroamerican fire regimes despite abundant natural ignitions. Our study shows clearly that Indigenous fire management impacted fire-size distributions, fire frequencies, and fire seasonality in ways that cannot be explained by seasonal and annual lightning densities.",

We tested the hypothesis that such conflicts in multiseeded fruits can be reduced if seeds are sired by a single pollen parent. We conducted a meta-analysis of paternity in 63 species across diverse plant families to assess paternity within fruits. Our results reveal that almost 50% of flowering plant species with multiseeded fruits have a single pollen parent. Our results question the prevailing notion that multiple paternity of seeds within fruits is widespread, especially when, in addition to single paternity in multiseeded fruits, a large number of species have single-seeded fruits. We provide insights into the role of sibling rivalry and kin selection in driving genetic relatedness of seeds within fruits. Equally important, the observation of monogamy at the level of flowers is in line with the mating patterns observed in animals.",

To investigate resource redistribution from growth- to defense-related processes in an essential tuber crop, potato, here we generate a large-scale compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic model (GEM), potato-GEM. Apart from a large-scale reconstruction of primary metabolism, the model includes the full known potato secondary metabolism, spanning over 566 reactions that facilitate the biosynthesis of 182 distinct potato secondary metabolites. Constraint-based modeling identifies that the activation of the largest amount of secondary (defense) pathways occurs at a decrease of the relative growth rate of potato leaf, due to the costs incurred by defense. We then obtain transcriptomics data from experiments exposing potato leaves to two biotic stress scenarios, a herbivore and a viral pathogen, and apply them as constraints to produce condition-specific models. We show that these models recapitulate experimentally observed decreases in relative growth rates under treatment as well as changes in metabolite levels between treatments, enabling us to pinpoint the metabolic rewiring underlying growth–defense trade-offs. Potato-GEM thus presents a useful resource to study and broaden our understanding of potato and general plant defense responses under stress conditions.",

TRAF3 plays critical roles in restraint of B lymphocyte activation, differentiation, and homeostatic survival. Consistent with such roles, loss-of-function mutations in TRAF3 have long been found in various human B cell malignancies. Mice lacking TRAF3 specifically in B cells have autoimmune manifestations, lymphadenopathy, and increased incidence of B cell lymphomas. More recently, human patients with germline TRAF3 mutations leading to haploinsufficiency have been reported; the phenotypes of these patients show striking similarities with those of mice with TRAF3-deficient B cells. This raises the important knowledge gap of how relative quantity of TRAF3 protein regulates B cells. To address this question, we investigated the effect of decreased B cell TRAF3 using mice whose B cells are heterozygous for loss of Traf3 . Traf3 +/− B cells displayed multiple functional abnormalities, to an extent intermediate between Traf3 +/+ and Traf3 −/− B cells, indicating a striking dose–response of B cells to relative quantities of TRAF3. Additionally, B cell TRAF3 protein—but not transcript—was reduced in B cells from normal aged mice and humans, consistent with increased occurrence of both B cell hyperactivity and B cell malignancies in older populations. Treatment of aged mice with a proteasome inhibitor restored the level of B cell TRAF3, suggesting age-related chronic signaling through receptors that lead to TRAF3 degradation. Thus, relative levels of B cell TRAF3 protein have important biological impacts on B cell function.",

This highly crystalline interface has few mobile polymer chains and thus limits energy dissipation and enhances interfacial energy transfer. The scalable composite films show exceptional magnetoelectric performance, with a magnetocapacitive coefficient of 23.6%.

          "abstract": "Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), side effects of anti-amyloid drugs seen in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, are a major safety concern in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. We developed an antibody transport vehicle (ATV) targeting transferrin receptor (TfR) for brain delivery of anti-amyloid-β protein (anti-Aβ) using asymmetrical Fc mutations (ATV cisLALA ) that mitigates TfR-related liabilities and retains effector function when bound to Aβ. Administration of ATV cisLALA :Aβ in mice exhibited broad brain distribution and enhanced parenchymal plaque target engagement. This biodistribution reduced ARIA-like lesions and vascular inflammation. Taken together, ATV cisLALA has the potential to improve the next generation of Aβ immunotherapy through enhanced biodistribution mediated by transport across the blood-brain barrier.",

          "authors": "George Kassiotis, Jonathan P. Stoye",
          "abstract": "Mammalian hosts deploy a multitude of germ line–encoded mechanisms to detect and restrict virus infection. These mechanisms must avoid pathological responses to endogenous retroviruses and other endogenous retrotransposable elements (RTEs)—viruses and viruslike genomic parasites that have invaded the host germ line and are passed down the generations as host genes. Although the location, specificity, and sensitivity of innate pattern recognition receptors and restriction factors are tuned to facilitate discrimination of infecting viruses from those that are part of self, immune cross-reactions do occur. The RTE viral heritage may, therefore, compromise the ability of the host to respond to virus infection without risking pathology. Nevertheless, RTEs have the potential to be co-opted as an alarm amplification system, to be repurposed as antiviral factors, and to contribute to the evolution of antiviral genes.",

One example of regulated mineralization is found in hypermineralized and ultrahard magnetic teeth of chiton, which grind on rock to feed on algae. At early stages of tooth formation, iron oxide deposition is controlled using a chiton-specific radular teeth matrix protein 1 (RTMP1), which is transported into teeth through microvilli. RTMP1 spatially and temporally guides and enhances mineralization on chitinous fibers within the tooth, providing a hard, tough, and strong architecture that enables the organism to perform repetitive abrasive events to survive.",

Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 micrometers) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometers) and temperatures up to 25 kelvin. This detector offers prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatibility and seamless integration into photonic-integrated circuits.

Males are more susceptible to the acute effects of viral disease and certain cancers, whereas females exhibit a more robust immune response that can make them prone to developing autoimmune complications. We reflect on the emerging appreciation of sex differences—governed by genetics, sex hormones, and environmental factors—in tissue immunity and immunology. Understanding these tissue context–dependent sex differences in the immune system is critical to deciphering the exact mechanisms that determine why women and men experience organ-specific infections, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, and cancers differently. Only by parsing distinction at the tissue level can the development of personalized and precision immunotherapy approaches be conceived and then achieved.",

We explore what generates or reduces immune variation, integrating recent empirical advances with potential overarching evolutionary principles. We posit that the multiple components of the immune system each present trade-offs (such as self-defense–self-harm, and investments in memory–retaining flexibility for future responses) that vary through life, and that variation in how immune components balance these trade-offs increases homeostasis to external and internal threats. Disentangling the mechanisms that shape immune diversity could inform effective strategies to manage microbial interactions and mitigate the burden of immune-mediated chronic diseases.",

Although mechanisms governing anaphylaxis after intravenous injection are defined in mice, these models neglect mucosal exposure that accompanies ingestion. We investigated the role of mast cells within the intestine of mice and found that oral anaphylaxis required immunoglobulin E–Fcε receptor 1 (IgE-FcεR1) signaling. Intestinal mast cells were a heterogeneous population, shaped by epithelial cues. Compared with connective tissue mast cells found throughout the body, intestinal mast cells largely resided in the epithelium, displayed divergent transcriptomes and effector functions, and had a diminished ability to generate histamine, but they enhanced leukotriene synthesis. Mice genetically deficient in cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis, or those treated with the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (aLOX5) antagonist zileuton, were protected from oral antigen–induced responses, whereas those elicited by intravenous injection were unaltered.",

In a forward genetic screen, resistance was correlated with dipeptidase 1 ( Dpep1 ) variants. DPEP1 is expressed in intestinal epithelium and catabolizes leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4 ). Blocking DPEP1 with cilastatin, deleting Dpep1 , or administering LTD 4 orally enhanced allergen transport in resistant mice.

This membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS) is important for many neuronal functions. Using live-cell super-resolution imaging, we found that the MPS is surprisingly dynamic, undergoing local disassembly and reformation constitutively in axons. MPS remodeling is driven by calcium signaling, leading to actin-ring destabilization through protein kinase C–mediated adducin phosphorylation and to spectrin degradation by calpain. Formin, an actin-nucleating and -polymerizing enzyme, plays a dual role in MPS remodeling and maintenance. MPS remodeling is enhanced by neuronal activity and functionally facilitates endocytosis. Our results highlight the importance of a dynamic membrane skeletal structure in neuronal function.",

Immunity’s operational toolbox contains diverse processes, such as phagocytosis, antigen recognition, cell killing, and secretion of cytokines and antibodies. Although immune cells interact with each other, they also communicate with cells typically associated with other organ systems, including the nervous, circulatory, metabolic, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and hematopoietic. This abundant cross-talk shows that immunity transcends defense and homeostasis: It is a network that participates in many physiological processes necessary for life. By accessing the circulation and inhabiting every tissue, leukocytes sense, interpret, and regulate biological processes.

          "abstract": "Waiting in a line (or a queue) is an unavoidable social interaction that occurs frequently in public spaces. Despite its wide prevalence and rich parametric variability, few studies have addressed the risks of airborne infection while waiting in a line. Here, we use a combination of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations to assess the flow patterns in a simplified waiting line setting. From observations of the transport of breath-like expulsions, we reveal the presence of fluid dynamical counter-currents —due to the competing effects of line kinematics and thermal gradients. Depending on the walking speed, an intermediate temperature range can potentially heighten the infection risks by allowing the breath plume to linger; however, colder and warmer ambients both suppress the spread. Current guidelines of increasing physical separation appear to have a limited impact on reducing aerosol transmission. This work highlights the need for updated transmission mitigation guidelines in settings where physical separation, interaction duration, and periodicity of movements are factors.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of sedentary farming economies, especially in contexts intensified by plow agriculture, has been argued to underpin marked increases in economic inequality and its intergenerational transmission across Eurasia. To assess this presumed causal relationship, we examine relational (burials) and material (house sizes) inequalities in the Carpathian Basin, a large region in central Europe, from the time the first farmers arrived in southeastern Europe through the next five millennia to the Bronze Age. We find that although farming did increase the potentials for both relational and material inequalities, the potential was rarely reached and then only for short durations. We identify a series of leveling mechanisms varying over time, including the removal of material wealth from circulation through the placement in graves, community fission, and investments of surplus labor in infrastructural investments. In the Carpathian Basin, only after at least 5000 years were the intergenerational potentials of material wealth transmissions more broadly realized.",

How SWR1 is directed to the flanking acetylated +1 nucleosome, its physiological substrate, has been enigmatic. We show by live-cell, single-molecule tracking that SWR1 subunits Bdf1 and Yaf9 harboring histone acetylation reader domains differentially regulate chromatin binding: Bdf1 promotes SWR1 association, while Yaf9-YEATS slows its dissociation. Notably, single-molecule tracking and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with exonuclease treatment reveal Bdf1 and Yaf9 contributions to global SWR1 targeting and histone exchange at +1 nucleosomes. Our findings highlight the in-cell biochemistry of histone readers and suggest a generalizable, two-stage mechanism wherein acetylated nucleosome interactions initially constrain the three-dimensional diffusion of SWR1 to increase local concentration, followed by stochastic one-dimensional diffusion at nucleosome-depleted regions with directional capture by acetylated +1 nucleosomes.",

Here, we experimentally demonstrate surface acoustic wave control using a hyperuniform arrangement of gold nanopillars on a lithium niobate layer. The hyperuniform structure, exhibiting characteristics of both random and ordered systems, leads to broad-range acoustic transmission reduction and bandgap-like regions of particularly strong suppression. By integrating linear and S-shaped waveguides into the hyperuniform pattern, we achieve efficient waveguiding at frequencies within these bandgaps. Both simulations and experiments confirm high transmission through the waveguides, demonstrating the flexibility of hyperuniform structures to support complex waveguide shapes. These findings provide an alternative approach to overcome limitations of traditional phononic crystals and advance acoustic technologies such as mechanical quantum computing and smartphone filters.",

Widespread volcanic features suggest that volcanic outgassing may have played a pivotal role in the transformation of Venus. However, the formation of volcanic units on Venus by basaltic lavas can only outgas a minor fraction of the CO 2 in the current atmosphere. Here, we model the erosion of long, meandering channels on Venus called canali and show that carbonatite lavas have the unique properties required to erode the canali. Our results suggest that eruption of these carbonatites may have delivered a total mass of CO 2 comparable to that of the modern atmosphere, resolving challenges to the formation of Venus’ atmosphere within the recent past and suggesting that exoplanets in the “Venus zone” may exhibit the potential for prolonged habitability.",

The largest baleen whales use a high-drag lunge-feeding strategy that is hypothesized to come at a high energetic cost, thus requiring exceptional calorie intake. We used biologging tags to measure respiratory rates in foraging rorquals and demonstrate that their field metabolic rates are less than half that predicted by prey consumption estimates and by scaling predictions from smaller marine mammals. The relative cost of rorqual foraging decreases with increasing size as larger whales spend disproportionately longer time filtering prey from engulfed water. By decoupling active swimming and filtration, the largest rorquals forage with limited movement costs. The evolution of lunge feeding confers an energetic advantage that is unique among filter feeders and may have provided an evolutionary pathway to the largest body sizes.",

The fire season is also lengthening, with an earlier onset. This trend has been hypothesized to be driven by anthropogenic warming, but it has yet to be quantitatively attributed to climate drivers. Using a comprehensive fire occurrence dataset, we analyze fire season onset and climate controls on its variability and change during 1992–2020 in 13 California ecoregions. Northern California ecoregions show stronger trends toward earlier onset compared to more arid southern California ecoregions. Onset has trended earlier for all but one ecoregion. Interannual variability of onset is dominated by climate variability and its influence on fuel moisture. Trend attribution inferred from onset-climate relationships suggests that anthropogenic warming advanced fire season onset by 6 to 46 days during 1992–2020 in 11 of 13 ecoregions. Continued warming is expected to further promote earlier fire season onsets.",

We introduce a regularized 3D reconstruction algorithm that exploits the redundancy inherent in the experimental data, allowing us to improve the time resolution. Our developments provide a comprehensive molecular picture at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of the nonlinear, linear, and fluctuating dynamic phenomena that single nanocrystals undergo during the GLC-EM experiment. We determined atomic structures of 66 temporal structural states, extracted from 15 time trajectories of individual nanocrystals. Large (478 to 698 atoms) and small (&lt;300 atoms) nanocrystals show etching that preserves a stable core, whereas mid-sized (351 to 571 atoms) nanocrystals present dynamics that change the coordination of the core.",

          "abstract": "Bone fracture repair initiates by periosteal expansion. The periosteum is a bilayered tissue composed of inner cambium and outer fibrous layers. Typically quiescent, periosteal progenitor cells proliferate upon fracture; however, the underlying transcriptional mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that deletion of the transcriptional regulators, yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ), from Osterix-expressing cells, which reside in the cambium, impairs periosteal expansion. YAP activation increases chromatin accessibility, preferentially at TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) binding sites, and regulates both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cellular functions. We identify bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( Bmp4 ) as a YAP-TEAD target gene expressed in the cambium. In YAP/TAZ knockout mice, BMP4 delivery increased periosteal expansion through matrix accumulation and fibrous layer cell proliferation. Conversely, in wild-type mice, BMP4 delivery increased osteogenic activity and angiogenesis. Together, these data identify YAP-mediated transcriptional programs that promote layer-specific periosteal expansion.",

In this work, we report phonon-based Fano resonance in a graphene/2D Ag/SiC heterostructure, arising from frequency and lifetime matching between discrete and continuous phonons of SiC. The observed Fano asymmetry is tunable over two orders of magnitude, surpassing previously reported phonon-based systems. The 2D Ag layer restructures the interfacial SiC and facilitates resonant scattering to enhance Fano asymmetry, which is unattainable in conventional Ag.

To uncover the atomistic basis of voltage gating in TREK K 2P channels, we integrated large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with extensive mutagenesis and patch-clamp electrophysiology, including sucrose-based experiments. Simulations revealed an asymmetric stability difference along the SF that results in a water-permeable extracellular side and a watertight intracellular side. Inactivation during inward flux occurs when water penetrates into the inner binding site and halts ion permeation, followed by the unbinding of three K + ions, consistent with gating charge analysis.

The pores are integrated with azobenzene units with photo-adaptable trans-to-cis isomerization, enabling dynamic pore size regulation at angstrom scale. Moreover, the isomerization induces drastic changes in intrapore polarity, which exert profound effects on the intermolecular affinity through the dipole-quadrupole interaction. Featuring these dynamic natures, the 3D COF membrane cooperating the size exclusion effect with a molecular recognition ability toward CO 2 . As a result, light-gating separation experiments show the superior CO 2 capture performance with a N 2 /CO 2 selectivity of 27.6. Theoretical calculations reveal that cis-state azobenzene can reduce the electron transfer barrier from azobenzene to CO 2 , thereby providing a molecular recognition pathway.",

          "abstract": "Rapid and accurate disease diagnosis in resource-limited settings is critical for optimizing medical resources and controlling epidemic outbreaks. However, developing a point-of-care detection system that is user-friendly, cost-effective, highly accurate, and exhibits strong specificity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report an integrated horizontal convection PCR system (IHCS) for clinical point-of-care testing, capable of real-time fluorescence detection. IHCS leverages horizontal thermal convection within a capillary to drive sample flow and temperature cycling for nucleic acid amplification, making it suitable for both home use and on-site rapid detection. Capillary action enables swift sample loading, thereby simplifying the overall procedure, and the horizontal thermal convection overcomes the volume limitations inherent in vertical systems. Validation with 130 clinical samples demonstrated that the system successfully detected HBV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza A virus within 40 min, achieving excellent sensitivity (&gt;96%) and specificity (100%). Overall, the IHCS integrates microfluidics, thermal engineering, and optical sensing and offers a paradigm-shifting solution for point-of-care diagnostics.",

          "abstract": "China’s rivers support nearly 20% of the global population and supply freshwater for the world’s largest proportion of industrial output and grain production. Despite their importance, nationwide streamflow changes and their drivers remain unclear because of challenges in accessing observations and disentangling the effects of climate, landscape, and human interventions. By combining data from 1046 hydrological stations with ISIMIP3a reconstructions, we provide a comprehensive national assessment showing that streamflow has declined across more than 70% of stations over the past six decades. Although regional heterogeneity exists, these declines are primarily concentrated in the north and driven by land use and cover change, further exacerbated by water abstraction, diversion, and regulation. In contrast, climate change and variability dominate the increases in streamflow, primarily in the south. Our results provide insights for water managers, helping them understand the multifaceted drivers of hydrological variability and inform the development of infrastructure and ecological projects to mitigate potential risks associated with declining streamflow.",

          "abstract": "Managing stress is essential for mental and physical health, yet current methods rely on subjective self-assessments or indirect physiological measurements, often lacking accuracy. Existing wearable sensors primarily target a single stress hormone, cortisol, using single-point measurements that fail to capture real-time changes and distinguish between acute and chronic stress. To address this, we present Stressomic, a wearable multiplexed microfluidic biosensor for noninvasive monitoring of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in sweat. Stressomic integrates iontophoresis-driven sweat extraction with bursting valve-regulated microfluidic channels for continuous sampling and analysis. Gold nanodendrite–decorated laser-engraved graphene electrodes achieve picomolar-level sensitivity, enabling simultaneous detection of multiple stress hormones. Electrochemical assays and human studies demonstrate that Stressomic reliably tracks hormone fluctuations in response to physical, psychological, and pharmacological stressors. Distinct temporal patterns reveal the dynamic interplay between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. This platform enables continuous, multiplexed stress profiling, offering opportunities for early detection of maladaptive responses, personalized stress management, and deeper insights into stress biology.",

A dataset of 3697 fluorescent images, along with tissue, cavity, and cell masks, is generated from experimental data. A computational pipeline analyzes morphological and marker expression features, revealing key developmental processes such as tissue growth, cavity expansion, and cell differentiation. To uncover hidden developmental dynamics, a deep manifold learning framework is introduced. This framework uses an autoencoder to project embryoid images into a twenty-dimensional (20D) latent space and models the dynamics using a mean-reverting stochastic process of mixed Gaussians. The approach accurately captures phenotypic changes observed at discrete experimental time points. Moreover, it enables the generation of artificial yet realistic embryoid images at finer temporal resolutions, providing deeper insights into the progression of early human development.",

Next, we solved a 4.2-Å resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of this 11-nanometer LPL filament using purified protein. The filament is made of repeating pairs of LPL molecules with occluded active sites, rendering the LPL inactive. The comparison of the in situ subtomogram average and the in vitro cryo-EM structure indicates that the previously uncharacterized physiological storage form of LPL is an inactive filament.",

With programmed ultrasound excitation and imaging, arterial axial and circumferential guided waves were simultaneously induced and measured in the longitudinal view. Then, a mechanical model was proposed to quantitatively predict the correlation of arterial guided waves with arterial biomechanical parameters. Our experimental design and biomechanical model enable an elastography method to assess temporal variations in blood pressure, bidirectional stiffness, and mechanical stresses in arterial walls. In vivo experiments were performed on healthy young, normotensive older, and hypertensive older volunteers. The results demonstrate that our method can find applications in understanding aging of cardiovascular system and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.",

Notably, normal prion protein (PrP C ) is essential for prion-induced rapid neurodegeneration, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that the unstructured N-terminal region of PrP C induces rapid and lethal neurodegeneration in mice, accompanied by the hallmark of prion disease, spongiosis. The neurotoxic N-terminal PrP is soluble, associates peripherally with lipid membranes, and induces neurotoxicity only when a critical threshold is exceeded. Both the N-terminally localized KKRPKP sequence and octarepeats contribute to neurotoxicity, with KKRPKP being essential. Without it, the N-terminal PrP is innocuous but exacerbates either neurodegeneration caused by N-terminal PrP or neurodegeneration in prion disease induced by intracerebral prion inoculation in mice. Our findings establish that soluble N-terminal PrP causes rapid neurodegeneration in prion disease and is a target for intervention.",

Here, using highly accurate duplex sequencing, we detected de novo mutations in single oocytes, blood, and saliva in women 20 to 42 years of age. We found that, with age, mutations increased in blood and saliva but not in oocytes. In oocytes, mutations with high allele frequencies were less prevalent in coding than noncoding regions, whereas mutations with low allele frequencies were more uniformly distributed along the mtDNA, suggesting frequency-dependent purifying selection. Thus, mtDNA in human oocytes is protected against accumulation of mutations with aging and having functional consequences. These findings are particularly timely as humans tend to reproduce later in life.",

However, when dysregulated, they lead to genomic instability and numerous human diseases. R-loops are tightly regulated, with RNase H1 acting as a key enzyme responsible for resolving DNA/RNA hybrids. Here, we identify the DNA-binding protein AND-1 as an essential factor in R-loop regulation through directly binding to R-loop structures, where it enhances the recruitment of RNase H1 and stimulates its endonuclease activity. We also provide in vivo evidence that R-loop accumulation occurs in the mammary gland tissue of AND-1–deficient mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of AND-1 decreases ESR1 expression by disrupting R-loop regulation at the enhancer region of the ESR1 gene in estrogen receptor–positive (ER + ) breast cancer cells, thereby overcoming resistance to aromatase inhibitors. Collectively, our findings reveal a mechanism by which AND-1 modulates R-loop dynamics and present a promising therapeutic strategy to combat endocrine resistance in breast cancer.",
