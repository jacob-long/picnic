          "title": "Three Sensitivity-Analysis Methods to Assess Unmeasured Pretreatment Confounding Bias in Experimental Mediation Analysis",
          "authors": "Diana Alvarez-Bartolo, David P. MacKinnon",
          "abstract": "Statistical-mediation analysis is a widely used method in psychological research that helps understand the intermediate variables, known as mediators ( M ), by which an independent variable ( X ) causes an outcome variable ( Y ). A major contribution to statistical-mediation analysis has been the incorporation of causal methods because it allows a clear definition of the causal direct and mediated effects and the specification of the assumptions to interpret such effects as causal. Modern causal approaches to mediation analysis encourage routinely investigating the extent to which unobserved confounders may explain the observed mediated effects. The recommendation acknowledges that even when X represents random assignment, participants are not usually randomly assigned to levels of M ; hence, unobserved confounders may bias the M to Y relation ( b -path). In this article, we describe unobserved pretreatment confounding of the M to Y relation in experimental mediation studies and three sensitivity-analysis methods to assess unmeasured pretreatment confounding of the M to Y relation: the correlated-residuals method, the left-out-variables-error method, and the phantom-variable method. We report the results of a simulation study that compares the routine application of the three sensitivity-analysis methods. Results generally indicate that larger effect sizes of the population b -path are less susceptible to confounding bias for all sensitivity methods. Thus, an initial approach to investigating confounding bias in experimental mediation studies is to assess the effect size of the path relating M to Y , and more details can be obtained by applying one of the three sensitivity-analysis methods.",

          "title": "From Experiments to Policy Insights: Generalizing Causal Effects From Study Samples to Target Populations",
          "authors": "Wen Wei Loh, Dongning Ren",
          "abstract": "Psychological science holds substantial promise for informing policy decisions but faces challenges in realizing its potential. One widely recognized challenge is bridging the gap between the nonrepresentative study samples commonly used to evaluate interventions and the broader populations that policymakers aim to serve. To address this challenge, we introduce causal effect generalizability, an approach from causal inference and epidemiology, in the form of an accessible, nontechnical tutorial for psychological and behavioral scientists. We use publicly available data from a real-world psychology intervention study to illustrate why causal effects in a nonrepresentative study sample may systematically differ from those in a broader population. We provide a step-by-step guide with user-friendly R functions, enabling researchers to generalize causal effects from a study sample back to the full target population. This approach allows researchers to assess intervention effects in broader populations, offering valuable insights to guide evidence-based policy development. We hope this nontechnical introductory material will assist scholars in enhancing the policy relevance and real-world impact of psychological science.",

          "authors": "Mehdi Ebrahimi Mehr, Jamal Amani Rad",
          "abstract": "This study critically examines the cognitive and theoretical foundations of the alpha parameter within the Lévy flight model (LFM), an extension of the diffusion decision model (DDM) that incorporates heavy-tailed noise distributions. The alpha parameter, which modulates the tail of these distributions, is assessed for its test–retest reliability – an essential criterion for its classification as a cognitive style measure. Utilizing data from three previous studies, we observed that alpha demonstrates consistent reliability across tasks and time points, supporting its role as a trait-like characteristic. Our observation regarding the interrelations between LFM parameters showed that although most parameters exhibited weak correlations, reflecting their representation of distinct aspects of data, moderate correlations were observed between alpha and both threshold and non-decision time. Furthermore, investigating practice effects, we observed consistent reductions in non-decision time, threshold, and often alpha across sessions, accompanied by a corresponding increase in drift rate in demanding tasks. Notably, alpha showed a strong relationship with the mean reaction time of error responses, indicating its critical role in explaining fast error responses. Additionally, our examination of the predicted decision-time distribution found that lower alpha values correspond to shorter response times in the first quartile of both correct and error responses, highlighting its impact on capturing the dynamics of fast decision-making. Employing the BayesFlow framework for parameter estimation, we evaluated its precision across varying trial counts. These findings offer insights for future research on LFM and similar models.",

          "abstract": "High-level cognition, such as intelligence and creativity, are considered the hallmark of human cognition; however, their complexity hinders the identification of underlying common mechanisms. We focus on one such likely mechanism—mental navigation. We utilize converging computational methods to demonstrate how mental navigation—operationalized via verbal fluency tasks—predicts individual differences in creativity, intelligence, and openness to experience (the personality trait most closely related to them). Participants’ ( N = 479) responses to two tasks—a 2-min animal fluency task and a 2-min generating synonyms of the word “hot” fluency task—were modeled over a multidimensional model (a cognitive multiplex network) of the mental lexicon. Quantitative measures of their mental navigation were used to build regression models that significantly predicted their assessed high-level cognition (replicating across both fluency tasks). Finally, we developed an online tool that capitalizes on our approach—the High-level Cognitive Prediction tool. Overall, we show how converging computational tools can elucidate the complexity of high-level cognition.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the moderating role of the context of social opinion in hostile media perception and its effect on partisan audiences in polarized politics. An online experiment ( N = 574), conducted in the US, manipulated the number of congruent/incongruent comments and emojis on social media posts discussing abortion (i.e., pro-choice versus pro-life Facebook posts) to create three distinct opinion contexts (i.e., congruent, balanced, and incongruent). The results indicate that perceived bias gaps between pro-attitudinal and counter-attitudinal posts were reduced in the condition of incongruent context. Furthermore, the study found that the incongruent context mitigates discomfort toward out-party supporters and political participation intention through reducing the perceived bias, whereas the congruent context intensifies them. Implications for media bias perceptions and political polarization are discussed in terms of intergroup relations.",

          "abstract": "Engagement with political news is vital for promoting civic participation and political knowledge but can negatively affect individuals’ mental health, including provoking anxiety. We examine how exposure to racial discrimination in news coverage (i.e., vicarious discrimination) may contribute to these negative effects among Latinos during the 2020 U.S. election. One hundred and eight Latinos completed daily measurements of political news engagement, vicarious discrimination, and anxiety-related symptoms for 14 days surrounding the election. Using disaggregated multilevel mediation models, we found that, on days when people engaged more with political news, they reported higher anxiety-related symptoms than on days when they engaged less (within-person relationship), but people who engaged more with political news on average did not report higher anxiety-related symptoms relative to those who engaged less with political news on average (between-person relationship). Additionally, the within-person relationship was mediated by experiences of vicarious discrimination, suggesting engaging with political news serves as an important source of exposure to racial discrimination experienced by others.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the critical role of social identity in leadership, specifically examining identity leadership (IL) and the unique contributions of its four subdimensions: identity prototypicality, identity advancement, identity entrepreneurship, and identity impresarioship. To date, research has largely focused on the global construct of identity leadership and shown that in organizational contexts, it is a predictor of a range of outcomes, including group members’ burnout and organizational citizenship. However, the distinct roles of the four subdimensions remain little understood. Extending earlier findings, we address this gap by testing the hypothesis that the four subdimensions are differentially implicated in two key mechanisms that underlie the relationship between IL and group outcomes: (a) trust in the leader and (b) team identification. The present study explores this proposition by using structural equation modeling with latent factors to test a mediation model in 2020–2021 data from the Global Identity Leadership Development project (GILD; N = 7,855). As hypothesized, we found that identity prototypicality and identity advancement predominantly predicted greater trust in the leader, whereas identity entrepreneurship primarily predicted greater team identification. Contrary to our hypothesis, identity impresarioship showed a negative relation with trust. In turn, both trust in the leader and team identification were positively associated with organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and negatively with burnout. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of these findings for both the theory and practice of leadership.",

Across studies, descriptive confronting norms facilitated perceptions of fewer anticipated social costs (Studies 1, 3) and greater social benefits (Studies 1–3) relative to the absence of a confronting norm (Studies 2–3) or an injunctive norm of confronting prejudice (Study 1). While social norms of prejudice confrontation did not directly impact White people’s intentions to confront prejudice (Study 1–3) or a specific instance of anti-Asian bias (Studies 2, 3), social norms did indirectly elicit greater intentions to confront prejudice through expectations of reduced social costs and increased social benefits (Studies 1, 2, 3).",

          "abstract": "Contemporary right-wing populist rhetoric paradoxically criticizes society as disadvantaging the ethnic majority relative to minorities, while simultaneously emphasizing the superiority of one’s own nation over others. Recent studies suggest that national superiority beliefs compensate for the perceived loss of ingroup advantage among ethnic-majority groups. A critical test of this idea would be whether ethnic-majority individuals with a higher need for group-based dominance show a stronger link between perceived ethnic deprivation and nationalism. Here, we assessed people’s need for dominance using the social dominance orientation (SDO) scale and tested our moderation hypothesis in two community samples in the UK and NZ (total N = 37,510). We found that white people perceiving their ethnic group as deprived predicts higher nationalism and does so more strongly for those higher on SDO. This suggests that part of the appeal of white nationalism may be about maintaining ethnic advantage, rather than economic grievances.",

          "abstract": "Cross-sectional research demonstrates that intimate partners generally hold similar political preferences. It is unclear, however, whether intimate partners influence each other’s preferences over time. We address this oversight by investigating the transmission of political party support across 1,613 woman-man couples in long-term intimate relationships using 10 annual waves of longitudinal panel data. Actor-partner interdependence random intercepts cross-lagged panel models revealed that within-person increases in an intimate partner’s party support predicted within-person increases in the other couple member’s party support the following year. These partner effects emerged for six political parties in New Zealand and, with only one exception, did not differ in strength across women and men. Partner effects for self-rated political orientation were not significant. These results suggest that couples mutually reinforce each other’s political party support over time, advancing understanding of the interpersonal transmission of political preferences and identifying a dyadic process that may contribute to political polarization.",

          "abstract": "People benefit immensely when they have close relationship partners who are instrumental (i.e., helpful) to their goal pursuit. However, little is known about what motivates partners’ continued instrumentality. Research on gratitude led us to examine whether, when, and why receiving expressions of gratitude for one’s instrumentality would increase people’s intentions to be instrumental to their romantic partner’s goal(s) in the future (future instrumentality intentions [FIIs]). In a correlational study (Study 1) and two experiments in which we manipulated expressed gratitude (Studies 2 and 3), gratitude receipt positively predicted FIIs. This finding persisted regardless of whether partners achieved their goal (Study 3). We identify potential mechanisms and show that gratitude receipt is particularly important for boosting FIIs among people in lower (vs. higher) quality relationships. These findings serve as a foundation for research examining antecedents to instrumentality and considering long-term consequences of gratitude receipt for support processes in romantic relationships.",

          "abstract": "Effective learning involves not only the ability to quickly acquire knowledge and skills, but also the capacity to accurately monitor one’s ongoing learning progress. The present research probed the relation between learning ability and monitoring accuracy. A meta-analysis (Study 1, N = 2,406) counterintuitively found that individuals with superior learning ability exhibited slightly poorer monitoring accuracy (measured as the resolution of judgments of learning). Study 2 reanalyzed the meta-analysis data and observed that expert learners remembered more items they erroneously believed they would not remember, and this underconfidence in expert learners led to a negative association between learning ability and monitoring accuracy. Studies 3 ( N = 102, adults aged 18–23) and 4 ( N = 481, adults aged 18–59) conceptually replicated the findings of Studies 1 and 2 in controlled experiments. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that good learners are also good monitors, suggesting instead that expert learners are actually the ones with monitoring deficits.",

          "title": "Creating together: Musicians’ descriptions of relational aspects of their profession",
          "authors": "Nicola J Baker, Clemence Due, John Baranoff, Luke W Dollman",
          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that making music together has a positive effect on wellbeing. In contrast, research focussed on professional musicians indicates they experience higher than general population average rates of anxiety and depression symptoms. In addition, despite the creative process of ensemble music-making being a joint endeavour, current approaches to addressing mental wellbeing largely focus on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms and suggest individual solutions. In response, the aim of this research is to understand how professional orchestral musicians themselves perceive mental wellbeing (both their own and that of other musicians they know), with a particular focus on relational aspects. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 musicians from full-time professional orchestras across Australia and were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. This study contributes to knowledge about wellbeing for professional orchestral musicians by demonstrating a range of relational issues and how they impact the individual wellbeing of musicians both positively and negatively. In particular, the interconnectedness of experience and the impact of close, longstanding work relationships are discussed, as well as the contrast between experiences of secrecy and open communication.",
