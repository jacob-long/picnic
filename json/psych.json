          "authors": "Evan Mayo-Wilson, Sean Grant, Katherine S. Corker, David Moher",
          "abstract": "In 2013, the Center for Open Science proposed that journal articles be awarded “badges” for engaging in open-science practices, including preregistration. In 2015, the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines (TOP 2015) promoted preregistration of studies and analysis plans. Since then, the term “preregistration” has been used to describe different research outputs created at different times—sometimes, but not always, including study registration. Following a review of evidence about TOP 2015 implementation, including evidence that adherence could not be rated reliably, the TOP Guidelines Advisory Board updated these guidelines (TOP 2025). The TOP 2025 guidelines no longer use the term “preregistration.” Instead, TOP 2025 disambiguates specific research outputs, such as registrations, study protocols, analysis plans, code, and other research materials. TOP 2025 also explains that researchers should describe the time at which outputs are created and shared in relation to key study activities. In this article, we explain why adopting the terminology used in TOP 2025 and describing the times at which specific research outputs are created and shared will enhance understanding and support better implementation and reporting of open science.",

          "authors": "Charles B. Chang, Sunyoung Ahn, Youngjoo Kim",
          "abstract": "To facilitate objective measures of proficiency for language users of diverse backgrounds, recent research in second language acquisition and multilingualism has developed short, yet reliable, tests of lexical knowledge in a wide range of languages. In this paper, we describe the development of LexKO, a brief lexically based test of Korean language proficiency, including its underlying logic, composition, intended use, and limitations. Three rounds of pilot and validation testing with first- and second-language Korean users resulted in a highly reliable Korean test comprising 60 items that can be completed in a few minutes. Freely available for other researchers to use, LexKO produces scores that correlate significantly with both first- and second-language Korean users’ scores on a standardized proficiency test (an abridged version of the Test of Proficiency in Korean) and may thus be helpful in multi-part studies for obtaining a quick, valid measure of proficiency in Korean, one of the world’s fastest-growing foreign languages.",

          "authors": "Kyle Cox, Benjamin Kelcey",
          "abstract": "Bayesian and structural-after-measurement (SAM) approaches have been developed, in part, to address limitations of conventional estimators in the context of structural equation models (SEMs) with latent interactions. Although both approaches have shown promise in a variety of contexts including small-sample studies, there is very little literature systematically comparing the relative benefits, limitations, and trade-offs among these approaches. In this study, we (a) compared the performance of estimators under each approach in multilevel SEMs with a within-, between-, or cross-level latent interaction and (b) demonstrated the flexibility of SAM approaches by extending and investigating them in partially nested SEMs with latent moderated mediation. The results suggest substantial differences between estimator performance as a function of the type of latent interaction. SAM approaches performed well with a variety of latent interactions in multilevel and partially nested SEMs, while Bayesian approaches, including those with informative priors, struggled with models that included a cross-level latent interaction and were not easily extended to partially nested SEMs. Overall, the results suggest that SAM approaches are a versatile and highly adaptable alternative or complement to conventional full-information estimators. To conclude, we outline estimator considerations based on the SEM type, latent interaction, and data structure.",

          "authors": "J. W. C. Harris, M. J. Murphy, P. A. Chouinard",
          "abstract": "The recording and interpretation of lifting force data — such as load and grip forces — are central to studying weight perception. Typically, such data are collected using force transducer-embedded handles placed on top of objects. While effective, these handles may be impractical or undesirable for certain experimental paradigms. A potential alternative is a force transducer-embedded platform, but validation is needed to determine whether it captures force data with the same consistency and interpretability as the handle-based method, particularly given the potential for data loss around lift-off. In two experiments, we compared these methods by having participants lift light and heavy objects off a platform either directly or via handles to assess the convergent validity of experimental outcomes and the concurrent validity of the recorded data. Our findings indicate that the experimental outcomes and data from both methods were highly comparable, but only for the heavy objects. However, for the light object, platform-recorded force data showed lower agreement with handle-based measures, and several anticipated sensorimotor effects were not observed in the platform data. These discrepancies resulted in differences in experimental outcomes, particularly in the detection of switch effects, highlighting the platform’s limitations for capturing lighter-weight interactions. Therefore, we suggest that while handles remain preferable for capturing rich force data, the platform method broadens methodological options and presents a viable and valid alternative.",

          "authors": "Gal Sasson-Lazovsky, Vered Pnueli, Yoed N. Kenett",
          "abstract": "Question-asking is a crucial aspect of human interaction. Questions fuel engagement, stimulate thought processes, foster learning, and facilitate information-seeking behavior. Yet, scarce empirical research exists on question-asking, or its relation to related cognitive capacities such as creativity, curiosity, and intelligence. The use of digital games as a research medium offers significant advantages for studying cognitive processes in natural settings. As such, this study empirically investigates how people ask questions in an online serious game. To do so, we developed an online game—Spot the Spy—where players are required to find a hidden spy amidst a crowded room, by asking a chatbot agent questions that guide them in their investigation. Our game thus offers to investigate question-asking in natural settings empirically, and optimal question-asking strategies, which we conducted in two studies. Study 1 (online, N = 103) focused on game development and exploratory validation, whereas Study 2 (in-lab, N = 100) focused on replication and extension. In both studies, participants completed a series of cognitive tasks assessing creativity, curiosity, and intelligence before playing the game. Our results highlight strategies related to optimal performance in the game, as well as how players’ gameplay correlates with their cognitive abilities, especially with intelligence. Specifically, we found that higher intelligence scores were associated with more effective questioning strategies and better game performance. These insights highlight the potential of gamified environments to enhance our understanding of cognitive processes and advance the development of educational and training tools that foster strategic thinking and question-asking capacities.",

          "abstract": "Four longitudinal studies ( N = 1,035) examined whether telling others about personal goals enhances goal support received, goal pursuit effort, and goal progress. In Study 1, participants nominated a personal goal and 1 week later reported whether they had shared this goal during the week. Goal disclosure predicted more support received from others and greater goal pursuit effort. In Studies 2 and 3, participants assigned to share a goal in the coming week later reported receiving more support from others, which in turn was linked to greater goal pursuit effort and progress. In Study 4, participants were assigned either to share a goal with a person accompanying them at that moment or to keep it private; goal disclosure was again linked to goal pursuit effort, though not to support received. Together, these studies reveal the benefits of sharing goals and highlight the importance of considering the audience and manner of goal disclosure.",

          "abstract": "Across 12 empirical studies ( N total = 2,615), this research systematically examined the stable tendency for individuals to overestimate others’ zero-sum beliefs, along with its underlying psychological mechanisms and behavioral consequences. Studies 1–3 and Supplementary Studies 1–4, using diverse experimental designs and measures, consistently showed that people tend to overestimate others’ zero-sum beliefs at both explicit and implicit levels. Studies 4–5, through surveys and experiments, provided converging evidence that construing others at a high construal level—as purely self-interested agents—serves as a key psychological mechanism driving this overestimation. Study 6 and Supplementary Studies 5–6 demonstrated that overestimating others’ zero-sum beliefs significantly reduced cooperative behavior, both in abstract game contexts and in more everyday settings. These findings enrich researchers’ understanding of the illusory nature of zero-sum beliefs and suggest that interventions based on the social norms approach may help correct this overestimation and foster cooperation.",

We found partial support for our predictions: poorer victim-oriented outcomes (e.g., victim blame) and more positive defendant-oriented outcomes (e.g., fewer guilty verdicts, more lenient sentencing) occurred for passing versus non-passing transgender (Experiments 1-2) and cisgender victims (Experiment 2) through increases in perceived deception and moral outrage (Experiment 2).

          "abstract": "Recognition memory refers to the process of distinguishing between previously experienced and novel events. Apart from the objective quality of stored memories, recognition depends on the retrieval context produced by all items (foils) presented together with actually memorized targets and causing confusion. Memory models often conceptualize target-foil confusability via distances in psychological spaces where greater confusability originates from shorter interitem distances. We tested whether recognition spaces change when other foils are added to the retrieval context or when target memory strength is changed ( N = 1,311 adults). Using signal-detection modeling, we found that separately measured distances, d ′s, from each foil to the target provide a good linear prediction of those distances for all foils being presented together against that target. Those predictions stay accurate even when the absolute distances are scaled up or down because of a change in memory strength. This suggests strong metric invariance of spaces used for recognition decisions under variable retrieval contexts.",

Research has shown that music serves as a nonverbal medium for mutual understanding and synchronization and that musical training and music-induced emotions correlate with empathy skills. In this study, we explored if musical sophistication and musical engagement can be predictors of the four Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) empathy subcomponents (i.e., Personal Distress, Perspective Taking, Empathic Concern, and Fantasy Scale), also in relation to gender and the musical cultural environment. We compared two samples of Italian (from Bari, Apulia; N = 260) and Spanish (from Valencian Community; N = 94) preadolescents (aged 10–14) of Italian music middle schools or Spanish extracurricular music schools of marching bands. Results showed positive, significant relationships of musical sophistication with all empathy subscales except for Personal Distress in both samples. For musical engagement, the two countries again reported similar results with some nuanced differences possibly due to the features of the two different types of training. In addition, in both samples, females displayed higher scores than males in all empathy domains. These findings suggest the importance of promoting music in preadolescence and the strong link between music and empathy traits regardless of context.",
