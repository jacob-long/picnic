          "title": "A large-scale, gamified online assessment of first impressions: The Who Knows project",
          "authors": "Richard Rau, Michael P. Grosz, Mitja D. Back",
          "abstract": "Interpersonal judgments play a central role in human social interactions, influencing decisions ranging from friendships to presidential elections. Despite extensive research on the accuracy of these judgments, an overreliance on broad personality traits and subjective judgments as criteria for accuracy has hindered progress in this area. Further, most individuals involved in past studies (either as judges or targets) came from ad-hoc student samples which hampers generalizability. This paper introduces Who Knows ( https://whoknows.uni-muenster.de ), an innovative smartphone application designed to address these limitations. Who Knows was developed with the aim to create a comprehensive and reliable database for examining first impressions. It utilizes a gamified approach where users judge personality-related characteristics of strangers based on short video introductions. The project incorporates multifaceted criteria to evaluate judgments, going beyond traditional self-other agreement. Additionally, the app draws on a large pool of highly specific and heterogenous items and allows users to judge a diverse array of targets on their smartphones. The app's design prioritizes user engagement through a responsive interface, feedback mechanisms, and gamification elements, enhancing their motivation to provide judgments. The Who Knows project is ongoing and promises to shed new light on interpersonal perception by offering a vast dataset with diverse items and a large number of participants (as of fall 2024, N = 9,671 users). Researchers are encouraged to access this resource for a wide range of empirical inquiries and to contribute to the project by submitting items or software features to be included in future versions of the app.",

          "authors": "Andrew D. Green, Andrew Clark, Melanie Pitchford, Andy Guppy",
          "abstract": "Traditional methods of displaying stimuli in eyewitness memory research, such as mock crime videos, are often criticised for lacking ecological validity. To overcome this, researchers have suggested using virtual reality (VR) technology to display the stimuli as it can promote a sense of presence, leading to real-world responses. However, little research has compared VR with traditional methods to demonstrate this enhanced validity. In Study 1, 54 participants viewed a mock crime video on screen or in VR while their heart rate was recorded, then completed measures of presence and emotion, and had their recall tested after 10 min. In Study 2, 74 participants’ recall was tested after a 7-day delay and included a more in-depth exploration of emotional experience. In both studies, participants in the VR group reported a statistically significant increase in their sense of general presence, spatial presence, and involvement in the scene; however, there was no statistically significant difference in recall between the groups. Participants in the VR group had a statistically significant increase in heart rate in Study 1 only, and emotional experience in Study 2 only. The findings of this research suggest that VR may provide a more ecologically valid eyewitness experience than videos, without impacting participant memory or wellbeing. The findings of the current research are discussed in relation to previous literature and implications for experimental eyewitness memory research.",

          "authors": "Charlotte R. Pennington, Kayley Birch-Hurst, Matthew Ploszajski, Kait Clark, Craig Hedge, Daniel J. Shaw",
          "abstract": "Social cognitive skills are crucial for positive interpersonal relationships, health, and wellbeing and encompass both automatic and reflexive processes. To assess this myriad of skills, researchers have developed numerous experimental tasks that measure automatic imitation, emotion recognition, empathy, perspective taking, and intergroup bias and have used these to reveal important individual differences in social cognition. However, the very reason these tasks produce robust experimental effects – low between-participant variability – can make their use as correlational tools problematic. We performed an evaluation of test–retest reliability for common experimental tasks that measure social cognition. One-hundred and fifty participants completed the race-Implicit Association Test (r-IAT), Stimulus–Response Compatibility (SRC) task, Emotional Go/No-Go (eGNG) task, Dot Perspective-Taking (DPT) task, and State Affective Empathy (SAE) task, as well as the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and indices of Explicit Bias (EB) across two sessions within 3 weeks. Estimates of test–retest reliability varied considerably between tasks and their indices: the eGNG task had good reliability (ICC = 0.63–0.69); the SAE task had moderate-to-good reliability (ICC = 0.56–0.77); the r-IAT had moderate reliability (ICC = 0.49); the DPT task had poor-to-good reliability (ICC = 0.24–0.60); and the SRC task had poor reliability (ICC = 0.09–0.29). The IRI had good-to-excellent reliability (ICC = 0.76–0.83) and EB had good reliability (ICC = 0.70–0.77). Experimental tasks of social cognition are used routinely to assess individual differences, but their suitability for this is rarely evaluated. Researchers investigating individual differences must assess the test–retest reliability of their measures.",

          "abstract": "Animal behavior analysis software has become an essential tool in the life sciences. However, the currently available tools have some significant shortcomings that limit their use by individuals without programming skills, access to higher informatics resources, or the capability to invest large sums of money. We have developed and validated an easy-to-use and straightforward tracking system named ESTraS to address this issue. This freeware software allows researchers to track and analyze rodent behaviors, offering additional options such as trajectory and angle analysis. Through ESTraS, researchers can utilize unsupervised clustering techniques, such as k -means or hierarchical clustering, to further explore the obtained results. This clustering enables the classification of results based on observed similarities among subjects. The data of this manuscript shows that ESTraS can prove to be extremely valuable, not only by providing essential behavioral analysis tools but also by offering specific data analysis options with just one click.",

          "abstract": "The stigma faced by gender and sexual minorities varies across countries. How does stigma relate to collective action for social change? We propose a curvilinear link (i.e., an inverted U-curve) between stigma and collective action such that increased stigma is associated with increased collective action up to a point, beyond which, increased stigma is associated with reduced collective action. Using Bayesian inference with a sample of over 3,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer (LGBTIQ+) individuals across 25 countries, analyses showed that at the between-country level (but not at the within-country level), there was preliminary evidence of a curvilinear effect. There was also an indirect effect of institutional stigma on collective action outcomes via perceived stigma, suggesting that structural-level factors can trickle down to shape individuals’ social change intentions and behaviours. These findings raise the importance of reconsidering the assumption of linearity between stigma and collective action.",

In Study 1 ( N = 205), Black and White participants completed a voting rights history test, racial identification measures, and perceptions of racism items in the context of voter suppression. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that when racial identity was high, historical knowledge was a significant mediator of the effect of racial category on perceptions of racism and voter suppression. Study 2 ( N = 243) examined whether a critical educational intervention about historical racism in voting policies (vs. a control) increased perceptions of racism in voting domains. Study 2 suggested that the intervention was most effective for White and Black Americans reporting low levels of racial identity, but the intervention decreased racism perceptions among highly identified White participants.",

Although consequences of age-based stereotype threat have been identified (e.g., poorer job attitudes), far less is known about workplace triggers and underlying mechanism. Three studies aimed to identify the workplace antecedents and mechanism underlying stereotype threat. Together, Studies 1a and 1b identified 10 potential antecedents associated with stereotype threat (e.g., being overlooked for training). Mediation analysis revealed that experiencing any of the potential antecedents was associated with increased age salience, which, in turn, was associated with greater feelings of stereotype threat. Study 2 manipulated three of the potential antecedents through short videos and found that experiencing the antecedents led to increased age salience and stereotype threat. This experimental approach complemented the cross-sectional nature of Studies 1a and 1b, providing evidence for the proposed causal pathways.",

          "abstract": "Competitive victimhood has significant implications for intergroup attitudes, including discrimination and hostility. The current two studies reveal the dynamic and context-dependent nature of competitive victimhood. We directly and simultaneously compared competitive victimhood among members of two groups: high-power and low-power. In Study 1, we found that under the transient threat circumstances of COVID-19, the high-power group (secular Israelis) experienced higher levels of competitive victimhood compared to the weaker group (ultra-Orthodox Israelis), indicating that intergroup threat may override group power in determining competitive victimhood. Study 2 further highlighted the dynamic nature of competitive victimhood by revealing, 18 months later, when the COVID-19 situation had changed, a contrasting image of the results obtained in Study 1, demonstrating that relative competitive victimhood levels can shift among the same groups when the transient threat and circumstances change. The findings suggest that competitive victimhood is a more agile and context-dependent construct than previously believed, especially in the context of power dynamics. The current research suggests a unique approach to conducting research: namely, a “mirror study,” in which two different groups provide a detailed reflection of the “same” reality, but through their own unique perspectives.",

          "authors": "Olivia A. Foster-Gimbel, L. Taylor Phillips",
          "abstract": "Psychological discomfort can motivate, demotivate, or even backfire upon efforts to encourage allyship. We consider the intensity of such discomfort to test curvilinear relationships between psychological discomfort and Whites’ engagement in equity efforts. Across four pre-registered studies ( N = 4,563), we find support for our curvilinear model. First, we explore the relationship between collective discomfort and allyship intentions. While we find that collective discomfort is linearly associated with greater allyship, we find little evidence of diminishing returns. Second, we find a curvilinear relationship between collective discomfort and defensive reactions: Both low and high discomfort was associated with increasing defensive reactions to evidence of racial inequity (victimhood claiming, stigma reversal) than moderate discomfort. Thus, we provide empirical support for the idea that dominant group members who experience high (vs. moderate) discomfort in the face of social inequality may be less likely to support equity. We offer insights on how to manage this issue",

Three studies were conducted in Northern Ireland to address this gap using a mixed-method approach. Study 1 involved 519 Catholic and Protestant participants who provided open-ended responses regarding religious identity construals as religious, cultural, or political. Qualitative content analysis yielded 17 items related to Catholic/Protestant identity construals. Study 2 included 276 participants who rated these 17 items, and factor analyses identified a subset of 14 items representing the three identity construals. Finally, Study 3 ( N = 300) validated the newly-developed scale and examined how different combinations of religious, cultural, and political identities related to forgiveness, collective action, and allyship. The results indicate the reliable measurement of religious identity construals across the three dimensions and contribute to understanding religious identity and its implications for conflict and peace.",

Study 1 ( n = 212) revealed a positive association between IH and empathic accuracy (EA), especially toward the outgroup. Study 2 ( n = 112) replicated the significant association between IH and EA. Study 3 ( n = 209) employed a manipulation to enhance IH to demonstrate causality. We found evidence for an indirect effect, wherein the manipulation increased state IH, which was associated with greater EA. A mini meta-analysis revealed that, on average, individuals with higher levels of IH exhibit increased EA, showing a greater understanding of others’ emotional states. Moreover, IH predicts empathic resilience—buffering against personal distress while maintaining or increasing empathic concern for others. These findings highlight the positive influence of IH on empathy, emphasizing its potential for fostering deeper connections and better understanding in social interactions.",

Here, we extend these efforts horizontally (new constructs) and vertically (new levels within the same construct) by charting out age-graded differences in Schwarz’s human values across 80,814 individuals. Conducting a systematic investigation of cross-sectional age-graded differences in human values—from late teenage years to post-retirement—featuring 36 analytical model choices and 180,000 simulation-based decisions, our analyses replicate some earlier findings (e.g., increasing self- and growth-focus during adolescence and increasing security concerns during adulthood), while also highlighting complex and previously unappreciated dynamics. As such, while it is a common practice to aggregate specific values into parsimonious higher-order concepts to ease interpretation, this may risk overlooking meaningful trends in lower-order value development. Specifically, revealing unique and asynchronous patterns for value nuances, we find that aggregation (a) leads to a loss of critical information, (b) creates conflicting results when nuances diverge, and (c) significantly reduces predictive power.",

Study 1 found that belief in karmic causality positively predicts a variety of system-justifying beliefs that legitimate social inequalities, but experimental reminders of karma also encouraged generosity toward others experiencing financial hardship. Studies 2 and 3 tested whether karma framing had different effects on generosity toward different recipients, who varied in their level of need and reason for need. Thinking about karma changed the importance of recipient characteristics, with need being less predictive and external attributions more predictive of giving when thinking about karma. Overall, experimental reminders of karma only reliably increased generosity toward recipients whose financial need was no fault of their own, showing that karmic beliefs draw attention to the reasons for people’s bad fortune, and evoke responses to misfortune that are sensitive to naturalistic explanations.",

Do environmental factors alter rates of online social activity? We conducted two large natural experiments to investigate how worse weather conditions affect social-media use in the United States, analyzing over 3.5 billion posts from Facebook and Twitter (now X) between 2009 and 2016. We found that extreme temperatures and added precipitation each independently amplified social-media activity, effects that persisted within individuals. Compounded weather extremes produced markedly larger increases in social-media activity. Days colder than −5 °C with 1.5 to 2 cm of precipitation elevated social-media activity by 35%, nearly triple the surge seen on New Year’s Eve in New York City. Our study highlights that environmental conditions play a critical—but overlooked—role in shaping digital social interaction.",

          "abstract": "Engaging in music practice is often assumed to increase empathy and prosociality. However, data in support of this relationship are limited, leaving unclear which components of empathy (cognitive empathy, emotional contagion, and emotional disconnection) and prosocial behaviors, if any, would be affected. Here, we recruited musicians with more than 2 years of musical experience ( n = 80) and nonmusicians ( n = 89) to measure empathy (using subjective and objective measures) and prosociality (using economic games). We hypothesized that musicians would score higher than nonmusicians on empathy and prosociality, and that musicians who practice more would show greater effects. Using classical and Bayesian analyses of variance (ANOVAs), we found no difference between musicians and nonmusicians in empathy and prosociality, and no correlation with the amount of practice. Exploratory analyses revealed associations between the age of onset of music practice and empathy, suggesting that it is not music practice per se but specifically its initiation in early life that could be linked to empathy. These findings challenge the common assumption that music practice in general increases empathy and prosociality and invites to explore in which specific contexts music practice does so (e.g., particular age ranges or group-based settings).",
