          "abstract": "Evidence-accumulation models (EAMs) are powerful tools for making sense of human and animal decision-making behavior. EAMs have generated significant theoretical advances in psychology, behavioral economics, and cognitive neuroscience and are increasingly used as a measurement tool in clinical research and other applied settings. Obtaining valid and reliable inferences from EAMs depends on knowing how to establish a close match between model assumptions and features of the task/data to which the model is applied. However, this knowledge is rarely articulated in the EAM literature, leaving beginners to rely on the private advice of mentors and colleagues and inefficient trial-and-error learning. In this article, we provide practical guidance for designing tasks appropriate for EAMs, relating experimental manipulations to EAM parameters, planning appropriate sample sizes, and preparing data and conducting an EAM analysis. Our advice is based on prior methodological studies and the our substantial collective experience with EAMs. By encouraging good task-design practices and warning of potential pitfalls, we hope to improve the quality and trustworthiness of future EAM research and applications.",

          "authors": "Jerome Hoffmann, Mathias Twardawski, Johanna M. Höhs, Anne Gast, Steffi Pohl, Marie-Ann Sengewald",
          "abstract": "In what aspects do replication studies differ from their primary studies? This question is central for providing insights into the reasons for the nonreplicability of psychological effects. So far, research on potential explanations for the nonreplicability of effects has mainly focused on publication bias and methodological challenges related to measurement error or statistical inference. The recently developed causal-replication framework directs attention toward controlling for differences in study characteristics, including variations in treatment conditions, outcome measures, recruitment, causal estimates, time, location, population, and setting. To contribute to this aim, we conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the design practices of current replication studies. We preregistered the assessment of study characteristics in a detailed review protocol and investigated the available information and intended or unintended variations across primary and replication studies. To do this, we compiled a database of studies that aimed to replicate a causal effect of a clearly stated primary study and that were published in impactful social- and cognitive-psychological journals between January 2017 and August 2022. Our review results highlight that compared with the primary study, authors of replication studies predominantly focus on controlling specific study characteristics in (i.e., methods, procedures, analysis) while often neglecting other study characteristics, such as population or setting. Furthermore, the results indicate that in most replication studies, multiple study characteristics are varied in the study comparison or are insufficiently reported. Accordingly, we discuss prevalent variations, reporting standards, and strategies for planning future replication studies.",

          "authors": "Maya B. Mathur",
          "abstract": "Attention checks are often used to identify and exclude participants who may be responding carelessly. There has been little statistical guidance on the analysis of such studies and on when it is indeed valid to simply exclude inattentive participants. To address this, I first formalize attention checks as measures intended to identify participants whose responses are free of measurement error. Measurement error could arise not only because of careless responding but also if some participants fail to receive the experimental manipulation in its intended form because they did not attend to its contents. I discuss the statistical assumptions under which it is valid to simply exclude inattentive participants. In randomized experiments, this standard analysis may lead to bias if (a) the dependent variable affects attentiveness or (b) there are variables that affect both attentiveness and the dependent variable. The latter assumption is stringent and is likely to be violated in many studies. I suggest a straightforward modification to the standard approach, that is, controlling for variables that affect both attentiveness and the dependent variable. This covariate-adjusted approach requires considerably less stringent assumptions. In two worked examples, I reanalyze previously published experiments on (a) a documentary intended to reduce consumption of meat and animal products and (b) flag-priming effects on political conservatism.",

          "abstract": "Critical-effect-size values represent the smallest detectable effect that can reach statistical significance given a specific sample size, alpha level, and test statistic. It can be useful to calculate the critical effect size when designing a study and evaluate whether such effects are plausible. Reporting critical-effect-size values may be useful when the sample size has not been planned a priori, there is uncertainty about the expected sample size that can be collected, or researchers plan to analyze the data with a statistical hypothesis test. To assist researchers in calculating critical-effect-size values, we developed an R package that allows researchers to report critical-effect-size values for group comparisons, correlations, linear regressions, and meta-analyses. Reflecting on critical-effect-size values could benefit researchers during the planning phase of the study by helping them to understand the limitations of their research design. Critical-effect-size values are also useful when evaluating studies performed by other researchers when a priori power analyses were not performed, especially when nonsignificant results are observed.",

          "abstract": "Are scientific papers providing all essential details necessary to ensure the replicability of study protocols? Are authors effectively conveying study design, data analysis, and the process of drawing inferences from their results? These represent only a fraction of the pressing questions that cognitive psychology and neuropsychology face in addressing the “crisis of confidence.” This crisis has highlighted numerous shortcomings in the journey from research to publication. To address these shortcomings, we introduce PECANS (Preferred Evaluation of Cognitive And Neuropsychological Studies), a comprehensive checklist tool designed to guide the planning, execution, evaluation, and reporting of experimental research. PECANS emerged from a rigorous consensus-building process through the Delphi method. We convened a panel of international experts specialized in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology research practices. Through two rounds of iterative voting and a proof-of-concept phase, PECANS evolved into its final form. The PECANS checklist is intended to serve various stakeholders in the fields of cognitive sciences and neuropsychology, including: (i) researchers seeking to ensure and enhance reproducibility and rigor in their research; (ii) journal editors and reviewers assessing the quality of reports; (iii) ethics committees and funding agencies; (iv) students approaching methodology and scientific writing. PECANS is a versatile tool intended not only to improve the quality and transparency of individual research projects but also to foster a broader culture of rigorous scientific inquiry across the academic and research community.",

          "authors": "Beatriz Bermúdez-Margaretto, Marc Brysbaert",
          "abstract": "This study examined the efficiency of item translation in a challenging language-testing situation. We created a Spanish translation of recently developed English vocabulary tests to assess word knowledge in Spanish-speaking students and highly educated adults, a group for whom it is a challenge to find words that some people know and others do not. The English tests were multiple-choice tests based on meaning recognition and consisted of a total of 150 items. From these, we were able to create two Spanish tests with 37 questions each. We constructed and validated the tests in two separate studies, including another established vocabulary test (Lextale-Esp, based on form recognition), general knowledge tests, and a test for reading comprehension. Two online studies with 161 and 196 participants confirmed that both vocabulary tests have reliability above .75 (.86 when combined) and correlate more highly with general knowledge and reading comprehension than Lextale-Esp. This shows that test translation is an efficient way to find useful items for language tests in different languages. All materials (including the general knowledge tests and the reading comprehension test) are freely available for research purposes.",

          "abstract": "Scholars conduct systematic literature reviews to summarize knowledge and identify gaps in understanding. Machine learning can assist researchers in carrying out these studies. This paper introduces a machine learning toolkit that employs Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing methods to extract textual features and categorize academic papers. The toolkit comprises two algorithms that enable researchers to: (a) select relevant studies for a given theme; and (b) identify the main topics within that theme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our toolkit by analyzing three streams of literature: cobranding, coopetition, and the psychological resilience of entrepreneurs. By comparing the results obtained through our toolkit with previously published literature reviews, we highlight its advantages in enhancing transparency, coherence, and comprehensiveness in literature reviews. We also provide quantitative evidence about the toolkit's efficacy in addressing the challenges inherent in conducting a literature review, as compared with state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing methods. Finally, we discuss the critical role of researchers in implementing and overseeing a literature review aided by our toolkit.",

          "abstract": "Do trait empathy measures predict how people experience empathy in daily life? Despite considerable research on empathy, we know surprisingly little about how trait measures relate to real-world empathic experiences. In this preregistered analysis of 7,343 experience sampling surveys from a near-representative sample of 246 U.S. adults, we map the connections between validated trait empathy measures and state experiences of empathy. Each component of state empathy—including emotion sharing, perspective taking, and compassion—was significantly predicted by theoretically relevant trait measures. However, trait empathy explained limited variance in daily experiences overall, ranging from just 3% for emotion sharing to 15% for perceived empathic efficacy. Adding emotional valence as a predictor improved model fit and variance explained for most state experiences, highlighting the crucial role of context. Our findings validate trait empathy measures while revealing their limitations in predicting real-world experiences.",

          "abstract": "The idea that some people completely lack inner speech is of both scientific and popular interest. In a recent study, Nedergaard and Lupyan compared self-reporting high and low inner-speech-prevalence groups and found that participants in the low-prevalence group performed worse on a verbal working memory test and responded more slowly and less accurately during rhyme judgments. These results represent an original contribution to the study of inner speech. However, the authors go on to draw the unfounded conclusion that their findings, together with previous empirical and anecdotal data, show that some people have no inner speech at all. They have coined the term anendophasia for this trait. This commentary examines Nedergaard and Lupyan’s claim of demonstrated anendophasia; I conclude they present no compelling evidence that some individuals lack inner speech.",

          "abstract": "Humans rely on more knowledgeable individuals to acquire information. But when we are ignorant, how are we to tell who is knowledgeable? We propose that human knowledge is nested: People who know only a few things tend to know very common pieces of information, whereas rare pieces of information are known only by people who know many things, including common things. This leads to the possibility of reliably inferring knowledgeability from minimal cues. In this study ( N = 848 U.S. adults recruited online), we show that individuals can accurately gauge others’ knowledgeability on the basis of very limited information, relying on their ability to estimate the rarity of different pieces of knowledge and on the fact that knowing a rare piece of information indicates a high likelihood of knowing more information in the same theme. Even participants who are largely ignorant of a theme can infer how knowledgeable other individuals are on the basis of the possession of a single piece of knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Melodic intonation is generally considered a central expressive means in musical performance. In Western classical music, relationships between intonation in perception and performance have shown to be less straightforward than one might expect. In this study, we investigated leading-tone intonation for solo violin, as perceived and performed by six accomplished violinists. We selected excerpts from classical violin repertoire, each of which included ascending semitone intervals leading up to tonally stable tones. Each violinist performed the excerpts and participated in a listening study and a semi-structured interview. Prior recordings of the excerpts, manipulated in terms of the pitch of the leading tones, were used in the listening study to obtain information about each participant’s accepted perceptual range of leading-tone intonation. The violinists’ preferred semitone sizes were between 80 and 90 cents, on average, both in their perceptual preferences and their performance practice. This group average appeared to approximate the “standard” of leading-tone intonation that the participants consistently mentioned in their verbal protocols. However, the perceptual preferences and the performance intonation also varied both within and between individuals. Given the overall sharp standard of leading-tone intonation, even an equal-tempered leading tone might sometimes represent an expressive gesture in the violinists’ artistic practice.",
