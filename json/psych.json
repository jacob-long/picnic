          "authors": "Julia M. Rohrer",
          "abstract": "Psychological researchers are interested in how things change over time and routinely make claims about age effects (e.g., personality maturation), cohort effects (e.g., generational differences in narcissism), and sometimes, period effects (e.g., secular trends in mental health). The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design (it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts) and the number of observations available (it also applies if researchers observe the whole population). Researchers usually rely on statistical models that impose constraints to pick one specific decomposition of effects. Unfortunately, these constraints often remain opaque, resulting in a lack of scrutiny of the underlying assumptions. How can researchers reason more transparently and systematically about age, period, and cohort? Here, I summarize advances in the understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem, provide an overview of ways to move forward, and highlight one approach that is particularly transparent about assumptions: bounding analysis, a framework developed by sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. To illustrate this approach, I analyze how age, period, and cohort affect attitudes toward working mothers in the German General Social Survey.",

          "authors": "Dana Pfefferle, Steven R. Talbot, Pia Kahnau, Lauren C. Cassidy, Ralf R. Brockhausen, Anne Jaap, Veronika Deikun, Pinar Yurt, Alexander Gail, Stefan Treue, Lars Lewejohann",
          "abstract": "Preference tests help to determine how highly individuals value different options to choose from. During preference testing, two or more options are presented simultaneously, and options are ranked based on the choices made. Presented options, however, influence each other, where the amount of influence increases with the number of options. Multiple binary choice tests can reduce this degree of influence, but conventional analysis methods do not reveal the relative strengths of preference, i.e., the preference difference between options. Here, we demonstrate that multiple binary comparisons can be used not only to rank but also to scale preferences among many options (i.e., their worth value). We analyzed human image preference data with known valence scores to develop and validate our approach to determine how known valence ranges (high vs. low) converge on a scaled representation of preference data. Our approach allowed us to assess the valence of ranked options in mice and rhesus macaques. By conducting simulations, we developed an approach to incorporate additional option choices into existing rank orders without the need to conduct binary choice tests with all original options, thus reducing the number of animal experiments needed. Two quality measures, consensus error and intransitivity ratio, allow for assessing the achieved confidence of the scaled ranking and better tailoring of measurements required to improve it further. The software is available as an R package (“simsalRbim”). Our approach optimizes preference testing, e.g., in welfare assessment, and allows us to efficiently and quantitatively assess the relative value of options presented to animals.",

          "abstract": "Evidence supporting the interaction between cognitive and motor processes is increasing. Conventional approaches to analyze balance control aggregate sway data over seconds up to minutes, which presents a challenge in discerning the impact of single cognitive processes on balance control. In this paper, we propose a novel, event-related approach to investigate how cognitive task performance affects balance control on small time scales using a force plate. A force plate continuously measures forces and moments in each spatial dimension over time. To facilitate the processing of the resulting time-series data, we developed an R-package called . This package segments the data so that each trial, corresponding to a cognitive task, has its own time-series data. A low-pass filter can be applied to remove artifacts (e.g., muscle twitches or electrical noise), and a baseline correction can be performed to improve the comparability of trials. For each trial’s time-series data, user-defined descriptive statistics (e.g., mean or standard deviation) can be calculated for user-defined time bins around an event (e.g., stimulus or response onset). The package generates a dataset with one or more measures per trial (depending on the number of time bins) that can be used for further analysis, such as a (mixed-effects) analysis of variance. The R-package and the described underlying procedure aim to establish a standard to process force-plate data collected in the context of cognitive experiments for the event-related approach. This facilitates the processing of force-plate data and enhances comparability between studies.",

          "abstract": "Social virtual reality (VR) setups allow two or more individuals to interact in a shared virtual environment while embodying computerized avatars. Such setups allow for detailed investigations into social-cognitive processes, can extend the functionality of existing single-user VR applications and can be used to design novel educational settings and psychotherapeutic treatments. While researchers may use commercially available social VR applications in addressing a range of research questions, an in-house software solution is typically developed when a research project requires more flexible experimental control or should conform to the highest data security standards. This tutorial demonstrates the construction of a social VR application based on an example software that mimics a VR setup but can be run and explored on an individual computer. Information flow emphasizes transparency to allow researchers to flexibly adapt the software to their own environment and research demands. The software is designed for use in controlled laboratory environments but can be extended for use in field research.",

          "abstract": "The problem: wearable eye trackers deliver eye-tracking data on a scene video that is acquired by a camera affixed to the participant’s head. Analyzing and interpreting such head-centered data is difficult and laborious manual work. Automated methods to map eye-tracking data to a world-centered reference frame (e.g., screens and tabletops) are available. These methods usually make use of fiducial markers. However, such mapping methods may be difficult to implement, expensive, and eye tracker-specific. The solution: here we present gazeMapper, an open-source tool for automated mapping and processing of eye-tracking data. gazeMapper can: (1) Transform head-centered data to planes in the world, (2) synchronize recordings from multiple participants, (3) determine data quality measures, e.g., accuracy and precision. gazeMapper comes with a GUI application (Windows, macOS, and Linux) and supports 11 different wearable eye trackers from AdHawk, Meta, Pupil, SeeTrue, SMI, Tobii, and Viewpointsystem. It is also possible to sidestep the GUI and use gazeMapper as a Python library directly.",

          "abstract": "The E ye movements on M achine-generated Te xts C orpus (EMTeC) is a naturalistic eye-movements-while-reading corpus of 107 native English speakers reading machine-generated texts. The texts are generated by three large language models using five different decoding strategies, and they fall into six different text-type categories. EMTeC entails the eye movement data at all stages of pre-processing, i.e., the raw coordinate data sampled at 2000 Hz, the fixation sequences, and the reading measures. It further provides both the original and a corrected version of the fixation sequences, accounting for vertical calibration drift. Moreover, the corpus includes the language models’ internals that underlie the generation of the stimulus texts: the transition scores, the attention scores, and the hidden states. The stimuli are annotated for a range of linguistic features both at text and at word level. We anticipate EMTeC to be utilized for a variety of use cases such as, but not restricted to, the investigation of reading behavior on machine-generated text and the impact of different decoding strategies; reading behavior on different text types; the development of new pre-processing, data filtering, and drift correction algorithms; the cognitive interpretability and enhancement of language models; and the assessment of the predictive power of surprisal and entropy for human reading times. The data at all stages of pre-processing, the model internals, and the code to reproduce the stimulus generation, data pre-processing, and analyses can be accessed via https://github.com/DiLi-Lab/EMTeC/ .",

          "abstract": "Studying the behavior of multiple participants using networked eye-tracking setups is of increasing interest to researchers. However, to conduct such studies, researchers have had to create complicated ad hoc solutions for streaming gaze over a local network. Here we present TittaLSL, a toolbox that enables creating networked multi-participant experiments using Tobii eye trackers with minimal programming effort. An evaluation using 600-Hz gaze streams sent between 15 different eye-tracking stations revealed that the end-to-end latency, including the eye tracker’s gaze estimation processes, achieved by TittaLSL was 3.05 ms. This was only 0.10 ms longer than when gaze samples were received from a locally connected eye tracker. We think that these latencies are low enough that TittaLSL is suitable for the majority of networked eye-tracking experiments, even when the gaze needs to be shown in real time.",

          "authors": "Drew J. McLaughlin, Arthur G. Samuel",
          "abstract": "Numerous language models propose a critical role of auditory short-term memory in spoken language processing, making reliable estimations of individual listeners’ memory capacities essential in linguistic research. Although a variety of cognitive tasks exist for assessing both visual and auditory short-term capacities in a laboratory environment (e.g., digit span), these types of tasks are typically not engaging for the participant. In the current study, we assess the validity and reliability of a novel “gamified” short-term memory assessment tool called Sandwich Builder . In Sandwich Builder , the participant completes 12 trials of a sandwich-building game. In each trial, a drive-thru customer’s sandwich order is presented auditorily, including a list of 1 to 10 sandwich ingredients (e.g., salami, cheddar cheese, mayo, and olives). The participant needs to remember these sandwich ingredients and then build the customer’s sandwich by selecting the necessary ingredients in the correct order. We evaluate Sandwich Builder as an estimate of auditory short-term memory, finding significant correlations with other classic short-term memory measures. Additionally, we measure affect (i.e., mood), fatigue, and motivation following Sandwich Builder as compared to classic tasks: Participants leave Sandwich Builder in a better mood, less fatigued, and more motivated than they leave other memory tasks. Sandwich Builder shows strong convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity, and moderate-to-good test–retest reliability. Finally, we examine the practicality of Sandwich Builder as a measure of individual differences in speech perception research, providing expected power curves for two common paradigms. Altogether, we robustly demonstrate the utility of Sandwich Builder , which is openly available online.",

          "abstract": "The gambler’s fallacy is typically defined as the false belief that a random event is less likely to occur if it has occurred recently. Although forms of this fallacy have been documented numerous times, past work either has not actually measured probabilistic predictions but rather point predictions or used sequences that were not independent. To address these problems, we conducted a series of high-powered, preregistered studies in which we asked 750 adult Amazon Mechanical Turk workers from the United States to report probabilistic predictions for truly independent sequences. In contrast to point predictions, which generated a significant gambler’s fallacy, probabilistic predictions were not found to lead to a gambler’s fallacy. Moreover, the point predictions could not be reconstructed by sampling from the probability judgments. This suggests that the gambler’s fallacy originates at the decision stage rather than in probabilistic reasoning, as posited by several leading theories. New theories of the gambler’s fallacy may be needed to explain these findings.",
