          "title": "A mouse-tracking classification task to measure the unhealthy = tasty intuition",
          "authors": "Jonathan D’hondt, Barbara Briers",
          "abstract": "Understanding food preferences plays a crucial role in addressing both health concerns, such as obesity, and environmental concerns, such as climate change. Recognizing the impact of lay beliefs on food preferences is essential in addressing these challenges. One prevalent belief is the “unhealthy = tasty intuition” (UTI), the belief that taste and health in food do not go together. While self-report scales and behavioral tasks are commonly used to measure such beliefs, they have distinct methodological purposes: scales are better suited for assessing stable, trait-like constructs, whereas tasks capture more dynamic processes and are well suited for experimental manipulation. This paper introduces a mouse-tracking classification task that provides a process-based behavioral index of UTI, providing a novel approach for assessing implicit beliefs about the relationship between taste and health in food. Three studies validate the task, demonstrating correlations between explicit UTI scores and task performance. Additionally, the task predicts actual food consumption and, importantly, exhibits sensitivity to contextual manipulations. Because this task can be adapted to measure other beliefs, it is a valuable tool for researchers working on individual lay beliefs and decision-making processes. To that end, a template of the task is provided to help other researchers build on this work.",

          "abstract": "This study documents and assesses the Tool for Automatic Analysis of Decoding Ambiguity (TAADA). TAADA calculates measures related to decoding, including metrics for grapheme and phoneme counts, neighborhood effects, rhymes, and conditional probabilities for sound–spelling relationships. These measures are assessed in two reading studies. The first study examined links between decoding variables and judgments of reading ease in a corpus of ~5000 reading excerpts, finding that variables related to word frequency, phonographic neighbors for words, word syllable length, and the reverse prior probability for consonants explained 34% of the variance in the reading scores. The second examined links between decoding variables and student reading miscues, finding that word frequency, phoneme counts, rhyme counts, and probability counts explained 3% of students’ reading miscues.",

          "title": "Unconscious cognition without post hoc selection artifacts: From selective analysis to functional dissociations",
          "authors": "Thomas Schmidt, Maximilian P. Wolkersdorfer, Xin Ying Lee, Omar Jubran",
          "abstract": "One of the most popular approaches to unconscious cognition is the technique of “post hoc selection”: Priming effects and visibility ratings are measured in multitasks on the same trial, and only trials with the lowest visibility ratings are selected for analysis of (presumably unconscious) priming effects. In the past, the technique has been criticized for creating statistical artifacts and capitalizing on chance. Here, we argue that post hoc selection constitutes a sampling fallacy, confusing sensitivity and response bias, wrongly ascribing unconscious processing to stimulus conditions that may be far from indiscriminable. In response to a high-profile “best practice” paper by Stockart et al. (2025) that condones the technique, we use standard signal detection theory to show that post hoc selection only isolates trials with neutral response bias, irrespective of actual sensitivity, and thus fails to isolate trials where the critical stimulus is “unconscious”. Our own data demonstrate that zero-visibility ratings are consistent with uncomfortably high levels of sensitivity. As an alternative to post hoc selection, we advocate the study of functional dissociations, where direct ( D ) and indirect ( I ) measures are conceptualized as spanning a two-dimensional D-I space wherein simple, sensitivity, and double dissociations appear as distinct curve patterns. While Stockart et al.’s recommendations cover only a single line of that space where D is close to zero, functional dissociations can utilize the entire space. This circumvents requirements like null visibility and exhaustive reliability, allows for dissociations among different measures of awareness, and supports the planful measurement of functional relationships between direct and indirect measures.",

          "authors": "Carolina Guidolin, Johannes Zauner, Steffen Lutz Hartmeyer, Manuel Spitschan",
          "abstract": "In field studies using wearable light loggers, participants often need to remove the devices, resulting in non-wear intervals of varying and unknown duration. Accurate detection of these intervals is an essential step during data pre-processing. Here, we deployed a multi-modal approach to collect non-wear time during a longitudinal light exposure collection campaign and systematically compare non-wear detection strategies. Healthy participants ( n = 26; mean age 28 ± 5 years, 14F) wore a near-corneal plane light logger for 1 week and reported non-wear events in three ways: pressing an \"event marker\" button on the light logger, placing it in a black bag, and using an app-based Wear log. Wear log entries, checked twice daily, served as ground truth for non-wear detection, showing that non-wear time constituted 5.4 ± 3.8% (mean ± SD) of total participation time. Button presses at the start and end of non-wear intervals were identified in &gt;85.4% of cases when considering time windows beyond 1 min for detection. To detect non-wear intervals based on black bag use and lack of motion, we employed an algorithm that detects clusters of low illuminance and clusters of low activity. Performance was higher for illuminance (F1 = 0.78) than for activity (F1 = 0.52). Light exposure metrics derived from the full dataset, a dataset filtered for non-wear based on self-reports, and a dataset filtered for non-wear using the low illuminance clusters detection algorithm showed minimal differences. Our results highlight that while non-wear detection may be less critical in high-compliance cohorts, systematically collecting and detecting non-wear intervals is feasible and important for ensuring robust data pre-processing.",

          "authors": "Lisa Loy, James P. Trujillo, Floris Roelofsen",
          "abstract": "Gesture recognition technology is a popular area of research, offering applications in many fields, including behaviour research, human–computer interaction (HCI), medical research, and surveillance culture, among others. However, the large quantity of data needed to train a recognition algorithm is not always available, and differences between the training set and one’s own research data in factors such as recording conditions and participant characteristics may hinder transferability. To address these issues, we propose training and testing recognition algorithms on virtual agents, a tool that has not yet been used for this purpose in multimodal communication research. We provide an example use case with step-by-step instructions, using mocap data to animate a virtual agent and create customised lighting conditions, backgrounds, and camera angles, creating a virtual agent-only dataset to train and test a gesture recognition algorithm. This approach also allows us to assess the impact of particular features, such as background and lighting. Our best-performing model in optimal background and lighting conditions achieved accuracy of 85.9%. When introducing background clutter and reduced lighting, the accuracy dropped to 71.6%. When testing the virtual agent-trained model on images of humans, the accuracy of target handshape classification ranged from 72% to 95%. The results suggest that training an algorithm on artificial data (1) is a resourceful, convenient, and effective way to customise algorithms, (2) potentially addresses issues of data sparsity, and (3) can be used to assess the impact of many contextual and environmental factors that would not be feasible to systematically assess using human data",

          "abstract": "We present the HR-ACT (Human–Robot Action) Database, a comprehensive collection of 80 standardized videos featuring matched communicative and noncommunicative actions performed by both a humanoid robot (Pepper) and a human actor. We describe the creation of 40 action exemplars per agent, with actions executed in a similar manner, timing, and number of repetitions. The database includes detailed normative data collected from 438 participants, providing metrics on action identification, confidence ratings, communicativeness ratings, meaning clusters, and H values (an entropy-based measure reflecting response homogeneity). We provide researchers with controlled yet naturalistic stimuli in multiple formats: videos, image frames, and raw animation files (.qanim). These materials support diverse research applications in human–robot interaction, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. The database enables systematic investigation of action perception across human and robotic agents, while the inclusion of raw animation files allows researchers using Pepper robots to implement these actions for real-time experiments. The full set of stimuli, along with comprehensive normative data and documentation, is publicly available at https://osf.io/8vsxq/ .",

          "abstract": "The United States is characterized as having relatively weak social norms compared to other countries. However, this characterization may be an oversimplification due to the cultural diversity that exists within the country. Four studies ( N = 1,537) examined whether and why U.S. racial minorities (East Asian, Latinx, and African Americans) perceive their racial community’s norms to be significantly stronger than European Americans and White immigrants to the United States (Studies 1–4). This difference was not due to increased perceived discrimination (Study 3) or concerns about out-group member punishment (Study 4). Instead, racial minorities’ stronger perceptions of community norms were motivated primarily by interdependence (Studies 1–4) and concerns about being punished by in-group members for not following norms (Study 4). These findings illustrate differences in norm strength between racial groups in a single country, deepening our understanding of how social norm perceptions may vary in a multicultural society.",

This study investigates whether disparities in well-being are associated with relational experiences, with a focus on friendship dynamics. Using a year-long multiwave survey, we investigate key features of friend networks that are linked to well-being among first-generation, low-income (FLI) students and their continuing-generation, higher-income (CHI) peers. We find that, for FLI students, better well-being is uniquely and consistently linked to similarity and academic support in their friend networks. Furthermore, disparities in well-being between FLI and CHI students are largest when FLI students' friend networks are more socioeconomically diverse and completely mitigated when they are less diverse. These findings underscore that in socioeconomically diverse college environments, friendships are not one-size-fits-all in their ability to meet the needs of individuals.",
