          "abstract": "Large behavioral datasets that provide detailed data on reading processes are valuable resources for a range of researchers working in linguistics, psychology and cognitive science. This paper presents the HeCz corpus, which comprises self-paced reading data for 1919 newspaper headlines (23,634 words) in Czech, with each headline being accompanied by a yes–no comprehension question, resulting in a rich dataset of reading times for each individual word and comprehension accuracy. The corpus is novel in terms of the sheer scale of data collection, with 1872 native Czech speakers, each reading approximately 120 headlines, with 1162 of those participants also completing the experiment again in a re-testing session using the same stimuli approximately 1 month later. There is participant level meta-data also available relating to basic demographic information, reading habits and a profile of their mood state prior to completing the experiment. Beyond the behavioral and demographic data, we also include a range of linguistic annotations for several variables, e.g., frequency, surprisal, morphological tagging. To better understand how these variables might impact processing, we present exploratory analyses where we predicted the reading times for words, with the results indicating important roles for linguistic, demographic, and methodological variables. Given the range of multidisciplinary applications of the HeCz corpus, we hope that it will provide a valuable and unprecedented resource for a range of research applications related to reading processes.",

          "abstract": "The vision of leveraging digital technologies to deliver real-time psychological interventions in everyday settings is realized via just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) – an intervention design that guides the use of rapidly changing information about a person’s internal states and contexts to decide whether and how to intervene in daily life. Microrandomized trials (MRTs) were developed as an experimental design to address scientific questions about how to best construct JITAIs, enabling scientists to investigate whether, what type, and under what conditions, intervention delivery can promote behavior change. However, missing data present challenges to the ability of MRTs to inform the development of JITAIs. This article articulates the multiple sources of missing data that can manifest in MRT studies, discusses how such missing data can impact (1) bias, (2) variance, and (3) the future implementation of JITAIs, and discusses strategies for both minimizing missing data in an MRT design and handling missing data when they occur. The overarching goal is to provide a conceptual framework that will guide future investigators in anticipating missing data and making informed decisions to manage them. Throughout, we illustrate concepts using existing data from the Mobile Assistance for Regulating Smoking (MARS) study. MARS ( n = 99) involved a 10-day MRT that included up to six randomizations per person per day.",

          "authors": "Nikola Sekulovski, Tessa F. Blanken, Jonas M. B. Haslbeck, Maarten Marsman",
          "abstract": "Graphical models have become an important method for studying the network structure of multivariate psychological data. Accurate recovery of the underlying network structure is paramount and requires that the models are appropriate for the data at hand. Traditionally, Gaussian graphical models for continuous data and Ising models for binary data have dominated the literature. However, psychological research often relies on ordinal data from Likert scale items, creating a model-data mismatch. This paper examines the effect of dichotomizing ordinal variables on network recovery, as opposed to analyzing the data at its original level of measurement, using a Bayesian analysis of the ordinal Markov random field model. This model is implemented in the R package . Our analysis shows that dichotomization results in a loss of information, which affects the accuracy of network recovery. This is particularly true when considering the interplay between the dichotomization cutoffs used and the distribution of the ordinal categories. In addition, we demonstrate a difference in accuracy when using dichotomized data, depending on whether edges are included or excluded in the true network, which highlights the effectiveness of the ordinal model in recovering conditional independence relationships. These findings underscore the importance of using models that deal directly with ordinal data to ensure more reliable and valid inferred network structures in psychological research.",

          "authors": "Inbal Kimchi, Sascha Schroeder, Noam Siegelman",
          "abstract": "The importance or centrality of a linguistic unit to a larger unit’s meaning is known to affect reading behavior. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to quantify a unit’s degree of importance or centrality, with previous quantifications using either subjective ratings or computational solutions with limited interpretability. Here we introduce a novel measure, which we term “informativeness”, to assess the significance of a word to the meaning of the sentence in which it appears. Our measure is based on the comparison of vectorial representations of the full sentence with a revised sentence without the target word, resulting in an easily interpretable and objective quantification. We show that our new measure correlates in expected ways with other psycholinguistic variables (e.g., frequency, length, predictability), and, importantly, uniquely predicts eye-movement reading behavior in large-scale datasets of first (L1) and second language (L2) readers (from the Multilingual Eye-tracking Corpus, MECO). We also show that the effects of informativeness generalize to diverse writing systems, and are stronger for poorer than better readers. Together, our work provides new avenues for investigating informativeness effects, towards a deeper understanding of the way it impacts reading behavior.",

          "authors": "Serena Castellotti, Irene Petrizzo, Roberto Arrighi, Elvio Blini",
          "abstract": "The measurement of pupil size is a classic tool in psychophysiology, but its popularity has recently surged due to the rapid developments of the eye-tracking industry. Concurrently, several authors have outlined a wealth of strategies for tackling pupillary recordings analytically. The consensus is that the “temporal” aspect of changes in pupil size is key, and that the analytical approach should be mindful of the temporal factor. Here we take a more radical stance on the matter by suggesting that, by the time significant changes in pupil size are detected, it is already too late . We suggest that these changes are indeed the result of distinct, core physiological processes that originate several hundreds of milliseconds before that moment and altogether shape the observed signal. These processes can be recovered indirectly by leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques. Here we therefore outline key concepts of temporal principal components analysis and related rotations to show that they reveal a latent, low-dimensional space that represents these processes very efficiently: a pupillary manifold. We elaborate on why assessing the pupillary manifold provides an alternative, appealing analytical solution for data analysis. In particular, dimensionality reduction returns scores that are (1) mindful of the relevant physiology underlying the observed changes in pupil size, (2) extremely handy and manageable for statistical modelling, and (3) devoid of several arbitrary choices. We elaborate on these points in the form of a tutorial paper for the functions provided in the accompanying R library “Pupilla.”",

          "authors": "Hanna Rajh-Weber, Stefan Ernest Huber, Martin Arendasy",
          "abstract": "Selecting an appropriate statistical method is a challenge frequently encountered by applied researchers, especially if assumptions for classical, parametric approaches are violated. To provide some guidelines and support, we compared classical hypothesis tests with their typical distributional assumptions of normality and homoskedasticity with common and easily accessible alternative inference methods (HC3, HC4, and six bootstrap methods) in the framework of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The method’s performance was assessed for four different regression models with varying levels of non-normality and heteroskedasticity of errors, and for five different sample sizes ranging from 25 to 500 cases. For each scenario, 10,000 samples of observations were generated. Type I error and coverage rates, power, and standard error bias were examined to assess the methods’ performance. No method considered here performed satisfactorily on all accounts. Using HC3 or HC4 standard errors, or a wild bootstrap procedure with percentile confidence intervals, could yield reliable results in many, but not all, scenarios. We suppose that, in the case of assumption violations, researchers might refer to a method that performed best in a scenario most similar to their data situation. To aid the selection of an appropriate method, we provide tables comparing relative performances in all considered scenarios.",

          "authors": "Jesse Boot, Jill de Ron, Jonas Haslbeck, Sacha Epskamp",
          "abstract": "In psychological studies, it is common practice to select a sample based on the sum score of the modeled variables (e.g., based on symptom severity when investigating the associations between those same symptoms). However, this practice introduces bias if the sum score selection imperfectly defines the population of interest. Here, we propose a correction for this type of selection bias in the Ising model, a popular network model for binary data. Possible applications of our correction are when one wants to obtain (1) full population estimates when only the sum score subset of the data is available, and (2) improved estimates of a subpopulation, if we observe a mixture of populations that differ from each other in the sum score. In a simulation study, we verify that our correction recovers the network structure of the desired population after a sum score selection using both a node-wise regression and a multivariate estimation of the Ising model. In an example, we show how our correction can be used in practice using empirical data on symptoms of major depression from the National Comorbidity Study Replication ( N = 9,282). We implemented our correction in four commonly used R packages for estimating the Ising model, namely IsingFit , IsingSampler , psychonetrics, and bootnet.",

          "abstract": "Children morally prioritize humans over animals less than adults do. Is this because children are less speciesist—meaning they place less moral weight on mere species membership? Or is it because they give less weight to differences in cognitive capacity between humans and other animals? We investigated this in two experiments, presenting children and adult participants in the United States and Spain with moral trade-off dilemmas. These dilemmas involved individuals who varied in species membership (human vs. monkey) and cognitive capacity. Across both cultures, children were less likely than adults to prioritize humans over animals, regardless of cognitive capacity. In addition, participants tended to prioritize individuals with higher cognitive capacities, regardless of species membership—though this effect was less robust in children. Our findings suggest that children in these Western contexts are indeed less speciesist than adults, though they do not rule out developmental changes in the moral weight assigned to cognitive capacity.",

          "abstract": "Microaggressions require an inferential process for their aggressive intent to be recognized. Using approaches from pragmatics, especially relevance theory, we conducted experiments to examine factors predicted to influence perceptions of an utterance as a microaggression. Participants read scenarios describing an interaction between two people and indicated their perceptions of a target remark. We expected and found that an utterance was more likely to be perceived as a microaggression if (a) it occurred in a context for which its relevance was not clear, thereby prompting observers to infer an aggressive intent, and (b) the recipient was a person of marginalized status. Furthermore, these effects were larger for participants with a more liberal political orientation relative to those who were more conservative. This was due, in part, to variability in Theory of Mind capabilities and beliefs about microaggressions associated with political orientation.",

Online daters (targets, N = 180) submitted their profiles, described their personality and the impression they wanted to convey. Judges ( N = 196) viewed these profiles and rated targets’ personalities. Overall, targets wanted to be seen accurately and positively, and they successfully presented desired personas without their personality leaking through, suggesting being seen accurately is within targets’ control. Some processes were related to outcomes (e.g., swiping decisions) and explained by individual differences (e.g., attachment).

This research investigated how information is used for generalized morality. It was predicted that group-level generalized morality, or moral stereotyping, would come first when the information is limited, thereby people rely on a surface cue. As information increases, they come to use individual-level generalized morality, which is shown by Jackson et al. Following Jackson et al., the current research employed an agent-based modeling (Study 1) and human study (Study 2). Study 1 found that participants used moral stereotyping first in their interactions when the visual cue-morality association was salient. Study 2 also showed the same trend.

Although SSAs are common in political discourse, they have received little empirical attention in this context. In 15 studies (including samples from four countries and a study of natural language usage on the social media site Reddit), we examine who may be most prone to slippery slope thinking and why people in general may engage in such thinking. We consider whether individuals of different political ideologies exhibit different degrees of support for SSAs. We test three competing hypotheses that it is (a) political extremists, (b) political liberals, or (c) political conservatives that more strongly endorse SSAs. We consistently find that conservatives endorse SSAs more due to ideological differences in intuitive thinking. We additionally find evidence of these ideological differences in social media behavior, and that slippery slope thinking has consequences for punitive attitudes.",

We present a theoretical integration of meaning and attention, followed by five studies investigating their relationship in lab experiments and everyday life (total N = 1,654). Experimental findings indicate that meaning increased attention (Studies 1 and 3), and attention increased meaning, but only when meaning could be found in a stimulus (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3). An experience-sampling study further reveals a positive meaning–attention association at dispositional, situational, and cross-levels (Study 4). Across varied daily activities, participants reported greater meaning when they paid more attention. These studies also explored the interplay of meaning and attention with boredom, negative emotions, and subjective well-being.

          "authors": "Ruri Takizawa, Stefanie Marx-Fleck, Alina Gerlach, Gudela Grote",
          "abstract": "How people respond to uncertainty has far-reaching socio-political consequences. When perceived as fixed and threatening, individuals may gravitate toward ideologies that undermine intergroup relations and social cohesion. We examined whether fostering an uncertainty-as-enabling mindset (viewing uncertainty as malleable and an opportunity) promotes positive diversity attitudes and indirectly affects commitment to societal change and support for right-wing populism. During Germany’s 2025 federal election, we ran a 3-month online study with German citizens ( N = 745). Participants who received an uncertainty mindset intervention (vs. control) reported a higher uncertainty-as-enabling mindset, which was linked to stronger commitment to societal change through higher perceived productivity of diversity and lower aversion to intergroup contact. The mindset was also linked to a lower likelihood of voting for a right-wing populist party via the same pathways. Shifting how individuals appraise uncertainty may thus be a promising strategy for strengthening democratic resilience by cultivating openness to diversity.",

          "authors": "Cassandra M. Chapman, Jessica Spence, Lucas Dixon, Aimee E. Smith, Matthew J. Hornsey",
          "abstract": "Charitable giving is essential for supporting collective action on various social and environmental problems. Social norms are known to sometimes affect giving, but not always. In this multilevel meta-analysis, we aggregate data from 113 independent samples from research involving 100,469 people in 22 countries to understand the extent to which social norms influence charitable giving ( r = .18, p &lt; .001). We test a range of theoretical, methodological, and sample moderators to understand the conditions under which norms may be most effective at promoting giving. The relationship was stronger for injunctive than descriptive norms, when the norm referent was friends and family (vs. no referent or another ingroup), for internalized (vs. externally presented) norms, and potentially when the giving behavior was observed by others. Norms appear effective for most people, and especially for younger people and in non-WEIRD and collectivist contexts. Effects, however, were only found in published research and non-preregistered studies.",

          "abstract": "This research identifies awe as an emotional factor that promotes perspective-taking. Utilizing a multi-method approach, we systematically investigate the influence of awe on perspective-taking, exploring its mechanisms and downstream consequences. We consistently found that awe is associated with (Studies 2 and 4) and promotes (Studies 1, 3, and 5) perspective-taking, with self-transcendence mediating this relationship (Studies 3, 4, and 5). Furthermore, the downstream effects of awe and perspective-taking manifest in association with (Study 4) and promote cooperative behavior (Study 5). The impact of awe on perspective-taking was not reducible to its positive valence (Study 1), and the mediation model was established beyond the influence of the small self (Study 3). These findings enrich the research on the relationship between emotions and perspective-taking, emphasizing the role of awe in promoting social cohesion.",
