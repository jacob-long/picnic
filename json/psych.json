          "authors": "Brendan Williams, Lily FitzGibbon, Daniel Brady, Anastasia Christakou",
          "abstract": "Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) are a commonly used metric in test–retest reliability research to assess a measure’s ability to quantify systematic between-subject differences. However, estimates of between-subject differences are also influenced by factors including within-subject variability, random errors, and measurement bias. Here, we use data collected from a large online sample ( N = 150) to (1) quantify test–retest reliability of behavioural and computational measures of reversal learning using ICCs, and (2) use our dataset as the basis for a simulation study investigating the effects of sample size on variance component estimation and the association between estimates of variance components and ICC measures. In line with previously published work, we find reliable behavioural and computational measures of reversal learning, a commonly used assay of behavioural flexibility. Reliable estimates of between-subject, within-subject (across-session), and error variance components for behavioural and computational measures (with ± .05 precision and 80% confidence) required sample sizes ranging from 10 to over 300 (behavioural median N : between-subject = 167, within-subject = 34, error = 103; computational median N : between-subject = 68, within-subject = 20, error = 45). These sample sizes exceed those often used in reliability studies, suggesting that sample sizes larger than are commonly used for reliability studies (circa 30) are required to robustly estimate reliability of task performance measures. Additionally, we found that ICC estimates showed highly positive and highly negative correlations with between-subject and error variance components, respectively, as might be expected, which remained relatively stable across sample sizes. However, ICC estimates were weakly or not correlated with within-subject variance, providing evidence for the importance of variance decomposition for reliability studies.",

We used reverse correlation to (a) generate images that approximate mental representations of apologetic faces, (b) determine whether these images are rated highly on apology-related characteristics, and (c) see if ratings differ by gender of the image generator, target face, and/or image rater. Faces generated from male and female base faces to look apologetic were rated as more apologetic, remorseful, and sad than the base face, demonstrating these mental representations can be approximated using reverse correlation. Findings suggest visually represented apologies express multiple apology-related characteristics. Study 2 revealed the visual templates of faces generated by the gender ingroup appeared more apologetic than those of the gender outgroup; women-generated female faces were most apologetic, and men-generated female faces were least apologetic. Findings highlight gender differences in mental representation, but not perception, of female apologetic faces.",

We develop and test a model identifying team-level psychopathic personality and teamwork knowledge as proximal contributors to the creation of toxic team climates, which mediates the effects to create dysfunctional team outcomes. We also tested an alternative model that treats teamwork knowledge as a moderator of the relationship between team psychopathy and toxic team climate. Using a four-wave longitudinal design, we evaluated these models in a sample of 508 business students comprising 107 student teams (35 MBA and 72 undergraduate) completing semester-long team projects. Results indicate that (1) teams with relatively higher levels of psychopathy and lower levels of teamwork knowledge were more likely to have toxic team climates, (2) teams with more toxic climates had higher levels of social loafing and interpersonal deviance, and lower team performance and satisfaction, and (3) the effects of psychopathy on dysfunctional outcomes were mediated by toxic team climate, but the effects of teamwork knowledge were not. In addition, teamwork knowledge moderated the relationship between team psychopathy and toxic team climate by reducing its effects. The study yields implications for the management of toxic work teams.",

          "authors": "Noya Kislev, Michal Reifen-Tagar, Daphna Joel, Tamar Saguy",
          "abstract": "Gendered parenting refers to parents’ tendency to promote gender-stereotypic behaviors of their young children. We claim that a central source of gendered parenting is parents’ support for social hierarchy (as captured by their social dominance orientation [SDO]). This is expected because parents high on SDO are more likely to think of gender as a biological dichotomy (gender essentialism), and to believe that men and boys belong in different domains than women and girls (a non-egalitarian gender ideology). Israeli parents to preschool children were surveyed ( N = 400 in Study 1; N = 401 in Study 2). Across studies, parents were asked to choose a gift for their child as a behavioral measure of gendered parenting. Results supported the predictions, such that parents’ SDO predicted gendered parenting through two sequential mediators: higher levels of gender essentialism and a non-egalitarian gender ideology. We discuss the relevance of these findings for understanding the roots of gendered parenting.",

One of the most influential approaches to abstract and concrete construals is Construal Level Theory, which has primarily taken a situational approach to studying construal level. The current research develops the General Construal Questionnaire to measure individuals’ general tendencies toward abstract and concrete thinking, opening possibilities for new research that extends past the focus on situational construal. Distinguishing abstract and concrete construals as distinct factors reveals that they have unique effects. Abstract construal correlates with extraversion, openness to experience, a focus on the future, promotion, and desirability, a preference for cognition, tolerance for uncertainty, and a tendency to perceive similarities, stereotype, and evaluate. Concrete construal correlates with conscientiousness, a focus on the present, prevention, and feasibility, a preference for certainty and perfectionism, and a tendency to perceive differences and make daily progress.",

Participants were 603 third- to fifth-grade students ( M age = 9.06, SD = .90; 47.9% girls; 52.4% racially minoritized). Peer nominations of prosocial behavior and friendships were collected twice in 1 year. Longitudinal path analyses focused on intergender friendships showed support for both the primary and secondary transfer effects on enhanced intergroup prosocial behavior. Analyses focused on racial status showed the primary effects of these friendships on enhanced interracial prosocial behavior, whereas the secondary transfer effects were less consistent. These findings provide a basis for interventions to promote equity in prosociality toward diverse others.",

Higher pregame similarity ratings led to increases in perceptions of competence, while higher pregame liking ratings led to increases in perceptions of sociability. In addition, objective performance mattered for competence ratings, whereas subjective perceptions of performance mattered for sociability ratings.

          "abstract": "Social stereotypes have been linked with gender and racial disparities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Developing a domain identity in a STEM field is linked with persistence and success among students from negatively stereotyped groups. However, these students often report a conflict between their group and domain identities. Across two studies we apply balanced identity design theory and latent profile analysis (LPA) to understand how individuals navigate stereotypically incompatible identities. In Study 1, we find that novice STEM majors from negatively stereotyped groups are less likely to hold identity balance than their positively stereotyped counterparts. However, in a separate sample of students approaching graduation in Study 2, the groups converge; both predominantly achieving identity balance. LPA identified three predominant clusters of identity balanced students which differentially predicted academic achievement and well-being for negatively compared with positively stereotyped students. This underscores the importance of understanding balanced identities for addressing underrepresentation in STEM.",

Accurate racial knowledge, determined by signal detection analysis, predicted tenet support, even when controlling for racial prejudice, social dominance, and political conservatism. In three experiments, White undergraduates learned critical knowledge about race vs. poverty or transportation (Studies 2 and 3, respectively) or structural racism vs. pig intelligence (Study 4). In each, critical racial knowledge increased CRT tenet support. In Study 1, racial knowledge predicted blind patriotism negatively but constructive patriotism positively. Acquiring critical racial knowledge in Studies 2–4 did not lead participants to distance from America, despite claims of cultural critics.

An insightful commentary reanalyzed the data using maximal random structure models and found no increase in accuracy when taking a disagreeing perspective. These findings present a curious challenge for inner-crowd research and hint at the importance of question variability. Here, we present the results of three preregistered experiments (total N = 2,884, with online adult participants from the United States and the United Kingdom) that reconcile these findings by discerning between the ease and difficulty of questions. The results support the notion that taking a disagreeing perspective is beneficial for difficult questions, yet harmful for easier questions. We emphasize that question difficulty is a key factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of any intervention designed to improve the accuracy of aggregate estimates through the enhancement of diversity.",

          "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the within-person relationship between religious-service attendance and mental health using data from the British Household Panel Survey ( N = 29,298), a longitudinal survey of adult British households between 1991 and 2009. The outcome variables were mental health (as measured with the General Health Questionnaire) and life satisfaction. Using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models over 10 waves of data spanning over 18 years, the associations between religious-service attendance and mental health at the within-person level were mostly nonsignificant. The few significant findings indicated that an increase in religious-service attendance is associated subsequently with either higher or lower levels of mental health, suggesting both detrimental and beneficial effects. A series of robustness analyses (including the use of marginal structural models) mainly supported these findings.
