          "authors": "Noemí Grinspun, Eden Landesman, Yonnhatan García, Tal-Chen Rabinowitch",
          "abstract": "This methodological paper examines the assessment of interpersonal synchrony during a joint dancing task between mothers and their children (aged 4 to 5 years) using OpenPose. This pose estimation tool captures movement in naturalistic settings. The study analyzes 45 mother–child dyads, comparing two analytical methods for assessing synchrony, and examines their correlation with the Coding Interactive Behavior (CIB) measure of interaction quality. The first method employs cross-wavelet transform (CWT) coherence to assess synchrony based on vertical head movement. This straightforward and computationally efficient approach reveals a significant correlation between interpersonal synchrony and CIB scores, thus implying its potential as a reliable indicator of interaction quality and suggesting its potential as a measure of interaction quality. The second method, the generalized cross-wavelet transform (GCWT), analyzes synchrony across multiple body parts, offering a more complex and detailed analysis of interpersonal dynamics. However, it did not significantly correlate with the CIB scores. Our findings suggest that focusing on head movement using CWT can effectively capture critical elements of interpersonal synchrony linked to interaction quality. In contrast, despite its richness, the more complex GCWT approach may not align as closely with observed interactive behaviors as the CIB scores indicate. This study underscores the need to balance methodological complexity and ecological validity in research, offering insights into selecting analytical techniques based on research objectives and the nuances of interpersonal dynamics. Our results contribute to the field of interpersonal synchrony research, emphasizing the benefits of efficient methods in understanding mother–child interactions and interaction relationships in general.",

Currently, there is no method for online monitoring phases of pupil size fluctuation. We introduce rtPupilPhase —an open-source software that automatically detects trends in pupil size in real time. This tool enables novel applications of real-time pupillometry for achieving numerous research and translational goals. We validated the performance of rtPupilPhase on human, rodent, and monkey pupil data, and we propose future implementations of real-time pupillometry.",

          "abstract": "Most current databases for bodily emotion expression are created in Western countries, resulting in culturally skewed representations. To address the obvious risk this bias poses to academic comprehension, we attempted to expand the current repertoire of human bodily emotions by recruiting Asian professional performers to wear whole-body suits with 57 retroreflective markers attached to major joints and body segments, and express seven basic emotions with whole-body movements in a motion-capture lab. For each emotion, actors performed three self-created scenarios that covered a broad range of real-life events to elicit the target emotion within 2–5 seconds. Subsequently, a separate group of participants was invited to judge the perceived emotional category from the extracted biological motions (point-light displays with 18 or 57 markers). The results demonstrated that the emotion discrimination accuracy was comparable to Western databases containing standardized performance scenarios. The results provide a significant step toward establishing a database using a novel emotional induction approach based on personalized scenarios. This database will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of emotional expression across diverse contexts.",

          "abstract": "Eye tracking technology has become increasingly prevalent in scientific research, offering unique insights into oculomotor and cognitive processes. The present article explores the relationship between scientific theory, the research question, and the use of eye-tracking technology. It aims to guide readers in determining if eye tracking is suitable for their studies and how to formulate relevant research questions. Examples from research on oculomotor control, reading, scene perception, task execution, visual expertise, and instructional design are used to illustrate the connection between theory and eye-tracking data. These examples may serve as inspiration to researchers new to eye tracking. In summarizing the examples, three important considerations emerge: (1) whether the study focuses on describing eye movements or uses them as a proxy for e.g., perceptual, or cognitive processes, (2) the logical chain from theory to predictions, and (3) whether the study is of an observational or idea-testing nature. We provide a generic scheme and a set of specific questions that may help researchers formulate and explicate their research question using eye tracking.",

          "abstract": "The present study introduces the Persian Sentence Reading (PSR) Corpus, aiming to expand empirical data for Persian, an under-investigated language in research on oculomotor control in reading. Reading research has largely focused on Latin script languages with a left-to-right reading direction. However, languages with different reading directions, such as right-to-left and top-to-bottom, and particularly Persian script-based languages like Farsi and Dari, have remained understudied. This study pioneers in providing an eye movement dataset for reading Persian sentences, enabling further exploration of the influences of unique Persian characteristics on eye movement patterns during sentence reading. The core objective of the study is to provide data about how word characteristics impact eye movement patterns. The research also investigates the characteristics of the interplay between neighboring words and eye movements on them. By broadening the scope of reading research beyond commonly studied languages, the study aims to contribute to an interdisciplinary approach to reading research, exemplifying investigations through various theoretical and methodological perspectives.",

          "abstract": "Aside from some common movement regularities, significant inter-individual and inter-trial variation within the same individual exists in motor system output. However, there is still a lack of a robust and widely adopted solution for quantifying the degree of similarity between movements. We therefore developed an innovative approach based on the Procrustes transformation to compute 'motor distance' between pairs of kinematic data. As a proof of concept, we tested this on a dataset of reach-to-grasp movements performed by 16 participants while acting with the same confederate. Using the information of wrist velocity, acceleration, and jerk, the proposed technique was able to correctly estimate smaller distances between movements performed by the confederate compared with those of participants. Moreover, the reconstructed pattern of inter-subject distances was consistent when computed either on precision grip prehension or whole hand prehension, suggesting its suitability for the investigation of 'motor styles'. The definition of a solid approach to 'motor distance' computation, therefore, opens the way to new research lines in the field of movement kinematics.",

          "authors": "Małgorzata Kossowska, Hoi-Wing Chan, Ying Yi Hong, Ewa Szumowska",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the longitudinal effects of aiding war refugees on perceptions of intergroup threat and the prospective fear of being affected by military conflict. We hypothesized that engaging in helping behaviors directed towards refugees would prompt individuals to perceive these actions as serving vital self-functions (i.e., satisfying basic psychological needs), which, in turn, could potentially mitigate the intergroup threat perceived in relation to the refugees while amplifying the prospective fear of potential warfare. Data were collected over three waves of a panel study during the initial 2 months of the refugee crisis in Poland arising from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Our findings reveal that providing assistance to war refugees at Time 1 resulted in greater perceived personal benefits of helping at Time 2. This enhanced perceived functionality of helping subsequently predicted diminished intergroup refugee threat perceptions (both realistic and symbolic), but also heightened fear levels concerning the potential impact of war at Time 3. These results were consistent across models accounting for lagged-1 and more stringent lagged-2 autoregressive effects. Importantly, the observed temporal relationships regarding realistic threat and fear of war were less robust against individual difference factors. These findings enrich the ongoing discourse on the impacts of aiding individuals fleeing conflict zones and how beliefs about the purpose of such means of assistance shape constructive intergroup relations.",

          "abstract": "The state’s monopoly on sovereignty can be challenged by criminal systems capable of gaining legitimacy within communities. Understanding the psychological basis of such legitimacy requires broadening traditional conceptualizations of authority to consider how it operates without legal backing and outside formal channels. This research introduces the Legitimacy of Secret Power (L-SP) Scale, a tool measuring individuals’ appraisal of illegal groups’ power. We validated L-SP through three studies ( N total = 3,173). Findings demonstrate a reliable, 20-item mono-factorial structure. Study 3 tested L-SP’s measurement invariance in the UK, Italy, Japan, and the US. Across studies, L-SP correlated with support for illegality, ideologies of masculine honor, and social dominance. It was inversely related to the perceived national threat of criminal groups, democratic attitudes, and police legitimacy. Notably, L-SP predicted individuals’ willingness to report criminal groups independently of their fear of these groups or perceptions of police legitimacy. Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.",

          "authors": "Mehrgol Tiv, Cody Spence",
          "abstract": "We examined whether exposure to context diversity in one domain relates to mental associations in another social domain. County-level metrics of racial diversity and segregation computed from restricted-use U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data were linked to a geolocated measure of sexual orientation implicit bias from over 825,000 respondents across the United States (2015–2021). Multilevel models revealed that living in more racially diverse counties was related to less stereotypic implicit associations of sexual orientation, and this relationship was moderated by racial segregation. This primary result was evaluated through a series of robustness checks. Weighted models accounting for the nonrepresentative nature of the sample revealed a robust association with diversity but not an interaction with segregation. The negative relationship with diversity was also replicated on a different Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit attitudes to disability, but the interaction with segregation was again insignificant. These results support the hypothesis that exposure to social diversity in one domain can generalize to intergroup attitudes in another domain. These results also highlight the dynamic interaction between an individual and their social environment, bolstering the need for socially contextualized research on human cognition.",

Extending the existing discrimination and social networks research, I argue that the effects of nativism—a bias against foreigners—in advice seeking and other network relations cannot be validly inferred from native/nonnative outcome inequalities. Instead, the effects of nativism in social networks are revealed in natives’ asymmetric behaviors and attitudes that disadvantage nonnatives. It is hypothesized that, other things being equal, natives seek task-related advice across the nativity divide less frequently than nonnatives do. In another manifestation of nativism, native advice seeking targets perceive nonnatives who seek their advice as less competent than those nonnatives who do not seek their advice. Consistent evidence of these patterns was found in four separate networks of working professionals. These findings have implications for the study of discriminatory biases in social networks and for countering such biases in organizational and educational settings.",

          "abstract": "Reputation is multidimensional, with some traits being more relevant than others in particular contexts. Can people selectively respond to reputational cues relevant to the task at hand? Across three studies, we examined how people weigh cues about helpfulness and competence when forming expectations about strangers’ behavior. Using adapted investment games, we varied whether a stranger’s helpfulness or competence predicted participants’ future payoffs. We found that when helpfulness is task-relevant (Experiments 1 and 2), participants correctly use this cue in investment decisions. When competence matters most (Experiment 3), participants use it as the primary cue. Overall, a high reputation for outcome-irrelevant characteristics did not compensate for a low reputation for the outcome-relevant reputational cue. However, we also find an asymmetric spillover: Decision-makers prefer cooperating with others who are highly competent and highly helpful, regardless of task demands. We discuss our results within the theoretical framework of person perception and theories of reputation.",
