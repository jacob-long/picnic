          "authors": "Tapio Nojonen, Kiia Korsu, Filip Ginter, Veronika Laippala, Jenna Kanerva",
          "abstract": "This work introduces TCBLex, a lexical database of Finnish literary works read by children between the ages of 7 and 15. We explain in detail the work done to build the corpus TCBLex is based on, including how books were sampled and collected, turned into text files, and finally processed. We also touch on legal considerations and how it is possible to build such a corpus in the EU. TCBLex contains over 11 million tokens that are annotated with parts-of-speech tags and lemmatized. We provide 14 different sub-lexicons in total, covering individual intended reading ages, age groups, as well as different genres. We also provide versions with additional morphological information, such as the cases and tenses of words. TCBLex provides various psycholinguistically interesting lexical statistics for both word types and lemmas, such as different frequency metrics, distributions, word lengths, numbers of syllables, morphological paradigm sizes, and for the first time in a Finnish lexicon, ages when words and lemmas are first encountered in books. TCBLex is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15655580 .",

          "authors": "İrem Yılmaz-Özdemir, Tim Wildschut, Constantine Sedikides, Erich W. Graf",
          "abstract": "We developed a new nostalgia induction using virtual reality. We compared this virtual reality task (VRT) with the established event reflection task (ERT) in terms of intensity of felt nostalgia and strength of psychological benefits produced by each induction method (Experiment 1) and the durability of these effects over time (Experiment 2). Offering initial validation for the VRT, Experiment 1 revealed that felt nostalgia and psychological benefits were higher in the nostalgia condition than in the control condition, irrespective of the induction method. In Experiment 2, we improved the VRT and measured felt nostalgia and psychological benefits at five time points, separated by 5-min intervals. The augmented VRT produced significantly stronger effects on felt nostalgia than did the ERT, and it retained this advantage over time. Compared to the ERT, the VRT did not produce significantly stronger effects on psychological benefits. Instead, psychological benefits were higher in the nostalgia than control condition at each time point except the final one, irrespective of induction method. Virtual reality environments can induce vivid, durable feelings of nostalgia and ensuing psychological benefits.",

          "authors": "Holger Mitterer",
          "abstract": "The study of language processing requires data from a wide range of languages but also data that are free from demand characteristics and meta-linguistic strategies. While eye-tracking has been successfully used to address the later issue, pragmatically, eye-tracking is often difficult to achieve with less well-studied languages. Therefore, the current paper presents a web-based mouse-tracking task that generates data that seem to reflect early perceptual processes similar to eye-tracking but which can be performed remotely. The task uses a set-up similar to early video games to entice participants to use language input as early as possible. The data presented here replicate an earlier eye-tracking study focusing on how reduced words are recognized. Fillers from the same study are also used, which show that the paradigm also reflects predictive semantic processing. It is concluded that the paradigm can be used to investigate lexical access, prosodic processing, and predictive semantic processing.",

          "title": "A tutorial on Bayesian hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients using the BFpack-module in JASP",
          "authors": "Joris Mulder, Julius Pfadt, Eric-Jan Wagenmakers",
          "abstract": "Correlation coefficients play a central role in scientific research to quantify the (linear) association between certain key variables of interest. Currently, hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, such as whether a correlation equals zero or whether two correlations are equal, is mainly done using classical p  values, despite their known limitations. An important cause of this problem is the limited availability of statistical software that supports alternative, Bayesian testing procedures. To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product–moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Partial correlations can be tested by controlling for certain covariates. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm, which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the research community.",

          "abstract": "What is worse—torturing an animal or killing it? What about humans? In three studies ( n = 472), torturing animals was perceived as worse than killing, but this was significantly reduced or reversed for humans. This was partially explained by mind-perception (agency or experience), and also by an aversion to the loss of human lives over and above this (speciesism). Study 1 provided evidence that the moral wrongness of torturing a hypothetical animal was worse than killing, but killing was worse for human targets. Study 2 partially replicated and extended these results across different species. Ratings were predicted by mind perception, and speciesist preference to avoid human death. Study 3 used pairs of species, separating torture and killing judgments, showing that while speciesism is important for explaining the greater weight people place on human lives, it played a smaller role in judgments about suffering after accounting for mind-perception.",

          "abstract": "The current research examines the functions of world beliefs in the context of observed social support interactions between romantic partners and their implications for affective experience and psychological well-being. Both members of romantic couples ( N = 235 couples) discussed personal problems while being recorded. When listening to their partner’s problems, participants who saw the world as Enticing (i.e., full of rewards and worth exploring) were more responsive to their partner’s bids for support. When discussing their problems, participants who saw the world as generally Good and Enticing perceived that their partner was more supportive, which predicted more positive mood at the end of the conversation and greater well-being a year later. These results provide novel evidence for behavioral and interpretive functions of world beliefs in the context of social support interactions and suggest that world beliefs may influence affective experience and well-being through their impact on support perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Social interaction bolsters well-being and relatedness. However, less is known about costs of social interaction, such as loss of autonomy. Here, we test a potential autonomy–relatedness tradeoff. College student participants completed experience sampling method self-reports ( N = 352, 10,046 observations) of their social interactions, feelings of social connectedness, autonomy, and positive affect in the past hour. Participants reported lower autonomy when socially interacting compared with being alone. This was especially true for people with higher levels of attachment avoidance. Crucially, interaction partner matters: Compared with being alone, people report lower autonomy when interacting with non-close others, similar levels of autonomy when interacting with friends and family, and higher autonomy when interacting with romantic partners. These findings provide ecologically valid evidence for an autonomy–relatedness tradeoff during social interactions with non-close others but show that interactions with romantic partners uniquely fulfill both autonomy and relatedness needs.",

          "abstract": "Prior research suggests a positive association between some religious/spiritual variables and well-being. However, many measures of religious/spiritual constructs are often within explicitly religious contexts, limiting the conceptualization of links between spiritual connection and well-being among nonreligious individuals. The present study employs a novel, versatile measure assessing how frequently individuals feel connected to a religion or form of spirituality. Using nationally representative 2021 Gallup World Poll data from 121 countries ( N = 125,843), we describe the distribution of religious/spiritual connection and examine its associations with subjective well-being among religious and nonreligious individuals. A majority of individuals worldwide—including many who are nonreligious—reported “often/always” feeling religious/spiritual connection. Adjusting for relevant covariates, religious/spiritual connection associated positively with subjective well-being in the global sample of religious individuals and, in some countries, nonreligious individuals (effect sizes were mostly small). Cross-national variation points to the complex role of religious/spiritual connection in shaping subjective well-being globally.",

          "abstract": "Mnemonic devices paired with a musical melody have long been used as memory aids. Although this perceived phenomenon has been recognized in previous studies, research is mixed on the effectiveness of utilizing music to improve learning and memory. In this study, we tested the effects of unfamiliar and familiar melodies on the memorization of unrelated word lists compared with a spoken control condition. Participants heard word lists with two-syllable words of mixed positive, negative, and neutral valence either spoken, sung to a familiar melody (e.g. Yankee Doodle ), or sung to an unfamiliar melody. After hearing each list, they were asked to freely recall the words in any order and were then asked to complete an old–new recognition task. In two experiments, we found spoken text to outperform (Experiment 1 recall and recognition, Experiment 2 recognition) or equal (Experiment 2 recall) the various sung text conditions. These results indicate that regardless of familiarity, melodies may be more distracting on initial presentation, due to working memory capacity limits. Our results thus suggest that at least for short-term recall of unrelated word lists, the colloquial belief of music aiding memory does not hold true.",

A better understanding of musicians’ health literacy can help educators, health professionals, organisations and relevant specialists address the needs of musicians more specifically. The aim was to assess scale reliability and model fit of the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) on a sample of UK-based musicians. We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the model and calculated Cronbach’s alpha scores for internal consistency and mean scores for the nine scales. Demographic information was obtained from 471 respondents aged 19–78 years ( M = 34, SD = 14). Subsequent to some slight amendments, a modified 8-factor model showed an improved and acceptable fit. This is the first study to investigate musicians’ health literacy using an already existing tool.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether groove could enhance motor control when playing multi-limb rhythmic patterns on the drum set. In a within-subjects experimental design, 20 collegiate music majors performed rhythms using the left hand/snare drum and right foot/bass drum on an electronic drum set in three conditions: Isochronous Mmetronome, High-groove, and Low-groove accompaniments—which were 16 beat excerpts of popular songs drawn from an empirically-derived list ranked according to “grooviness.” The rhythms were performed with each accompaniment with Foot, Hand, and Foot and Hand together. Participants also rated their familiarity, enjoyment, perceptions of grooviness, and degree to which they felt “in the groove” after playing with each accompaniment. Analyses revealed that performance accuracy varied as a function of groove condition and effector condition, such that (a) Hand-only and Hand and Foot trials were very close to synchrony, whereas Foot-only trials were early, and (b) High-Groove and Metronome trials were close to the beat, whereas Low-Groove trials were late.
