          "title": "Identifying Careless Survey Respondents Through Machine Learning Using Responses to a Gibberish Scale",
          "authors": "Leah Bloy, Yehezkel Resheff, Avraham Kluger, Nechumi Malovicki-Yaffe",
          "abstract": "Invalid responses pose a significant risk of distorting survey data, compromising statistical inferences, and introducing errors in conclusions drawn from surveys. Given the pivotal role of surveys in research, development, and decision-making, it is imperative to identify careless survey respondents. The existing literature on this subject comprises two primary categories of approaches: methods that rely on survey items and methods involving post hoc analyses. The latter, which does not demand preemptive preparation, predominantly incorporates statistical techniques or metadata analysis aimed at identifying distinct response patterns that are associated with careless responses. However, several inherent limitations limit the precise identification of careless respondents. One notable challenge is the lack of consensus concerning the thresholds to use for the various measures. Furthermore, each method is designed to detect a specific response pattern associated with carelessness, leading to conflicting outcomes. In this article, we seek to assess the efficacy of the existing methods using a novel survey methodology encompassing responses to both meaningful and meaningless gibberish scales in which the latter compels respondents to answer without considering item content. Using this approach, we propose the application of machine learning to identify careless survey respondents. Our findings underscore the efficacy of a methodology using supervised machine learning combined with unique gibberish data as a potent method for the identification of careless respondents, aligning with and outperforming other approaches in terms of effectiveness and versatility.",

          "title": "Building a construct-valid battery of performance and self-report indicators of sustained attention consistency",
          "authors": "Matthew S. Welhaf, Matt E. Meier, Michael J. Kane",
          "abstract": "Previous work has argued that the ability to sustain attention consistency can be best modeled as the individual-difference covariation in objective performance-based measures (e.g., reaction-time [RT] variability; accuracy) and self-report measures of task-unrelated thought (TUT). Latent variable studies demonstrate that a general, higher-order attention consistency factor correlates more strongly with nomological network constructs than do either lower-order, measurement-specific factors. The present study aimed to replicate and extend this measurement approach by building a construct-valid battery of sustained attention consistency tasks and testing associations with the conative factors of task interest and success motivation. We analyzed data from 402 subjects who completed a battery of seven attention-consistency functions and found that the hierarchical model provided an adequate fit to the data. Further, attention-consistency associations with motivation and interest, while evident with the lower-order factors, were again stronger with the general higher-order factor (and each conative factor predicted unique variance in general attention consistency in structural regression models). We also refined our task battery by removing poor-performing indicators and demonstrated similar patterns of correlations among the attention and conative factors. We suggest that studies examining attention consistency should use a combination of performance and self-report indicators to capture its individual-differences variation in the most construct valid way. We finally provide recommendations on which tasks and measures might be most useful when measuring sustained attention consistency in future research.",

          "authors": "Dirk U. Wulff, Pascal J. Kieslich, Felix Henninger, Jonas M. B. Haslbeck, Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck",
          "abstract": "Movement tracking is a novel process-tracing method that promises unique access to the temporal dynamics of psychological processes. The method involves high-resolution tracking of a hand or handheld device (e.g., a computer mouse) while it is used to make a choice. In contrast to other process-tracing methods, which mostly focus on information acquisition, movement tracking focuses on the processes of information integration and preference formation. In this article, we present a tutorial on movement tracking of psychological processes with the mousetrap R package. We address all steps of the research process, from design to interpretation, with a particular focus on data processing and analysis and featuring both established and novel approaches. Using a representative working example, we demonstrate how the various steps of movement-tracking analysis can be implemented with mousetrap and provide thorough explanations of their theoretical background and interpretation. Finally, we present a list of recommendations to assist researchers in addressing their own research questions using movement tracking of psychological processes.",

          "authors": "Holger Mitterer",
          "abstract": "The study of language processing requires data from a wide range of languages but also data that are free from demand characteristics and meta-linguistic strategies. While eye-tracking has been successfully used to address the later issue, pragmatically, eye-tracking is often difficult to achieve with less well-studied languages. Therefore, the current paper presents a web-based mouse-tracking task that generates data that seem to reflect early perceptual processes similar to eye-tracking but which can be performed remotely. The task uses a set-up similar to early video games to entice participants to use language input as early as possible. The data presented here replicate an earlier eye-tracking study focusing on how reduced words are recognized. Fillers from the same study are also used, which show that the paradigm also reflects predictive semantic processing. It is concluded that the paradigm can be used to investigate lexical access, prosodic processing, and predictive semantic processing.",

          "title": "A tutorial on Bayesian hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients using the BFpack-module in JASP",
          "authors": "Joris Mulder, Julius Pfadt, Eric-Jan Wagenmakers",
          "abstract": "Correlation coefficients play a central role in scientific research to quantify the (linear) association between certain key variables of interest. Currently, hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, such as whether a correlation equals zero or whether two correlations are equal, is mainly done using classical p  values, despite their known limitations. An important cause of this problem is the limited availability of statistical software that supports alternative, Bayesian testing procedures. To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product–moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Partial correlations can be tested by controlling for certain covariates. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm, which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the research community.",
