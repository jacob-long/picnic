          "abstract": "Cross-cultural studies are crucial for investigating the cultural variability and universality of cognitive developmental processes. However, cross-cultural assessment tools in cognition across languages and communities are limited. In this article, we describe a gaze-following task designed to measure basic social cognition across individuals, ages, and communities (the Task for Assessing iNdividual differences in Gaze understanding-Open-Cross-Cultural; TANGO-CC). The task was developed and psychometrically assessed in one cultural setting and, with input of local collaborators, adapted for cross-cultural data collection. Minimal language demands and the web-app implementation allow fast and easy contextual adaptations to each community. TANGO-CC captures individual- and community-level variation and shows good internal consistency in a data set of 2.5- to 11-year-old children from 17 diverse communities. Within-communities variation outweighed between-communities variation. We provide an open-source website for researchers to customize and use the task ( https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/tango-cc ). TANGO-CC can be used to assess basic social cognition in diverse communities and provides a roadmap for researching community-level and individual-level differences across cultures.",

          "abstract": "The use of ecological-momentary-assessment (EMA) data to study individuals in their everyday lives is popular in many areas of social and life sciences. At the same time, EMA data sets are complex, the psychometric properties of EMA items are often not investigated systematically, and scales are often neither standardized nor validated beyond their face validity. Here, we present different descriptive statistics and data-visualization techniques to increase the understanding of the performance of EMA items. We apply these techniques to a wide range of items used in a large EMA data set (599 participants, 360 time points) collected in the WARN-D study to investigate their distributions, contextual influences, change over time, sources of variability, and relationship with classical static measures of psychopathology. We discuss the theoretical and substantive implications of our findings and provide researchers with R code that they can adapt to their own EMA data, as well as literature recommendations for each topic. We hope to inspire more researchers to share in-depth descriptive summaries of their experience-sampling data such that the field can move forward in understanding the performance of EMA measures across contexts.",

          "title": "Research With the Reluctant: Challenges and Strategies",
          "authors": "E. B. Gross, Susan A. Gelman",
          "abstract": "Although psychological research often relies on convenience samples, the most informative participants may be individuals who are reluctant to engage because of vulnerability, mistrust of the research process, and/or disagreement with a study’s goals. Although this concern is particularly urgent for certain research questions, it is relevant for all researchers because relying solely on easy-to-reach participants limits a study’s validity and generalizability and may substantially hollow out or even render unanswerable some research questions. We review a number of challenges for conducting research with “reluctant but informative” participants and strategies to meet and overcome these challenges. We argue that engaging reluctant participants requires attention at every phase of the research process, including study design and planning, participant recruitment and testing, data analysis and interpretation, and reporting and broader impacts. We also illustrate with our own recent experiences conducting research on children’s gender concepts in rural, conservative U.S. communities that expressed skepticism about the value of this research. Although every study is different, notable across all projects are the need to respect both individual participants and their communities and to balance competing desiderata. Finally, we discuss the importance of transparency around sample composition and constraints to generalizability and the potential utility of collaborative research both across research institutions and between researchers and participant communities.",

          "abstract": "Interaction effects are very common in the psychological literature. However, interaction effects are typically very small and often fail to replicate. In this study, we conducted a simulation comparing the generalizability and estimability of two linear regression models: one correctly specified to account for interaction effects and one misspecified including simple effects only. We manipulated noise levels, predictor variable correlations, and different sets of regression weights, resulting in 9216 different conditions. From each dataset, we drew 1000 samples of N = 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000, resulting in a total of 55,296,000 analyses for each model. Our results show that misspecification can drastically bias regression estimates, sometimes leading to zero or reversed simple effects. Furthermore, we found that when models are generalized to the entire population, the difference between the explained variance in the sample and in the population is often smaller for the misspecified model than for the correctly specified model. However, the comparison between models shows that the correctly specified model explains the data at the population level better overall. These results emphasize the importance of theory in modeling choices and show that it is important to provide a rationale for why interactions are included or excluded in an analysis.",

In Studies 1 and 2, American national and White racial collective narcissism was positively associated with support for state repression of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, antiegalitarianism, and legitimization of racial inequality. Black racial collective narcissism was negatively associated with the same variables. In Studies 3 and 4, American national and White racial collective narcissism was positively associated with antiegalitarianism, support for the alt-right movement, and opposition to policies to advance racial minorities. Latinx racial collective narcissism was negatively associated with the same variables. In sum, in the US, national collective narcissism among Whites and racial minorities and White racial collective narcissism hinder the pursuit of racial equality. However, Black and Latinx racial collective narcissism is associated with pursuit of racial equality.",

          "abstract": "Research conducted in the United States shows that White Americans form more positive impressions of White than Black interaction partners through instrumental learning. We asked whether this pattern generalizes to the cultural context of the Netherlands, which differs in norms for expressing intergroup bias. In three preregistered studies ( Ns = 66, 83, 80), White Dutch participants played a money-sharing game, based on a reward reinforcement task, with White and Moroccan partners. Although players shared at different rates, average sharing rates for White and Moroccan players were equated. Unexpectedly, and despite anti-Moroccan explicit and implicit attitudes, participants displayed a pro-Moroccan choice preference across studies. Nevertheless, computational modeling indicated the same learning effects of ethnicity as in past research: ethnicity biased initial reward expectations, and these were updated via group-specific learning rates. We discuss potential explanations for this unexpected pattern and broader implications for cross-cultural research on intergroup social cognition.",

          "authors": "Olivia A. Foster-Gimbel, L. Taylor Phillips",
          "abstract": "Psychological discomfort can motivate, demotivate, or even backfire upon efforts to encourage allyship. We consider the intensity of such discomfort to test curvilinear relationships between psychological discomfort and Whites’ engagement in equity efforts. Across four pre-registered studies ( N = 4,563), we find support for our curvilinear model. First, we explore the relationship between collective discomfort and allyship intentions. While we find that collective discomfort is linearly associated with greater allyship, we find little evidence of diminishing returns. Second, we find a curvilinear relationship between collective discomfort and defensive reactions: Both low and high discomfort was associated with increasing defensive reactions to evidence of racial inequity (victimhood claiming, stigma reversal) than moderate discomfort. Thus, we provide empirical support for the idea that dominant group members who experience high (vs. moderate) discomfort in the face of social inequality may be less likely to support equity. We offer insights on how to manage this issue",

          "abstract": "Personality-development research is flourishing. Here, we extend these efforts horizontally (new constructs) and vertically (new levels within the same construct) by charting out age-graded differences in Schwarz’s human values across 80,814 individuals. Conducting a systematic investigation of cross-sectional age-graded differences in human values—from late teenage years to post-retirement—featuring 36 analytical model choices and 180,000 simulation-based decisions, our analyses replicate some earlier findings (e.g., increasing self- and growth-focus during adolescence and increasing security concerns during adulthood), while also highlighting complex and previously unappreciated dynamics. As such, while it is a common practice to aggregate specific values into parsimonious higher-order concepts to ease interpretation, this may risk overlooking meaningful trends in lower-order value development. Specifically, revealing unique and asynchronous patterns for value nuances, we find that aggregation (a) leads to a loss of critical information, (b) creates conflicting results when nuances diverge, and (c) significantly reduces predictive power.",

A qualitative approach was used to identify locally relevant topics and variables in an understudied African context. Fifty 18- to 25-year-old Ovambo Namibians from rural and urban areas were interviewed. Results of reflexive thematic analysis suggest the significance of gender and birth order in defining adult roles and the completion of one’s education as a new rite of passage. Full adult personhood means providing for and engaging with a larger community as well as one’s children and extended family, reflecting the ongoing relevance of African communalism in today’s society. Youth in Namibia, and likely in sub-Saharan Africa more broadly, balance traditional and contemporary demands as they come of age in a postindependence, globalizing society. Our findings reflect the centrality of community and the intermingled nature of agentic and communal values in this process.",

          "abstract": "Engaging in music practice is often assumed to increase empathy and prosociality. However, data in support of this relationship are limited, leaving unclear which components of empathy (cognitive empathy, emotional contagion, and emotional disconnection) and prosocial behaviors, if any, would be affected. Here, we recruited musicians with more than 2 years of musical experience ( n = 80) and nonmusicians ( n = 89) to measure empathy (using subjective and objective measures) and prosociality (using economic games). We hypothesized that musicians would score higher than nonmusicians on empathy and prosociality, and that musicians who practice more would show greater effects. Using classical and Bayesian analyses of variance (ANOVAs), we found no difference between musicians and nonmusicians in empathy and prosociality, and no correlation with the amount of practice. Exploratory analyses revealed associations between the age of onset of music practice and empathy, suggesting that it is not music practice per se but specifically its initiation in early life that could be linked to empathy. These findings challenge the common assumption that music practice in general increases empathy and prosociality and invites to explore in which specific contexts music practice does so (e.g., particular age ranges or group-based settings).",
