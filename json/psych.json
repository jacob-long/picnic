          "title": "A Guide to Causal Inference in Life-Event Studies",
          "authors": "Mario Lawes, Stephen G. West, Michael Eid",
          "abstract": "There is considerable interest in studying the impact of major life events (e.g., marriage, job loss) on people’s lives. This line of research is inherently causal: Its goal is to study whether life events cause changes in the examined outcomes. However, because major life events cannot be randomly assigned, studies in this area necessarily rely on longitudinal observational data. In this article, we provide guidelines for researchers interested in studying life events in an explicitly causal framework. Although focused on life-event studies for substantive context, many recommendations also apply to longitudinal observational studies more broadly. We begin by emphasizing the importance of clearly specifying the causal estimand and describe conditions in which the defined causal estimand can be identified. Then, we discuss the features and challenges of the two main analytical approaches to causal inference in life-event studies: difference-in-difference designs with a (matched) comparison group that attempt to separate event-related changes from normative changes and within-person designs that control for all time-invariant person-level confounders. We describe how the desired causal effect can be estimated in these designs and provide recommendations for when to apply each modeling strategy. In addition, we present methods for conducting sensitivity analysis, probing the robustness of the estimated causal effects, and evaluating the generalizability of the results. We conclude by describing how new specialized panel studies can be designed to examine the impact of various life events in more controlled settings.",

          "authors": "Ulrich Schroeders, Timo Gnambs",
          "abstract": "Although item-response-theory (IRT) models offer well-established psychometric advantages over traditional scoring methods, they remain underused in practice. Following a brief introduction to the IRT framework, we emphasize its major advantages and explore potential applications in various research areas. The main part of this tutorial provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to Monte Carlo simulation-based sample-size estimation in IRT, which is essential for obtaining precise estimates of item and person parameters, structural effects, and model fit. Accurate a priori sample-size estimation is also crucial for effective study planning, especially in preregistration and registered reports. We highlight 10 key decisions, organized into four areas: (a) determining the data-generation model, (b) defining the test design and the process of missing values, (c) selecting the IRT model and parameters of interest, and (d) setting up and running the Monte Carlo simulation. The procedure is illustrated with examples from educational, personality, and clinical psychology. An extensively annotated and easily customizable syntax is available in an online repository.",

          "abstract": "In response to the replication and confidence crisis across various empirical disciplines, ensuring the validity of research has gained attention. High validity is crucial for obtaining replicable and robust study outcomes when both exploring new questions and replicating previous findings. In this study, we aimed to address this issue by developing a comprehensive checklist to assist researchers in enhancing and monitoring the validity of their research. After systematically analyzing previous findings on validity, a comprehensive list of potential checklist items was compiled. Over the course of three rounds, more than 30 interdisciplinary and psychological-science experts participated in a Delphi study. Experts rated items on their importance and were given the opportunity to propose novel items as well as improve existing ones. This process resulted in a final set of 91 items, organized according to common stages of a research project. The VALID checklist is accessible online ( https://www.validchecklist.com/ ) and provides researchers with an adaptable, versatile tool to monitor and improve the validity of their research and to suit their specific needs. By focusing on adaptiveness during its development, VALID encompasses 331 unique checklist versions, making it a one-stop solution suitable for a wide range of projects, designs, and requirements.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup meta-attitude inaccuracy—the extent to which perceptions of outgroup views towards the ingroup diverge from what outgroup members actually think—fuels intergroup hostility, yet research on its precursors is scarce. Through four correlational studies, we examined whether and how intergroup contact predicts meta-attitude (in)accuracy in three conflict contexts: Black–White British in the United Kingdom (UK), Turks–Kurds in Turkey, and Catholics–Protestants in Northern Ireland. Regardless of context or status, all groups perceived themselves to be evaluated more negatively by the outgroup than they really were. Positive contact predicted increased meta-attitude accuracy (through increased shared reality) which was, in turn, associated with more positive outgroup attitudes. The role of negative contact and affective mediators (such as intergroup anxiety and fear) was not consistent and depended on group and context. The use of positive intergroup contact as a potential rectifier of overestimated negative meta-attitudes in conflict contexts is discussed.",

          "abstract": "Life satisfaction has been shown to change over time, but we know little about how people perceive those changes. In preregistered analyses, the current research investigated the degree of correspondence between people’s retrospective perceptions of life satisfaction change and their measured life satisfaction change (Sample A analytic N = 359; Sample B analytic N = 336). On average, retrospective perceptions of change were moderately correlated with measured change ( r = .20–.25). When evaluating their life satisfaction change, participants reported that they focused more on the present compared to the past, considered their life circumstances more than their feelings, and engaged in careful consideration more than relying on gut instinct. Findings suggest people have some insight into changes in their life satisfaction. Consistent with the individual differences in evaluating life satisfaction (IDELS) model, people engaged in a variety of evaluation strategies and differed from one another in the degree to which they used each strategy.",

          "abstract": "Dignity is prominently endorsed in health care, organizations, and law. However, humanities research casts doubt over the utility of this concept, disputing that “dignity” captures any unique ethical value distinguishable from “respect”. Here, we test a recent proposal that dignity entails special regard for humiliation. We created a set of vignettes describing a “perpetrator” making offensive remarks or gestures to a “victim”, and asked lay participants to rate how well each offense corresponds to a dignity violation as opposed to a respect violation. We manipulated the victims’ resulting emotions within-subject, across “humiliation”, “anger”, and “baseline” conditions, while controlling for other factors (e.g., victim’s gender, vulnerability). We found substantial evidence (BF = 4.11) for our preregistered hypothesis that humiliation increased dignity-relatedness ratings as compared with the baseline condition, and very strong evidence when compared with the anger condition (BF = 84.75). These findings provide empirical backing to dignitarian ethics with applications in health care, organizations, and law.",

          "abstract": "The probability of cross-class contact between individuals from different social classes is significantly lower than that of random chance contact. However, it remains unclear whether individuals from lower or higher social classes are more reluctant to engage in cross-class contact. This study found that individuals with a lower subjective social class (SSC) were less willing to engage in cross-class contact than those with a higher SSC (Studies 1–2). This disparity in willingness persists even after controlling for expression bias and can be explained by negative contact expectations (Study 3). By manipulating negative contact expectations, a substantial increase in willingness to engage in such interactions can be achieved (Study 4). By focusing on the relationship between SSC and willingness for cross-class contact, this study has profound implications for enhancing intergroup interactions and assisting individuals with a low SSC in overcoming social challenges.",

          "abstract": "Intelligence is known to predict survival, but it remains unclear whether cognitive abilities differ in their relationship to survival in old age. We analyzed longitudinal data of 516 healthy adults (age: M = 84.92 years, SD = 8.66 years at Wave 1) from the Berlin Aging Study (Germany) on nine tasks of perceptual speed, episodic memory, verbal fluency, and verbal knowledge, and a general composite intelligence score. There were eight waves, with up to 18 years of follow-up; all participants were deceased by the time of analysis. We used a joint multivariate longitudinal survival model to estimate the unique contribution of each cognitive ability in terms of true (i.e., error-free) current value and current rate of change when predicting survival. Additional survival covariates included age at first occasion, sex, sociobiographical status, and suspected dementia. Only the two verbal-fluency measures were uniquely predictive of mortality risk. Thus, verbal fluency showed more salient associations with mortality risk than did measures of perceptual speed, episodic memory, and verbal knowledge.",
