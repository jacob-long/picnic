          "authors": "Farid Anvari, Taym Alsalti, Lorenz A. Oehler, Zach Marion, Ian Hussey, Malte Elson, Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "We examined the extent to which constructs and measures have proliferated in psychological science. We integrated two large databases obtained from the American Psychology Association that have been used to keep track of constructs, measures, and research in the psychological-science literature for the past 30 years. In our descriptive analyses, we found that (a) thousands of new constructs and measures are published each year, (b) most measures are used very few times, and (c) there is no trend toward consensus or standardization in the use of constructs and measures; in fact, there is a trend toward even greater fragmentation over time. That is, constructs and measures are proliferating. We conclude that measurement in the psychological-science literature is fragmented, creating problems such as redundancy and confusion and stifling cumulative scientific progress. We conclude by providing suggestions for what researchers can do about this problem.",

          "authors": "Louis Schiekiera, Kristina Eichel, Felicitas Heßelmann, Jacqueline Sachse, Sophie P. Müller, Helen Niemeyer",
          "abstract": "Review studies suggest that results that are statistically significant or consistent with hypotheses are preferred in the publication process and in reception. The mechanisms underlying this bias remain unclear, and prior research has focused on between-subjects rather than within-subjects designs. We conducted a within-subjects study, grounded in dual-process decision-making theories, to examine these dynamics. Across four online experiments, 303 clinical-psychology researchers evaluated 16 fictitious abstracts varying in statistical significance and hypothesis consistency. Participants provided fast, intuitive judgments about each abstract’s likelihood of being submitted, read, or cited, rated their feeling of rightness (FOR), and gave deliberated evaluations. We analyzed the data using multilevel and mediation models. Researchers rated statistically nonsignificant abstracts as less likely to be submitted, read, or cited compared with significant ones. No such bias was found for hypothesis-inconsistent results. Intuitive judgments were rarely revised, and FOR did not predict response changes. Overall, researchers favored statistically significant results, with deliberation and FOR playing minimal roles.",

          "authors": "Renata Sadibolova, Devin B. Terhune",
          "abstract": "Optional stopping refers to the practice of repeatedly performing a statistical analysis on a dataset as new data are collected until a pre-specified decision criterion is reached. This procedure is often adopted because of its effectiveness in optimizing data collection. Discussions of optional stopping to date have primarily centred around statistical issues, with relatively little consideration of any methodological implications of this procedure. Building on recent work drawing attention to methodological biases arising from the use of optional stopping, we highlight experimenter awareness of the current evidence state during data collection ( experimenter evidence unmasking ) as a salient methodological confound of optional stopping. We argue that experimenter evidence unmasking has the potential to influence an experimenter to implicitly or explicitly modify their behaviour in ways that can reduce the internal validity of an experiment. We conclude by offering recommendations for circumventing this confound and for the transparent reporting of experimenter evidence masking procedures.",

          "abstract": "Research into dyadic social interactions has expanded significantly, enabling a deeper understanding of the dynamic processes underlying interpersonal communication. As the use of larger datasets becomes increasingly common in this field, the need for scalable and efficient analytical tools has grown. Automated coding methods, such as those provided by OpenPose, an open-source software for detecting and tracking human motion, offer significant advantages for analysing the movement of two individuals during an interaction. However, the processing and analysis of large quantities of JSON output files generated by OpenPose remain a considerable challenge. To address this, we introduce duet , an R package designed to streamline the processing and analysis of OpenPose output data, particularly in the context of dyadic interactions. The package provides a suite of functions for data cleaning, interpolation, kinematic analysis, and visualisation, offering researchers a comprehensive and user-friendly workflow. By simplifying the handling of OpenPose data, duet aims to facilitate large-scale, automated analysis of dyadic social interactions, with minimal coding experience, thereby advancing methodological capabilities in social and behavioural sciences.",

          "authors": "Oliver Grenke, Stefan Scherbaum, Martin Schoemann",
          "abstract": "Process tracing and process modeling are the two primary behavioral approaches for uncovering human decision-making processes. However, both approaches face significant limitations: process tracing offers a large and oftentimes confusing number of measures, while process modeling relies on a minimal number of comparable trials for reliable model fitting. In our study, we explore how we can combine mouse cursor tracking and the drift diffusion model (DDM) in order to both reduce the number of cursor measures and circumvent the minimal trial amount requirements of DDM fitting. One hundred three participants completed 90 trials in a random dot kinematogram (RDK). A total of 18 cursor measures were taken from the mouse cursor tracking literature and used to predict drift rate, threshold separation, and non-decision time of the DDM via partial least squares regression. Four cursor measures contributed significantly to the prediction of the DDM parameters. When reducing the available trials, these cursor measures, in combination with response time and accuracy, performed better and remained more stable in the prediction of DDM parameters than model fitting. Our results lower the barrier for applying mouse cursor tracking for novice researchers by highlighting important cursor measures and their mapping to psychological constructs of decision-making, while also offering an approach for behavioral scientists to investigate DDM components in experimental setups with a restricted number of trials.",

          "abstract": "Peers are assumed to be crucial in shaping adolescents’ attitudes and behaviors in schools; what peers yield social influence over adolescents is less clear. We disentangled two mechanisms of peer influence: friendship influence and normative pressure. Friendship influence refers to the impact of friends’ attitudes and behaviors, while normative pressure stems from the influence of peers from the same social group, such as gender group. We adopted a network perspective, recognizing that peer influence can be shaped by changing relationships among peers. We investigated friendship influence and normative pressure based on sharing the same gender and ethnicity in shaping academic drive, prejudice, and religiosity. We analyzed a sample of German school grades ( N = 2,838; 29 school grades) using stochastic actor-oriented modeling. Adolescents influenced each other via both friendship influence and normative pressure. These findings improve our understanding of who influences whom in schools and open new research avenues.",

          "abstract": "Previous research attributes differences in working styles (e.g., diligence, excessive hours) primarily to individual traits or values, such as workaholism, neglecting cultural context. This research introduces cultural work ideals—subjective perceptions of societal expectations about work—and distinguishes between perceived cultural values of (a) hard work (i.e., efficiency, high quality, wise time use) and (b) excessive work (i.e., long hours, high quantity, constant work prioritization). We develop and validate the I ndividual Perceptions of C ultural H ard and E xcessive W ork (I-CHEW) Scale across six diverse North American samples ( N = 1,902), including full-time employees, business undergraduates, MBA students, and alumni. Psychometric analyses support the I-CHEW’s reliability and validity. As hypothesized, perceiving a cultural ideal of hard work predicts beneficial outcomes (e.g., lower cynicism, higher engagement) beyond individual, organizational, and cultural factors. Conversely, perceiving a cultural ideal of excessive work predicts negative outcomes, including greater emotional exhaustion, reduced well-being and job satisfaction, and poorer physical health.",

          "abstract": "In spontaneous trait transference (STT), communicators describing the behavior of others (i.e., actors) are perceived as having the personality traits implied by the behavior they describe. We tested whether this effect relies on moderators that are indicative of rule-based, attributional processes: the communicator-actor relation (friends vs. enemies; Experiment 1), the diagnosticity of the statement for inferring the implied trait to the communicator (Experiment 2), and the validity of the statement (i.e., whether it was actually provided by the communicator; Experiment 3). In line with attributional theories, trait ratings revealed a joint impact of the three moderators. Experiment 4 showed that communicators were attributed alternative traits—not implied by the behavior itself, but by the fact that they described the behavior. Together, our results suggest that participants attribute traits to the communicator based on the communicator’s behavior (i.e., the act of describing the behavior of someone else).",

In contrast, we demonstrate that increasing the number of arguments in a message can have conflicting effects on perceptions of the message source. Compared to using few arguments, using many arguments makes the source seem more like an expert, increasing persuasion, but it can also make the source appear to have greater persuasive intent, decreasing persuasion. These perceptions suppress each other, resulting in minimal or no overall benefit to persuasion. We document these effects across multiple experiments. We further demonstrate that providing many arguments can have a clear positive or negative effect, depending on whether high expertise or low persuasive intent is more valued. These findings expand our understanding of argument quantity effects in persuasion and contribute to a growing literature on conflicting source perceptions.",

We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample ( N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

          "abstract": "In this review, we mapped the existing academic literature on facilitation factors in community-based, non-professional adult singing groups who gather for fun and well-being. Group singing is an effective community-based intervention offering participants therapeutic benefits. Social prescription to group singing is gaining popularity however little is known about those people who undertake the facilitation role. This review was conducted in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Nineteen articles published across 14 peer reviewed journals and six countries since 2014 were included in the review. Results have been presented in a descriptive manner, supported by tables and Supplementary Material. A gap in role definition was established from the available literature.
