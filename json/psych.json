          "abstract": "The Item Response Warehouse (IRW) is a collection and standardization of a large volume of item response datasets in a free and open-source platform for researchers. We describe key elements of the data standardization process and provide a brief description of the over 900 datasets in the current iteration of the IRW (version 28.2). We describe how to access the data through both the website and an API, and offer a brief tutorial with example R code illustrating how to download data from the IRW and use it in standard psychometric analyses. While we are continuing to develop the IRW, this presentation may help researchers utilize data from this resource for work in psychometrics and related fields.",

          "authors": "Jana Holtmann, Kenneth Koslowski",
          "abstract": "The study of time-dependent within-person dynamics has gained popularity in recent years through the use of multilevel (latent) time-series models. However, due to the complexity of the models, model applications are usually limited with respect to the inclusion of time-varying moderating factors on the longitudinal within-person relations between variables. That is, in common applications of multilevel time-series models, the within-person dynamics of constructs over time are regarded as being insensitive to changes in other time-varying factors or changes in contexts. We illustrate an extension of multilevel latent time-series models that incorporate latent interaction effects at the dynamic within-person level. We build on previous work that incorporated time-varying observed or latent moderator variables for the dynamic parameters in vector autoregressive models and provide a tutorial for the application of the models, implemented and estimated using Bayesian estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The models are illustrated by two empirical applications that investigate the temporal dynamics of negative affect, rumination, and mindful attention. The performance of different models with varying complexity is investigated via several simulation studies to provide recommendations regarding the models’ applicability for applied researchers. Required sample sizes range between at least 25 time points for around 50 persons in the simplest fixed-effects models and at least 100 time points for at least 100 persons in random-effects factor models, depending on the expected effect sizes of the dynamic parameters.",

          "title": "A pipeline for stochastic and controlled generation of realistic language input for simulating infant language acquisition",
          "authors": "Okko Räsänen, Daniil Kocharov",
          "abstract": "Computational models of early language development involve implementing theories of learning as functional learning algorithms, exposing these models to realistic language input, and comparing learning outcomes to those in infants. While recent research has made major strides in developing more powerful learning models and evaluation protocols grounded in infant data, models are still predominantly trained with non-naturalistic input data, such as crowd-sourced read speech or text transcripts. This is due to the lack of suitable child-directed speech (CDS) corpora in terms of scale and quality. In parallel, the question of how properties and individual variability in language input affect learning outcomes is an active area of empirical research, underlining the need for realistic yet controllable data for modeling such phenomena. This paper presents a solution to the training data problem through stochastic generation of naturalistic CDS data using statistical models, thereby enabling controlled computational simulations with naturalistic input. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the approach by showing how naturalistic CDS transcripts can be generated with a language model conditioned on recipient information (here, infant age), and how text-to-speech systems can be used to convert the transcripts to high-quality speech with a controllable speaking style. We also conduct modeling experiments with generated speech corpora by varying different aspects of the data, showing how this maps into different learning outcomes, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for controlled language learning simulations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of using synthetic data in general, and of the present proof-of-concept pipeline in particular.",

          "authors": "Kaitlyn T. Harper, Brendan P. Zietsch",
          "abstract": "Assortative mating—the tendency to choose partners similar to oneself—is a ubiquitous phenomenon in mate choice. Despite numerous proposed explanations, a parsimonious mechanism has been overlooked: When individuals choose mates on the basis of heritable traits and preferences, offspring inherit a trait and the corresponding preference from each parent, creating genetic correlations that link having a trait to preferring that same trait. We evaluated this mechanism with an agent-based model simulating 100 generations in which agents, with traits and preferences each uniquely determined by 40 loci, chose reproductive partners based on preferences. Genetic correlations formed between preferences and preferred traits, as well as between partner traits (i.e., assortative mating), demonstrating that heritable variation in preferences and preferred traits is sufficient to drive assortative mating. We presented a toy model here, so we cannot speak to the robustness of such genetic correlations or to the relative explanatory power of this mechanism over others.",
