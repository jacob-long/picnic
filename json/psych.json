          "title": "With Low Power Comes Low Credibility? Toward a Principled Critique of Results From Underpowered Tests",
          "authors": "Lukas L. Lengersdorff, Claus Lamm",
          "abstract": "Researchers should be motivated to adequately power statistical tests because tests with low power have a low probability of detecting true effects. However, it is also often claimed that significant results obtained by underpowered tests are less likely to reflect a true effect. Here, we critically discuss this “low-power/low-credibility” (LPLC) critique from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Although the LPLC critique is first and foremost a critique of frequentist tests, it is itself not consistent with frequentist theory. In particular, it demands that researchers have some information on the probability that a hypothesis is true before they test it. However, such prior probabilities are dismissed as meaningless in frequentist inference, and we demonstrate that they cannot be meaningfully introduced into frequentist thinking. Even when adopting a Bayesian perspective, however, significant results from tests with low power can provide a nonnegligible amount of support for the tested hypothesis. We conclude that even though low power reduces the chances to obtain significant findings, there is little justification to dismiss already obtained significant findings on the basis of low power alone. However, concerns about low power might often reflect suspicions that findings were produced by questionable research practices. If this is the case, we suggest that communicating these issues transparently rather than using low power as a proxy concern will be more appropriate. We conclude by providing suggestions on how results from tests with low power can be critiqued for the correct reasons and in a constructive manner.",

          "abstract": "Performing high-quality research is a challenging endeavor, especially for early career researchers, in many fields of psychological science. Most research is characterized by experiential learning, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating. Although most institutions provide selected resources to help researchers with their projects, these resources are often expensive, spread out, hard to find, and difficult to compare with one another in terms of reliability, validity, usability, and practicability. A comprehensive overview of resources that are useful for researchers in psychological science is missing. To address this issue, we created ARIADNE: a living and interactive resource navigator that helps to use and search a dynamically updated database of resources ( https://igor-biodgps.github.io/ARIADNE ). In this tutorial, we aim to guide researchers through a standard research project using ARIADNE along the way. The open-access database covers a growing list of resources useful for each step of a research project, from the planning and designing of a study, over the collection and analysis of the data, to the writing and disseminating of the findings. We provide (a) a step-by-step guide on how to perform a research project (in the fields of biological psychology and neuroscience as a case example but with broad application to neighboring fields) and (b) an overview of resources that are useful at different project steps. By explicitly highlighting open-access and open-source resources, we level the playing field for researchers from underprivileged countries or institutions, thereby facilitating open, fair, and reproducible research in the psychological sciences.",

          "authors": "Eline N. F. Ensinck, Daniël Lakens",
          "abstract": "We quantified how many studies registered on the OSF up to November 2017 are performed but not shared after at least 4 years. Examining a sample of 169 registered research studies, we found that 104 (61.5%) were publicly shared. We estimate that 5,316 out of 9,172 (58%) registered studies on the OSF are publicly shared. Researchers use registries to make unpublished studies public, and the OSF policy to open registrations after a 4-year embargo substantially increases the number of studies that become known to the scientific community. In responses to emails asking researchers why studies remained unpublished, logistical issues (e.g., lack of time, researchers changing jobs) were the most common cause, followed by null results and rejections during peer review. Our exploratory study shows that a substantial amount of studies that researchers perform remain unpublished.",

          "authors": "Umberto Granziol, Maximilian Rabe, Marcello Gallucci, Andrea Spoto, Giulio Vidotto",
          "abstract": "Before conducting statistical analyses, scholars and researchers often have specific hypotheses about differences between groups of means. Their hypotheses are frequently tested by applying post hoc comparisons with statistically significant simple or interaction effects. With the exception of exploratory studies, using post hoc comparisons can increase Type I error rates and decrease statistical power. A well-known solution involves planning comparisons before the study. However, the coding of such planned comparisons can be difficult to understand and implement, especially for customized comparisons and interaction effects. In this tutorial, we aim to reduce such difficulties by examining all the possible types of planned comparisons, even the customized ones, for both main and interaction effects. In this tutorial, a Shiny App coded in R and called “appRiori” is presented. appRiori is coded to help in understanding both the logic behind the planned comparisons and the way to interpret them when a model is tested. By using empirical examples on reproducible data, we explain how to code any default planned comparison executable in R. Moreover, through some features of appRiori, the customization of planned comparisons is shown, even on interaction effects, such as the possibility of creating customized contrast through click-and-drop menus. For each step, the R code related to the planned comparison is provided. Implications and fields of use of planned comparisons and appRiori are discussed.",

          "title": "Practical Problems Estimating and Reporting Power When Hypotheses Are Embedded in Complex Statistical Models",
          "authors": "David A. Cole, George Abitante, Hoi Kan, Qimin Liu, Kristopher J. Preacher, Scott E. Maxwell",
          "abstract": "In both grant proposals and published studies, many research hypotheses (represented by primary parameters) are tested in the context of complex statistical models. The power to detect these primary parameters depends on the values of multiple secondary model parameters that often go unexamined, unreported, and unjustified. The result is that many a priori power analyses are incomplete, ambiguous, potentially subjective, and nearly impossible for others to evaluate. In the current article, we encourage researchers to use plausible values for secondary parameters (PVSPs), in addition to the hoped-for effect sizes for their primary parameters, in their power calculations. More specifically, upper and lower bounds for power are generated based on the highest and lowest plausible values for secondary model parameters. In the article, we demonstrate how to conduct and describe such power estimates for four increasingly complex statistical methods. We further demonstrate how such analyses can inform decisions about resource allocation in ways that improve power in the context of complex statistical models, often revealing that power can be enhanced by methods other than increasing sample size. The PVSP approach can enhance power, improve the transparency of power analyses in grant proposals, reduce the likelihood of funding underpowered research, and alleviate at least one problem underlying the replication crisis.",

          "authors": "Po-Hsien Hu, Ching-Lin Shih, Cheng-Te Chen",
          "abstract": "The measurement efficiency of a grid multidimensional computerized classification test (grid MCCT), which makes a classification decision per dimension, can be improved by taking the correlations between the dimensions into account in the termination criterion. The higher the correlations, the better the improvement in measurement efficiency. However, a termination criterion utilizing inter-dimensional information (i.e., SPRT-C; Liu et al., 2022) was found to yield lower levels of correct classification rates than not utilizing it (i.e., SPRT-SF; Seitz &amp; Frey, 2013) under the between-item grid MCCT when the cutoff was set at the mean of the latent trait distribution. This study proposes a pre-rule to determine whether the SPRT-SF or SPRT-C should be used during the process of classification test administration. Through a series of simulation studies, the results showed that our proposed method (called P-SPRT) can substantially improve upon the SPRT-C in terms of correct classification rates, while maintaining its high measurement efficiency in terms of test length. This paper concludes with a discussion of the findings and further applications.",

          "authors": "Mareike Westfal, Emiel Cracco, Jan Crusius, Oliver Genschow",
          "abstract": "People automatically imitate a wide range of different behaviors. One of the most commonly used measurement methods to assess imitative behavior is the imitation-inhibition task (Brass et al., 2000). A disadvantage of its original form is, however, that it was validated for laboratory settings—a time-consuming and costly procedure. Here, we present an approach for conducting the imitation-inhibition task in online settings. We programmed the online version of the imitation-inhibition task in JavaScript and implemented the task in online survey software (i.e., Qualtrics). We validated the task in four experiments. Experiment 1 ( N = 88) showed that the typical automatic imitation effects can be detected with good psychometric properties. Going one step further, Experiment 2 ( N = 182) directly compared the online version of the imitation-inhibition task with its laboratory version and demonstrated that the online version produces similar strong and reliable effects. In Experiments 3 and 4, we assessed typical moderator effects that were previously reported in laboratory settings: Experiment 3 ( N = 93) demonstrated that automatic imitation can be reliably detected in online settings even when controlling for spatial compatibility. Experiment 4 ( N = 104) found, in line with previous research, that individuals imitate hand movements executed by a robot less strongly than movements executed by a human. Taken together, the results show that the online version of the imitation-inhibition task offers an easy-to-use method that enables the measurement of automatic imitation with common online survey software tools in a reliable and valid fashion.",

An open question is whether such increased prosociality is dampened by intergroup conflict. We conducted preregistered field experiments with two ethno-religious populations in Fiji: indigenous Christian iTaukei ( N = 324) and Hindu Indo-Fijians ( N = 280). In each study, we manipulated (between-person) whether participants thought about intergroup conflict before completing a dictator game in which we manipulated (within-person) whether participants thought about God’s preferences when allocating real money to an outgroup member. Although participants who reflected on intergroup conflict gave less money away to outgroup members, thinking about God led to significant and comparable increases in intergroup prosociality regardless of whether participants thought about conflict. Results challenge widely-held assumptions about the role of religious belief in intergroup conflict and raise questions about mechanisms that are often theorized to explain the spread of religious beliefs themselves.",

          "abstract": "People with concealable stigmatized identities may strategically share or hide cues to their identity. They may likewise seek or avoid interpersonal invisibility (i.e., being ignored). Despite semantic similarities, identity concealment and invisibility are conceptually distinct, but existing empirical work has not explored whether they are independent—that is, whether people may sometimes reveal to be invisible, or conceal to be visible. To evaluate this distinction, we collected lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) participants’ free-response descriptions of situations where they revealed or concealed their sexual orientation to be visible or invisible (Study 1). Other LGB participants imagined social interactions in which they revealed or concealed their sexual orientation to be visible or invisible and rated their expected emotions in this situation (Study 2). We find that concealment and invisibility can occur independently of one another with separate effects on emotions, and that LGB people use identity disclosure and concealment to strategically navigate interpersonal invisibility.",

          "authors": "Yibiao Liang, Erik Blaser, Jia Ying Yi, Liyang Sai, Zsuzsa Kaldy",
          "abstract": "Most work on working memory development has children remember a set of items as well as they can. However, this approach sidesteps the extended mind, the integration of external information with memory. Indeed, adults prefer to use external resources (e.g., lists, models) but will remember more as the cost to access them increases. Here, in our shopping game, we investigated this trade-off in 5- to 8-year-olds. Using a touchscreen, children shopped in a virtual store. Their shopping list and the store were not visible simultaneously but could be toggled. We manipulated access cost by varying a delay (0–4 s) before the list’s reappearance. Across three preregistered experiments at two sites (the United States and China, N = 141), a pattern emerged: When it was costlier to do so, children revisited the list less often, studied it longer, and selected more correct items. Also, children recognized the costs, identifying the no-delay condition as easier. Young children showed a cost-dependent trade-off of external-resource use versus working memory.",

          "authors": "Jan Stupacher, Cecilie Møller, Alexandre Celma-Miralles, Peter Vuust",
          "abstract": "No two people perceive the same music alike. This may apply especially to polyrhythms, which consist of two or more rhythms with indivisible regular pulses, such as three over four (3:4). Either of these pulses can be perceived as the underlying beat. Previously, we showed that people naturally tap along to pulses that can be subdivided into groups of two or four equally spaced units (i.e., binarized pulses). This propensity for binarized pulses is reduced when the opposite pulse admitting ternary subdivisions is pitched lower. However, individual factors may modulate these binary and low-pitch preferences. Therefore, we examined the influence of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT), musicianship, played instrument, and played musical style on beat perception in 2:3 and 3:4 polyrhythms. Participants with slower SMT synchronized their tapping with slower metrical levels of the pulses admitting binary subdivisions, suggesting that the natural pace with which we move through the world is linked to our perception of musical tempo. In addition, classical musicians were more likely to synchronize with lower pitched pulses than pop/rock musicians when the low pitch was in the pulse admitting ternary subdivisions. This suggests that enculturation in specific musical styles shapes how pitch and rhythm influence beat perception.",
