          "title": "Language Models Accurately Infer Correlations Between Psychological Items and Scales From Text Alone",
          "authors": "Björn E. Hommel, Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Many behavioral scientists do not agree on core constructs and how they should be measured. Different literatures measure related constructs, but the connections are not always obvious to readers and meta-analysts. Many measures in behavioral science are based on agreement with survey items. Because these items are sentences, computerized language models can make connections between disparate measures and constructs and help researchers regain an overview over the rapidly growing, fragmented literature. Our fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, accurately predicts the correlations between survey items, the reliability of aggregated measurement scales, and intercorrelations between scales from item positions in semantic vector space. We measured the model’s performance as the convergence between its synthetic model estimates and empirical coefficients observed in human data. In our pilot study, the out-of-sample accuracy was .71 for item correlations, .89 for reliabilities, and .89 for scale correlations. In our preregistered validation study using novel items, the out-of-sample accuracy was slightly reduced to .59 for item correlations, .84 for reliabilities, and .84 for scale correlations. The synthetic item correlations showed an average prediction error of .17, and there were larger errors for middling correlations. Predictions exhibited generalizability beyond the training data and across various domains, with some variability in accuracy. Our work shows language models can reliably predict psychometric relationships between survey items, enabling researchers to evaluate new measures against existing scales, reduce redundancy in measurement, and work toward a more unified behavioral-science taxonomy.",

          "authors": "Wolf Culemann, Angela Heine, Ignace T. C. Hooge",
          "abstract": "Eye tracking in reading research requires high spatial accuracy due to small, densely arranged areas of interest. However, despite widespread use of pupil-based eye trackers in reading studies, a major source of systematic inaccuracy remains largely unaddressed: the pupil size artifact (PSA) – apparent gaze shift in fact caused by pupil dilation even when the eye remains stationary. Using pupillary light reflex manipulations and reading tasks under controlled luminance, we quantified gaze inaccuracy due to the PSA and compared correction methods. We observed systematic apparent gaze shift of up to 2 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ as pupil sizes varied from 2 to 6 mm. Horizontal PSA showed contralateral patterns (median slopes: 0.38 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ /mm), while vertical PSA increased with pupil size (up to 0.86 $$^{\\circ }$$ ∘ /mm for larger pupils). Even under constant luminance, pupil size varied substantially during reading (median 95% ranges 0.78–1.38 mm). We compared two correction approaches: line assignment (standard in reading research) and PSA recalibration (modeling pupil-size-induced apparent gaze shift across the screen). Both methods effectively corrected vertical apparent gaze shift, showing similar average correction offsets and sensitivity of correction to pupil size, suggesting that line assignment implicitly compensates for vertical PSA effects. However, only PSA recalibration addressed horizontal apparent gaze shift, reducing overall gaze shift by over 50% and improving the performance of line assignment algorithms. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for PSA in reading research. We offer practical recommendations for improving gaze accuracy in eye-tracking reading studies.",

          "authors": "Frances G. Cooley, Karen Emmorey, Emily Saunders, Elizabeth R. Schotter",
          "abstract": "Eye-tracking corpora have advanced our understanding of reading processes by providing large-scale datasets of naturalistic reading behavior. However, existing corpora have almost exclusively sampled from typically hearing readers of spoken languages. Here, we present the Signers’ Eye-movements in English Reading (SEER) Corpus, a dataset of eye-movement behaviors from 41 skilled deaf adult readers who are early signers of American Sign Language (ASL), as well as a comparative group of 101 typically hearing monolingual English readers. Participants read 200 English sentences presented one at a time. In addition to eye-tracking data, the corpus includes detailed participant information: a standardized measure of reading proficiency, spelling recognition, and nonverbal intelligence for all participants. Information for the deaf participants include ASL comprehension scores, age of ASL acquisition, and phonological awareness scores (for a subset of participants). We report comparative analyses of reading behaviors at both the word level and sentence level. We also examine group differences in the effects of word length, frequency, and surprisal on local measures. The results indicate stronger effects of length and surprisal, but equivalent frequency effects (on content words) for deaf compared to hearing readers. The SEER Corpus offers researchers the opportunity to test hypotheses about reading development and efficiency in bimodal bilinguals who are first language users of ASL and skilled readers of English, supporting broader investigations of visual language processing. The corpus is preregistered and publicly available ( https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/7P4F2 ) to facilitate replication, cross-study comparisons, and exploration of preliminary hypotheses in this understudied population.",

          "abstract": "Prototypes—internalized knowledge structures of the most typical or characteristic features of a concept—are important because they influence cognitive processing. Yet prototype analysis, the method used to examine prototypes, appears relatively underutilized in organizational research. To introduce prototype analysis to a wider audience of organizational scholars, we conducted a critical methodological literature review following a six-step procedure. Seventy-three prototype analyses published in 35 journals were categorized and their content analyzed. A prototype analysis typically includes a sequence of independent studies conducted over two stages, recently referred to as the standard procedure. Our review makes several contributions, including development of a taxonomy of prototype analysis applications, clarification of the standard procedure of a prototype analysis and possible variations, and suggestions for organizational research. Benefits of undertaking a prototype analysis include improved understanding of abstract workplace concepts that are difficult to measure directly, the ability to compare cross-cultural prototypes, and an approach for investigating the issue of construct redundancy. We conclude with best-practice recommendations, implications for organizational scholarship, methodological limitations, and future research suggestions.",

          "abstract": "Americans readily identify with class labels, such as working class and middle class . In turn, these identities affect their social affiliations, cultural values, and physical health. Despite theoretical predictions that class identity can change, little work has empirically examined the long-term malleability of class identity. Here we ask, can class identity change in the long term? And if so, when? We tested this question by examining whether the 2008 Great Recession changed how Americans viewed their social and economic standing in society—that is, their class identity. In three of four data sets (total N = 164,296), we found that the 2008 Great Recession shifted Americans toward identifying as a lower class. We discuss the implications of these results for theories of the formation of class identity and for the political and social development of the United States following 2008.",

          "abstract": "Context drives our interpretations of music as surprising, frightening, or awe-inspiring. However, it remains unclear how formal musical training affects our ability to hierarchically integrate complex tonal information to efficiently predict, remember, and segment music. We scrambled naturalistic music at multiple timescales to manipulate coherent tonal context while controlling for multiple acoustic cues. Memory (Experiment 1; n = 108, age range = 19–41 years) and prediction (Experiment 2; n = 108, age range = 20–41 years) improved with more intact context for both musicians and nonmusicians. Listeners’ event boundaries were influenced by the amount of tonal context but also reflected nested phrase structure, and musicians were more sensitive to longer-timescale “hyperphrase” structure (Experiment 3; n = 95, age range = 20–42 years) and could better identify the amount of scrambling (Experiment 4; n = 108, age range = 19–41 years). These results indicate that listeners integrate tonal context across complex phrases to efficiently encode, predict, and segment naturalistic music and that in general, training has surprisingly little impact on this integration.",

          "authors": "Konstantinos Giannos, Emilios Cambouropoulos",
          "abstract": "Harmonic expectations are actively connected with the syntactic and asymmetric organisation of Western tonal harmony. Their violation has been associated with concepts such as tension, surprise, completeness, or harmonic relatedness and coherence, among others. The aim of this study is to examine whether the violation of expected chord directionality is related to perceived consonance/dissonance (C/D) of entire short chord sequences, focusing on the impact of horizontal manipulations, whilst maintaining identical the vertical content (average C/D of the chords comprising a short sequence). We conducted two experiments, with chord progressions presented in an original and retrograde arrangement. Their harmonic content ranged from strictly diatonic and tonal to highly chromatic or 12-tone. Participants reported the perceived consonance/dissonance of each sequence. Findings suggest that chord directionality indeed affects C/D evaluation in tonal sequences as opposed to atonal sequences. In addition, chord directionality appears to play hardly any role when a clear tonal hierarchy is missing, that is, in the absence of a perfect cadence that unambiguously points to a specific tonal centre of equilibrium and closure. Cadences (related to closure effects) are privileged compared with other harmonic progressions as an influencing factor to consonance perception. Voice leading appears to have some influence in such evaluations.",

          "authors": "Caroline Curwen",
          "abstract": "Musically evoked narrative imaginings (MENI) are mental stories that listeners construct in response to shifts in musical features such as dynamics, tempo, and timbre. Event segmentation – the cognitive process of identifying transitions in continuous stimuli – shapes these narratives. In music-colour synaesthesia (MCS), sounds involuntarily evoke colours and visual forms, offering perceptual anchors that may enhance event segmentation and narrative coherence. This article presents a novel theoretical framework integrating ideasthesia – the view that synaesthetic experiences are conceptually mediated rather than purely sensory-driven – with event segmentation theory to explain how MCS shapes MENI. It argues that synaesthetic percepts align with musical transitions to increase segmentation precision, strengthen narrative continuity, and deepen emotional and thematic engagement. Rather than treating MCS as an isolated phenomenon, it is situated within a broader continuum of music cognition and narrative construction, suggesting it magnifies processes shared across listeners. This perspective calls for further research into how multimodal mental imagery influences music perception, emotional response, and memory for musical narratives.",
