          "authors": "Caitlin A. Howlett, G. Lorimer Moseley",
          "abstract": "The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is a popular neuropsychological test that is complicated to score and interpret. In an attempt to make scoring of the WCST simpler, Berry (The Clinical Neuropsychologist 10, 117–121, 1996) developed a diagrammatic scoring procedure, particularly to aid scoring of perseverative responses. We identified key limitations of Berry’s diagram, including its unnecessary ambiguity and complexity, use of terminology different from that used in the standardized WCST manual, and lack of distinction between perseverative errors and perseverative responses. Our new diagrammatic scoring procedure scores each response one-by-one; we strongly suggest that the diagram is used in conjunction with the 1993 WCST manual. Our new diagrammatic scoring procedure aims to assist novice users in learning how to accurately score the task, prevent scoring errors when using the manual version of the task, and help scorers verify whether other existing computerized versions of the task (apart from the PAR version) conform to the Heaton et al. (1993) scoring method. Our diagrammatic scoring procedure holds promise to be incorporated into any future versions of the WCST manual.",

          "authors": "Emily M. Zitek, Claire Sandman Malcomb, Frank J. Hager",
          "abstract": "Researchers in psychology and management have recently examined what leads competitors to perceive that they are in a rivalry (e.g., repeated competitions) and what the consequences of rivalry are (e.g., better performance). Other researchers have long focused on the importance of social identity for how people evaluate themselves and others. In two studies, we connect and extend this past work by examining whether having the same identity as an opponent (specifically, gender or nationality) produces rivalry effects. In an online experiment, we found that sport competitors are more likely to perceive their same-gender opponents as rivals than their different-gender opponents (and this was especially the case for men). These stronger rivalry perceptions were predicted by competitors’ greater similarity, greater frequency of past competitions, and greater competitiveness with their same-gender opponents. Then, in an analysis of data from Major League Baseball (MLB), we found that batters from the Dominican Republic and the United States hit better when a same-nationality catcher was behind the plate. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of identity-based rivalry.",

          "abstract": "This study integrates research on intergroup contact and the rejection–identification model to examine how negative and positive contact interact to influence both the health and well-being as well as the group identification (assessed as ingroup affect, ingroup ties, and centrality) of disabled people. We analysed data from a week-long diary study (Study 1; N = 83) and a longitudinal study (Study 2; N = 87) with three waves separated by 1 year. Results showed that positive contact can be associated with a reduction in, or even a cancelling out of, the association between negative contact and lower well-being and ingroup affect (buffering effect). We also found that negative contact was associated with higher ingroup ties only among those with higher levels of positive contact (facilitation effect). Results reveal the potential of positive contact to reduce the adverse effects of negative contact on disadvantaged group members’ outcomes, and its potential to facilitate nonharmful effects.",

          "abstract": "Individuals may consider socioeconomic status (SES) change from an absolute or relative standpoint. Across five studies and supplementary analyses of secondary data, we found that individuals who perceive SES as being unlikely to change (i.e., low perceived social mobility) tend to consider SES change from a relative standpoint—i.e., one person’s gain in SES occurs at the expense of another’s loss in SES—reflecting that they harbor zero-sum beliefs regarding social hierarchies. In other words, the extent to which individuals believe that society is mobile predicts how they consider the nature of social mobility. This relationship is mediated by a scarcity mindset and further predicts the tendency for aggression. The findings held when we controlled for variables such as perceived economic inequality, income, and education.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this exploratory instrumental qualitative case study with nested mixed methods was to examine undergraduate music majors’ perceptions of their sense of belonging within one public university music program. We surveyed undergraduate music majors within a single music program and completed purposeful and targeted follow-up interviews of selected respondents who represented a diverse cross-section of the student body. Quantitative analysis included descriptive demographic statistics and linear multiple regression with belonging as the dependent factor. There was a statistically significant relationship between faculty interactions and student sense of belonging ( p &lt; .001). Qualitative findings suggested that student–faculty interactions were a primary contributor to a student’s sense of belonging, as well as the importance of a network of friends and the overall school culture. Implications of these results may assist music administration and faculty members in developing a culture of belonging within their respective studios or departments.",

          "abstract": "The Music Self-Perception Inventory-Short (MUSPI-S) is a theoretically based instrument consisting of 28 items with subscales that assess music self-concept globally and in six specific areas. The present study sought to validate a German translation of the MUSPI-S using a sample of 444 secondary school students. In addition to participants’ scores from the German translation of the MUSPI-S, associated data included demographic background variables, self-reported school grades in various subjects, and interest in the school subject of music. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesized factor structure and measurement model for MUSPI-S scores. Latent factor correlations among MUSPI-S subscale scores and correlations of these scores with school grades and interest in the school subject of music aligned well with theoretical expectations and previous research. Findings also provided evidence for strict measurement invariance of scores in the German MUSPI-S across subgroups of gender, school year (i.e., grade level), and musical activity. MUSPI-S subscale factor-level means did not reliably differ among seventh-, eighth-, and ninth-grade students but favored females over males and musically active over non-active students on nearly all subscales. Overall, this evidence supports the use of the German translation of the MUSPI-S in assessing a wide range of important self-perceived musical abilities for research and practical assessment purposes.",

          "abstract": "We present a novel framework for music and emotion research that addresses emotional experiences with music as functional episodes. This framework, called the Episode Model, places the situation and the function of the music for the individual at the centre of the experience and integrates acts of affective self-regulation to our understanding of music as emotional experiences. The model consists of a set of five common and functionally unique episodes of emotional experiences related to music, which are: (1) Enjoyment–Distraction–Relaxation (EDR), (2) Connection–Belonging (CB), (3) Focus–Motivation (FM), (4) Personal Emotional Processing (PEP), and (5) Aesthetic–Interest–Awe (AIA). Each episode type can be characterised by a distinct configuration of six descriptive schemes: (1) core affect and emotion qualia, (2) induction mechanisms, (3) listening modes and agency, (4) reward and exposure, (5) musical meanings, and (6) functional contexts. This framework of episodes and schemes places the functionality of emotions at the forefront of music and emotion research and explains how emotional experiences are situated and functionally constructed. In addition, we provide a set of assumptions and specific predictions to facilitate focussed empirical studies of emotional engagement with music.",
