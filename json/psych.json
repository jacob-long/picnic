          "authors": "Tim Kaiser, Philipp Herzog",
          "abstract": "Statistical prediction models are ubiquitous in psychological research and practice. Increasingly, machine-learning models are used. Quantifying the uncertainty of such predictions is rarely considered, partly because prediction intervals are not defined for many of the algorithms used. However, generating and reporting prediction models without information on the uncertainty of the predictions carries the risk of overinterpreting their accuracy. Conventional methods for prediction intervals (e.g., those defined for ordinary least squares regression) are sensitive to violations of several distributional assumptions. In this tutorial, we introduce conformal prediction, a model-agnostic, distribution-free method for generating prediction intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage, to psychological research. We start by introducing the basic rationale of prediction intervals using a motivating example. Then, we proceed to conformal prediction, which is illustrated in three increasingly complex examples using publicly available data and R code.",

          "title": "Continuous Rating Scale Analytics (CoRSA): A tool for analyzing continuous and discrete data with item response theory",
          "authors": "Yeh-Tai Chou, Yao-Ting Sung, Wei-Hung Yang",
          "abstract": "The use of continuous rating scales such as the visual analogue scale (VAS) in research has increased, yet they are less popular than discrete scales like the Likert scale. The non-popularity of continuous scales is primarily due to the lack of validated analytical tools and user-friendly interfaces, which have also jointly resulted in a lack of sufficient theoretical and empirical research supporting confidence in using continuous rating formats. This research aims to address these gaps through four studies. The first study proposed an algorithm and developed the Continuous Rating Scale Analytics (CoRSA) to estimate parameters for the continuous rating scale model (Müller, Psychometrika , 52 , 165–181, 1987). The second study evaluated CoRSA’s efficacy in analyzing continuous scores compared to pcIRT (Hohensinn, Journal of Statistical Software , 84 , 1–14, 2018) and discrete scores against ConQuest (Adams et al., 2020). Results showed superior parameter recovery with CoRSA for continuous data and comparable outcomes for discrete data. The third study analyzed empirical data from career interest and work value assessments using both VAS and Likert scales with CoRSA, demonstrating good model-data fit and validating CoRSA’s effectiveness in rescaling data to interval measurements. Finally, the fourth study integrated CoRSA into the VAS-RRP 2.0 platform (Sung &amp; Wu, Behavior Research Methods , 50 , 1694–1715, 2018) to enhance accessibility and usability, allowing researchers and practitioners unfamiliar with statistical procedures to easily analyze continuous data. These findings confirm CoRSA as a valid tool for analyzing both continuous and discrete data, enhancing the utility of continuous rating formats in diverse research contexts.",

          "authors": "Nir Ofir, Ayelet N. Landau",
          "abstract": "Multiple systems in the brain track the passage of time and can adapt their activity to temporal requirements. While the neural implementation of timing varies widely between neural substrates and behavioral tasks, at the algorithmic level, many of these behaviors can be described using drift-diffusion models of decision-making. In this work, wedevelop a drift-diffusion model to fit performance in the temporal generalization task, in which participants are required to categorize an interval as being the same or different compared to a standard, or reference, duration. The model includes a drift-diffusion process which starts with interval onset, representing the internal estimate of elapsed duration, and two boundaries. If the drift-diffusion process at interval offset is between the boundaries, the interval is categorized as equal to the standard. If it is below the lower boundary or above the upper boundary, the interval is categorized as different. This model outperformed previous models in fitting the data of single participants and in parameter recovery analyses. We also used the drift-diffusion model to analyze data from two experiments, one comparing performance between vision and audition and another examining the effect of learning. We found that decision boundaries can be modified independently: While the upper boundary was higher in vision than in audition, the lower boundary decreased with learning in the task. In both experiments, timing noise was positively correlated with upper boundaries across participants, which reflects an accuracy-maximizing strategy in the task.",

          "abstract": "The eyeball is not rigid and deforms during saccades. As a consequence, the saccade waveform recorded by an eye tracker may depend on which structure of the eye is used to estimate eyeball rotation. Here, we systematically describe and compare signals co-recorded from the retina, the cornea (corneal reflection, CR), the pupil, and the lens (fourth Purkinje reflection, P4) during saccades. We found that several commonly used parameters for saccade characterization differ systematically across the signals. For instance, saccades in the retinal signal had earlier onsets compared to saccades in the pupil and the P4 signals. The retinal signal had the smallest saccade amplitude and reached the peak saccade velocity earlier compared to the other signals. At the end of saccades, the retinal signal came to a stop faster than the other signals. We discuss possible explanations that may account for the relationship between the retinal signal and the other signals.",

          "abstract": "One major difficulty in conversational research is the time required to segment and transcribe conversational recordings. While recent advances have improved automatic speech recognition technologies, one limitation of current tools is that they are generally catered toward speech that occurs in monologues rather than conversation. Accordingly, the purpose of this project was to develop and validate an automated user-friendly tool for transcribing conversations. This tool, called Autoscribe, converts dyadic conversational audio recordings into Praat TextGrids with time-aligned turn boundaries between speech and non-speech segments and transcripts of all spoken dialogue output. Here we describe the development of this tool as well as its validation on two conversational corpora. Results showed that Autoscribe decreased the amount of active working time needed for TextGrid creation by over 70%. Average transcription accuracy was 92% and average utterance boundary placement of 95%. Thus, Autoscribe affords a practical research tool that drastically reduces the time and resource intensitivity needed for conversational segmentation and transcription.",

          "authors": "Annedore Hoppe, Immo Fritsche, Helena Pauen",
          "abstract": "The present studies investigate how populist attitudes influence perceptions of personal control. Populist reasoning is proposed to enhance personal control by promoting a sense of belonging to an agentic group (“the people”) that opposes a perceived antagonistic “corrupt elite.” Across three experiments ( N = 733), participants were asked to adopt either a populist or a pluralistic reasoning style. In Study 3, the salience of high versus low personal control was additionally manipulated. Results showed that populist reasoning increased participants’ sense of control, particularly in relation to specific goals, such as performing well in an upcoming debate. However, making low control salient tended to diminish this effect. These findings suggest that populist narratives may be appealing during crises due to their control-enhancing function. The novel experimental method for manipulating populist attitudes opens new pathways for testing causal effects and understanding the motivational drivers of populism, potentially contributing to future interventions in this field.",

          "abstract": "Despite the potential to significantly increase the impact of donations, people often fail to prioritize the cost-effectiveness of charities. This paper examines an explanation for why people may donate less effectively due to reputational concerns that favor empathizing with donation recipients rather than deliberating about the cost-effectiveness of charities. Across seven studies, we find that “deliberators” are perceived as less moral and less desirable as social partners than “empathizers.” Moreover, people accurately anticipate the reputational costs of deliberation and are more likely to donate to causes that evoke more empathy but are less cost-effective when reputational concerns are highlighted. Our findings suggest that there are disincentives for selecting charities by deliberating about their cost-effectiveness, as people are more rewarded for signaling socially valued moral traits than for prioritizing charitable impact.",

We examined whether autonomous motivation—which captures supporters’ internalized commitment to a cause—would sustain identification with the movement and collective action after experiencing failure (vs. success) outcomes following the marriage equality vote in Australia (Study 1; N = 186), and an experimental induction of movement failure (Study 2; N = 137). Autonomous motivation positively predicted identification and collective action, but there was no evidence of moderation by outcome. In Study 3 ( N = 377), we experimentally manipulated outcomes (success/failure) and framing (specific/broad) of the climate action movement. We found evidence of a three-way interaction such that the effects of autonomous motivation on identification were strongest after a specific campaign failure. We conclude that autonomous motivation can help to buffer the demotivating effects of a specific failure as well as sustaining identification and commitment to action broadly.",

          "abstract": "People readily moralize health, whether by criticizing smokers or treating exercise as noble. Drawing from the theory of dyadic morality, we theorized that people moralize health most strongly when they perceive poor health as a source of suffering. Through five studies (total N = 2,055), we show that perceived harm can drive the moralization of health. We identified three types of harm—personal, interpersonal, and collective—that people perceive as relevant to health and created a 15-item measure to capture each (Study 1). Perceived interpersonal harm reliably predicted moralizations of health, whether health was conceived broadly (Study 2) or as a concrete health issue (e.g., smoking, eating healthfully, disease prevention; Study 3). Experimentally manipulating the interpersonal harmfulness of a health behavior caused participants to moralize it (Studies 4 and 5), whereas disgust had no unique effect (Study 4). We suggest that perceived harm plays a key role in moralizing health.",

We test this prediction across two studies (total N = 860), to show that reported friendships with sexual minorities relate not only to beliefs about sexual minorities, but also to attitudes toward people who are gender atypical, beliefs about traditional gender roles and norms, and endorsement of different versions of sexism. Our findings indicate that the sexuality-as-gendered framework involves not only people’s cognitions in terms of beliefs and attitudes, but also the types of interpersonal relationships they maintain.",

          "abstract": "Although both Democrats and Republicans tend to be more tolerant of democratic norm violations that benefit their own party, this pattern is not always symmetrical, even when political stakes appear identical. Two experiments ( N = 2,352) tested competing explanations: that partisans differ in democratic commitment, their tendency to rationalize violations as legitimate, or the values they prioritize (e.g., voter access vs. election integrity). Both parties rationalized weaker opposition to beneficial violations as more democratic. However, Republicans in Study 1 were more responsive to partisan advantage without showing similarly greater democratic rationalization and more tolerant of mail-in voting restrictions regardless of partisan benefit. These differences disappeared in Study 2 when different violations were tested, suggesting such asymmetries are issue-specific rather than fixed. Overall, the findings suggest that partisan gaps in support for democratic norm violations reflect the politicization of particular practices more than stable differences in commitment to democracy.",

          "abstract": "In Eskreis-Winkler and Fishbach (2019), failure stymies learning: People learn less from failure than success. The commentary proposes that the failure to learn from failure could be due to a tendency to respond consistently. Although a consistent response pattern explains why people struggle to learn from failure in some paradigms, we argue that it does not explain the results of the original paradigm. Certain consistency mechanisms require that people assume they should be consistent with their initial intuition instead of updating as they learn new information. This assumption does not apply to the original paradigm. We discuss how the commentary helps sharpen the criteria for assessing learning from failure and the role of consistency as one potential barrier to learning.",

          "authors": "Sabrina M McKenzie, Amanda E Krause, Solange Glasser, Margaret S Osborne",
          "abstract": "Music listening can impact emotional well-being. However, self-compassion, an aspect strongly related to emotional well-being, is rarely discussed in music listening literature. Therefore, this study explored self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two hundred and ninety-six Australian university students ( M age = 19.32) completed a mixed-methods music listening and self-compassion questionnaire. The questionnaire included the Self-Compassion Short Form Scale along with an author-adapted version exploring the influence of music listening. Additional, open-ended questions probed self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences. Most participants (81.76%) reported self-compassionate experiences through listening to music during the pandemic. Template analysis examining people’s self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences resulted in an overlap of themes including emotional experience, connection , and music styles . Distinct patterns were found, such as positive outcomes in self-compassionate responses and negative outcomes in uncompassionate experiences. The inclusion of emotional release within uncompassionate responses demonstrates the complexity of the relationship between music listening and self-compassion. These findings highlight the need for further exploration into music listening and self-compassion, particularly in an everyday context beyond the pandemic.",
