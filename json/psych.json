          "abstract": "The current research examined implications of primal world beliefs—beliefs about the world’s basic character—for the maintenance of satisfying and mutually responsive relationships. In a dyadic daily diary study of romantic couples with a 1-year follow-up ( N = 236 couples and 6,411 days), those who saw the world as Good and Enticing were more satisfied with their relationships and responsive to their partners in everyday life, they had partners who were more satisfied and responsive, and they reported greater motivation for responsiveness over the year. These findings were corroborated by partner and informant reports of responsiveness, and they were mediated by approach relationship goals. Those who saw the world as Good and Enticing pursued rewarding experiences in their relationships, which predicted greater satisfaction and responsiveness of both partners. Results suggest that, by shaping goal pursuit, positive world beliefs may promote satisfying communal relationships that confirm those beliefs.",

          "authors": "Arielle Bonneville-Roussy, Paul Evans",
          "abstract": "Practice may be the single most important activity that musicians can use to improve their performance. Yet practice requires significant effort and can sometimes feel difficult or unenjoyable. For this reason, substantial motivational resources are required to sustain consistent, high-quality practice over long periods. In this study, we used self-determination theory to study the kinds of motivation that predict practice behavior and the potential influence that teachers might have on their students’ behaviors. A total of 213 university music students in the United Kingdom and Canada completed measures of practice time, practice quality, motivation, and their teacher’s teaching style. Hypothesized relationships between these variables were examined using structural equation modeling. Results supported the process model in which teacher autonomy supported predicted autonomous motivation, which in turn predicted practice time and practice quality. Teacher control predicted controlled motivation, but controlled motivation was not predictive of practice time or practice quality. Indirect effects suggested that motivation fully mediates the link between teaching style and practice behavior. The findings add clarity to research aiming to understand the kinds of social environments that lead students to develop forms of motivation that enable them to practice in a way that is enjoyable and productive.",

          "abstract": "Context is one of the key parameters influencing music emotion perception in listeners. The current study systematically investigates the influence of immediate intrinsic musical context on the perception of music-evoked emotions. Four dominantly happy and four dominantly sad Hindustani classical music excerpts were chosen and rated for perceived emotions in two types of listening experiments. In the first experiment, baseline ratings of these excerpts were collected from general participants to establish the emotions perceived without any influence. In the second experiment, pairs of excerpts were presented in succession, without any breaks, and rated continuously for perceived emotions. The perceived emotion responses for the second excerpt in the pair were considered for possible influence by the preceding music excerpt. The baseline and influenced ratings were compared to understand the effect of immediate intrinsic musical context—the first excerpt in this case—on emotion perception. Significant differences in terms of intensity of perceived emotions were found between baseline and influenced conditions for both happy and sad excerpts, either in the form of changes in perceived dominant emotion or in perceived nuance, and this phenomenon was termed intra-contextual influence. The results reflect the importance of immediate intrinsic musical context on emotion perception of musical excerpts and might be used to understand music semantics better.",
