          "authors": "Ulrich Schroeders, Timo Gnambs",
          "abstract": "Although item-response-theory (IRT) models offer well-established psychometric advantages over traditional scoring methods, they remain underused in practice. Following a brief introduction to the IRT framework, we emphasize its major advantages and explore potential applications in various research areas. The main part of this tutorial provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to Monte Carlo simulation-based sample-size estimation in IRT, which is essential for obtaining precise estimates of item and person parameters, structural effects, and model fit. Accurate a priori sample-size estimation is also crucial for effective study planning, especially in preregistration and registered reports. We highlight 10 key decisions, organized into four areas: (a) determining the data-generation model, (b) defining the test design and the process of missing values, (c) selecting the IRT model and parameters of interest, and (d) setting up and running the Monte Carlo simulation. The procedure is illustrated with examples from educational, personality, and clinical psychology. An extensively annotated and easily customizable syntax is available in an online repository.",

          "authors": "Stephen P. J. Goodman, Blake Collins, Kathleen Shorter, Ashleigh T. Moreland, Christopher Papic, Adam S. Hamlin, Brendon Kassman, Frank E. Marino",
          "abstract": "Mental fatigue is a transient psychophysiological state characterized by impaired cognition and behavior across a range of dynamic contexts. Despite increasing interest in this phenomenon, its (neuro)physiologic representations remain unclear. This systematic review aimed to quantify the range of (neuro)physiologic outcomes and methodologies used to investigate mental fatigue in laboratory-based settings. Across the 72 studies meeting our inclusion criteria, we identified 30 unique physiologic, four visual outcomes, and the application of several neuroimaging techniques investigating neuronal function. Mental fatigue increased heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, low frequency, and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and reduced standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) (all P ≤ 0.04) when compared with controls. Applying electroencephalography to investigate delta, theta, and alpha bandwidths may provide useful insights into this phenomenon, and functional near-infra-red spectroscopy to right-lateralized frontoparietal regions would be helpful to investigate cortical activity change in response to mental fatigue. More data are needed across a range of methodological contexts in order to further determine the (neuro)physiological manifestations of mental fatigue. However, this review provides direction to researchers and will assist them in navigating and considering the range of options available.",

In this paper, we present the latest version of the Animal-AI Environment, outlining several major features that make the game more engaging for humans and more complex for AI systems. These features include interactive buttons, reward dispensers, and player notifications, as well as an overhaul of the environment’s graphics and processing for significant improvements in agent training time and quality of the human player experience. We provide detailed guidance on how to build computational and behavioural experiments with the Animal-AI Environment. We present results from a series of agents, including the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning agent Dreamer-v3 , on newly designed tests and the Animal-AI testbed of 900 tasks inspired by research in the field of comparative cognition. The Animal-AI Environment offers a new approach for modelling cognition in humans and non-human animals, and for building biologically inspired artificial intelligence.",

          "title": "Evaluating mobile-based data collection for crowdsourcing behavioral research",
          "authors": "Dennis T. Esch, Nikolaos Mylonopoulos, Vasilis Theoharakis",
          "abstract": "Online crowdsourcing platforms such as MTurk and Prolific have revolutionized how researchers recruit human participants. However, since these platforms primarily recruit computer-based respondents, they risk not reaching respondents who may have exclusive access or spend more time on mobile devices that are more widely available. Additionally, there have been concerns that respondents who heavily utilize such platforms with the incentive to earn an income provide lower-quality responses. Therefore, we conducted two studies by collecting data from the popular MTurk and Prolific platforms, Pollfish, a self-proclaimed mobile-first crowdsourcing platform, and the Qualtrics audience panel. By distributing the same study across these platforms, we examine data quality and factors that may affect it. In contrast to MTurk and Prolific, most Pollfish and Qualtrics respondents were mobile-based. Using an attentiveness composite score we constructed, we find mobile-based responses comparable with computer-based responses, demonstrating that mobile devices are suitable for crowdsourcing behavioral research. However, platforms differ significantly in attentiveness, which is also affected by factors such as the respondents’ incentive for completing the survey, their activity before engaging, environmental distractions, and having recently completed a similar study. Further, we find that a stronger system 1 thinking is associated with lower levels of attentiveness and acts as a mediator between some of the factors explored, including the device used and attentiveness. In addition, we raise a concern that most MTurk users can pass frequently used attention checks but fail less utilized measures, such as the infrequency scale.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup meta-attitude inaccuracy—the extent to which perceptions of outgroup views towards the ingroup diverge from what outgroup members actually think—fuels intergroup hostility, yet research on its precursors is scarce. Through four correlational studies, we examined whether and how intergroup contact predicts meta-attitude (in)accuracy in three conflict contexts: Black–White British in the United Kingdom (UK), Turks–Kurds in Turkey, and Catholics–Protestants in Northern Ireland. Regardless of context or status, all groups perceived themselves to be evaluated more negatively by the outgroup than they really were. Positive contact predicted increased meta-attitude accuracy (through increased shared reality) which was, in turn, associated with more positive outgroup attitudes. The role of negative contact and affective mediators (such as intergroup anxiety and fear) was not consistent and depended on group and context. The use of positive intergroup contact as a potential rectifier of overestimated negative meta-attitudes in conflict contexts is discussed.",

          "abstract": "Inclusion experiences are central to an individual’s well-being, but when do individuals feel included? Does it suffice to belong to the larger group (e.g., a work team or society), or do individuals also need to feel unique within that group, as optimal distinctiveness research would suggest? In this paper, we examine whether feeling unique improves an individual’s well-being beyond belonging only. Two correlational studies with Europe-based employees ( N = 292, N = 295) show that uniqueness explains well-being when controlling for belonging. An online experiment from a general sample in the US ( N = 666) provides indicative causal evidence that feeling unique improves well-being while holding belonging constant. Together, this research indicates that uniqueness plays a vital role in individuals’ inclusion experiences, such that it improves well-being beyond belonging. However, isolating the two components remains intricate, and we discuss avenues for future research to operationalize the two inclusion needs.",

          "abstract": "Despite knowing better, people often follow the opinions of others when making decisions. Although people in joint evaluation mode (i.e., comparing options side-by-side) anticipate feeling less culpable if things go wrong after following someone else’s suggestion, our research shows the opposite effect when they actually experience one of the options. Across multiple studies ( n = 3,200), including four with real monetary consequences, we find that people feel more culpable when they go against their better judgment. This counterintuitive effect occurs because going against one’s better judgment increases thoughts about alternative, better decisions that could have been made, which amplify feelings of control over the situation. This effect occurs regardless of whether the input is solicited or unsolicited and is specific to situations where people go against their better judgment. It does not occur if people reject poor suggestions or follow input that aligns with their judgment.",

          "abstract": "Dignity is prominently endorsed in health care, organizations, and law. However, humanities research casts doubt over the utility of this concept, disputing that “dignity” captures any unique ethical value distinguishable from “respect”. Here, we test a recent proposal that dignity entails special regard for humiliation. We created a set of vignettes describing a “perpetrator” making offensive remarks or gestures to a “victim”, and asked lay participants to rate how well each offense corresponds to a dignity violation as opposed to a respect violation. We manipulated the victims’ resulting emotions within-subject, across “humiliation”, “anger”, and “baseline” conditions, while controlling for other factors (e.g., victim’s gender, vulnerability). We found substantial evidence (BF = 4.11) for our preregistered hypothesis that humiliation increased dignity-relatedness ratings as compared with the baseline condition, and very strong evidence when compared with the anger condition (BF = 84.75). These findings provide empirical backing to dignitarian ethics with applications in health care, organizations, and law.",

          "abstract": "Prosocial interventions grounded in social interactions have shown limited effectiveness in alleviating depressive symptoms, possibly because of the discomfort and unease that depressed individuals experience during such interactions. We developed and examined an innovative prosocial intervention—an online micro-charitable giving intervention, in which individuals voluntarily donated at least one Chinese cent (¥0.01, or about $0.0014) daily. We conducted three preregistered, 2-month randomized controlled trials with depressed individuals (Sample 1: N = 125, Sample 2: N = 296, Sample 3: N = 462). Results showed that, compared with the waitlist group, the intervention group exhibited significantly greater improvements in both depressive symptoms (Cohen’s ds = −0.19 to −0.46) and emotional positivity (Cohen’s ds = 0.22 to 0.49), and that emotional positivity mediated the intervention’s effect on the reduction of depressive symptoms. Exploratory analysis found a slightly larger intervention effect for generous donors than for minimal donors. This low-cost, easily accessible prosocial intervention holds potential for the prevention of depression. [Box: see text]",

          "abstract": "Intelligence is known to predict survival, but it remains unclear whether cognitive abilities differ in their relationship to survival in old age. We analyzed longitudinal data of 516 healthy adults (age: M = 84.92 years, SD = 8.66 years at Wave 1) from the Berlin Aging Study (Germany) on nine tasks of perceptual speed, episodic memory, verbal fluency, and verbal knowledge, and a general composite intelligence score. There were eight waves, with up to 18 years of follow-up; all participants were deceased by the time of analysis. We used a joint multivariate longitudinal survival model to estimate the unique contribution of each cognitive ability in terms of true (i.e., error-free) current value and current rate of change when predicting survival. Additional survival covariates included age at first occasion, sex, sociobiographical status, and suspected dementia. Only the two verbal-fluency measures were uniquely predictive of mortality risk. Thus, verbal fluency showed more salient associations with mortality risk than did measures of perceptual speed, episodic memory, and verbal knowledge.",
