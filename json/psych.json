          "authors": "Daphne Xin Hou, Stuti Thapa, Louis Tay",
          "abstract": "Past research on cross-cultural equivalence has focused on statistical procedures and techniques for ensuring measurement equivalence in tests and surveys. With the rise of big data and machine learning (ML), particularly natural language processing, researchers have powerful tools to study culture using large-scale, organic language data from social media. However, the lack of methodological guidance on how to establish cross-language equivalence in cross-cultural studies, especially with multilingual or culturally diverse text data, poses a major challenge. To address this gap, in this article, we propose a framework to raise awareness of key equivalence challenges and offer practical guidance for reducing measurement biases when applying ML techniques to social media language data. The framework outlines five types of equivalence following the ML pipeline from data collection to evaluation: source equivalence, sample equivalence, input equivalence, psychological-ground-truth equivalence, and model-performance equivalence. We also draw parallels to survey-based research to highlight shared conceptual challenges and identify future directions to advance cross-cultural research with big data and computational-linguistic methods.",

          "authors": "Kushin Mukherjee, Holly Huey, Laura M. Stoinski, Martin N. Hebart, Judith E. Fan, Wilma A. Bainbridge",
          "abstract": "The development of large datasets of natural images has galvanized progress in psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. Notably, the THINGS database constitutes a collective effort towards understanding of human visual knowledge by accumulating rich data on a shared set of visual object concepts across several studies. In this paper, we introduce ( DoT ), a novel dataset of 28,627 human drawings of 1854 diverse object concepts, sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language, mirroring the structure of the THINGS image database. In addition to data on drawings’ stroke history, we further collected fine-grained recognition data for each drawing, along with metadata on participant demographics, drawing ability, and mental imagery. We characterize people’s ability to communicate and recognize semantic information encoded in drawings and compare this ability to their ability to recognize real-world images of the same visual objects. We also explore the relationship between drawing understanding and the memorability and typicality of the objects contained in THINGS. In sum, we envision DoT as a powerful tool that builds on the THINGS database to advance understanding of how humans express knowledge about visual concepts.",

          "authors": "Hiromichi Hagihara, Kazuki Miyazawa",
          "abstract": "This study examined how well large language models (LLMs) approximate human psychological ratings for early-acquired English words. We used four state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o and Meta-Llama-3.1, to evaluate 21 static psychological features for 695 words and compared these estimates with human norms. The results showed that LLMs aligned well with human ratings for some features (e.g., Concreteness, Bodily Interactiveness) in terms of rank correlations ( r s &gt; .82) and distributional similarities but diverged notably for others (e.g., Iconicity, Arousal; r s &lt; .48). Compared with content words, function words showed more pronounced discrepancies between human and LLM ratings. We also assessed how similarly human- and LLM-derived psychological features predicted words’ age of acquisition (AoA), revealing both strong correspondences and systematic biases, depending on the model (differences in correlations ranged from −.27 to .28). Based on these analyses, we identified which features may be reliably estimated using LLMs, which require further refinement, and what methodological considerations are necessary for applying LLM-based measures in cognitive science. We discuss the implications of using LLMs as methodological tools in psychology and cognitive science, highlighting both their practical advantages (e.g., data coverage and data collection efficiency) and theoretical relevance. The present study provides a novel framework for evaluating the cognitive plausibility of LLMs by using lexical psychological features, complementing existing benchmarks.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup attitudes can be positively influenced by peers, but it remains unclear whether this occurs primarily through ingroup socialization or outgroup contact. Prior studies concurrently exploring both pathways have yielded mixed results. This paper introduces two key factors, ingroup identification and interpersonal dislike, as potentially moderating or counteracting the effects of these processes. We incorporate these factors into a comprehensive statistical model that accounts for various mechanisms associated with outgroup attitude change, including peer influence, ingroup and outgroup contact, ethnic and attitudinal homophily in friendship selection, and general relationship formation dynamics. Using stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM), we analyze longitudinal data on coevolving networks and attitudes among 380 German secondary school adolescents. Our findings show that both outgroup contact among German adolescents and ingroup socialization significantly influence outgroup attitude change. However, interpersonal dislike and ingroup identification do not play a meaningful role in these processes.",

          "abstract": "Group and intergroup research often addresses the ways in which people care about a specific group but focuses less on caring about groups in general. Here, we investigate individual differences in how likely people are to join and invest in the groups to which they belong. This idea is related to collectivism, but collectivism measures have been plagued by theoretical and measurement weaknesses. We therefore developed a Group Orientation Scale and a Generalized Identification Scale to measure how much people care about groups, and test the scales’ predictive validity alongside related constructs. Both measures are reliable but the Group Orientation Scale items were found to be easier to comprehend. Furthermore, group orientation predicts identification with real and minimal groups, the intensity of emotional reactions to group concerns, contributions made in a public goods dilemma, intentions to engage in personal sacrifice to limit coronavirus infections, and motivation in group tasks.",

          "abstract": "Fostering prosociality in adolescents is essential for social cohesion and well-being, yet the psychological processes underlying individual differences remain understudied. Guided by moral identity theory, this research examined how moral identity internalization and symbolization relate to prosociality and whether moral elevation mediates these associations. Across three studies, moral identity internalization showed a stronger and more consistent association with prosociality than symbolization. Study 1, using cross-sectional data, found that both moral identity internalization and symbolization were related to prosociality through moral elevation. Study 2 utilized a mediation pathway analysis and found that moral identity internalization was positively associated with moral elevation and prosociality, and that moral elevation was further associated with prosociality. Study 3 employed a measurement-of-mediation design, providing additional evidence that moral elevation mediates the link between moral identity internalization and prosociality. These findings suggest that moral elevation is a key mechanism linking moral identity to prosociality and that interventions fostering moral elevation may support adolescents’ prosocial development.",

          "abstract": "Organizations often endure across multiple generations of members—and what one generation preaches may not always align with what another generation practices. We demonstrate that people attribute such inconsistency to hypocrisy, even when over half a century separates the practicing and preaching. Five experiments and three supplemental studies demonstrate this intergenerational hypocrisy effect ( N = 4,482). Organizations were perceived as more hypocritical, their actions seemed less legitimate, and people were more motivated to protest against them when the organization’s words and deeds were (vs. were not) misaligned across generations of members. We test several moderators, and find that to attenuate the intergenerational hypocrisy effect, organizations can attribute their word–deed inconsistency to moral principles that they paid a tangible cost to uphold. The results suggest that organizations risk reputational damage in a wider array of situations than previously appreciated.",

Here, we use an adaptation of the discordant twin design in a structural equation framework (ACE-β models) with 1264 Norwegian monozygotic and dizygotic twins, to investigate whether education and RWA remain associated after controlling for confounders from genes and environmental influences shared by twins. Our model estimates that 25% of the covariance between education and RWA reflects genetic confounders, 47% reflects shared-environmental confounders, and 28% of the covariance remains unaccounted for. This remaining covariance then reflects causal effects and/or environmental confounders not shared by twins. Perceived socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood accounted for about one-third of the shared-environmental confounding. We did not find evidence that effects of education on RWA are mediated by perceived SES in adulthood.",

Do these narratives have self-fulfilling consequences? To test this hypothesis, and to attain a practical way to support people in realizing their strengths, we developed a brief (~20 min), highly scalable exercise that highlights the strengths people show when contending with depression. Three experiments ( N total = 748) show that this depression-reframing-exercise enhanced the confidence of people who had experienced depression to pursue their goals in life, 0.30≤ d s ≤0.68 ( N s = 158, 419, and 171); and, over 2 weeks, the progress they reported making towards a valued personal goal by 49% (from 43% reported completion to 64%), d = 0.47 (Experiment 3). While default inherent-weakness-narratives harm goal pursuit among people with depression, efforts to reframe depression can help people with depression recognize and access their strengths.",

In one laboratory and three online experiments ( N total = 3,066), we measured trust in true, false, and disinformation statements related to the Russo–Ukrainian war (Experiments 1–3) and to politics, climate, and health (Experiment 4). We examined longer-term effectiveness of a fact-based corrective message delivered either before (prebunking) or after (debunking) participants’ initial evaluation of disinformation statements. Across all four experiments, debunking intervention consistently and substantially reduced trust in disinformation, with effects persisting for at least two weeks. Prebunking intervention produced similarly durable benefits only when it was immediately followed by evaluation of the just-corrected disinformation. When evaluation was delayed, prebunking had no reliable impact. We found no significant backfire effects on trust in disinformation across any ideological groups. However, debunking induced a more conservative response pattern overall, reducing trust in true statements as well.",

          "abstract": "Nedergaard and Lupyan (2024) presented four studies aimed at validating anendophasia (i.e., experiencing no inner speech). 1 However, Lind (2025) held that no one, including Nedergaard and Lupyan, has demonstrated that anendophasia exists. In both articles, the authors support their positions using the findings of descriptive experience sampling. Here, I show that descriptive experience sampling is a fidelity-aspiring method; I highlight the distinction between fidelity and validity (an important distinction for psychological science in general and for anendophasia in particular). Anendophasia is an experiential phenomenon, not a construct, and therefore requires incorporating fidelity-based investigations. Nedergaard and Lupyan treated anendophasia as a construct (providing validity-based investigations), but drew phenomenon-based conclusions. I distinguish between completely and mostly anendophasic individuals, noting that, in practice, that distinction might be impossible to make. I suggest that anendophasic (or at least mostly anendophasic) individuals do in fact exist (probably frequently) and are worthy of fidelity-based (as well as validational) investigations.",

          "abstract": "Do individuals possess a “gaze fingerprint” that reveals how they uniquely look at the world? We tested this question by examining intra- and intersubject gaze similarity across 700 static pictures of complex natural scenes. Independent discovery ( n = 105) and replication data sets ( n = 46) of adults aged 18 to 50 years (sampled from Italy and Germany) revealed that gaze fingerprinting is possible at relatively high rates (e.g., 52%–63%) compared with chance (e.g., 1%–2%). We also identify gaze-fingerprint barcodes , which reveal a unique individualized code describing which stimuli an individual can be gaze-fingerprinted on. Preregistered longitudinal follow-up experiments have shown that gaze-fingerprint barcodes are nonrandom within an individual over short and long time fraframmes. Finally, we find that increased gaze fingerprintability for social stimuli is associated with decreased levels of autistic traits. To summarize, this work showcases the potential of gaze fingerprinting for isolating traitlike factors that may be of high neurodevelopmental and biological significance.",

Here, two game-based experiments reveal a capacity to simulate decision-making under such counterfactual ignorance. English-speaking adults ( N = 1,001) saw the solution to a game (ship locations in Battleship, the hidden word in Hangman) but attempted to play as though they never had this information. Pretenders accurately mimicked broad aspects of genuine play, including the number of guesses required to reach a solution, as well as subtle patterns, such as the effects of decision uncertainty on decision time. Although peers were unable to detect pretense, statistical analysis and computational modeling uncovered traces of overacting in pretenders’ decisions, suggesting a schematic simulation of their minds. Opening up a new approach to studying self-simulation, our results reveal intricate metacognitive knowledge about decision-making, drawn from a rich—but simplified—internal model of cognition.",

It remains unclear whether an individual’s confidence in being correct is generated by the same system across tasks ( domain generality ) or whether it is computed independently in the context of each task ( domain specificity ). Previous studies have focused on correlations across several tasks, yet the evidence is mixed, and more complex models of domain generality were not taken into account. Analyzing data from 10 tasks collected across three studies in Denmark and Poland ( N = 253–547 adult participants), we found a fixed pattern of cross-task correlations for both metacognitive bias and metacognitive efficiency. In accordance with previous studies, we found that hierarchical estimation of metacognitive efficiency led to higher correlations. We used confirmatory factor analyses to investigate the existence of general processes. We found evidence for a weak domain generality with a metacognitive module for perceptual tasks and another for cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics underlying musical taste by examining five dimensions of musical taste through psychological, sociological, and music-analytical perspectives. By focusing on specific musical styles, the study aims to identify key factors that shape style-specific preferences. Data were collected from N = 844 participants through an online survey. Participants selected one of 17 musical styles they were most passionate about and completed five scales assessing factors influencing musical taste development, functions and situations of music listening, musical value judgments, and perceived musical dislikes. The data were analyzed using factor analyses to identify underlying dimensions, followed by a random forest classification to explore the importance of these factors for musical preferences across styles. The results highlight the role of social influences in shaping musical taste, particularly among punk, metal, and rock fans, while these factors were less relevant for classical and jazz enthusiasts. Identity expression and the relevance of lyrics were also pivotal for punk, metal, and rock fans, whereas pop and rap listeners frequently cited perceptions of mainstream appeal as a reason for rejection. This study underscores the multifaceted and style-specific nature of musical taste, advocating for an integrative approach by bridging psychological, sociological, and music-analytical perspectives.",

To provide an empirical framework and tools for future research, we examined the relevance of the participatory music engagement for mental well-being model for autistic adults. The model outlines four pathways through which music supports well-being: managing and expressing emotion, providing respite, facilitating self-development, and facilitating connections. Based on the model, we developed a new questionnaire, the Participatory Music Engagement for Mental Well-being (PaMEW), and collected responses from 63 autistic adults. We found that most respondents believed the items were relevant to their experiences of the relationship between music and well-being, that the factorial structure of their responses aligned with the model, and that their comments reflected the four pathways; however, they also highlighted nuances not addressed by the model. The study underscores the need for nuanced tools that reflect the unique ways autistic individuals use music to support their well-being, suggesting future revisions of PaMEW in collaboration with the autistic community to enhance its relevance and clarity.",

          "abstract": "This article describes the results of an exploratory action research project that sought to implement an intervention proposal entitled Promoting Self-regulated Musical Learning in Online Lessons (PSRL). This PSRL was developed in accordance with self-regulated learning theory and the corresponding premise that self-regulation can be activated directly through teacher instructions and indirectly by enriching the learning environment with pedagogical tools that facilitate student self-regulation. The PSRL contained two components: (1) a diagnostic approach, which aimed to understand just which self-regulation processes students deployed during practice, and (2) a training approach, which included teacher instructions and tools for self-regulation. In addition, this study explored an online learning environment tailored to activate and enhance self-regulated learning skills. Two cello students from a music education BA programme in Brazil participated in the project. The PSRL was implemented throughout 4 weeks in eight cycles of action. The findings indicate that a questioning approach and the indirect support of the online environment were associated with increased metacognitive reflection in the two students. Although the results cannot be generalized due to the small sample size, the study provides insights into teaching strategies that may support the development of students’ self-regulated musical practice habits in online lessons.",
