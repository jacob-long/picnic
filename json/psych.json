          "title": "A Cautionary Note on Using Univariate Methods for Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling",
          "authors": "Suzanne Jak, Mike W.-L. Cheung",
          "abstract": "Meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) is an increasingly popular technique in psychology, especially in management and organizational psychology. MASEM refers to fitting structural equation models (SEMs), such as path models or factor models, to meta-analytic data. The meta-analytic data, obtained from multiple primary studies, generally consist of correlations across the variables in the path or factor model. In this study, we contrast the method that is most often applied in management and organizational psychology (the univariate-r method) to several multivariate methods. “Univariate-r” refers to performing multiple univariate meta-analyses to obtain a synthesized correlation matrix as input in an SEM program. In multivariate MASEM, a multivariate meta-analysis is used to synthesize correlation matrices across studies (e.g., generalized least squares, two-stage SEM, one-stage MASEM). We conducted a systematic search on applications of MASEM in the field of management and organizational psychology and showed that reanalysis of the four available data sets using multivariate MASEM can lead to different conclusions than applying univariate-r. In two simulation studies, we show that the univariate-r method leads to biased standard errors of path coefficients and incorrect fit statistics, whereas the multivariate methods generally perform adequately. In the article, we also discuss some issues that possibly hinder researchers from applying multivariate methods in MASEM.",

          "authors": "Caitlin A. Howlett, G. Lorimer Moseley",
          "abstract": "The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is a popular neuropsychological test that is complicated to score and interpret. In an attempt to make scoring of the WCST simpler, Berry (The Clinical Neuropsychologist 10, 117–121, 1996) developed a diagrammatic scoring procedure, particularly to aid scoring of perseverative responses. We identified key limitations of Berry’s diagram, including its unnecessary ambiguity and complexity, use of terminology different from that used in the standardized WCST manual, and lack of distinction between perseverative errors and perseverative responses. Our new diagrammatic scoring procedure scores each response one-by-one; we strongly suggest that the diagram is used in conjunction with the 1993 WCST manual. Our new diagrammatic scoring procedure aims to assist novice users in learning how to accurately score the task, prevent scoring errors when using the manual version of the task, and help scorers verify whether other existing computerized versions of the task (apart from the PAR version) conform to the Heaton et al. (1993) scoring method. Our diagrammatic scoring procedure holds promise to be incorporated into any future versions of the WCST manual.",

          "authors": "Emily M. Zitek, Claire Sandman Malcomb, Frank J. Hager",
          "abstract": "Researchers in psychology and management have recently examined what leads competitors to perceive that they are in a rivalry (e.g., repeated competitions) and what the consequences of rivalry are (e.g., better performance). Other researchers have long focused on the importance of social identity for how people evaluate themselves and others. In two studies, we connect and extend this past work by examining whether having the same identity as an opponent (specifically, gender or nationality) produces rivalry effects. In an online experiment, we found that sport competitors are more likely to perceive their same-gender opponents as rivals than their different-gender opponents (and this was especially the case for men). These stronger rivalry perceptions were predicted by competitors’ greater similarity, greater frequency of past competitions, and greater competitiveness with their same-gender opponents. Then, in an analysis of data from Major League Baseball (MLB), we found that batters from the Dominican Republic and the United States hit better when a same-nationality catcher was behind the plate. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of identity-based rivalry.",

We analysed data from a week-long diary study (Study 1; N = 83) and a longitudinal study (Study 2; N = 87) with three waves separated by 1 year. Results showed that positive contact can be associated with a reduction in, or even a cancelling out of, the association between negative contact and lower well-being and ingroup affect (buffering effect). We also found that negative contact was associated with higher ingroup ties only among those with higher levels of positive contact (facilitation effect). Results reveal the potential of positive contact to reduce the adverse effects of negative contact on disadvantaged group members’ outcomes, and its potential to facilitate nonharmful effects.",

          "abstract": "In six studies, we examined two foundational questions about moral praise. First, what makes an action praiseworthy? In Study 1, participants reported that actions that exceed duties (compared with dutiful actions) deserve greater praise and are perceived as less likely to happen. Second, what do observers infer from praise? Praise may communicate information about local norms. In Study 2, we found that—in general—participants expect praise to increase the likelihood of a behavior. However, in Studies 3–6, participants inferred that moral behavior that receives praise is less common and is less required and expected of people. These inferences led individuals to judge that someone would be less likely to perform a behavior that was praised. These studies provide insight into the lay beliefs and communicative function of moral praise.",

          "abstract": "Individuals may consider socioeconomic status (SES) change from an absolute or relative standpoint. Across five studies and supplementary analyses of secondary data, we found that individuals who perceive SES as being unlikely to change (i.e., low perceived social mobility) tend to consider SES change from a relative standpoint—i.e., one person’s gain in SES occurs at the expense of another’s loss in SES—reflecting that they harbor zero-sum beliefs regarding social hierarchies. In other words, the extent to which individuals believe that society is mobile predicts how they consider the nature of social mobility. This relationship is mediated by a scarcity mindset and further predicts the tendency for aggression. The findings held when we controlled for variables such as perceived economic inequality, income, and education.",

Four studies ( N = 789) using both university and community samples examined the relationship between live music events and CE and how this relationship contributes to positive, lasting outcomes. Results suggest that CE is highly related to positive outcomes associated with attending live music events. CE uniquely predicted meaning in life and enjoyment during the event above and beyond related constructs. Feeling CE was also related to greater meaning in life during the event and continued happiness a week after live music events. Further, CE mediated effects between various elements of live music events (e.g., parasocial bonds with the artist) and positive lasting outcomes. In summary, CE plays a key role in the lasting wellbeing that follows live music events.",

          "abstract": "Recent event-related potential (ERP) studies showed that individuals with low visual working memory (VWM) capacity are more susceptible to salience-driven attentional capture than high-capacity individuals are, with the latter being able to proactively suppress salient but irrelevant distractors. However, it remains unclear whether and how contingent attentional capture by distractors that possess a task-relevant (target) feature is related to VWM capacity. Here, we adopted a central focused-attention task that contained peripheral target-matching distractors to investigate this issue ( N = 51 adults). Surprisingly, we revealed that target-matching distractors elicited both a larger N2-posterior-contralateral (N2pc) and a larger post-N2pc distractor positivity (P D ) component in high-capacity individuals than in low-capacity ones, meaning that high-capacity individuals are less able to ignore such distractors initially, though they could call on a stronger reactive suppression mechanism afterward. These findings illustrate that high-capacity individuals are more (rather than less or equally) susceptible to contingent attention capture compared with low-capacity ones.",

          "authors": "Erika J. Knapp, James Brinkmann, Liza Calisesi Maidens",
          "abstract": "The purpose of this exploratory instrumental qualitative case study with nested mixed methods was to examine undergraduate music majors’ perceptions of their sense of belonging within one public university music program. We surveyed undergraduate music majors within a single music program and completed purposeful and targeted follow-up interviews of selected respondents who represented a diverse cross-section of the student body. Quantitative analysis included descriptive demographic statistics and linear multiple regression with belonging as the dependent factor. There was a statistically significant relationship between faculty interactions and student sense of belonging ( p &lt; .001). Qualitative findings suggested that student–faculty interactions were a primary contributor to a student’s sense of belonging, as well as the importance of a network of friends and the overall school culture. Implications of these results may assist music administration and faculty members in developing a culture of belonging within their respective studios or departments.",

          "authors": "Daniel Fiedler, Johannes Hasselhorn, A. Katrin Arens, Anne C. Frenzel, Walter P. Vispoel",
          "abstract": "The Music Self-Perception Inventory-Short (MUSPI-S) is a theoretically based instrument consisting of 28 items with subscales that assess music self-concept globally and in six specific areas. The present study sought to validate a German translation of the MUSPI-S using a sample of 444 secondary school students. In addition to participants’ scores from the German translation of the MUSPI-S, associated data included demographic background variables, self-reported school grades in various subjects, and interest in the school subject of music. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesized factor structure and measurement model for MUSPI-S scores. Latent factor correlations among MUSPI-S subscale scores and correlations of these scores with school grades and interest in the school subject of music aligned well with theoretical expectations and previous research. Findings also provided evidence for strict measurement invariance of scores in the German MUSPI-S across subgroups of gender, school year (i.e., grade level), and musical activity. MUSPI-S subscale factor-level means did not reliably differ among seventh-, eighth-, and ninth-grade students but favored females over males and musically active over non-active students on nearly all subscales. Overall, this evidence supports the use of the German translation of the MUSPI-S in assessing a wide range of important self-perceived musical abilities for research and practical assessment purposes.",
