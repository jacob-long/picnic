          "authors": "Tim Kaiser, Philipp Herzog",
          "abstract": "Statistical prediction models are ubiquitous in psychological research and practice. Increasingly, machine-learning models are used. Quantifying the uncertainty of such predictions is rarely considered, partly because prediction intervals are not defined for many of the algorithms used. However, generating and reporting prediction models without information on the uncertainty of the predictions carries the risk of overinterpreting their accuracy. Conventional methods for prediction intervals (e.g., those defined for ordinary least squares regression) are sensitive to violations of several distributional assumptions. In this tutorial, we introduce conformal prediction, a model-agnostic, distribution-free method for generating prediction intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage, to psychological research. We start by introducing the basic rationale of prediction intervals using a motivating example. Then, we proceed to conformal prediction, which is illustrated in three increasingly complex examples using publicly available data and R code.",

          "abstract": "Musicians are often regarded as a positive example of brain plasticity and associated cognitive benefits. This emerges when experienced musicians (e.g., musicians with more than 10 years of music training and practice) are compared with nonmusicians. A frequently observed behavioral finding is a short-term memory advantage of the former over the latter. Although available meta-analysis reported that the effect size of this advantage is medium (Hedges’s g = 0.5), no literature study was adequately powered to estimate reliably an effect of such size. This multilab study has been ideated, realized, and conducted in lab by several groups that have been working on this topic. Our ultimate goal was to provide a community-driven shared and reliable estimate of the musicians’ short-term memory advantage (if any) and set a method and a standard for future studies in neuroscience and psychology comparing musicians and nonmusicians. Thirty-three research units recruited a total of 600 experienced musicians and 600 nonmusicians, a number that is sufficiently large to estimate a small effect size (Hedges’s g = 0.3) with a high statistical power (i.e., 95%). Subsequently, we measured the difference in short-term memory for musical, verbal, and visuospatial stimuli. We also looked at cognitive, personality, and socioeconomic factors that might mediate the difference. Musicians had better short-term memory than nonmusicians for musical, verbal, and visuospatial stimuli with an effect size of, respectively, Hedges’s g s = 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.94, 1.22]; large), 0.16 (95% CI = [0.02 0.30]; very small), and 0.28 (95% CI = [0.15, 0.41]; small). This work sets the basis for sound research practices in studies comparing musicians and nonmusicians and contributes to the ongoing debate on the possible cognitive benefits of musical training.",

          "authors": "Nir Ofir, Ayelet N. Landau",
          "abstract": "Multiple systems in the brain track the passage of time and can adapt their activity to temporal requirements. While the neural implementation of timing varies widely between neural substrates and behavioral tasks, at the algorithmic level, many of these behaviors can be described using drift-diffusion models of decision-making. In this work, wedevelop a drift-diffusion model to fit performance in the temporal generalization task, in which participants are required to categorize an interval as being the same or different compared to a standard, or reference, duration. The model includes a drift-diffusion process which starts with interval onset, representing the internal estimate of elapsed duration, and two boundaries. If the drift-diffusion process at interval offset is between the boundaries, the interval is categorized as equal to the standard. If it is below the lower boundary or above the upper boundary, the interval is categorized as different. This model outperformed previous models in fitting the data of single participants and in parameter recovery analyses. We also used the drift-diffusion model to analyze data from two experiments, one comparing performance between vision and audition and another examining the effect of learning. We found that decision boundaries can be modified independently: While the upper boundary was higher in vision than in audition, the lower boundary decreased with learning in the task. In both experiments, timing noise was positively correlated with upper boundaries across participants, which reflects an accuracy-maximizing strategy in the task.",

          "title": "The impact of dichotomization on network recovery",
          "authors": "Nikola Sekulovski, Tessa F. Blanken, Jonas M. B. Haslbeck, Maarten Marsman",
          "abstract": "Graphical models have become an important method for studying the network structure of multivariate psychological data. Accurate recovery of the underlying network structure is paramount and requires that the models are appropriate for the data at hand. Traditionally, Gaussian graphical models for continuous data and Ising models for binary data have dominated the literature. However, psychological research often relies on ordinal data from Likert scale items, creating a model-data mismatch. This paper examines the effect of dichotomizing ordinal variables on network recovery, as opposed to analyzing the data at its original level of measurement, using a Bayesian analysis of the ordinal Markov random field model. This model is implemented in the R package . Our analysis shows that dichotomization results in a loss of information, which affects the accuracy of network recovery. This is particularly true when considering the interplay between the dichotomization cutoffs used and the distribution of the ordinal categories. In addition, we demonstrate a difference in accuracy when using dichotomized data, depending on whether edges are included or excluded in the true network, which highlights the effectiveness of the ordinal model in recovering conditional independence relationships. These findings underscore the importance of using models that deal directly with ordinal data to ensure more reliable and valid inferred network structures in psychological research.",

          "authors": "Inbal Kimchi, Sascha Schroeder, Noam Siegelman",
          "abstract": "The importance or centrality of a linguistic unit to a larger unit’s meaning is known to affect reading behavior. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to quantify a unit’s degree of importance or centrality, with previous quantifications using either subjective ratings or computational solutions with limited interpretability. Here we introduce a novel measure, which we term “informativeness”, to assess the significance of a word to the meaning of the sentence in which it appears. Our measure is based on the comparison of vectorial representations of the full sentence with a revised sentence without the target word, resulting in an easily interpretable and objective quantification. We show that our new measure correlates in expected ways with other psycholinguistic variables (e.g., frequency, length, predictability), and, importantly, uniquely predicts eye-movement reading behavior in large-scale datasets of first (L1) and second language (L2) readers (from the Multilingual Eye-tracking Corpus, MECO). We also show that the effects of informativeness generalize to diverse writing systems, and are stronger for poorer than better readers. Together, our work provides new avenues for investigating informativeness effects, towards a deeper understanding of the way it impacts reading behavior.",

          "authors": "Serena Castellotti, Irene Petrizzo, Roberto Arrighi, Elvio Blini",
          "abstract": "The measurement of pupil size is a classic tool in psychophysiology, but its popularity has recently surged due to the rapid developments of the eye-tracking industry. Concurrently, several authors have outlined a wealth of strategies for tackling pupillary recordings analytically. The consensus is that the “temporal” aspect of changes in pupil size is key, and that the analytical approach should be mindful of the temporal factor. Here we take a more radical stance on the matter by suggesting that, by the time significant changes in pupil size are detected, it is already too late . We suggest that these changes are indeed the result of distinct, core physiological processes that originate several hundreds of milliseconds before that moment and altogether shape the observed signal. These processes can be recovered indirectly by leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques. Here we therefore outline key concepts of temporal principal components analysis and related rotations to show that they reveal a latent, low-dimensional space that represents these processes very efficiently: a pupillary manifold. We elaborate on why assessing the pupillary manifold provides an alternative, appealing analytical solution for data analysis. In particular, dimensionality reduction returns scores that are (1) mindful of the relevant physiology underlying the observed changes in pupil size, (2) extremely handy and manageable for statistical modelling, and (3) devoid of several arbitrary choices. We elaborate on these points in the form of a tutorial paper for the functions provided in the accompanying R library “Pupilla.”",

          "abstract": "Selecting an appropriate statistical method is a challenge frequently encountered by applied researchers, especially if assumptions for classical, parametric approaches are violated. To provide some guidelines and support, we compared classical hypothesis tests with their typical distributional assumptions of normality and homoskedasticity with common and easily accessible alternative inference methods (HC3, HC4, and six bootstrap methods) in the framework of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The method’s performance was assessed for four different regression models with varying levels of non-normality and heteroskedasticity of errors, and for five different sample sizes ranging from 25 to 500 cases. For each scenario, 10,000 samples of observations were generated. Type I error and coverage rates, power, and standard error bias were examined to assess the methods’ performance. No method considered here performed satisfactorily on all accounts. Using HC3 or HC4 standard errors, or a wild bootstrap procedure with percentile confidence intervals, could yield reliable results in many, but not all, scenarios. We suppose that, in the case of assumption violations, researchers might refer to a method that performed best in a scenario most similar to their data situation. To aid the selection of an appropriate method, we provide tables comparing relative performances in all considered scenarios.",

          "authors": "Jesse Boot, Jill de Ron, Jonas Haslbeck, Sacha Epskamp",
          "abstract": "In psychological studies, it is common practice to select a sample based on the sum score of the modeled variables (e.g., based on symptom severity when investigating the associations between those same symptoms). However, this practice introduces bias if the sum score selection imperfectly defines the population of interest. Here, we propose a correction for this type of selection bias in the Ising model, a popular network model for binary data. Possible applications of our correction are when one wants to obtain (1) full population estimates when only the sum score subset of the data is available, and (2) improved estimates of a subpopulation, if we observe a mixture of populations that differ from each other in the sum score. In a simulation study, we verify that our correction recovers the network structure of the desired population after a sum score selection using both a node-wise regression and a multivariate estimation of the Ising model. In an example, we show how our correction can be used in practice using empirical data on symptoms of major depression from the National Comorbidity Study Replication ( N = 9,282). We implemented our correction in four commonly used R packages for estimating the Ising model, namely IsingFit , IsingSampler , psychonetrics, and bootnet.",

We found that White NFL players were less likely than Black NFL players to choose specific victim names (e.g., “Breonna Taylor”), were more likely to choose generic phrases de-emphasizing racism (e.g., “It Takes All of Us”), and were less likely to choose generic phrases highlighting racism (e.g., “End Racism”). Similarly, White NBA players were more likely than Black NBA players to choose phrases that de-emphasized racism (e.g., “Peace”), and less likely to choose those that emphasized racism (e.g., “Antiracist”).",

Is this because children are less speciesist—meaning they place less moral weight on mere species membership? Or is it because they give less weight to differences in cognitive capacity between humans and other animals? We investigated this in two experiments, presenting children and adult participants in the United States and Spain with moral trade-off dilemmas. These dilemmas involved individuals who varied in species membership (human vs. monkey) and cognitive capacity. Across both cultures, children were less likely than adults to prioritize humans over animals, regardless of cognitive capacity. In addition, participants tended to prioritize individuals with higher cognitive capacities, regardless of species membership—though this effect was less robust in children. Our findings suggest that children in these Western contexts are indeed less speciesist than adults, though they do not rule out developmental changes in the moral weight assigned to cognitive capacity.",

          "abstract": "Microaggressions require an inferential process for their aggressive intent to be recognized. Using approaches from pragmatics, especially relevance theory, we conducted experiments to examine factors predicted to influence perceptions of an utterance as a microaggression. Participants read scenarios describing an interaction between two people and indicated their perceptions of a target remark. We expected and found that an utterance was more likely to be perceived as a microaggression if (a) it occurred in a context for which its relevance was not clear, thereby prompting observers to infer an aggressive intent, and (b) the recipient was a person of marginalized status. Furthermore, these effects were larger for participants with a more liberal political orientation relative to those who were more conservative. This was due, in part, to variability in Theory of Mind capabilities and beliefs about microaggressions associated with political orientation.",

          "abstract": "Recent perspectives have challenged the view that left-wingers are less likely to derogate out-group members. Building on research demonstrating heightened out-group derogation by Progressive (vs. Traditional Liberal) left-wingers, we examined whether Progressives and Traditional Liberals differentially tolerate in-group dissenters on the issue of gender identity. Using reverse correlation, Study 1 found that the Progressive-generated face of J.K. Rowling (a prominent gender critical left-winger) was evaluated negatively, while the Traditional Liberal–generated face was evaluated positively. Study 2 found that in both abstract (general description) and concrete (public figure) presentations, faces of left-wing in-group members expressing gender critical views were judged more negatively than self-identification faces, with Progressive-generated gender critical faces evaluated more negatively than Traditional Liberals–generated faces.

          "abstract": "People’s beliefs about sexual minorities are intertwined with their beliefs about gender (i.e., the sexuality-as-gendered framework), leading to the prediction that the amount of friendly contact with sexual minorities will be related to one’s beliefs about gender. We test this prediction across two studies (total N = 860), to show that reported friendships with sexual minorities relate not only to beliefs about sexual minorities, but also to attitudes toward people who are gender atypical, beliefs about traditional gender roles and norms, and endorsement of different versions of sexism. Our findings indicate that the sexuality-as-gendered framework involves not only people’s cognitions in terms of beliefs and attitudes, but also the types of interpersonal relationships they maintain.",

          "abstract": "How does one attain meaning? Though pivotal to well-being, this question has been explored mainly within symbolic and philosophical domains, with little focus on its cognitive processes. We present a theoretical integration of meaning and attention, followed by five studies investigating their relationship in lab experiments and everyday life (total N = 1,654). Experimental findings indicate that meaning increased attention (Studies 1 and 3), and attention increased meaning, but only when meaning could be found in a stimulus (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3). An experience-sampling study further reveals a positive meaning–attention association at dispositional, situational, and cross-levels (Study 4). Across varied daily activities, participants reported greater meaning when they paid more attention. These studies also explored the interplay of meaning and attention with boredom, negative emotions, and subjective well-being. Together, our results suggest that paying attention during everyday activities can, in some instances, enhance the experience of meaning.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Pitt",
          "abstract": "To navigate complex physical environments, animals keep track of the spatial relations among objects using various reference frames, both body-based (e.g., left/right) and environment-based (e.g., east/west), but how these spatial representations interact remains unresolved. Whereas neuroscientific findings show habitual integration across reference frames, psycholinguistic accounts suggest humans use one reference frame at a time, as in speech. This article examines whether people spontaneously use two reference frames in the same action. When placing a single object in a two-dimensional array, adult participants ( N = 110) routinely used an environment-based frame to determine the object’s left–right position while using a body-based frame to determine its front–back position at the same time. Such hybrid responses were prevalent among both Indigenous Tsimane’ and educated U.S. participants, suggesting that people across cultures habitually construct compound cognitive maps to represent the multidimensional spatial relations that compose natural settings.",

          "abstract": "What are the risky choices people face in our complex and fast-changing world? This article reports on a series of population surveys in Switzerland ( N = 4,380) that collected those risky choices that are relevant in people’s everyday lives. Using this empirical basis, we developed an inventory consisting of 100 unique real-life choices to address open questions regarding the structure, life domains, and stability of the current ecology of risk. Moreover, a follow-up study ( N = 933) indicated some degree of generalizability of the construct of risk preference to the newly identified real-life choices. The five key insights that emerged from our analyses may be useful for researchers studying decision-making under risk and uncertainty (e.g., what criteria to use when developing novel measurement instruments) and policymaking in applied settings (e.g., addressing how swiftly the risks of modern life change).",

          "authors": "Sabrina M McKenzie, Amanda E Krause, Solange Glasser, Margaret S Osborne",
          "abstract": "Music listening can impact emotional well-being. However, self-compassion, an aspect strongly related to emotional well-being, is rarely discussed in music listening literature. Therefore, this study explored self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two hundred and ninety-six Australian university students ( M age = 19.32) completed a mixed-methods music listening and self-compassion questionnaire. The questionnaire included the Self-Compassion Short Form Scale along with an author-adapted version exploring the influence of music listening. Additional, open-ended questions probed self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences. Most participants (81.76%) reported self-compassionate experiences through listening to music during the pandemic. Template analysis examining people’s self-compassionate and uncompassionate music listening experiences resulted in an overlap of themes including emotional experience, connection , and music styles . Distinct patterns were found, such as positive outcomes in self-compassionate responses and negative outcomes in uncompassionate experiences. The inclusion of emotional release within uncompassionate responses demonstrates the complexity of the relationship between music listening and self-compassion. These findings highlight the need for further exploration into music listening and self-compassion, particularly in an everyday context beyond the pandemic.",
