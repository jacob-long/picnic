          "title": "Survey measures of metacognitive monitoring are often false",
          "authors": "Kit S. Double",
          "abstract": "Metacognitive monitoring is an extremely important ability that predicts a wide range of outcomes. However, do people have insight into their own metacognitive monitoring capacity? This study measured participants' perceived metacognitive monitoring abilities using a novel psychometrically validated questionnaire (Study 1) and then examined how well survey responses aligned with online measures of metacognitive monitoring (resolution, discrimination, sensitivity, efficiency) taken from confidence ratings participants made while performing a perceptual decision-making task and Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Study 2). We found a negative correlation between the questionnaire responses and many of the online measures of metacognitive monitoring – those who reported being better at metacognitive monitoring, in fact tended to be worse according to the online metacognitive ratings. This occurred because, in general, high self-perceptions of monitoring ability were, in fact, related to higher confidence and lower cognitive performance. These findings suggest that we may have inaccurate insights into our own metacognitive monitoring capacity and questionnaire-based measures of metacognitive abilities may be problematic as they may represent unrealistic self-perceptions.",

          "title": "Distribution-free Bayesian analyses with the DFBA statistical package",
          "authors": "Richard A. Chechile, Daniel H. Barch",
          "abstract": "Nonparametric (or distribution-free) statistics have been widely used in psychological research because behavioral data can be messy and inconsistent with the Gaussian model for measurement error. Distribution-free procedures only use categorical or rank information, so they avoid the problems of outliers and violations of distributional assumptions. Yet frequentist nonparametric procedures are still subject to the limitation of relative frequency theory, which stems from the founding assumption that population parameters cannot be represented by probability distributions. Bayesian statistical methods, by contrast, allow for prior and posterior probability distributions for population parameters, so they rigorously provide experimental scientists with a probability representation of the population parameters of interest. The Bayesian counterpart for a set of distribution-free statistical methods is a relatively recent development. This paper is a detailed discussion of the DFBA package of R functions, which is designed for doing distribution-free Bayesian analyses for the common nonparametric procedures. Included in the package are functions that enable the user to explore the relative power for computer-based data that can be sampled from nine different probability models. The distribution-free procedures have almost the same power as the t  test when the data are normally distributed, but for eight other alternative probability models, the distribution-free Bayesian procedures have greater power than the frequentist t .",

          "abstract": "Network science tools are becoming increasingly important to psycholinguistics, but few open-access data sets exist for exploring network properties of even well-studied languages like English. We constructed several phonological similarity networks (neighbors differ in exactly one consonant or vowel phoneme) using words from a lexicon based on the SUBTLEX-US English corpus, distinguishing networks by size and word representation (i.e., lemma vs. word form). The resulting networks are shown to exhibit many familiar characteristics, including small-world properties, broad degree distributions, and robustness to node removal, regardless of network size and word representation. We also validated the SUBTLEX phonological networks by showing that they exhibit contrasts in degree and clustering coefficient comparable to the same contrasts found in prior studies and exhibit familiar trends after extraction of a backbone network of nodes important to network centrality. The data release ( https://github.com/aldo-git-bit/phonological-similarity-networks-SUBTLEX ) includes 17 adjacency lists that can be further explored using the networkX package in Python, a package of files for building new adjacency lists from scratch, and several scripts that allow users to analyze and extend these results.",

          "authors": "Manuel Bohn, Julia Prein, Jonas Engicht, Daniel Haun, Natalia Gagarina, Tobias Koch",
          "abstract": "Parent report measures have proven to be a valuable research tool for studying early language development. Caregivers are given a list of words and are asked which of them their child has already used. However, most available measures are not suited for children beyond infancy, come with substantial licensing costs or lack a clear psychometric foundation. Here, we present the PREVIC (Parent Report of Expressive Vocabulary in Children), an open-access, high-quality vocabulary checklist for German-speaking children between 3 and 8 years of age. The PREVIC was constructed leveraging the advantages of item response theory: we designed a large initial item pool of 379 words and collected data from 1190 caregivers of children between 3 and 8 years of age. Based on these data, we computed a range of fit indices for each item (word) and used an automated item selection algorithm to compile a final pool that contains items that (a) vary in difficulty and (b) fit the Rasch (one-parameter logistic) model. The resulting task is highly reliable and shows convergent validity. The IRT-based construction allowed us to design an adaptive version of the task that substantially reduces the task duration while retaining measurement precision. The task – including the adaptive version – was implemented as a website and is freely accessible online ( https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/previc-demo/ ). The PREVIC fills an important gap in the toolkit of researchers interested in language development and provides an ideal starting point for developing converging measures in other languages.",

          "authors": "Olya Hakobyan, Paul-Julius Hillmann, Florian Martin, Erwin Böttinger, Hanna Drimalla",
          "abstract": "Social interactions are a fundamental aspect of human life, yet, their objective and naturalistic measurement remains challenging for scientific research. This challenge can be addressed using digital communication data. To this end, we have developed Dona, an open-source platform for donating messaging data from WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. Given the highly sensitive nature of messaging data, we ensure participant privacy through rigorous data minimization. Dona removes all sensitive information on the user side prior to donation, retaining only de-identified meta-data such as message length and timestamps. This paper presents an overview of the platform, a deployment guide, and example use cases. In addition, we evaluate the informativeness of minimized messaging data for studying social interactions with two approaches. First, we conducted a user study in which 85 participants donated their data, received visualizations of their messaging behavior and evaluated the informativeness of this visual feedback. Second, we performed a quantitative analysis using over 1500 donated chats to confirm whether minimized messaging data captures known aspects of human interactions, such as interaction balance, heterogeneity, and burstiness. The results demonstrate that minimized, de-identified messaging data reflects informative interaction features as assessed by both self-reports and objective metrics. In conclusion, Dona is a donation platform well suited for sensitive contexts in which researchers aim to balance participant privacy with the acquisition of objective and informative data on social interactions.",

          "authors": "Alaa Alzahrani",
          "abstract": "The majority of neighborhood calculators are restricted to one language. The limited availability of multilingual neighborhood calculators could pose challenges for conducting psycholinguistic research on low-resource languages. Therefore, this study introduced Jiwar, a database and calculator for neighborhood information across three levels (orthographic, phonological, and phonographic) across 40 languages. The database contains information for 24 linguistic and neighborhood measures, while the Python-based calculator allows users to compute more than 46 neighborhood measures for words and nonwords. This study further examined the Jiwar calculator’s instrument reliability and validity. Correlations with previous datasets across several languages suggested the strong reliability of two key Jiwar measures. Multiple-linear regression models revealed that a subset of Jiwar measures significantly predicted behavioral results in lexical decision and visual naming tasks, indicating the validity of the Jiwar calculator. Jiwar is an open-source, Python-based tool that is designed to expand to more languages and functions.",

          "authors": "Michael J. Sargent, Mara Casey Tieken",
          "abstract": "In previous work, respondents overestimated the size of the US Black population, while underestimating the White population. In the present study, we examined perceptions of the racial composition of more specific locations within the US, comparing relatively rural and urban locations to one another. We expected that observers would see more rural places as having smaller Black populations, and larger White populations, compared to less rural places, but these perceived differences would exist independent of actual variation in racial makeup. In three samples, US residents judged 70 locations, estimating their racial demographics, rurality/urbanness, and desirability. Study 1 ( N = 241) tested an all-White sample; Study 2 tested a White subsample ( n = 246) and a Black subsample ( n = 263).As expected, more rural locations were judged as having larger White populations and smaller Black populations than less rural locations, beyond any actual differences in racial composition. These results support the conclusion that the mental images that Black and White respondents have of rural and urban America are characterized by stereotypes of their populations. Public Significance Statement Academic and public scholarship has assumed that the meaning of the idea of “rural” is racialized, such that places judged as rural are thought of as White, and places judged as urban are thought of as Black, beyond any actual racial differences among locations. The present data confirm the operation of such biases, demonstrating them among both Black and White observers. The data also speak to how observers estimate the size of Black and White populations in specific locations, supporting the following conclusion: people’s judgments of the racial composition of the residents of places are a product of multiple, not entirely consistent, processes.",

          "authors": "Sami R. Yousif, Elizabeth M. Brannon",
          "abstract": "There are many ways to describe and represent the visuospatial world. A space can be described by its euclidean properties—the size of objects, the angles of boundaries, the distances between them. A space can also be described in nonspatial terms: One could explain the layout of a city by the order of its streets. Somewhere in between, topological representations—such as those commonly depicted in public-transit maps—capture coarse relational structure without precise euclidean detail, offering a relatively efficient, low-dimensional way of capturing spatial content. Here, we ask whether human adults quickly and automatically perceive such relations. In six experiments, we show that differences in simple topological features influence a range of visual tasks from object matching to number estimation to visual search. We discuss the possibility that topological relations are a kind of visual primitive that supports visuospatial representation.",

          "authors": "Kexin Xu",
          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to understand the relationships among self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, and self-worth of adolescent singers, and how each construct functions in high school choir. The second purpose was to understand the degree to which these constructs predicted singing participation after high school graduation. Participants consisted of 215 high school students enrolled in choir from five public high schools in the United States. The majority of participants reported their self-identified gender as female (61.9%, n = 133), with 27.0% reporting as male ( n = 58), and 11.2% preferring to indicate other ( n = 24). IBM SPSS Statistics 28 and Lavaan were used for data analysis. Physiological states were the only significant predictor of singing self-efficacy, p &lt; .05. A significant and positive relationship was found between self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation for singing. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the effect of self-worth on the relationship between self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation, revealing a significant and negative interaction effect in the model, p &lt; .001. Furthermore, the moderation model was a significantly better fit than the direct effect model, p &lt; .001. Participants’ plans to continue participating in singing were positively related to intrinsic motivation and mastery experiences.",
