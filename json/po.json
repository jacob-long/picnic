          "title": "External Cues and Policy Preferences: Rethinking the Drivers of Policy Positions",
          "authors": "Francisca Castro, Jennifer Oser, Fernando Feitosa, Nir Grinberg",
          "abstract": "At a time when the influence of external cues on opinion formation is gaining attention due to their relevance for preference formation, this research note investigates how external cues from political elites and close friends shape individual policy preferences. Building on prior studies by Barber and Pope (2019, 2024) regarding Donald Trump's impact on people's policy preferences during his 2017–2021 presidency, we examine whether this influence persists soon after Trump's first presidential tenure concludes in late 2021 through a survey experiment. We also assess the influence of a second external cue that has gained attention due to the growing role of social media in political processes: a close friend, who might also serve as a relevant figure for policy position formation. We find that Trump's liberal cues shift Republican preferences in a liberal direction, while close friend cues show diverse patterns, including some backlash effects where individuals adopt positions opposite to conservative friend advocacy. These effects vary with individuals' party identification, political knowledge, and social conformity levels. Individual characteristics moderate political elite influence, while peer influence operates through reactance mechanisms rather than conformity, revealing that social networks shape opinions through more complex pathways than commonly theorized.",

          "title": "Toward a Principled Workflow for Prevalence Mapping Using Household Survey Data",
          "authors": "Qianyu Dong, Yunhan Wu, Zehang Richard Li, Jon Wakefield",
          "abstract": "Understanding the prevalence of key demographic and health indicators in small geographic areas and domains is of global interest, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where vital registration data is sparse and household surveys are the primary source of information. Recent advances in computation and the increasing availability of spatially detailed datasets have led to much progress in sophisticated statistical modeling of prevalence. As a result, high-resolution prevalence maps for many indicators are routinely produced in the literature. However, statistical and practical guidance for producing prevalence maps in LMICs has been largely lacking. In particular, advice in choosing and evaluating models and interpreting results is needed, especially when data is limited. Software and analysis tools are also usually inaccessible to researchers in low-resource settings to conduct their own analysis or reproduce findings in the literature. In this paper, we propose a general workflow for prevalence mapping using household survey data. We consider all stages of the analysis pipeline, with particular emphasis on model choice and interpretation. We illustrate the proposed workflow using a case study mapping the proportion of pregnant women who had at least four antenatal care visits in Kenya. The workflow is implemented using the R package surveyPrev, and all reproducible code is provided in the Supplementary Materials. It can be readily extended to a wide range of indicators.",

          "title": "Continuity and Change in Trust in Scientists in the United States: Demographic Stability and Partisan Polarization",
          "authors": "Jonathan Schulman, James N Druckman, Alauna Safarpour, Matthew A Baum, Katherine Ognyanova, Kristin Lunz Trujillo, Alexi Quintana Mathé, Hong Qu, Ata Aydin Uslu, Roy H Perlis, David M J Lazer",
          "abstract": "Americans’ trust in scientists has been stable and high, relative to other political and social institutions, for the last half century (Krause, Brossard, and Scheufele 2019). Yet, underlying this stability lies a dramatic change such that a partisan gap has emerged, with Democrats exhibiting substantially more trust than Republicans. Fifty years ago, Republicans in fact exhibited more relative trust in scientists. This article explains this continuity and change. First, we demonstrate that the demographic correlates of trust in scientists have been remarkably stable for more than a half century: women, Black, rural, religious, non-college educated, and lower/working-class individuals exhibit less trust than their counterparts. Second, we show that the partisan relationship with trust in scientists has flipped (over that same time period) as low-trusting demographic strata shifted partisan allegiances. This is particularly the case when it comes to education and religiosity. Concomitant with the emergent partisan gap is a massive perceptual gap among Democrats, who perceive a partisan divide more than double its actual size. Democrats vastly underestimate Republicans’ trust in scientists. The enduring demographic basis of trust in scientists provides an opportunity to bridge partisan divides by addressing demographic inequities in the practice and application of science.",
