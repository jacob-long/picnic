          "authors": "Giacomo Lanfiuti Baldi, Andrea Nigri, Han Lin Shang",
          "abstract": "Understanding and modeling mortality patterns, especially differences in mortality rates between populations, is vital for demographic analysis and public health planning. We compare three statistical models within the age-period framework to examine differences in death counts. The models are based on the double Poisson, bivariate Poisson, and Skellam distributions, each of which provides unique strengths in capturing underlying mortality trends. Focusing on mortality data from 1960 to 2015, we analyze the two leading causes of death in Italy, which exhibit significant temporal and age-related variations. Our results reveal that the Skellam distribution offers superior accuracy and simplicity in capturing mortality differentials. These findings highlight the potential of the Skellam distribution for analyzing mortality gaps effectively.",

          "title": "Turing’s Children: Large Language Models and Imitative Intelligence",
          "authors": "Rafael C. Alvarado",
          "abstract": "This essay introduces and develops the concept of imitative intelligence implied by Turing’s foundational work on machine intelligence and connects it to the current generation AI agents based on large language models. Based on a close reading of Turing’s writings on machine intelligence, from the 1938 paper on the entscheidungsproblem to the 1950 paper on the imitation game, the Turing test is found to be more than an operational convenience; it reflects an implicit theory of the imitative and social nature of intelligence that informs his entire project of intelligent machine design. Moreover, the proported shortcomings of the Turing test—its reliance on language and emphasis on culture—turn out to be foundational to the success of LLM-based AI agents today. It is suggested that the design and regulation these agents is usefully framed by the perspective of the concept of imitative intelligence is inherited by them.",

          "title": "Performing Productivity: Exploring the Narratives of State-Funded AI Projects Over a Decade in Chile",
          "authors": "Claudia López, Francisca Luco, Mónica Humeres, Teresa Correa",
          "abstract": "Public funding plays a pivotal yet often overlooked role in shaping AI development, especially in Latin America. Drawing on sociological theories of performativity, we analyze 205 AI projects funded by Chile’s key public agencies, related to research, entrepreneurship, and creation, over the past decade. Through content analysis combined with a qualitative, heuristic procedure, we characterize five dominant narratives across state-funded AI projects, seeking to interpret the social meanings embedded within their descriptions considering their situated context. This method informs the articulation of five narratives: AI for productivity gains, as a transformative force, as a literacy need, for smart surveillance, and as situated and creative inquiry. Our findings reveal that AI for productivity gains has strongly dominated over the last decade. We argue that this narrative functions as a strategic mechanism for aligning legacy institutional interests with those of the actors seeking funding. By framing public funding as performative, this paper contributes to debates on how state-led narratives help shape technological development’s trajectory. It also emphasizes the interconnectedness of actors, political economy, and socio-technical dynamics concerning AI’s future.",

          "title": "Artificial Intelligence and the Social Scientist: The Mediation of AIfied Creative Sites",
          "authors": "Maxime Harvey",
          "abstract": "This article examines the mediating role of social scientists in the cultural integration and regulation of artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on the creative industries. Drawing on an ethnographic case study within a film cooperative, it identifies four modalities through which social scientists become enrolled in AI-related organizational processes: as middlemen linking theory and practice, as distributors facilitating the flow of agency, as coordinators bridging innovation and appropriation, and as hosts observing the reproduction of technical skills. Situated at the intersection of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Media Studies, the article rethinks mediation not as passive translation, but as an active montage of fragmented meanings, practices, and actors. It argues that AI is not merely an object of study but a distributed assemblage whose significance emerges through situated associations. By articulating how social scientists engage with AI through organizational consultation, cultural programming, and collaborative experimentation, this paper reframes the sociology of AI as a field of strategic, reflexive, and creative intervention. In doing so, it highlights the importance of problematizing mediation as a relational practice that connects cultural actors, technologies, and institutions in the evolving ordering of artificial intelligence.",
