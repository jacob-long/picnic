          "title": "Measuring Political Attitudes with Word Association",
          "authors": "Ze Han, Rory Truex, Naijia Liu",
          "abstract": "This paper advances the use of Word Association Tests (WATs), where respondents are presented with a series of cue words and asked to provide other words that come to mind as quickly as possible. Compared to standard approaches, WATs more directly map to psychologists’ understanding of the human mind. The paper develops and demonstrates the utility of word association through an analysis of Chinese citizens’ attitudes toward the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Empirically, we show how the collective “mental map” of the population tends to reflect regime narratives. Citizens who are CCP members and more educated are more likely to reproduce regime language. The paper provides a how-to guide for other political science researchers seeking to use word association.",

          "title": "An Audit of Social Science Survey Experiments",
          "authors": "Tamkinat Rauf, Jan Gerrit Voelkel, James Druckman, Jeremy Freese",
          "abstract": "Survey experiments have become a popular methodology for causal inference across the social sciences. We study the efficacy of survey experiment designs by analyzing 100 social science experiments—entailing more than 1,000 hypothesis tests—that were selected by experts via a competitive process and fielded on probability samples of US adults between 2012 and 2020. Inclusion in the analysis is only conditional on the experiment qualifying for data collection, and not in any way on study results or publication. Results show that less than a third of proposed hypotheses were supported by the data, implying many more null findings than ostensibly appear in the published literature. We find that the largest predictor of positive experimental results was sample size. This is somewhat surprising, given that experimental studies typically take power considerations into account prior to data collection. In our data, the importance of sample size stemmed from small effect sizes across studies (perhaps smaller than researchers may have anticipated), highlighting a tension between commonly used power calculi and determining what constitutes a “meaningful effect.” We also find that moderation hypotheses were rarely significant, and that using multiple items for outcome measures did not affect results as expected. But indicators of research experience predicted higher rates of positive results, suggesting that there may be some room for optimizing experiment outcomes by minimizing design errors.",

          "title": "A Measurement Gap? Effect of Survey Instrument and Scoring on the Partisan Knowledge Gap",
          "authors": "Lucas Shen, Gaurav Sood, Daniel Weitzel",
          "abstract": "Research suggests that partisan gaps in political knowledge with partisan implications are wide and widespread in the United States. Using a series of experiments, we estimate the extent to which the partisan gaps in commercial surveys reflect differences in confidently held beliefs rather than motivated guessing. Knowledge items on commercial surveys often have guessing-encouraging features. Removing such features yields scales with greater reliability and higher criterion validity. More substantively, partisan gaps on scales without these “inflationary” features are roughly 40 percent smaller. Thus, contrary to some prior research, which finds that the upward bias is explained by the knowledgeable deliberately marking the wrong answer (partisan cheerleading), our data suggest that partisan gaps on commercial surveys in the United States are strongly upwardly biased by motivated guessing by the ignorant. Relatedly, we also find that partisans know less than what toplines of commercial polls suggest.",

          "authors": "Md. Sayeed Al-Zaman",
          "abstract": "Social bots have played a significant role in shaping global political events, despite regions’ economic, social, and political differences. However, their presence and impact on social movements remain poorly understood, which underscores the need for further academic inquiry. Consequently, relying on the concept of computational propaganda, we conducted a computational analysis of approximately 1.30 million public comments on Facebook during the July Revolution of 2024 in Bangladesh, utilizing specialized methods for bot detection, network analysis, and topic modeling. Our findings indicate that 22.27% of the comments were likely generated by bots. We discovered a well-organized network of bots that utilized template-based message crafting, mass duplication of messages, and systematic distribution efforts to disseminate propaganda and control the narrative of the movement. The topics discussed by the bots varied according to the event’s timeline and intensity, closely mirroring real-time developments. This suggests that bots may have helped initiate and guide activities, or influence and amplify the dynamics and outcomes of the event.",

          "title": "How Centralized is Party Communication on Social Media?",
          "authors": "Tilko Swalve, Dominic Nyhuis, Christoph Hönnige, Merle Huber, Philipp Köker",
          "abstract": "Social media has become an indispensable tool for politicians, allowing them to bypass traditional media and party filters to directly communicate with voters. This presents both opportunities and challenges for political parties. On the one hand, politicians can personalize their message to resonate with local constituents. On the other, parties risk appearing disjointed with potential electoral consequences when they fail to present a clear message. To understand whether parties are able to ensure a coherent message in the new media environments, this study examines parties' retweet networks on Twitter in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom between 2017 and 2021. We argue that party communication remains predominantly hierarchical, particularly in larger parties. Party elites and official party accounts serve as focal points, creating content that gets disseminated by regular MPs. Unlike party elites, official party accounts play a role in amplifying regular MPs’ messages to a wider audience. We employ Exponential Random Graph Models to assess the structure of parties’ online communication networks, analyzing nearly 400,000 retweets. The results confirm the core predictions of our theory.",
