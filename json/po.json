          "authors": "Spencer Goidel, Bradley Madsen, Craig Freeman, Kirby Goidel",
          "abstract": "In this paper, we use data from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study to explore the relationship between partisanship, attitudes toward free markets, and corporate social responsibility. We find that while Republicans continue to express abstract support for free markets and business involvement in politics, they respond negatively to more specific descriptions of CEO activism, particularly when that activism is directed toward environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Overall, individual support for business involvement in politics depends on the noneconomic impact of corporate behavior. In this respect, our findings echo the literature on political tolerance: abstract support for free markets slips when applied to specific environmental, social, and governance contexts. Within this context, “business involvement in politics,” which Republicans support, translates into “corporate political activity,” which Republicans oppose.",

          "title": "Investigating the Origins of Status Threat among White Americans",
          "authors": "Spencer C Lindsay, Cody R Melcher",
          "abstract": "In the last decade and a half, the United States has seen a rise in right-wing nationalism. Status threat provides a compelling explanation as to why. As white Americans see changing demographics, more diverse imagery in American leadership, and increased interdependence globally, they fear that they are losing “their” country. Scholars, however, often see status threat as primarily symbolic rather than material. We argue that material concerns are also instrumental in shaping whites’ perception of status threat. We test this hypothesis using an original survey experiment in which some respondents are primed to think about symbolic or material aspects of status threat. Relative to the control, both groups express heightened levels of perceived threat from other groups, indicating that both material and symbolic concerns are instrumental in shaping perceptions of status threat. We additionally test whether Republican whites respond to this perceived threat by becoming more likely to endorse far-right, restrictionist immigration policies. Our findings on the latter question are mixed.",

          "title": "The Rhetorical “What Goes with What”: Political Pundits and the Discursive Superstructure of Ideology in US Politics",
          "authors": "Jon Green",
          "abstract": "In his foundational essay, Philip Converse (1964) alludes to a small class of political sophisticates who are influential in the social construction and diffusion of ideological belief systems. However, despite their importance to the nature of ideology in the public at large, there is little empirical research focusing on those select few involved in this process of “creative synthesis”—and work examining the rhetorical structures that cohere sets of plausibly independent issue stances is rarer still. I do so here using a novel dataset of tweets sent by roughly 1,000 of the most prominent political pundits in the United States from January through August of 2019. Using a combination of text and network-analytic techniques, I identify robust relationships between both how pundits discuss a wide range of political concepts and the extent to which this discussion is informative of their network-based preferences. I find that broad, organizing concepts such as partisan and ideological labels emerge as central in political discourse, facilitating indirect links between a wide range of issues. However, I also find that discussions of discrete policy issues and political concepts are highly informative of pundits’ latent preferences. This descriptive account of the discursive superstructure of ideology offers new evidence regarding how creative synthesis is conducted in practice.",

          "title": "Angry Politics: Populism and the Erosion of Political Support during Hard Times",
          "authors": "Daniel Auer, Markus Freitag",
          "abstract": "We argue that threat-induced anger is not a universal driver of populist attitudes and waning political support. Instead, we hypothesize that anger erodes democracy-relevant political attitudes only when a threat affects citizens’ norms and only when blame for said threat is attributed to the domestic political system. We corroborate our hypotheses using data from a unique survey experiment conducted in Germany in 2022, in which we vary the level of responsibility attribution and threat noxiousness by exposing respondents to different threats that were salient during the field phase. The results indicate that citizens differentiate whom they hold accountable, such that it is not necessarily the quality of the threat but the quality of the political response to the threat that determines the future of democracy.",

          "title": "Blame Attribution, Partisanship, and Federalism: Evidence from a Panel Survey",
          "authors": "Matthew J Uttermark, Jack Mewhirter, Rebecca Sanders, Danielle M McLaughlin",
          "abstract": "When disaster strikes in federal systems, who do citizens blame and why? Partisan blame attribution (PBA) suggests that Republicans and Democrats hold consistent ideological preferences on which level of government should respond and receive blame for policy failures in times of crisis. Conversely, partisan federalism (PF) suggests that partisans will opportunistically assign blame to the level of government controlled by their disfavored party. Research on blame attribution has yet to assess which mechanism better explains patterns of blame attribution among individuals. We test each mechanism to evaluate patterns of blame attribution related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging panel survey data collected before the 2020 election and after the 2021 presidential transition, we find that Democrats uniformly follow PF expectations, whereas Republicans follow both PBA and PF expectations. We conclude that scholars should revisit blame attribution and more carefully consider the role of federalism in determining citizen preferences.",
