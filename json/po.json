          "authors": "Seo Yoon Lee, Heejae Lee, Sunho Park",
          "abstract": "Climate change’s dire effects call for fostering a belief in it through accurate information. This research investigates how YouTube, enabling selective and like-minded information exposure, influences climate change beliefs based on political orientations. Additionally, this study aimed to ascertain whether YouTube significantly facilitated like-minded climate change information exposure and impacted climate change beliefs among individuals leaning toward specific political orientations by comparing it with broadcast news use. We also examined the politicization effect by contrasting the United States and South Korea. Findings revealed that U.S. conservatives consuming broadcasted information exhibited stronger climate change beliefs, linking to increased risk perception and pro-environmental actions. However, YouTube did not show a significant association with beliefs in climate change, and neither did political orientation significantly moderate this relationship. In South Korea, political orientation did not play a significant role in the associations between YouTube and broadcast news use on climate change belief. Further theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "title": "Anxious But Hesitant to Act: The Impact of Concurrent Priming of the Climate Crisis and the War in Ukraine on Public Support",
          "authors": "Jakob Dreyer, Søren Damsbo-Svendsen",
          "abstract": "Decision-makers and commentators are calling Europe’s present political predicament a polycrisis: a period of overlapping, urgent, and mutually reinforcing crises with climate change and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as key challenges. Our knowledge about how citizens perceive and respond to polycrisis is limited. This paper presents a preregistered survey experiment from Denmark with 4,017 nationally representative respondents. We study crisis perceptions and willingness to act for the climate and Ukraine after concurrently priming both issues. Overall, threat perceptions increase, but so does inaction. Climate change drives increases in threat perception and worry, while the war in Ukraine drives a reduction in willingness to act and pay. The results challenge the “finite pool of worry” hypothesis, which presupposes that worry about new, urgent threats will crowd out worry about existing problems, especially in the case of climate change. Rather, willingness to act under polycrisis is issue-specific and shaped by concrete pocketbook costs, as the experimental evidence illustrates. The results also have important policy implications at a time when decision-makers frequently justify political action through polycrisis discourse.",

          "title": "Analyzing Potential Non-Ignorable Selection Bias in an Off-Wave Mail Survey Implemented in a Long-Standing Panel Study",
          "authors": "Heather M Schroeder, Brady T West",
          "abstract": "Typical design-based methods for weighting probability samples rely on several assumptions, including the random selection of sampled units according to known probabilities of selection and ignorable unit nonresponse. If any of these assumptions are not met, weighting methods that account for the probabilities of selection, nonresponse, and calibration may not fully account for the potential selection bias in a given sample, which could produce misleading population estimates. This analysis investigates possible selection bias in the 2019 Health Survey Mailer (HSM), a sub-study of the longitudinal Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The primary HRS data collection has occurred in “even” years since 1992, but additional survey data collections take place in the “off-wave” odd years via mailed invitations sent to selected participants. While the HSM achieved a high response rate (83 percent), the assumption of ignorable probability-based selection of HRS panel members may not hold due to the eligibility criteria that were imposed. To investigate this possible non-ignorable selection bias, our analysis utilizes a novel analysis method for estimating measures of unadjusted bias for proportions (MUBP), introduced by Andridge et al. in 2019. This method incorporates aggregate information from the larger HRS target population, including means, variances, and covariances for key covariates related to the HSM variables, to inform estimates of proportions. We explore potential non-ignorable selection bias by comparing proportions calculated from the HSM under three conditions: ignoring HRS weights, weighting based on the usual design-based approach for HRS “off-wave” mail surveys, and using the MUBP adjustment. We find examples of differences between the weighted and MUBP-adjusted estimates in four out of ten outcomes we analyzed. However, these differences are modest, and while this result gives some evidence of non-ignorable selection bias, typical design-based weighting methods are sufficient for correcting for it and their use is appropriate in this case.",

          "abstract": "Past research demonstrates that the working poor are politically relevant, yet little is known about public opinion toward this group. This research note explores public beliefs about working poverty in the United States. The results suggest that most Americans are aware of the working poor and view working poverty as problematic and due to structural factors. Like many political attitudes, beliefs about the working poor are linked to Americans’ personal experiences—namely, their level of local exposure to low-income people. However, consistent with research on the role of race in shaping the politics of poverty and inequality, the linkage between local low-income populations and beliefs about the working poor is conditioned by the race of the local poor. Finally, the political relevance of beliefs about the working poor is illustrated by their substantively large relationships to preferences over spending on the poor and taxing the rich.",

          "title": "Partisanship and Older Americans’ Engagement with Dubious Political News",
          "authors": "Benjamin Lyons, Jacob M Montgomery, Jason Refiler",
          "abstract": "Studies based on digital trace data show that older Americans visit and share dubious news sources far more often than younger cohorts, tendencies often attributed to lower levels of digital literacy. At the same time, survey experiments show that older Americans are no worse, if not better, at discerning between false and accurate news. If older Americans can identify misleading news content equally well, why are they still more likely to engage with it in observational settings? In this article, we combine survey measures and digital trace data for three nationally representative samples (N = 9,944) to argue that the existing literature overemphasizes the importance of factors like digital literacy relative to standard political variables such as political interest and partisanship, factors known to increase across the lifespan. Calcified partisanship in particular makes older Americans vulnerable to hyperpartisan news—which is highly slanted but not verified as explicitly false. High rates of engagement with this category of content, which has been examined in survey studies of older citizens less regularly in the literature, may partially explain the high rates of engagement with dubious news domains in behavioral trace data. In all, our findings have important implications for how we understand—and might intervene to reduce—high engagement among this cohort with dubious news.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrate that politicians’ issue positions and rhetorical style have grown increasingly extreme. It remains unclear, however, whether extremity pays off electorally. Using two preregistered conjoint experiments conducted in the United States (N = 2,006) and Israel (N = 1,999), we investigate whether citizens reward or penalize candidates for taking extreme positions (i.e., proposing radical solutions to societal problems) and using an extreme rhetorical style (i.e., communicating in a way that signals rigidity and dogmatism). The results are consistent in showing that extremity is costly for candidates. Across countries, citizens penalize both in-party and out-party candidates for both extreme positions and an extreme rhetorical style, and the average penalty for being extreme is a 16-percentage-point decrease in candidate support. Our results are in line with scholarship demonstrating that citizens disapprove of elite extremity. They also indicate that citizens react independently to elites’ substantive policy positions and their communication style.",

          "authors": "Levente Littvay, Jennifer L McCoy, Gabor Simonovits",
          "abstract": "There is a growing worry about the health of American democracy, and political scientists and pundits alike are looking for possible explanations. Surveys conducted during the Trump presidency showed considerable citizen support for liberal democratic norm erosions, especially among Republicans. However, recent experimental research also shows that voters of both parties are more tolerant of norm erosion committed by politicians of the party they prefer. In this note, we aim to reconcile these contradictory findings by analyzing surveys spanning from 2006 to 2021 on the public’s tolerance of executive concentration of power. We also collect original data under both the Trump and Biden administrations gauging support for a broad array of liberal democratic norm erosions. Support for such erosions, in fact, has been relatively similar across Democrats and Republicans once we account for the party of the president. Support for executive aggrandizement has been prevalent among supporters of the president’s party at least since the second term of the Bush administration. Increased checks and balances on the executive, through divided government, amplifies this effect further. Taken together, these findings suggest that universal support for the liberal democratic status quo has been weaker among those who support the president’s party, well before and since the Trump presidency.",

          "title": "Reducing Racial Asymmetries in the Survey Overestimation of Voter Turnout",
          "authors": "David C Barker, Ray Block, Marcus Johnson, Jan Leighley",
          "abstract": "Research has consistently demonstrated that Black respondents are more likely than their White counterparts to overstate their plans or previous decisions to vote. We propose that by using a single question regarding turnout intention and candidate preference (rather than the typical approach of using two separate questions), survey researchers can reduce these racial asymmetries. The reason, we suggest, is that doing so encourages Black respondents to consider the turnout question through the lens of candidates and parties, rather than as a civic responsibility they have toward other Black Americans, which therefore mitigates the social desirability bias that leads to overestimation. We evaluate this argument using a survey experiment that randomly asks a control group of survey respondents to answer two voting questions—one about turnout and one about vote choice—and asks the other half of the sample, the treatment group, a single question that combines the two. Using original data from a nationally representative survey, we find that using the single turnout/preference question reduces the racial asymmetry in turnout overestimation substantially. We further observe that the decrease is concentrated among respondents with relatively high levels of campaign indifference and especially racial civic consciousness, a condition that is much more common among Black respondents than among White respondents. We believe these findings are particularly relevant to election scholars and campaign professionals, given their focus on understanding the thought processes of survey respondents and prospective voters, as well as improving the validity of self-reports in survey research.",

          "title": "The Curious Case of Black “Conservatives”: Assessing the Validity of the Liberal-Conservative Scale among Black Americans",
          "authors": "Hakeem Jefferson",
          "abstract": "Many Black Americans identify as conservative on surveys, despite their allegiance to the Democratic Party. Prominent theoretical accounts claim this mismatch results from identity-based considerations. I revisit this long-standing puzzle and offer an alternative explanation with broad implications for studying political attitudes and behavior across the social sciences. Leveraging data from the American National Election Studies, I demonstrate that the terms “liberal” and “conservative” are unfamiliar to many Black Americans, compromising the usefulness and validity of the liberal-conservative scale for Black respondents. Respondents unfamiliar with these terms misapply them and choose ideological labels that fail to align with their partisan preferences. Consequently, scholars and political actors make incorrect and imprecise inferences about the contours of Black politics. Findings also raise new concerns about the generalizability of claims that rely on ideological self-identification measures, including popular claims about mass polarization and partisan-ideological sorting among the American public. Critically, this work suggests a need for caution when using concepts that vary in their meaningfulness across social groups.",

          "abstract": "Is anti-far-right grassroots mobilization effective? Scholars studying the far right have focused extensively on the causes and consequences of far-right success but have paid little attention to what citizens and civil society can do to tackle this phenomenon. Focusing on the surge of Sardine (the Sardines), an anti-far-right social movement, during the 2020 Italian regional elections, we test whether grassroots mobilization is an effective tool to curb far-right parties’ electoral performance. Employing municipality-level data on electoral results, Sardines rallies, and far-right events, we exploit a difference-in-differences design to identify the effect of local exposure to Sardine mobilization on the municipal electoral performance of far-right parties. The results suggest that local exposure to a Sardines event has a strong negative effect on far-right electoral results.",
