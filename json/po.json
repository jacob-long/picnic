          "authors": "Alain Quartier-la-Tente",
          "abstract": "This paper examines and compares real-time estimates of the trend-cycle component using moving averages constructed with local polynomial regression. It enables the reproduction of Henderson’s symmetric and Musgrave’s asymmetric filters used in the X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment algorithm. This paper proposes two extensions of local polynomial filters for real-time trend-cycle estimates: first including a timeliness criterion to minimize the phase shift; second with procedure for parametrizing asymmetric filters locally while they are generally parametrized globally, which can be suboptimal around turning points. An empirical comparison, based on simulated and real data, shows that modeling polynomial trends that are too complex introduces more revisions without reducing the phase shift, and that local parametrization reduces the delay in detecting turning points and reduces revisions. The results are reproducible and all the methods can be easily applied using the R package rjd3filters.",

          "authors": "Shalima Zalsha, Kirk M. Wolter",
          "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating a time series of population means from a series of sample surveys when the means are known to be nondecreasing. We introduce the standard survey estimators of the series of means, which are not guaranteed to be nondecreasing. We employ the Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm (PAVA) to turn the series of standard survey estimates into a nondecreasing series. We introduce five methods of constructing confidence intervals for the series of non-decreasing means: normal-theory intervals based on the standard survey point estimator of the mean and the Taylor series estimator of its variance; normal-theory intervals based on the nondecreasing PAVA estimator of the mean and a unique jackknife estimator of its variance developed here (jackknife-[Formula: see text]); intervals similar to the aforementioned method but based on Student’s-[Formula: see text] distribution (jackknife-[Formula: see text]); analytical intervals due to Morris; and simultaneous confidence limits due to Korn. We report the results of a Monte Carlo simulation and assess the methods’ performance under various scenarios. Jackknife-[Formula: see text] intervals exhibited coverage probabilities that are near the nominal value. Taylor, jackknife-[Formula: see text], and Korn intervals found coverage below the nominal value while Morris intervals were excessively conservative. Jackknife intervals were much narrower than Taylor intervals.",

          "authors": "Patrick M. Joyce, Tucker S. McElroy",
          "abstract": "Published survey data often are delivered as estimates computed over an epoch of time. Customers may desire to obtain survey estimates corresponding to epochs, or time points, that differ from the published estimates. This “change of support” problem can be addressed through the use of continuous-time models of the underlying population process, while taking into account the sampling error that survey data is subject to. The application of a Continuous AutoRegressive Moving Average (CARMA) model is investigated as a tool to provide change of support applications, thereby allowing interpolation for published survey estimates. A simulation study provides comparisons of competing estimation methods, and a synthetically constructed data set is developed in order to elucidate real data applications. The proposed method can be successful for change of support problems, despite modeling challenges with the CARMA framework.",

          "authors": "Dana Garbarski, Jennifer Dykema, James A Yonker, Rosie Eungyuhl Bae, Rachel A Rosenfeld",
          "abstract": "While researchers have some recommendations for measuring gender identity in surveys based on research and other sources that are summarized in a series of working group and panel reports, we continue to refine our understanding and practices. Gender identity is usually measured in surveys using a categorical selection response format with a small number of response options (e.g., “female,” “male,” “nonbinary”) and an open text response field to capture additional responses (“not listed, please tell us”). There is limited research guiding researchers on the use of other response formats. This study reports results from a between-subjects experiment embedded in a campus climate survey about university students’ attitudes about their campus and their behaviors and experiences related to inclusion and belonging at a large Midwestern university in 2021. Over 13,000 students were asked “What is your gender?” and subsequently randomly assigned to respond using either a categorical selection response format or an open response format (i.e., a place to specify their gender with no response options listed). We examine the distribution of responses, item nonresponse, response times, and concurrent validity (in terms of the association between gender and relevant survey outcomes) across the two response formats. Findings indicate the categorical selection response format is preferred for this population. While results show similar distributions in the categorization of responses across the formats and similar relationships with other survey outcomes, the selection format is associated with less item nonresponse and shorter response times.",
