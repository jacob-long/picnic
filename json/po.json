          "abstract": "Digital media constitute a key space for the negotiation of public opinion. Despite long-standing research on public opinion climates on digital media, little theory exists that considers their emergence and discursive dynamics. In this article, we conceptualize public opinion negotiations in a digital media ecosystem as a discursive process aimed at delimiting the latitude of normatively acceptable opinions. Building upon theoretical work on predigital media, we distill five enduring aspects to characterize digitally mediated public opinion negotiations as (a) the public expression of (b) normative opinions upon public issues by (c) positioned speakers, resulting in (d) the public negotiation of acceptable stances (e) within digitally mediated public arenas governed by institutional and sociotechnical media logics. Discussing how digital media shape this discursive process, we propose a theory of public opinion negotiations in a digital media ecosystem, flagging operational implications for the empirical study of public opinion processes on digital media.",

          "authors": "Eyal Rubinson, Gal Bitton-Alayof",
          "abstract": "Do electoral outcomes influence public support for the winning candidate's policy agenda? While voters are often assumed to evaluate candidates based on policy alignment, research suggests that partisan identity frequently overrides rational assessment. However, the extent to which the identity of the electoral winner legitimizes policy positions—particularly in the domain of foreign policy—remains underexplored. This research note leverages the 2024 U.S. presidential election as a natural experiment, using a preregistered two-wave panel survey to assess whether electoral victory influences public perceptions of the winning candidate's platform. Results reveal a moderate “winner effect”: Democratic voters exhibited an increase in support for Trump's foreign policy positions postelection, while support for Harris declined, even among her base. Nevertheless, winner effects produced shifts in foreign policy preferences commensurate with those on a highly salient domestic issue, challenging assumptions about greater volatility in foreign policy. Furthermore, preelection candidate support conditioned postelection stability, with winning-party supporters maintaining greater consistency. While electoral victories enhance the perceived legitimacy of the winner's platform, partisan identity remains the primary constraint, limiting large-scale ideological realignment.",

          "authors": "Silvia Russo, Fanny Lalot, Michele Roccato",
          "abstract": "There is a dearth of research into the combined effect of political trust and societal concern on preferences for different models of governance. Using a quota sample of the Italian adult population surveyed in October 2021 (N = 1,151), we conducted two moderated regressions to predict the support for technocratic and authoritarian governance as a function of trust in epistemic and nonpartisan institutions, health and economic concerns, and their interactions. Consistent with a distrustful complacency hypothesis, which predicts an interactive effect of trust and concern, support for technocratic governance was the lowest among participants who had low trust in epistemic institutions and were not concerned about the health consequences of COVID-19. In addition, support for authoritarian governance was the lowest among those who had high trust in nonpartisan institutions and were not concerned about the economic consequences of COVID-19. This study therefore expands the distrustful complacency hypothesis, applying it for the first time to governance preferences and thus adding to the literature on trust in institutions. We discuss limitations, strengths, and possible developments.",

          "abstract": "Predictive AI models increasingly guide high-stakes institutional decisions across domains from criminal justice to education to finance. A rich body of interdisciplinary scholarship has emerged examining the technical choices made during the creation of these systems. This article synthesizes this emerging literature for a sociology audience, mapping key decision points in predictive AI development where diverse forms of sociological expertise can contribute meaningful insights. From how social problems are translated into prediction problems, to how models are developed and evaluated, to how their outputs are presented to decision-makers and subjects, we outline various ways sociologists across subfields and methodological specialities can engage with the technical aspects of predictive AI. We discuss how this engagement can strengthen theoretical frameworks, expose embedded policy choices, and bridge the gap between model development and use. By examining technical choices and design processes, this agenda can deepen understanding of the reciprocal relationship between AI and society while advancing broader sociological theory and research.",
