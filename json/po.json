          "title": "Nowcasting in Triple-System Estimation",
          "authors": "Daan B. Zult, Peter G. M. van der Heijden, Bart F. M. Bakker",
          "abstract": "Multiple systems estimation uses samples that each cover part of a population to obtain a total population size estimate. Ideally, all available samples are used, but if some samples are available (much) later, one may use only the samples that are available early. Under some regularity conditions, including sample independence, two samples are enough to obtain an asymptotically unbiased population size estimate. However, the assumption of sample independence may be unrealistic, especially when the samples are derived from administrative sources. The assumption of sample independence can be relaxed when using three or more samples, which is therefore generally recommended. This may be a problem if the third sample is available much later than the first two samples. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new approach that deals with this issue by utilizing older samples, using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm. This leads to a population size nowcast estimate that is asymptotically unbiased under more relaxed assumptions than the estimate based on two samples. The resulting nowcasting model is applied to the problem of estimating the number of homeless people in The Netherlands, leading to reasonably accurate nowcast estimates.",

          "title": "The Role of Physical Appearance Comparison, Self-Esteem, and Emotional Control in the Association Between Social Media Addiction and Masculine Depression",
          "authors": "Maya Kagan, Uzi Ben-Shalom, Michal Mahat-Shamir",
          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of daily life, shaping behaviors, self-perception, and emotional well-being. However, its addictive use raises concerns about its potential to aggravate psychological challenges, particularly in the context of societal expectations of masculinity. The current report presents a study exploring the pathways through which social media addiction contributes to masculine depression, specifically examining the roles of physical appearance comparison, self-esteem, and emotional control among men. By investigating these relationships, it aims to provide insights into the psychological consequences of social media addiction for men. Structured questionnaires were administered to 849 Israeli men aged 18 and older. Employing a moderated sequential mediation model with social media addiction as the independent variable, physical appearance comparison and self-esteem as mediators, and masculine depression as the dependent variable, this study also investigates emotional control as a moderator in the associations between social media addiction, physical appearance comparison, self-esteem, and masculine depression. The analysis, conducted using model 89 PROCESS v4.2 macro, reveals that conforming to the masculine norm of emotional control intensifies menâ€™s vulnerability to distress resulting from maladaptive behaviors such as social media addiction, which can lead to masculine depression. Furthermore, addiction to social media can trigger masculine depression via psychosocial factors such as physical appearance comparison and low self-esteem, which have yet to be explored in the context of masculine depression. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions that address the societal pressures of masculinity and the psychological repercussions of excessive social media use among men. They also emphasize the necessity of raising awareness about these issues among both the public and therapists.",

          "title": "Survey on Deep Learning for Misinformation Detection: Adapting to Recent Events, Multilingual Challenges, and Future Visions",
          "authors": "Ansam Khraisat,  Manisha, Lennon Chang, Jemal Abawajy",
          "abstract": "The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has emerged as a pervasive and pressing challenge, threatening the integrity of information dissemination across online platforms. In response to this growing concern, this survey paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the landscape of misinformation detection methodologies. Our survey delves into the intricacies of model architectures, feature engineering, and data sources, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach. Despite significant advancements in misinformation detection, this survey identifies persistent challenges. The paper accentuates the need for adaptive models that can effectively tackle rapidly evolving events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Language adaptability remains another substantial frontier, particularly in the context of low-resource languages like Chinese. Furthermore, it draws attention to the dearth of balanced, multilingual datasets, emphasizing their significance for robust model training and assessment. By addressing emerging challenges and offering a comprehensive view, our paper enriches the understanding of deep learning techniques in misinformation detection.",
