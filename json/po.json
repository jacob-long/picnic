          "abstract": "Lengthy web surveys can be burdensome for respondents to complete in a single session. This study experimentally examines the effects of different app-based surveys, some of which use a modular design, on perceived burden, breakoffs, and indicators of satisficing behaviors. Participants (n = 664) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) a browser-based web survey (control group), (2) an app-based survey, (3) a modular app dividing the survey into seven parts, and (4) a sequential modular app releasing modules at 48-hour intervals. Our findings indicate that administering surveys via apps can reduce the perceived burden of the survey task and improve response quality. Additionally, we find weak evidence that releasing modules individually over time can further enhance response quality, although this approach results in increased breakoffs between modules. The implications of these findings for the use of research apps and modular surveys are discussed.",

          "title": "AI and Aesthetic Alienation: The Image and Creativity in Contemporary Culture",
          "authors": "Naomi Smith, Clare Southerton",
          "abstract": "In this comment piece, we argue that mass-produced generative AI (GenAI) images, commonly referred to as “AI slop” should be considered a form of aesthetic alienation. Specifically, we focus on GenAI images of fall, arguing that GenAI images alienate not only artists from their art, but produces an alienating aesthetic in and of itself. Closely attending to the aesthetic registers of GenAI images opens up important sociological questions about the role of the image in contemporary society, and the affective logics of late capitalism. Finally, we highlight how GenAI images are profoundly implicated in the extractive and destructive materialities of late capitalism.",

          "title": "Towards a Socioeconomics of Hype: Hype Dynamics and Symbolic Boundary Work Within the Speculative AI Bubble",
          "authors": "Jason Bohner, Janet Vertesi",
          "abstract": "Drawing on interviews with 37 entrepreneurs, engineers, technologists and investors in the New York City tech scene involved in AI, we investigate the social formations that characterize “AI-hype” from the perspective of micro-level economic sociology. We observe how actors in New York draw symbolic boundaries between their own work and that of “hype-beasts” in San Francisco, despite drawing upon and profiting from the same sociotechnical imaginaries about AI’s transformative potential. We show how this symbolic boundary work serves to legitimate the local ecosystem, to provide moral valuations for the exchange of capital, to ground different temporalities that inspire urgency in their work, and to enact spatial boundaries amid competing sociotechnical imaginaries. We demonstrate how these contestations contribute to the construction of powerful relevant social groups and their respective technological systems. We thus use the case of AI to take steps toward developing a sociology of hype, drawing on literature in the sociology of technology, boundary work in the professions, and economic sociology.",

          "authors": "Xiaoti Yue, Hong Hong",
          "abstract": "Establishing a successful brand on online labor platforms is crucial for freelancers. It helps them attract clients and secure a steady stream of income. Freelancers can maintain their self-branding by adjusting the self-introduction text on their profiles. However, the style of self-branding that contributes to career advancement remains unclear. In this study, we examine the impact of analytical writing on building successful self-branding success. We use LIWC to analyze 7860 profile overviews from 1965 Upwork freelancers collected over four consecutive months. The empirical results show that a highly analytical writing style in these profiles has a negative effect on freelance earnings. Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneity of this effect. We find that higher education and more extensive experience of freelancers mitigate this negative impact, while higher job success scores and top freelancer badges amplify it. Our findings provide guidance for various stakeholders in the online labor market, including freelancers and platform owners, and contribute to the literature on the freelance labor market.",
