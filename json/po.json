          "authors": "Buthaina Al-Khelaifi, Lina Bader, Engi Elmaghraby, John Lee Holmes, Fahmida Naheen, Abdoulaye Diop",
          "abstract": "Since December 2010, when Qatar won the bid to host the FIFA World Cup 2022, scholars’ interests have mainly focused on the treatment of migrant workers whose skills and expertise are essential for Qatar's development. However, scholars also need to study nationals’ perspectives vis-à-vis expatriate workers and their impact on Qatar's social and economic landscape. In 2020, the Social and Economic Survey Institute partially replicated a 2012 survey that used a split-sample technique to explore Qataris’ attitudes toward high-skilled and low-skilled expatriates. As in the 2012 study, most Qataris perceived the number of migrant workers to be high. However, unlike the previous study, some citizens also indicated a need to increase certain groups of expatriates to support economic growth. Some important variables measured in the study, such as traffic congestion and openness to new cultures, showed statistically significant changes over the nearly decade-long period. Given the rarity of studies exploring nationals’ views toward expatriates, this replication provides unique insights into how these perspectives evolve alongside societal needs. Moreover, monitoring these trends assists policymakers in fostering a balanced economic and social environment.",

          "title": "Depression, Populism, and Presidential Approval",
          "authors": "Matthew A Baum, James N Druckman, Katherine Ognyanova, David Lazer, Roy H Perlis",
          "abstract": "Is there a relationship between depression and political evaluations? Building on existing work, we argue that experiencing depressive symptoms will positively correlate with supporting a populist politician and negatively correlate with supporting a nonpopulist officeholder. We evaluate these predictions with data from the United States, focusing on Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Our data are consistent with our hypotheses, and, as expected, we find particularly strong relationships for Democratic respondents. The results highlight the importance of considering mental health when studying the approval of politicians both in and out of office. We conclude with a discussion of next steps for a research agenda on depression and political evaluations.",

          "title": "Randomized, Controlled Trial Comparing Household Response and Completion Rates Using 1 and 2 US Dollar Unconditional Incentives in A Mail Push-to-Web Survey",
          "authors": "Jon Agley, Tiffany Neal, Mariah Benham, Lilian Golzarri-Arroyo, Naomi Swiezy",
          "abstract": "Household surveys are an important means of obtaining standardized data; unfortunately, response rates have been declining for decades. Evidence based on social exchange theory supports the use of small, unconditional monetary incentives (pre-incentives) to increase survey response and completion rates. However, the optimal pre-incentive amount is unclear. Our project team was contracted to conduct a large survey (census) of all households in Indiana at which an individual with a developmental disability who was on the waitlist for certain state-based services resided. In the absence of a clear answer from the literature about what pre-incentive amount to use, we preregistered a sub-study to obtain clarity. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing a $1 cash pre-incentive to a $2 cash pre-incentive in a large, mail push-to-web household survey in the midwestern US, examining both response rates and completion rates (&amp;gt;80 percent of the survey). We hypothesized that a $2 pre-incentive would result in significantly more responses and completed surveys than a $1 pre-incentive. Using 1:1 blinded allocation, 6,525 households were randomized to receive either a $1 or $2 cash pre-incentive. All other procedures were identical between study arms. Of the 960 valid responses, 467 were from Arm 1 ($1) and 493 were from Arm 2 ($2). Of those, there were 798 complete responses (&amp;gt;80 percent of the instrument). We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that there was a difference in either response (OR = 1.07, p = .361, 95 percent CI [0.929, 1.223]) or completion (OR = 1.07, p = .362, 95 percent CI [0.924, 1.242]) rates depending on the amount of pre-incentive included in the invitation. Although we provide multiple caveats and encourage caution when interpreting these findings, we suggest that individuals planning to use a small pre-incentive to encourage survey responses should not by default assume that a $2 incentive is superior to a $1 incentive.",

          "title": "Conceptualizing, Assessing, and Improving the Quality of Digital Behavioral Data",
          "authors": "Bernd Weiß, Heinz Leitgöb, Claudia Wagner",
          "abstract": "The spread of modern digital technologies, such as social media online platforms, digital marketplaces, smartphones, and wearables, is increasingly shifting social, political, economic, cultural, and physiological processes into the digital space. Social actors using these technologies (directly and indirectly) leave a multitude of digital traces in many areas of life that sum up an enormous amount of data about human behavior and attitudes. This new data type, which we refer to as “digital behavioral data” (DBD), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or the World Wide Web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, RFID sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). However, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. While data quality frameworks—such as the Total Survey Error framework—have a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of DBD introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. For example, most DBD are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. Hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of DBD. Furthermore, many forms of DBD lack well-established data models, measurement (error) theories, quality standards, and evaluation criteria. Therefore, this special issue addresses (i) the conceptualization of DBD quality, methodological innovations for its (ii) assessment, and (iii) improvement as well as their sophisticated empirical application.",

          "title": "Leveraging VLLMs for Visual Clustering: Image-to-Text Mapping Shows Increased Semantic Capabilities and Interpretability",
          "authors": "Luigi Arminio, Matteo Magnani, Matías Piqueras, Luca Rossi, Alexandra Segerberg",
          "abstract": "As visual content becomes increasingly prominent on social media, automated image categorization is vital for computational social science efforts to identify emerging visual themes and narratives in online debates. However, the methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently used in the field are unable to fully capture the connotative meaning of images, and struggle to produce easily interpretable clusters. In response to these challenges, we test an approach that leverages the ability of Vision-and-Large-Language-Models (VLLMs) to generate image descriptions that incorporate connotative interpretations of the input images. In particular, we use a VLLM to generate connotative textual descriptions of a set of images related to climate debate, and cluster the images based on these textual descriptions. In parallel, we cluster the same images using a more traditional approach based on CNNs. In doing so, we compare the connotative semantic validity of clusters generated using VLLMs with those produced using CNNs, and assess their interpretability. The results show that the approach based on VLLMs greatly improves the quality score for connotative clustering. Moreover, VLLM-based approaches, leveraging textual information as a step towards clustering, offer a high level of interpretability of the results.",
