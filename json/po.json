          "title": "Improving Real-Time Trend Estimates Using Local Parametrization of Polynomial Regression Filters",
          "authors": "Alain Quartier-la-Tente",
          "abstract": "This paper examines and compares real-time estimates of the trend-cycle component using moving averages constructed with local polynomial regression. It enables the reproduction of Henderson’s symmetric and Musgrave’s asymmetric filters used in the X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment algorithm. This paper proposes two extensions of local polynomial filters for real-time trend-cycle estimates: first including a timeliness criterion to minimize the phase shift; second with procedure for parametrizing asymmetric filters locally while they are generally parametrized globally, which can be suboptimal around turning points. An empirical comparison, based on simulated and real data, shows that modeling polynomial trends that are too complex introduces more revisions without reducing the phase shift, and that local parametrization reduces the delay in detecting turning points and reduces revisions. The results are reproducible and all the methods can be easily applied using the R package rjd3filters.",

          "authors": "James Wagner, Brady T. West, Brian Kim, Deji Suolang, Curtiss Engstrom, Jennifer Sinibaldi",
          "abstract": "Rising nonresponse and the increasing costs of conducting surveys are creating pressure on survey organizations to efficiently allocate resources. The challenge is to produce the highest quality data possible within a fixed budget. We use a stopping rule designed to minimize a function of cost and errors. The rule is based on the product of predicted costs and the predicted mean squared error of a survey estimate. We simulate the impact of implementing the stopping rule on the 2019 US Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), which is a longitudinal survey conducted every two years in the US using web, mail, and CATI. We vary the types of models used to generate the input predictions (parametric regression vs. nonparametric tree models) and the timing of the implementation of the rule. We found that the modeling approach made less difference, while the timing of the implementation of the stopping rule made a large difference in outcomes. The rule is multivariate and optimizes outcomes for two variables. It performed better for one variable, leading to reduced costs and only small increases in errors. The other variable had larger error increases.",

          "title": "A Monte Carlo Investigation of Confidence Intervals for a Nondecreasing Series",
          "authors": "Shalima Zalsha, Kirk M. Wolter",
          "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating a time series of population means from a series of sample surveys when the means are known to be nondecreasing. We introduce the standard survey estimators of the series of means, which are not guaranteed to be nondecreasing. We employ the Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm (PAVA) to turn the series of standard survey estimates into a nondecreasing series. We introduce five methods of constructing confidence intervals for the series of non-decreasing means: normal-theory intervals based on the standard survey point estimator of the mean and the Taylor series estimator of its variance; normal-theory intervals based on the nondecreasing PAVA estimator of the mean and a unique jackknife estimator of its variance developed here (jackknife-[Formula: see text]); intervals similar to the aforementioned method but based on Student’s-[Formula: see text] distribution (jackknife-[Formula: see text]); analytical intervals due to Morris; and simultaneous confidence limits due to Korn. We report the results of a Monte Carlo simulation and assess the methods’ performance under various scenarios. Jackknife-[Formula: see text] intervals exhibited coverage probabilities that are near the nominal value. Taylor, jackknife-[Formula: see text], and Korn intervals found coverage below the nominal value while Morris intervals were excessively conservative. Jackknife intervals were much narrower than Taylor intervals.",

          "authors": "Patrick M. Joyce, Tucker S. McElroy",
          "abstract": "Published survey data often are delivered as estimates computed over an epoch of time. Customers may desire to obtain survey estimates corresponding to epochs, or time points, that differ from the published estimates. This “change of support” problem can be addressed through the use of continuous-time models of the underlying population process, while taking into account the sampling error that survey data is subject to. The application of a Continuous AutoRegressive Moving Average (CARMA) model is investigated as a tool to provide change of support applications, thereby allowing interpolation for published survey estimates. A simulation study provides comparisons of competing estimation methods, and a synthetically constructed data set is developed in order to elucidate real data applications. The proposed method can be successful for change of support problems, despite modeling challenges with the CARMA framework.",

          "title": "Extending Cochran’s Sample Size Rule to Stratified Simple Random Sampling with Applications to Audit Sampling",
          "authors": "Siyu Qing, Richard Valliant",
          "abstract": "Audit samples are selected by businesses, institutions, government agencies, and other organizations to check the accuracy of financial reports and assess the quality of services provided among other reasons. A standard design used in auditing is stratified simple random sampling. Point estimates and confidence intervals for population values are usual products of an audit. Cochran’s sample size rule and its extension by Sugden, Smith, and Jones provided minimum sample size formulas for a simple random sample to ensure effective normal approximation and adequate coverage for nominal 95% confidence intervals of a standardized or Studentized sample mean. The purpose of this paper is to extend Cochran’s rule and establish a formula for the minimum sample size for the normal approximation and the use of traditional one-sided or two-sided confidence intervals to be acceptable for mean estimation in stratified simple random samples. We concentrate on variables that are at least partially continuous. Simulations are used to examine the performance of our sample size formula with a variety of skewed populations based on ones encountered in auditing.",

It turns out that Fisher indices can be considered as members of the infinite set of Martini indices. In particular attention is paid to the question to what extent these indices exhibit Consistency-in-Aggregation. This throws new light on the behavior of Fisher indices.",
