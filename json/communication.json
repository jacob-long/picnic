          "abstract": "Purpose This study seeks to understand what organizational changes are occurring within two vertical cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) implementations using socio-technical systems (STS) theory. Design/methodology/approach We conduct an exploratory field study of two business unit CRM implementations and collect data through field notes, emails, conversations and interviews. We apply STS theory and qualitative techniques to analyze the actors, structures, technology, tasks and their interdependencies. Findings Dependence on central IT significantly decreased for both units, but these vertical cloud-based CRM systems could not be implemented and maintained without expert IT actors. We found variations of IT expertise skills and dependence on central IT resulting in three differences: the business unit’s development processes, the ability to implement and maintain systems internally and CRM capabilities available to the business units. Extensive product research should be conducted prior to making decisions, implementation plans and goals. Business units should be cautious about vendor claims of self-sufficiency and no technical expertise requirement. Originality/value We extend the literature on user-led system implementations by studying implementation processes and applying Leavitt’s STS diamond to examine four interdependent dimensions. We apply Leavitt’s theoretical model as a tool to frame and guide our understanding of the differences and impacts of user-led implementations. We identify the activities for successful user-led cloud implementation and present propositions for organizations to consider when supporting user-led systems. When systems are supporting decentralized business processes, the implementation efforts will be complex and require more time to successfully implement a useable solution.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This research examines how digital communication technology can act as an intervention tool to develop online social capital and resilience when normal bonding and support reduces during crisis. Design/methodology/approach Using 21 semi-structured interviews, the experiences of women are explored to understand how they strengthened their capabilities to acquire support and achieve resilience during crisis. Findings Findings demonstrate different ways women developed their bonding and bridging social capital at personal, family and community level to seek online support and empower themselves to achieve disaster resilience. While the context of this study is pandemic, findings are applicable to other crisis scenarios. Originality/value The research enhances the importance of online social capital in developing agency, capabilities and resilience during crisis. It enables to understand how practitioners should not limit technology use to disaster preparedness and prevention, but it could also be used in responding and recovering from crisis.",

Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a privacy-preserving location data collection approach based on local differential privacy (LDP) and validates the feasibility of the approach through experiments on three real-world public check-in datasets. Findings The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which preserves privacy while retaining over 90% of the data utility. Practical implications This research has the potential to assist tourism practitioners in establishing improved collaborations with trusted third parties, enabling the exploration of user location data insights without undue concerns regarding indirect privacy breaches during data mining, thereby enhancing travellers’ experience and aiding businesses’ decision-making. Originality/value This paper is likely to be the first to represent a promising solution for addressing privacy leakage concerns related to non-sensitive data in data mining. It provides a location data collection technology that strikes a balance between user privacy and data utility for tourism practitioners.",

          "abstract": "Purpose In the current digital transformation era, guiding employees toward realizing self-leadership has become a critical strategy for enterprises to mitigate the risks of external uncertainty. This study explores the intrinsic relationship between enterprise social media (ESM) communication visibility and self-leadership on the basis of communication visibility theory (CVT) and conservation of resources theory (COR) to support the sustainable growth of employee self-leadership. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 332 Chinese employees across three stages. Hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method were employed to test the hypotheses. Findings Network translucence and message transparency positively affect self-leadership. Relational energy and job control mediate the relationship between communication visibility and self-leadership. Moreover, response expectations weaken the positive relationship between relational energy and self-leadership as well as between job control and self-leadership. Practical implications Managers can use ESM to provide work and social support for employees’ job control and social network development to achieve long-term maintenance of employees’ self-leadership. At the same time, within the context of ESM use, moderately reducing response expectations can offer situational support for employees to achieve self-leadership. Originality/value This research sheds light on the internal mechanism by which ESM communication visibility affects self-leadership and explores the key boundary conditions that impact how self-leadership is formed. These findings expand the understanding of self-leadership development in the context of ESM use and offer new technical insights for guiding and fostering sustainable employee self-leadership.",

          "authors": "Zhenya Tang, Leida Chen",
          "abstract": "Purpose Digital device recycling platforms (DDRPs) are customer-to-business online marketplaces that allow consumers to trade in or sell their used electronics, like smartphones and laptops, directly to a business for cash or credit. Guaranteed data destruction is a service provided by most DDRPs to securely erase all data on devices being recycled or traded in. Perceived credibility of the service refers to the extent to which customers are confident in the effectiveness and reliability of the service offered by a given DDRP. Grounded in privacy calculus theory, the current study aims to explore the influence of perceived credibility of guaranteed data destruction service (GDDS) on one’s intention to use a DDRP. Design/methodology/approach An empirical study was conducted through an online survey of Chinese DDRP users. The proposed model was tested by analyzing the collected data using the structural equation modeling approach. Findings Our results indicate that perceived credibility of GDDS affects users’ intention to use DDRPs by decreasing privacy concerns and increasing perceived convenience and environmental benefits of these platforms. Research limitations/implications This study’s findings are based on data collected from Chinese DDRP users, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other cultural or market contexts. Practical implications This study provides practical guidance for DDRPs, emphasizing the importance of enhancing perceived credibility through transparent data destruction practices and certifications. Originality/value The findings of the current study offer implications for theory development in sustainable information technology and e-commerce as well as practical suggestions for increasing usage of DDRPs.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore and understand the literature on digital transformation (DT) research that will lead to developing a conceptual and thematic structure of DT management. Design/methodology/approach The research approach employed a hybrid approach of bibliometric analysis and a structured review of DT management research studies from 2017 to 2023. Although systematic reviews and bibliometric analysis are distinct methods, they complement one another in research by enabling the synthesis and analysis of existing literature. Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) were selected as the bibliographic databases for this study since they are generally accepted as the most comprehensive data sources for various purposes. Findings Findings revealed 186 publications during these periods, with the top three publications being the Journal of Business Research , Business Horizons and California Business Review . Top-ranking researchers hailed from Germany, Japan and Spain. Keywords that appeared were innovation, digital transformation, artificial intelligence and DT. In the management area, there are fewer studies conceptualising DT management that led to this study forming a conceptual framework using a qualitative, interpretative and thematic analysis approach. Originality/value These findings are relevant for understanding the phenomenon of DT and DT management. The study contributes to the emerging body of knowledge in management and DT.",

          "authors": "Haiyuan An, Wenli Li, Yahe Yu, Zhen Wang",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines how default bias, driven by the default positive review (DPR) rule – which automatically classifies reviews not provided by consumers within a specified period as positive – and rebate bias, associated with the conditional rebate strategy (CRS), where sellers offer rebates exclusively to consumers who submit positive reviews, distort the distribution of online product reviews over time and impact consumer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach A key aspect of our method lies in developing latent variable models that capture the relationship between biased online reviews and consumer satisfaction levels. By applying our models to a panel dataset from Taobao – a leading Chinese e-commerce platform – and using insights from online consumer feedback surveys, we assess the extent of the biases introduced by DPR and CRS in a given feedback system. A hierarchical regression model was employed to investigate the impact of the proposed biases on consumer satisfaction. Findings Consumers who have previously written online reviews experience satisfaction outcomes 72.9% of the time with DPR and up to 81.3% when CRS is included. Implementing DPR may boost product sales to some extent, but it would significantly amplify consumer dissatisfaction, whereas offering a rebate could effectively alleviate consumer discontent, even though the rebate is conditional. Originality/value Our findings reveal the extent of biases introduced by CRS and DPR in online reviews and inform the consumer satisfaction debate regarding the phenomenon of excessive positive reviews resulting from these practices.",

          "authors": "Mahdi Abouei, Nima Kordzadeh, Maryam Ghasemaghaei, Bilal Khan",
          "abstract": "Purpose Users contribute to online communities by posting and responding to discussion threads. Nonetheless, only a small fraction of threads gain popularity and shape community discourse. Prior studies have identified several factors driving thread popularity; however, despite their prevalence, the role of emotional expressions within discussion threads remains understudied. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of thread starters’ valence and embedded discrete emotions of anger, anxiety and sadness on thread popularity, drawing on the negativity bias and the emotion-as-social-information theories. Design/methodology/approach Using two samples from Reddit, this study employs negative binomial regression analysis to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results demonstrate that negativity in thread starters significantly influences thread popularity; however, the expression of discrete emotions impacts popularity variously. In some contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccination subreddits, embedded anger in thread starters decreases thread popularity, whereas anxiety and sad expressions enhance it. In other contexts, such as professional discussions (e.g. r/Medicine subreddit), anger and anxiety expressions increase thread popularity, while sad expressions have no significant influence. Research limitations/implications The study is limited by its focus on specific emotions and contexts. Future research could examine a broader range of emotions, post-content modalities and the impact of cultural and linguistic differences. Originality/value This study contributes to theory by offering a new definition of thread popularity and enhancing our understanding of the impact of emotions in online discussions. It also provides practical implications for online community members and moderators seeking to promote discussion posts that help achieve community goals.",

          "abstract": "This research contributes to understanding how podcast intimacy shapes the evolving relationship between journalists and their audiences in the digital age. Intimacy in podcasting refers to creating a close emotional connection between journalist and audience, facilitated by this audio format and the growth of headphone—and earbud—listening. Podcasting allows for a more personal relationship, where journalists not only inform but also share emotions and experiences. However, this “emotional truth” can blur the boundaries between fiction and reality, raising ethical challenges regarding objectivity. Based on 14 semi-structured interviews with journalists producing daily news podcasts and documentaries, we examine how intimacy is constructed and experienced in these types of productions. Using a qualitative approach, we explore the boundaries of intimacy in journalists’ discourse, as well as the challenges it poses and the opportunities it offers for the production of news podcasts.",

          "authors": "Axelle Asmar, Tim Raats, Leo Van Audenhove",
          "abstract": "This article critically explores Netflix’s use of diversity as a strategic tool within its global production culture; it focuses on how the streamer increasingly deploys various narratives about diversity and inclusion to legitimate its presence, rationalize its operations, and normalize the industrial changes it generates. Through a critical discourse analysis of Netflix’s corporate communication—press releases and diversity reports published between June 2022 and February 2024—the study identifies four central discourses that shape Netflix’s approach. These discourses reveal that while Netflix positions itself as a socially responsible actor championing diversity and inclusion, its strategy intertwines cultural values with commercial imperatives. By appealing to local talents worldwide, Netflix’s rhetoric not only opens opportunities for underrepresented voices but also risks simplifying complex local identities to fit global market demands. The article concludes that Netflix’s approach to diversity, while progressive on the surface, may in practice constrain creative autonomy, subtly reinforcing existing global power structures and shaping diversity through a commercial lens.",

          "authors": "Natalia Vereshchagina, Irina Dushakova",
          "abstract": "The social media landscape is replete with images of animals that users share, repost, and like. The various nonhuman species that have become a part of the social media ecosystem are no longer merely models for different content formats but have their own accounts and become influencers almost like humans. Instagram’s gender-related politics do not regulate images of animals; one can hypothesize that pet accounts could serve as spaces, tools, and sources of creative content for gender representations free from stereotypes or undermining gender norms. This article aims to answer two main research questions: In what sets of actions is gendered human–animal identity performed in pet accounts? What curating strategies and platform tools are selected by owners to perform gender in pet accounts, within the limits of the platform affordances? To answer these questions, the article addresses three theoretical fields: (a) human–animal relationships, (b) the representation and performing of identity, and (c) the politics and affordances of digital platforms. Based on previous research in these fields, the authors suggest an analytical approach comprising account architecture (content of the header, saved/pinned stories, and relationships with other pet accounts) and account content (format in which content is created and presented). The empirical part is based on the analysis of six regularly updated accounts run on behalf of pets that were active at least three months prior to the beginning of the research.",

          "abstract": "This thematic issue examines the gendered dimensions of platform economies, focusing on the construction of gendered online selfhood. Through the affordances of social media platforms, users expand the range of topics and content accessible to the public, simultaneously exposing these subjects to increased visibility and potential debate. Platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, X, and Telegram enable anyone to create channels and publicize content on virtually any topic, fostering niche communities. In other words, platforms, driven by their pursuit of attention, time, and data, cannot be analyzed solely through a business or organizational lens. The economic dimension is intertwined with cultural formations—beliefs, values, and identity constructions—which carry an anthropological dimension. In this thematic issue, we are particularly interested in the gendered aspects of this intertwining.",
