          "authors": "Jiawei Sophia Fu, Katherine R Cooper",
          "abstract": "All actors engage in hybrid organizing. Grounded in constitutive approaches, this article reorients attention to hybridity by examining how actors combine multiple, often competing, constitutive elements in social impact organizing. Building on recent developments in communication research that challenge long-standing assumptions about organizing—and increased scholarly attention to social impact—we argue that hybrid stakeholders and hybrid processes play a central role in constructing social reality. To illustrate this argument, we draw on examples from three recently published studies to showcase hybrid organizing across diverse contexts. While this article focuses on hybridity of social impact organizing situated within organizational communication, we further discuss its relevance to diverse social phenomena and various subfields of communication (e.g., health, political, intercultural). We suggest that, given the prevalence of hybridity in social and organizational reality and its significance in shaping the future of work, a hybridity lens generates meaningful theoretical advancements and practical implications.",

          "authors": "Yukun You, Trine Syvertsen",
          "abstract": "Taking breaks from digital connectivity has become a common practice but we still have limited knowledge of which approaches are used and who uses them. This article explores how technological measures are used to take temporary breaks from smartphones and digital media. Technological measures include silent and airplane mode, turning off notifications, deleting and setting time limits on apps, downloading disconnection apps, and using a simpler phone. Based on two representative surveys from Norway (2018, N = 1046; 2023, N = 1142), the study shows a preference for simple measures – silencing, removing, and deleting – over complex tools like disconnection apps. Regarding socio-demographic differences, the article shows that younger, highly educated, and left-leaning people ‘use tech to beat tech’ to a higher degree. Furthermore, the study explores how the use of technological measures corresponds with how respondents assess their smartphone (over)use. The article adds to the body of nationally representative surveys in digital disconnection research and contributes to understanding how technological measures for disconnection have evolved and their popularity and use.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the causal impact of CEO digital vision within smart cities on tourism enterprises’ resilience and digital heritage preservation. Employing a Difference-in-Differences quasi-experimental design, we find that firms led by digitally visionary CEOs in smart cities experience significantly greater increases in revenue stability and faster recovery times, alongside enhanced digital heritage digitization and engagement. Heterogeneity analysis reveals these effects are more pronounced for larger firms. Furthermore, increased investment in digital infrastructure partially mediates this relationship, highlighting a key mechanism. Our findings highlight the critical role of strategic digital leadership in fostering robust and culturally engaged tourism sectors within evolving urban digital ecosystems, offering vital theoretical and practical implications for leaders and policymakers.",

          "authors": "Yang Liu, Yuan Chen, Yuchen Xu",
          "abstract": "Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally transformed workplace dynamics, compelling organizations to transition employees to work from home abruptly. Since corporate online forums played an important role as an online communication channel during the shift, this paper aimed to investigate the effect of enforced working from home (WFH) on employee engagement behaviors in such forums during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach Leveraging the Wuhan lockdown as a natural experiment, this study employed a year-to-year difference-in-differences approach to analyze a unique panel dataset from a large company. Findings We found that enforced WFH increased passive engagement but significantly reduced active contributions. We also found an interesting recovery effect: while the drop in contributions subsided within a month of adaptation, elevated login and free-riding behaviors persisted. Further heterogeneity analyses uncovered critical disparities: male employees contributed less, senior employees participated less in low-cost activities, while employees under a stricter containment policy exhibited a smaller decrease in contributions. Practical implications Our findings provide insights for organizations to design equitable engagement incentives, recalibrate forum management strategies, and prioritize mental health support in future WFH policies. Our results also inform policymakers on tailoring containment measures to mitigate unintended workforce online disengagement. Originality/value Our study advances WFH research by analyzing enforced remote work’s impact on corporate forum engagement during COVID-19. It also enriches pandemic-related literature by incorporating crisis-specific factors and highlighting recovery patterns and policy-driven heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate individuals dating intentions in the metaverse. The integrative model of behavioural prediction (IMBP) and behavioural reasoning theory (BRT) are used as underpinning theories to examine proposed hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach Using a sequential mixed-methods approach, this study begins with a qualitative study in phase 1 by conducting in-depth interviews. The insights gained from phase 1, along with pertinent literature, form the basis for constructing the conceptual framework research model. This model is then empirically validated in phase 2. A total of 318 responses were collected to examine the proposed hypotheses. The obtained data were analyzed via the structural equation modelling approach. Findings The results of this study reveal that social anxiety and anonymity are significantly associated with positive anticipated emotions. Further, the results also show that avatar customization, social anxiety and anonymity are significantly associated with negative anticipated emotions. Further, anticipated emotions are also associated with attitude and perceived norms towards dating in the metaverse. Moreover, attitudes towards metaverse dating and perceived norms towards metaverse dating are positively associated with dating intention in the metaverse. Finally, results show time spent in the metaverse as a significant moderator. Originality/value This research reveals how users approach dating in metaverse environments, drawing on BRT and the IMBP. These findings offer valuable insights for dating platforms seeking to enhance metaverse dating experiences.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates how firms’ social media strategies, including firm-initiated owned social media (OSM) and customer-generated earned social media (ESM) content, affect customer perceptions of quality, value and satisfaction. By analyzing sentiment across millions of social media posts and linking them to customer mindset data, we aim to provide insights for optimizing social media engagement and enhancing customer outcomes. Design/methodology/approach We analyze a large multi-year sample, combining over 250,000 customer survey responses and 3.5 million social media posts from 167 US consumer goods companies. Using a novel positive valence surplus (PVS) metric, we assess the impact of social media sentiment and engagement on customer perceptions of quality, value and satisfaction across posts from both firms and consumers on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter). Findings Both PVS and engagement positively affect customer perceptions for ESM posts, influencing satisfaction. For OSM posts, PVS is negatively related to user engagement, but engagement still improves quality perceptions. Overly positive OSM content leads to a backfire effect, particularly on Facebook, where it is more detrimental than on X. Originality/value This research utilizes PVS to measure the sentiment balance of social media content, which is a novel approach for assessing firm-initiated and customer-generated posts. Our unique dataset allows us to analyze the distinct impacts of OSM and ESM content on customer perceptions across two major social media platforms (Facebook and X). The findings provide actionable insights for managers to refine social media strategies.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores the antecedents of viewers' support provision in the live streaming context. Design/methodology/approach An online survey with 316 valid responses was conducted to test our research model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to assess the measurement and structural models. Findings The results show that functional congruity and self-congruity promote viewer support provision through establishing psychological contracts. Specifically, the transactional contract has a stronger effect on financial support provision, whereas the relational contract has a stronger effect on emotional support provision. Practical implications The findings encourage streamers and platforms to strategically engage with viewers who share a similar image with the streamer and to facilitate psychological contracts with them. Originality/value First, this study emphasizes the importance of both functional congruity and self-congruity in motivating viewer support provision. Second, it identifies psychological contracts as mediators to explain how dual congruity works. Third, this study examines the asymmetric effects of transactional and relational contracts on viewer financial support and emotional support provision.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Due to ChatGPT’s relative novelty, the determinants and consequences of trust in it remain largely unexplored, especially in the field of higher education. This research investigates how perceptions of AI can foster university students’ trust in ChatGPT, which in turn leads to their continuance and sharing intentions. Cross-cultural differences are also analyzed to provide culturally relevant insights. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach was employed. In the qualitative phase (Study 1), we interviewed 30 university students and used an inductive methodology to analyze the data. In the follow-up quantitative studies, the hypotheses were examined using a sample of 249 students from China (Study 2) and 204 students from the United States (Study 3). Findings Qualitative results suggest that perceived benefits (convenience, usefulness and controllability) and perceived risks (inflexibility, privacy invasion and overreliance) are identified as antecedents of learners’ trust in ChatGPT. Quantitative results reveal that factors including convenience, usefulness and overreliance on AI positively influence learners’ trust in ChatGPT. Furthermore, trust positively affects learners’ continuance intention and sharing intention. These findings are consistent across the Chinese and American samples. However, inflexibility significantly influences trust among Chinese learners but not among American learners. Additionally, invasion of privacy negatively affects trust in ChatGPT only for the US sample, suggesting cultural divergence in trust formation between these two countries. Originality/value We shed light on the antecedents and consequences of trust in ChatGPT within higher education settings, especially across different cultures. This research endeavor also promotes the integration of ChatGPT for learning activities to maximize the utility of this technology.",

          "abstract": "Purpose To promote acceptance of blockchain-based investment options and enhance confidence for new investors, the market must become more comprehensible and accessible to the broad masses. This requires transparency to build trust in web-based intermediaries, particularly given the multitude of websites that often advertise unrealistic returns in the crypto sector. Consequently, intermediaries within the decentralized finance ecosystem need to be clearly identified and categorized to facilitate mass-market adoption. Design/methodology/approach We employ a six-iteration taxonomy approach, establishing a data foundation through literature reviews, expert interviews and document analysis of 50 intermediaries. Archetypes are derived using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Finally, a survey is conducted to evaluate the taxonomy and the archetypes. Findings The taxonomy encompasses three meta-characteristics (functionality, architecture, security) and 63 characteristics. Furthermore, the research findings reveal six archetypes of blockchain-based investment intermediaries, demonstrating significant discrepancies between them, particularly in terms of financial features and governance structures. Given the complexity of crypto intermediary platforms for novice users, the findings underscore the need to implement technology-based and institutional-based trust mechanisms, improve risk assessment and enable informed decision-making. Originality/value By increasing market transparency and fostering trust, this study contributes to the acceptance and adoption of blockchain-based financial intermediaries, drawing on the diffusion of innovation theory. The proposed taxonomy, particularly its dimensions, specifically addresses the requirements of both technology-based and institution-based trust, which are critical for crypto investments. Moreover, the findings emphasize the importance of educational resources and communicated trust features in strengthening user confidence and facilitating broader market participation.",

Emerging media offer a solution to studying message reception in simulated real-world environments, which may soon become the actual media environments in which we encounter messages. Here, we utilized virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking to investigate message processing in a realistic virtual city environment populated with billboards. We introduced an inception-style manipulation where billboards initially overlooked by participants were covertly reintroduced based on real-time gaze tracking. Our findings show this algorithmic manipulation, undetected by participants, significantly boosted message memory retention for the targeted messages. This study reveals a path of media influence, demonstrating how undetected algorithmic manipulations can shape individual and collective memory. The findings carry practical and theoretical implications for diverse communication contexts, from advertising and public health to political messaging in the emerging metaverse ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "The German gender star is a form of gender inclusive language that uses an asterisk to merge masculine and feminine role noun endings (e.g., Choreograf*in, ‘ choreographer inclusive ’). It was created to counter the male bias of masculine forms intended as generic and to represent all genders more inclusively. This study examined how role nouns with the gender star are processed in written and spoken German using a semantic priming paradigm. In Experiment 1, German participants were primed with masculine 1 ( Choreograf ), feminine ( Choreografin ), and star noun forms ( Choreograf*in ) in printed form, before identifying the gender of a following pronoun as feminine ( sie, ‘ she’) or masculine ( er, ‘ he’). Experiment 2 presented the same prime forms auditorily with the star form realized as a glottal stop ( Choreografʔin ), produced by either a conventionally feminine-sounding or masculine-sounding voice. Congruency between prime and target gender for masculine noun forms ( Choreograf–er ) facilitated response times in both experiments and for feminine noun forms ( Choreografin–sie ) in Experiment 2. Response times for the masculine and feminine pronouns following the inclusive prime forms did not differ significantly in either experiment, indicating that these forms can be associated with both female and male referents in reading and listening, with the gender of the voice having no further effect on processing.",

Using both correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) methodology, we examined the degree to which relatedness needs might be satisfied in viewers via a direct route (i.e., through meaningful parasocial relationships with narrative characters) and via a vicarious route (i.e., through identification with a character who has satisfying relationships). Results indicated that each route can facilitate relatedness need satisfaction in narrative audiences. The present studies highlight how audiences experience characters both as shared selves and as distinct others and illustrate how narrative engagement can serve as a source for experiences and fulfillment outside of our day-to-day lives.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Social media are increasingly becoming platforms for moral discussions. Users communicating on a moral level can encourage us to engage with information regarding a moral debate by activating processes that shape our moral judgments. To investigate these processes, this paper studies the effect of attitude congruence and morally-framed arguments on the selection, reading time, and liking of social media content related to moral debates and whether the level of perceived moral relevance of the topic influences the effects’ strength. Further the role of identification with other users when choosing what content to interact with is examined. In a 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design experiment, participants were given an information selection task in which they were shown different posts within a mockup Facebook feed. Here, comment valence (positive vs. negative), type of argumentation within the comment (moral argument vs. no moral argument) and the opinion climate within one’s ingroup (ingroup supports attitude-consistent vs. attitude-inconsistent views) were manipulated. Results supported the confirmation bias regarding the selection and liking of content in social media. The hypothesized effects of moral arguments, relevance and group identification did not influence information selection or reading duration. Exploratory analyses revealed that content accompanied by comments with moral arguments has a higher likelihood of being liked, especially when the issue is seen as morally significant.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Human–computer interaction has advanced significantly with the emergence of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, it’s unclear whether users perceive these chatbots to have positive human qualities. Using a 2 × 2 experimental design, university students evaluated the perceived warmth and benevolence of a chatbot, whereby we altered the description of the chatbot across experimental groups. Specifically, we altered its description according to Asch’s (1946) concept of warmth, where we varied it to have traits suggesting high or low kindness, and we also varied the language used in the chatbot description (technical vs. anthropomorphic). We hypothesized that describing the chatbot using anthropomorphic (humanlike language) vs. technical language would increase its perceived warmth and benevolence and that descriptions highlighting kindness would enhance the chatbot’s perceived warmth. Results revealed that kindness-related descriptions of the chatbot significantly affected its perceived warmth and benevolence, whereas differences in anthropomorphic or technical language did not. The role of personality traits in shaping AI perceptions is discussed.",

          "abstract": "Ultimatums are a consequential yet underexamined conflict strategy. While often perceived as a distributive tactic, they can also function as pivotal moments of boundary-setting and relational transformation. Despite their presence in compliance-gaining, negotiation, and reconciliation literature, little is known about how ultimatums operate in serial arguments within close relationships. Thus, we engaged the serial argument process model to (1) examine the conditions that contribute to the use of ultimatums in serial arguments, (2) explore the associations between ultimatums and relationship outcomes, and (3) compare the use of ultimatums in romantic relationships and friendships. Using multi-group path analyses, we found that although ultimatums may be employed in both dating and friendship contexts, their usage and associated outcomes are related to factors such as conflict goals, perceived resolvability, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of ultimatum use. These findings have implications for conflict theory and provide guidance for conflict resolution within close relationships.",

          "authors": "Hester He Xiao, Kit S. Double, Rebecca T. Pinkus, Carolyn MacCann",
          "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been positively associated with relationship quality in romantic couples, but few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this association. The current study examines the mediating role of extrinsic emotion regulation (regulating your partner’s emotions) on the associations between EI and relationship quality. Specifically, we studied the mediating effects of three extrinsic regulation strategies involving high engagement with the partner’s emotions (cognitive reframing, receptive listening, and valuing). Heterosexual couples ( N = 175) completed three waves of surveys across 14 weeks from August to October 2021. EI, extrinsic emotion regulation strategies, and relationship quality were measured at three time points. Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Models (APIMeMs) were applied to the dyadic data to predict relationship quality and changes in relationship quality (with baseline relationship quality controlled). Results showed that valuing one’s partner was the only significant mediator linking EI to relationship quality. For both men and women, individuals’ EI is associated with better relationship quality for themselves and their partners, through their use of valuing to regulate their partners. However, the mediation effect did not extend to residualized changes in relationship quality over time, indicating that EI and mutual valuing may not drive long-term growth. These findings underscore the importance of fostering EI and mutual valuing within couples, which related to healthier present relational functioning. Future research is needed to clarify their roles in sustaining long-term relationship trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Establishing new social connections is critical during the transition to university, especially for students who have moved far from home. We examined how students’ one-on-one connections, along with the dynamics of their social groups, related to their adjustment across a school year. Participants were 717 first-year international undergraduates at a Canadian university who participated in a transition program involving assignment to orientation groups of 20-30 students. Cross-sectionally, students’ individual-level social network measures were associated with better adjustment at the start of the year. Longitudinally, being part of a group with better social connections at the start of the year was associated with students’ higher grade point average, lower hostility, and greater institutional attachment at the end of the school year. Findings highlight the importance of group-level social dynamics for emerging adults’ adjustment during a significant life transition.",

          "authors": "Paola Sartoretto, Luana Martins",
          "abstract": "For Indigenous populations in Brazil, maps have long been instruments of invisibility. Official maps have historically misnamed and erased Indigenous territories and communities. At the same time, cartographic representations have been a tool of resistance for Indigenous activists. Indigenous communities and organisations have created their own maps identifying territories, peoples, languages, and cultures. These dynamics of contentious visibility intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic when the spread of the virus among Indigenous populations was poorly reported or even absent from hegemonic contagion maps. State negligence, intensified by an authoritarian government hostile to Indigenous populations, threatened the survival of communities around the country who organised collectively to create their own cartographic representations of the pandemic through resistant appropriations of media and data. This article draws on interviews with Indigenous leaders and media activists to discuss processes of data appropriation and resistant cartographies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the use of data and counter mapping strategies for self-representation and political action that must be understood through a non-media-centric perspective, drawing from conceptualisations at the intersection between human geography, communication, and post-colonial theory.",

A three-wave panel study collected data among 520 French adolescents ( M age = 15.14, SD age = 1.90, 58.7% girls) in 2021–22 and was linked to content analytical data on the political posts of adolescents’ favorite accounts. The random intercept cross-lagged panel model revealed no significant between-person differences or within-person reciprocal effects between exposure to influencers’ and celebrities’ political content and adolescents’ political interest. Furthermore, neither peer nor parental political interest moderated these relationships. Explanations for the absence of media and selection effects are discussed.",

A digital version is a digital replica of an embodied human, living or dead, that convincingly mimics that person’s textual, visual and aural habits, and exists independently of that source person. By considering digital versions through the lens of (self-)objectification, this article argues that individuals simultaneously assert and relinquish power when creating their own digital versions. Following its analysis of CarynAI, this article proposes a research agenda about digital versions, suggesting avenues for future study about versions and versioning. Ultimately, this article argues for the urgent need to understand the shifting dynamics of personal agency, interpersonal intimacy and identity posted by digital human versions.",

Using three-wave panel data from 717 Swiss adolescents (collected between spring 2018 and autumn 2020), we applied Latent Transition Analysis to identify distinct parental mediation classes and adolescents’ transitioning patterns, resulting in the: Enforcing &amp; Engaged Approach; Hands-off Approach ; and Moderate Approach , showing fluctuation over time. Regression analysis revealed no significant associations between the three classes and mental health; however, adolescents in the Moderate Approach class reported lower perceived autonomy compared to those in the Enforcing &amp; Engaged Approach class. These findings highlight that (1) mediation strategies likely reflect broader parenting styles, (2) adapt to developmental needs, and (3) high parental engagement in setting boundaries coupled with active dialogue supports autonomous adolescent development. This insight can guide caregivers, healthcare, and policy development.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms have removed influential users for violating platform rules. While this intervention reduces harmful content on the platform, deplatforming high-profile figures may prompt general users to migrate to alternative domains, where they can continue to engage with inappropriate communication. Utilizing web tracking data from 12,400 US Twitter users, we showed that after Twitter deplatformed Donald Trump, users had no immediate change in Twitter usage, but their engagement with the platform decreased slightly over time. Meanwhile, they demonstrated an increase in visiting alternative domains, although this spike gradually tapered off. This pattern varied across the population: Those frequently consuming left-leaning news immediately increased Twitter usage, whereas users visiting right-leaning outlets displayed a rise in using alternative social media, especially among heavy consumers of right-leaning news. These findings highlight the importance of investigating two separate processes of platform migration, non-use and new use, for appraising the impact of content moderation.",

          "abstract": "Social media has long facilitated self-presentation, but the tension between authenticity and performativity remains. BeReal, launched in 2020, promised a more ‘authentic’ experience by requiring users to share unedited, real-time images. This study examines the platform’s perceived value, its initial appeal, and subsequent decline in user engagement. Through a large-scale qualitative survey ( N = 333), we present motivations for (dis)engagement, revealing a trajectory of enthusiasm, scepticism, and eventual disinterest. Participants valued BeReal for fostering social connection and serving as a digital memory archive. However, growing cynicism about authenticity – along with increasing performative behaviours and feature creep – diminished its appeal. Applying Ng’s post-adoption model we map users’ transition from adoption to discontinuance, situating BeReal’s decline within broader trends of social media fatigue. Our findings contribute to debates on ethical social media design, performative authenticity and user disengagement, providing insight into the ephemeral nature of digital platforms.",

In study 2, participants ( N = 188) screenshotted moments ( n = 551) when they experienced social presence through media in daily life. Participants reported the degree to which they had an established relationship or a social interaction with the target, connected with the content or target absent any pre-existing relationship, and felt a shared experience. Multilevel models found all pathways were associated with social presence and perceived change in connection. Although social interactions within established relationships constitute most experiences of belongingness and social presence, a sense of identification, parasocial relationships, and online communities are other meaningful pathways.",

Using a nationally representative survey data set, we investigate how end-users’ attitudes toward moderating harmful speech online relate to their offline racial attitudes. We find that racially conservative beliefs are significantly positively related to participants indicating a distaste for concepts related to content moderation and cancel culture, suggesting that racial conservatism may be a crucial factor to consider in assessing these attitudes. We discuss our findings through the lens of moral disengagement theory, positing that supporting “freedom of expression” by way of disagreeing with content moderation and cancel culture may be a contemporary mechanism of morally disengaging with the harmful effects of racially insensitive speech.",

Findings revealed the most significant gratifications obtained were expressing the authentic self, entertainment, connecting to others, and presenting the ideal self, and these perceived affordances moderated the relationships between motives and gratifications obtained. Users seeking companionship were more likely to alleviate loneliness through BeReal when they perceived stronger social presence. Those using BeReal to pass time found it more entertaining when the app was seen as less editable and ephemeral. In addition, users aiming to connect with others experienced greater satisfaction when they perceived content as less editable.

Extending De Certeau’s spatial framework of place, space, and subject positions to digital platforms, this article explores how ordinary Instagram users negotiate platform power by approaching resistance as spatial negotiation embedded in everyday use. Based on 15 in-depth interviews, the analysis identifies everyday tactics that transform Instagram from a structured place into a lived space : users abandon places, make the platform habitable, play with its materiality, and repurpose it for unexpected uses. The study demonstrates how users resist by how they position and move within platform structures. It categorizes users as voyeurs and walkers , based on De Certeau’s subject positions, and introduces a new category, transients , each reflecting distinct spatial relations to the platform. This article argues that spatial relations shape user agency and the conditions under which resistance becomes possible.",

The mixed-methods study includes exploratory reconstructions and survey experiments. Two intervention approaches proved efficient in reducing the sharing of misinformation, but only one significantly differentiated between true and false information. This study contributes to the literature on normative countermeasures and is the first to emphasize epistemic norms. Although misinformation is fundamentally an epistemic issue, scholars rarely refer to the rich epistemic literature for conceptualization and theory. The article also draws on focus theory and additional social literature to ensure a holistic framework. In addition to underscoring the role of epistemic norms, we suggest temporal proximity as a new factor to consider in focus theory-based measures. Ethical, empirical, and practical implications are discussed, emphasizing the need to control for countermeasures’ effect on true information sharing, which may threaten to suppress public discourse.",

We draw on empirical insights from five creative workshops to examine how university students perceive and respond to the logics of this ‘algorithmic event’ and assertion of identity through ‘wrappification’. Our analysis identifies four themes: the resonance of Wrapped, limits of the Wrapped self, ambience of music and contestations of Spotify’s governance. These themes reflect the multifaceted emotions evoked in users, ranging from celebration of personalisation to critique of data capture. They also demonstrate contradictory views of classification systems. While our participants are deeply attuned to the algorithmic and commercial forces of streaming, their engagement with music often transcends the platform’s affordances. By examining these negotiated practices during an algorithmic event, our study extends debates on the platformisation of culture, especially regarding music’s aesthetic and functional values.",

Besides these approaches, mindfulness stands as a promising quality to benefit from social media without being overwhelmed by their drawbacks. Accordingly, this study investigates whether mindful technology use (MTU) can help manage social media use. Based on the Affordance-Use-Reflection-Automaticity Model, MTU was proposed as a means to regulate the effects of social media affordances (i.e. hedonic and utilitarian content gratification), habit, satisfaction, and system use. The research model was tested on three different social media—Facebook ( n = 220), Instagram ( n = 132), and Twitter/X ( n = 123)—using a cross-sectional survey. The results show that MTU is associated with lower habit and system use, and a stronger positive link between hedonic content gratification and habit. These findings indicate that MTU can be a disconnection strategy by supporting mindful consumption and weakening habitual use.",

We argue that existing methodologies for the analysis of visual content based on the notions of the metapicture are not yet fully equipped to account for the multi-layered, dynamic, and information-rich nature of audio-visual material. To fill this gap, we propose an approach aimed at ‘enriching’ the metapicture with textual and other components, alongside visual ones, to critically and systematically analyse video collections. First, we explain how researchers can enrich the metapicture by following three main principles: metadating, disaggregation and reaggregation, and readability. To illustrate our approach, we present a case study based on data donations to explore the content and gender representations TikTok users are exposed to. The study is structured in three steps, each introducing a type of enriched metapicture: the megapicture, scene-by-scene timeline, and video stack.",

Building on social acceleration and the sociology of quantification, we take a media sociology perspective to examine how algorithmic automation accelerates public visibility and fans’ data work. Based on netnography of a Chinese idol group INTO1’s fans, we theorize that algorithms, a technological acceleration in audience data production, trigger two changes in public visibility encountered by fans: ephemeral visibility and externally visible production. They further accelerate the pace of fans’ data work, reflected in generating more data in less time, speeding up reaction, organizing data work by time intervals, and adding additional and indirect data work. While prior algorithm studies emphasize opacity, we highlight the important yet underexplored speed aspect of algorithms and its social impact on the time dimension.",

We extend this by examining engagement across multiple communities using over 4 million Reddit posts from 20 “subreddits” in the “manosphere”—an interconnected ecosystem of anti-feminist online communities. In summary, (1) users’ membership in the “manosphere” constitutes engagement with an array of communities, (2) we develop a measure of relative engagement (MRE) to show that users post unequally across their member communities, and (3) we explore the patterns of engagement across communities in the manosphere. We discuss how users navigate multiplicitous identity expressions across communities in the “manosphere” (as measured by MRE) and highlight the value of studying online community membership from a more holistic perspective for researchers, designers, and content moderators.",

          "abstract": "Attitudes toward singlehood have been operationally and methodologically framed in different ways, with some focused on desire for relational pursuit, some on satisfaction or contentment with singlehood, and others focused on negative affect or experiences associated with singlehood. The present research explores whether measures such as fear of being single (FOBS), desire for a relationship (DFR), and satisfaction with relationship status (SWRS) represent distinct perspectives associated with singlehood experiences or, conversely, a general attitude toward relationship status. In two samples of singles ( N 1A = 172, N 1B = 257), the three measures loaded onto distinct factors. Exploratory analyses revealed distinct associations with well‐being, relationship pursuit tendencies, and perceived rewards/costs of singlehood and relationships. Results suggest that unique experiences of singlehood and relationships associated with FOBS, DFR, and SWRS reflect distinct motivational underpinnings. Careful consideration of research goals and implications should be used when selecting different operational and methodological framings of attitudes toward relationship status.",

          "authors": "Hannah Little, Juliet Dunstone",
          "abstract": "Storytelling is a growing topic in science communication research, highlighting the importance of learning from existing storytelling research from other disciplines. Storytelling research in cultural evolution has identified a number of cognitive biases in how we transmit information: stories are remembered and passed on more faithfully when they contain social and survival information, negative information or counterintuitive information. In this article, we review this cultural evolution literature and present findings from a set of interviews with science communication professionals. We asked science communicators about the potential benefits and risks that may come about when using cognitive biases within science communication storytelling. Science communicators reported already using some cognitive biases in their practice. Participants also expressed concerns about some tactics that might contradict objectives of science communication, threaten the integrity of science and science communication and risk the welfare of audiences. We map the benefits and risks reported using a thematic analysis.",
