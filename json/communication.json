          "authors": "Fuseini Iddrisu, Noel Nutsugah, Derek Onomah, Mavis Essandoh",
          "abstract": "A critical look at the extant literature on the history of public relations (PR) in Africa indicates that the phenomenon started only when the Europeans arrived. These historical narratives ignore PR principles that can be found in the indigenous practices of most traditions in Africa. This study embarks on a critical scholarship guided by in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, observations, and video data to argue that there exist PR principles in Akan indigenous palace communication that predate the arrival of the Europeans. Specifically, the study found several indigenous activities that connote strategic image construction, relationship-building and management, general communication concepts, and media relations function, all of which are core to PR management. Based on the above, the study developed an Akan PR model that depicts notable PR principles within the milieu of Akan palace communication in an attempt to retell the history of PR in a non-westernized context. This study holds scholarship and pedagogical significance for magnifying other voices in the evolution of PR. This is achieved by explicating that traditional African governance structures have long employed strategic communication, relationship management, and reputation management principles.",

          "title": "Big data on pornhub insights: Datafication and the making of a new sexual culture",
          "authors": "Rebecca Saunders",
          "abstract": "Big data has been crucial to the expansion of the pornography industry and its online evolution over the past 40 years. The datafication of digital users’ desire is the economic basis of free porn platforms. These now dominate the industry and foster an easy accessibility that has made pornography so profoundly culturally influential. The Pornhub Network is well-known as the world’s largest collection of free porn sites, receiving over one hundred million visits a day. Only Google, YouTube, Meta and Reddit receive more of digital users’ attention. Porn viewers therefore constitute a massive global audience. The data gathered from them provides important insights into contemporary sexual culture. Pornhub Insights is an important part of this datafication of viewers’ desire. This site parses the big data gathered from the hundreds of millions of daily ‘hits’ across The Pornhub Network, using Google Analytics ‘to dig deep into the data’ about the sexual preferences of its viewers. Where the dataveillance conducted by corporations is often a relatively clandestine practice, Pornhub Insights explicitly foregrounds its datafication. Because the ‘statisticians at Pornhub’ (Pornhub Insights) are able to draw from such huge data stores, Pornhub Insights is used as a resource for journalists and researchers. Its statistics are conceptualised as providing definitive facts about sexuality, drawing on big data’s associations with the scientific and objective. Where statistics and counting have served a regulatory function in relation to sexuality, this article explores what this big data really tells us about contemporary porn consumption and sexuality. It investigates the ideological objectives of data visualisations and asks what the company’s objectives are in publishing the data. This article asks whether the ‘bigness’ of Pornhub’s data makes it more meaningful than other important sociological studies of sexuality. Ultimately, it considers the significance of these massive data sets lies less in their insights about sexuality and more in what they reveal about cultural perceptions and expectations of big data itself.",

          "authors": "Agata Waszkiewicz, Kristian A. Bjørkelo",
          "abstract": "This article examines how games continue and represent the historical rituals of invective poetry exchanges. The article juxtaposes the analog, multiplayer card game Cards Against Humanity , known for its transgressive, profanity-based humor, with two single-player video games that present the invective poetry competition as (more or less) historically accurate activity. The former is argued to be a continuation of the same tradition that encompasses various historical practices such as Germanic flyting or African sounding, while the latter is an attempt at representation, without inviting the players to participate in the same practices. The difference between the card game, which makes a freer use of profanities, and the video game representation, which is devoid of it, are used to discuss to investigate the importance of the rituals involving invective poetry in the contemporary culture, as well as theorize about the differences seen in the analog and video games.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study provides researchers and business practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) transparency in the business discipline, enabling them to navigate the evolving digital landscape, where AI transparency is an escalating concern, by identifying the conceptual foundations in the most influential studies. Design/methodology/approach This study uses bibliometric analysis techniques, including performance and co-citation analyses. These analyses are grounded in data extracted from the Social Sciences Citation Index within the Web of Science, comprising 108 primary articles and 7,459 secondary (cited) documents. Findings AI transparency research is rising with a greater focus on end-users. Six clusters of cited publications serve as the bedrock of AI transparency in the business discipline: trust, AI explanation, bias and power, undesirable usage, user acceptance/aversion and user heuristics. Analyzing these clusters revealed a framework for signaling AI transparency that can be extended to future research and business strategies. Originality/value This study addresses the following research gaps. First, the nature of AI transparency and its knowledge base remain elusive. Second, AI transparency in the business discipline is underexplored compared to information sciences and law. Third, there is ambiguity surrounding the implementation strategies for AI transparency, with companies often resorting to simplistic methods such as updating terms and conditions. Fourth, there is a lack of clear future research directions specifically for AI transparency, as opposed to the broader context of AI ethics.",

          "abstract": "Social media powered by AI has become a major means for influencing beliefs and behaviors. Its unprecedented analytical, personalization, and scaling capabilities could transform economic, health, and other development outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, issues associated with the AI technologies that underlie social media platforms, such as algorithmic bias and misinformation, and emerging risks of AI persuasion and autonomy could undermine LMICs’ social and human development goals, particularly those with nascent AI governance and capacities. This commentary examines AI-powered social media’s potential to contribute to development in LMICs through social and behavior change, the role of human cognition and cultural influences in mediating AI risks, and how a human-centric approach familiar to international development could help LMICs shape AI-powered social media that supports their values and development goals.",

          "authors": "Jaemin Jung, Jeong-Nam Kim",
          "abstract": "We have collected 16 research essays on how artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping media, communication, and public life. The authors describe and prescribe how people respond to AI in real settings, such as journalists transitioning to algorithmic newsrooms, students utilizing ChatGPT, and policymakers searching for fairness and transparency. Across all articles, trust, ethics, and context should and could surpass AI’s technical power. We classify the essays into four groups: AI adoption and professional integration; AI governance, ethics, and societal risk; pseudo-information detection and correction; and data-science methods for opinion and behavior analysis. These essays witness emerging media transformations, hinting at how AI can coevolve with, not replace, human intelligence in everyday mediated and connected life.",

          "authors": "Alexandra R Stankus, Archana Krishnan",
          "abstract": "Online lurking is a common behavior but defining it and understanding its motivations is complex. Various definitions and measurements for online lurking have been employed but have often suggested “lurking” to be conflated with other behaviors. This study developed and tested a scale to measure consistent online lurking (COOL), addressing the need for a clear conceptualization and measurement of this behavior. Exploratory factor analysis explicated two dimensions of online lurking – online invisibility and preference for content consumption, and confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the two-factor structure. The resulting scale demonstrated good reliability across two samples. The study differentiates consistent lurking from information-seeking and contextual factors, focusing on individuals who tend to lurk across platforms. This conceptualization provides a theoretical contribution by illuminating a subset of online users who are often underrepresented in research but are integral to online communities despite their invisibility.",

          "abstract": "Social media are key arenas for public opinion formation, but are susceptible to coordinated social media manipulation (CSMM), that is, the orchestrated activity of multiple accounts to increase content visibility and deceive audiences. Despite advances in detecting and characterizing CSMM, the attribution problem—identifying the principals behind CSMM campaigns—has received little scholarly attention. In this article, we address this gap by synthesizing existing research and developing a theoretical model for understanding CSMM. We propose a consolidated definition of CSMM, identify its key observable and hidden characteristics, and present a rational choice model for inferring principals’ strategic decisions from campaign features. In addition, we present a typology of CSMM campaigns, linking variations in scale, elaborateness, and disguise to principals’ resources, stakes, and influence strategies. Our contribution provides researchers with conceptual and heuristic tools for attribution and invites interdisciplinary and comparative research on CSMM campaigns.",

          "abstract": "Concerns about the decline of traditional forms of civic engagement and local news availability in the United States exist alongside developing forms of activist politics online, with one prominent form of social media-driven activism coming from First Amendment auditors. This study examines the protracted conflict between the governmental authorities of Leon Valley and First Amendment auditors to explore the re-placement of civic engagement for the age of social media, facilitated by the development of what I call paralocal relationships. Paralocal relationships describe a sense of familiarity with and concern toward a place featured in media by viewers who have never been there. First Amendment audits enable paralocal relationships by combining on-the-ground activism with clear and simple calls to action for distant viewers, helping to convert audiences into engaged and invested participants in the political life of featured places and enabling new modes of participatory politics.",

          "authors": "Adrian Rauchfleisch, Daniel Vogler, Gabriele de Seta",
          "abstract": "The language used in public debates and in the news can influence how citizens perceive the risks and benefits of technology. While framing effects on technology perception are well understood, few studies have focused on the effects of specific terms used to describe technology. We analyze how the terms deepfake and synthetic media affect risk and benefit perceptions across application fields. Using Switzerland as a case, our manual content analysis ( n = 380 news articles) reveals a focus on risks in news coverage of deepfakes with minimal use of the term synthetic media. We then tested the effects of the terms on risk and benefit perceptions in a preregistered survey experiment (n = 736 participants). Term choice does not change perceived risks, but “synthetic media” significantly increases perceived benefits across application fields. As a theoretical contribution, we link our findings to the concept of euphemism, proposing that term choice should align with application fields to reflect the risks and benefits of technology. Overall, our study shows that the terms we use to label technology matter, especially for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.",

          "authors": "Hui Lin, Rafal Zaborowski",
          "abstract": "This article examines Douyin’s gamified features to investigate whether and how they facilitate online sociality. Drawing on literature on online sociality and gamification, this study demonstrates how Douyin’s gaming elements introduce a playful dimension to social interactions and examines the implications of transforming sociality into a game. Using a mixed-method approach comprising the walkthrough method and diary-interview technique, the study finds that gamified features—such as friendship badges, quantified levels, and virtual pets—can encourage social behavior and strengthen interpersonal bonds. However, these effects are primarily confined to small, strong-tie friendship groups and do not extend to larger, weak-tie networks. The findings suggest that Douyin users often display heightened awareness of how algorithms exploit their social behaviors, prompting them to adopt cautious and critical digital practices. The article makes both empirical and methodological contributions by offering a case study of gamification in socialization and demonstrating the utility of the diary-interview approach for analyzing user interactions.",

          "authors": "Steve Borchardt, Matteo Trane, Stefano Cisternino, Luisa Marelli",
          "abstract": "Launched in December 2019, the European Green Deal (EGD) represents the European Union’s (EU) ambitious policy framework to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. This study employs a sentiment analysis of 582,156 tweets from the beginning of 2020 to April 2024 to understand the evolution of public sentiment toward the EGD. Grounded in Social Representations Theory and Framing Theory, we analyze sentiment trends, topic distributions, and the impact of key policy and external events (e.g. COVID-19 spread) on public sentiment. The results reveal predominantly neutral sentiment (61.68%), with more positive (28.26%) than negative (10.06%) sentiment overall and a substantially stable trend over time. EU-affiliated accounts showed higher positive sentiment compared to non-EU-affiliated accounts. Sentiment trends were correlated with key policy announcements and global events, demonstrating the intricate relationship between policy communication and the formation of public opinion. The study identified key themes and specific initiatives driving positive sentiment, including those linked to the first EU climate law and climate targets, Farm to Fork, and New European Bauhaus. Conversely, economic concerns, challenges in policy implementation challenges, ecosystem conservation status, and food system, and energy security issues appeared as associated with negative sentiment. The findings highlight the importance of targeted communication strategies, transparent response to skepticism, communication of policy processes, and stakeholder feedback collection tool enhancement to leverage public sentiment in support of the EU green transition, paving the way for future research to explore regional nuances and sentiment monitoring.",
