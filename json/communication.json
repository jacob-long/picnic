          "abstract": "This article examines gender disparities in academic communication research, focusing on authorship, collaboration, citation impact, faculty representation, and compensation in leading U.S. public universities. An analysis of 62,359 papers from 121 journals (2004–2023) shows women constitute 50.4% of authors and nearly half of sole-authored works, yet receive fewer citations, even in higher-impact journals. Women-only teams perform strongly in journal impact factors, particularly in smaller groups, suggesting parity in some contexts. Persistent biases remain: women in larger mixed-gender teams are cited less, and women Assistant Professors earn 5.61% less than men, though women Associates slightly out-earn men. These findings highlight the need for institutional reforms to promote equitable pay, recognition, and representation in communication research.",

          "authors": "Maria Jansson, Jono Van Belle",
          "abstract": "This article seeks to analyze audience constructions in Swedish policy documents dealing with televised media from 2012 to the present. The period analyzed has been characterized by changes in Swedish media policy due to new technology, neoliberal governing ideas, and globalization. Further, debates about media policy have recently become polarized, and longstanding ideals of diversity, gender equality, and inclusion have been challenged. The article analyzes the political work performed by audience constructions and unpacks the characteristics of spectators in their capacity as citizens, Swedes, consumers, and the protected. The article shows that audience conceptualizations reproduce hierarchies based on socio-economic conditions, age, disabilities, gender, ethnicity, and place of residence. Further, the article finds that the tensions between audiences in their capacity as citizens and consumers have been smoothed out and identifies the beginning of a nationalist turn in public service policy, as it moves from an emphasis on inclusion through acknowledging differences to the pursuit of a more assimilationist agenda and the creation of an essentialist Swedish identity.",

          "authors": "Jana H Dreston, Andreas Nanz",
          "abstract": "As political campaigns increasingly use social media to reach voters, scholars debate whether users actually acquire election-related knowledge or merely perceive themselves as more knowledgeable. It remains unclear whether social media enhances voting that aligns with users’ political attitudes (“correct voting”). Previous studies suggest social media effects vary substantially based on whether exposure is intentional or incidental. In a between-subject online experiment (N = 1,460), participants scrolled through a social media feed exposing them to policy statements either intentionally, incidentally, or not at all before voting in a mock election. We found that both intentional and incidental exposure increased objective knowledge, whereas only intentional exposure enhanced subjective knowledge. Yet, participants did not translate the acquired knowledge into aligned voting. However, those who intentionally sought election information felt more confident in their voting decision. Our findings suggest social media may mobilize voters more effectively than it enables them to make “good” decisions.",

          "authors": "Jason Whalley, Volker Stocker",
          "abstract": "Purpose This article analyses the responses to a UK consultation that explored how the regulation of public call boxes could be amended in light of their declining use. By focusing on the responses, we shed light on how old technologies, which are viewed as being technologically inferior, can continue to play a valuable role through generating societal value. Design/methodology/approach The analysis draws on the 23 responses to the consultation. A thematic analysis was undertaken to ascertain the views of respondents. Findings Our analysis highlights the complexities and challenges of regulating old technologies within an industry experiencing sustained technological change. Although the use of public call boxes has declined in the United Kingdom, not least because of the ubiquity of mobile telecommunications, our analysis shows that there is resistance to their removal and amending the range of services that they provide. Furthermore, the underlying technological characteristics of public call boxes that make them available in a power cut complicates their replacement with modern technologies. Our analysis explores how public call boxes act as a “safety net”, providing a means of communications in cases of emergency as well as when someone wants to ring a helpline. Social implications Our analysis highlights the “safety net” role of public call boxes and their role in emergency situations. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first academic article to examine the consultation and through this the role that public call boxes can play in the UK's telecommunications industry.",

          "authors": "Li Ji, Yitong Wang, Huanyi Zhao, Ling Jiang, Xingyu Chen",
          "abstract": "Purpose Paid knowledge products have become prevalent on online platforms; however, consumers’ discontinued consumption has plagued paid knowledge platforms, and the factors affecting user discontinuance have not been fully investigated. This study examined how users’ post-usage attitudes toward knowledge products were associated with their discontinuance intention and how the associations were moderated by users’ goal orientations. Design/methodology/approach In this cross-sectional study, 352 users of paid knowledge products completed online surveys. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to examine the effects of post-usage attitudes and goal orientation on post-purchase discontinuance intention. Findings The results showed that users’ post-usage attitudes toward self-improvement were negatively associated with discontinuance intention, whereas users’ attitudes toward self-image and conformity to subjective norms were positively associated with discontinuance intention. Simultaneously, learning goal orientation weakened the negative relationship between self-improvement attitudes and discontinuance intention, whereas performance-oriented goal orientation strengthened the positive relationship between self-image attitudes and discontinuance intention. Originality/value This study advances the literature on paid knowledge consumption by identifying consumer post-usage attitudes driven by their pre-usage expectations, including self-improvement, self-image and conformity with norms. In addition, this study extends the expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT), which postulates a positive relationship between post-usage attitudes and user continuance by highlighting the intrinsic and extrinsic nature of user expectations as a boundary condition. Consistent with EDT, users with positive attitudes toward intrinsically driven self-improvement were less likely to discontinue their use. However, in contrast to EDT, users with positive attitudes about extrinsically driven self-image and conformity to norms are more likely to discontinue use. These findings have important implications for practitioners designing different paid knowledge products and retaining users with distinct expectations.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The rise of virtual influencers (VIs) has reshaped influencer culture, yet existing literature lacks a cross-cultural examination of how VIs foster engagement from media communication and fan perspectives. Notably, factors influencing VI-fan engagement remain underexamined, leading to inconsistent findings and a critical knowledge gap. This study aims to address this gap by identifying overlooked determinants of VI-fan interactions, thereby enhancing such engagement both in China and globally. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach, integrating content analysis and statistical analysis, was employed to compare fan engagement among top Chinese and global VIs, with theoretical grounding in the information adoption model and the eWOM narrative model. Findings The study identified the specific effects of platform differences and content types on VI-fan engagement. Additionally, it developed a content typology tailored to enhance such engagement, offering actionable insights for optimizing VI-fan engagement. Practical implications It provides detailed guidance on brand management for VIs, aiding in strategic decisions such as VI design, platform selection and content curation to strengthen fan engagement, whether for Chinese or global VI campaigns. Originality/value It fills a key literature gap by providing cross-cultural evidence on VI-fan engagement – an area previously marked by insufficient and inconsistent findings. Its focus on comparative analysis between China and the global context adds unique value, addressing the lack of cross-cultural analysis in existing studies.",

          "abstract": "The present study provides an Italian-adapted version of the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) 2.0, namely Italian version of the MFD (it-MFD), for use in the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count software. The MFD 2.0 was translated and adapted from English into Italian following a multistep process. Subsequently, the reviewers compared the output with the original text to identify semantic discrepancies. Independent judges then evaluated the relevance of each word to the five moral foundations, and only the words assessed as both relevant and with a high level of agreement between the judges were included in the final version. The resulting it-MFD comprises 2,881 words. To evaluate the tool's effectiveness, we applied it to a sample of salient texts originally written in Italian and for which official English translations were available. The results are presented and discussed.",

          "abstract": "Caring for an aging adult can harm an individual’s mental, physical, and relational well-being. Couples providing eldercare often report increased tension and conflict, decreased time for intimacy, and lowered marital adjustment. Nonetheless, few studies have attempted to explain the mechanisms through which caregiving experiences impact relationship evaluations. This study engages the frameworks of relational turbulence theory and transition processing communication to examine how stress, partner communication, and relationship parameters intersect for married caregivers. The study employs dyadic data to consider four forms of relationship-focused communication that may help married caregivers preserve or elevate their partnership. Results of the study provide evidence that partner engagement in transition processing communication is associated with less relational uncertainty and improved interdependence. However, caregiving stress was associated with decreased engagement in transition processing communication. Results shed light on gender differences in the extent to which stress, communication, and relationship parameters may be connected in the context of caregiving. The study adds to our theoretical and practical understanding of how relationship turmoil develops and is attenuated within RTT and among caregiving couples.",

          "abstract": "This research examines associations of gender role (i.e., masculine and feminine) orientations with drinking alcohol shortly after a recent significant romantic relationship conflict, and whether experiencing specific emotions in response to the conflict has indirect effects on gender role orientation effects on drinking. Participants included 410 American and Canadian adults (59% female) in committed romantic relationships who consumed alcohol regularly (i.e., 12+ drinks/past year). Participants completed an online survey and reported their biological sex, gender identity, gender role orientation, the degree to which they experienced a variety of negative (e.g., ashamed, angry) and positive emotions (e.g., validated, connected) in response to a recent significant romantic relationship conflict, and the amount of alcohol consumed following the conflict. Zero-inflated negative binomial models indicated masculine orientation was related to greater odds of drinking post-conflict. Masculine orientation was associated with experiencing more negative affect and emotions such as feeling sad, disgusted, and powerless. Feminine orientation was associated with positive affect and emotions such as understood, connected, and happy. Experiencing negative emotions was linked with greater odds of drinking and drinking more post-conflict. Analyses of indirect effects indicated that overall negative affect and all individual negative emotions explained links of masculine orientation with drinking whereas feminine orientation was indirectly associated with drinking via both overall negative and positive affect as well as several self-conscious, anxious, and positive emotions. Our study clarifies the emotions that should be targeted in individuals with specific gender role orientations to prevent excessive drinking and/or relapse following romantic conflict.",

          "abstract": "The Strong Black Woman (SBW) schema prescribes a complex set of behavioral expectations for Black women, namely, that they render a guise of self-reliance, emotional and physical strength, self-sacrifice, and resilience in the face of adversity. Thus, this study sought to explore the role of SBW, a culturally salient gendered-racial schema believed to represent a central aspect of Black womanhood, on Black women’s experiences of romantic and intimate partnerships. We conducted eight focus groups ( N = 16) with young Black women aged 18 – 30 (M = 22.13, SD = 3.46). Data were analyzed using the rapid and rigorous qualitative data technique and thematic analysis. Study findings revealed a multidimensional construct specific to SBW in the context of intimate partnerships: (1) Black women confronting expectations to uphold strength, (2) a commitment to independence while partnered, (3) efforts to conceal emotions with one’s partner, (4) aspirations to achieve equitable caretaking within the relationship, and (5) shielding to curate a positive relationship image. These findings provide unique insights into how young Black women are navigating gendered racial stereotypes to engage in romantic and intimate partnerships.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the psychological profiles of parents through a person-centered approach, focusing on levels of parenthood regret, parental burnout, and parental reflective functioning (PRF). It further explored the associations between these profiles and experiences of childhood maltreatment as well as child dysregulation. The sample comprised 1,994 cisgender heterosexual parents residing in Italy ( M age = 42.24, SD = 7.15; 85.61% mothers), each with at least one biological child aged 2–18 years ( M age = 9.59, SD = 5.09; 49.75% assigned female at birth). Latent profile analysis identified three distinct psychological profiles: a Low-Risk Profile (81.3%), characterized by low parental burnout and regret alongside high PRF; a Medium-Risk Profile (13.6%), marked by moderate levels across all dimensions; and a High-Risk Profile (5.1%), defined by elevated burnout and regret, coupled with impaired PRF. Fathers and parents with lower educational attainment were more likely to belong to the High-Risk Profile compared to the Low-Risk group, whereas younger parents, mothers, and those with higher levels of education were more likely to fall within the Medium-Risk Profile. Psychological (but not physical) childhood maltreatment significantly predicted membership in the Medium- and High-Risk Profiles. Additionally, parents in higher-risk profiles reported significantly greater child dysregulation. These findings indicate heterogeneous, qualitatively distinct constellations of parental functioning and identify PRF as a central internal resource. Clinically, profile-tailored, maltreatment-informed, mentalization-based interventions may help contain parental burnout, understand parenthood regret under demand, and support children’s regulation.",

Using a mixed-method approach, we examine researchers’ justifications to scale up content analysis and assess the methodological adjustments—or lack thereof—when employing supervised machine learning for 38 large-scale content analyses. Almost all of the included studies displayed deficiencies in study design, primarily related to the uncritical use of frequentist statistics on datasets containing the entire statistical population, or employing supervised machine learning without methodological adjustments to account for misclassifications.

          "abstract": "The rapid growth of social media has prompted many corporations to collaborate with social media influencers (SMIs) to create sponsored personal stories to engage their consumers. While the positive effects of narrative transportation have been examined in the SMI context, its potential backfire effects are rarely explored. Through two online experiments, Study 1 ( N = 161) found that narratives (vs. non-narratives) resulted in less positive ad responses, with these effects fully mediated by perceived manipulative intent. Study 2 ( N = 257) replicated these findings and further revealed that sponsorship disclosure moderated these effects: disclosure exacerbates the backfire effects of narratives by heightening perceived manipulative intent, whereas in non-narrative ads, it enhances ad effects by reducing consumers’ inference of manipulative intent.",

          "abstract": "The article demonstrates intermedia dynamics in the hybrid media system and reveals the susceptibility of traditional media to attempts to influence their agenda and public opinion formation. Specifically, it deals with the thematization of a faux pas by the conservative chancellor candidate Armin Laschet during the German federal election campaign in 2021. To analyze the intermedia dynamics in this case, the first step is a content analysis of journalistic reporting of the faux pas, which illustrates the responsiveness of traditional media to social media trends and activities. The research shows that journalistic media addressed the faux pas only after it was problematized on social media and became visible through the trending hashtag #LaschetLacht on Twitter. Building on this, the next step involves network and content analyses of Twitter users and their posts about the faux pas, which shed light on how the hashtag trend emerged and gained momentum. Key actors who were particularly relevant to the emergence and dissemination of the hashtag are identified, as well as their strategies to reinforce the trend and draw the attention of journalistic media to it. As the analysis reveals, highly active accounts played a significant role by attempting to artificially amplify the emerging Twitter trend, aiming to exploit the attention logics in the hybrid media system.",

          "authors": "Silke Fürst",
          "abstract": "Research on hybrid media systems has predominantly focused on recent digital developments, often overlooking historical precedents and long-term patterns that continue to shape today’s media landscape. This study addresses that gap by examining information flows—the cross-media dissemination of information and amplification of attention—from a historical perspective. Combining a literature review in journalism and media history with a longitudinal analysis of newspaper content, the study investigates four phenomena that illustrate information flows over time: media events, scandals, intermedia agenda-setting, and metaphors of public response. These phenomena are closely linked to recurring phrases and terms in public discourse and function as self-reinforcing communication patterns that connect different media channels and logics. The analysis draws on press coverage from three leading German-language newspapers: &lt;em&gt;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; (Germany), &lt;em&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; (Switzerland), and &lt;em&gt;Die Presse &lt;/em&gt;(Austria). The findings reveal that terms such as “media frenzy,” “media attention,” and “scandal” have been used since the mid-20th century to describe cross-media dynamics, well before the advent of digital and social media. The frequency of such terms has increased over time, particularly with the expansion and diversification of mass media, and again with the rise of digitalization. By situating information flows in a historical context, the study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of continuity and change within hybrid media systems. While focused on German-speaking countries, the results suggest broader relevance and encourage future research that further integrates historical perspectives into the study of information flows in hybrid media systems.",

Specifically, it examines the extent to which elements of “govtainment”—the “spectacularisation” of government communication through digital media—are present in the communication strategies of public institutions. We analysed how the communication strategies of two Romanian ministries on TikTok are shaped by the platform’s specific characteristics, the impact of these adaptations on their audiences, and what elements of “govtainment” can be identified within their content. We employed a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative content analysis of TikTok publications by Romania’s Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Internal Affairs—the only two ministries with a consistent presence on the platform. The findings indicate that both ministries adapt their communication strategies to align with TikTok’s features, incorporating elements that enhance virality, such as tone, viral trends and sounds, content formats, speech acts, and humanisation. Our analysis confirms the presence of govtainment elements in the communication strategies employed by these ministries. However, when correlating spectacularisation elements such as trend participation, tone, and speech acts with audience engagement, we found that their presence does not necessarily result in the highest engagement rates. Nevertheless, the overall figures suggest that both institutions have managed to gain significant engagement on their TikTok accounts.",

          "abstract": "New media technologies have transformed social interactions, offering connectivity but also drawbacks such as phubbing – the act of ignoring others by using mobile phones during face-to-face interactions. This study examines the psychological consequences of being phubbed and how individuals cope through mobile use based on the temporal need-threat model. A lab experiment was conducted where participants interacted with partners and were phubbed. Results showed that phubbed individuals felt socially excluded, experienced threats to fundamental needs, and reported lower mood than those in the no-phubbing condition. Phubbing also led to less favorable attitudes toward the partners and lower interaction intention. Analysis of mobile use during a break after phubbing revealed no significant differences in social versus non-social mobile use. Interestingly, individuals with high social mobile use reported increased need threats.

          "abstract": "This study examines how Chinese older seasonal migrants (Houniao, 候鸟) employ vlogging on Douyin (Chinese TikTok) to create hybrid digital–physical spaces reshaping their mobility experiences. Through qualitative thematic analysis of purposively sampled vlogs ( N = 121) collected over two migration periods, we identify three interconnected themes of digital place-making: identity construction countering decline narratives of aging; community-building through linguistic strategies; and wellness engagement through therapeutic documentation. Findings reveal how older adults strategically appropriate a youth-dominated platform to document seasonal journeys between northern cities and southern destinations. These vlogging practices exemplify “digital place-making” where physical travel and digital representation mutually constitute meaningful therapeutic landscapes. The study demonstrates how older adults subvert ageist assumptions about digital capabilities while creating alternative representations of aging that emphasize agency and vitality rather than decline.",

          "authors": "Julie Dereymaeker",
          "abstract": "Baby monitoring technologies (BMTs) are increasingly sophisticated and marketed as essential tools for responsible parenting, reinforcing expectations of constant vigilance and care. This study investigates how parents domesticate BMTs and how responsibilisation manifests in this process. The study draws on in-depth interviews with 15 Flemish families and employs constructivist grounded theory analysis. Findings show this domestication is an agentic negotiation where parents balance elements of reassurance, autonomy, rationality, peace of mind, cost considerations and the ideal of letting go. This negotiation, however, is framed by a process of moral responsibilisation which manifests through three distinct but interconnected pathways: the self-guided, social and technologically imposed pathways. This process challenges the delegation of care to trusted caregivers and calls for a critical assessment of the expansion of monitoring technologies. As these technologies enable parental omnipresence, the choice not to monitor one’s child may shift from a personal decision to a political act.",

In-depth interviews with 17 users in the United States revealed that the dimensions of physical, social, informational, and psychological privacy, originally defined in interpersonal communication, can be extended to human–algorithm interaction and are still deemed to be significant by users. Popular episodes of privacy invasions showed three main themes that privacy violation perceptions are grounded upon: lack of choice, non-interpretability of algorithms, and lack of understanding and respect. The three basic human needs for growth and motivation proposed by the self-determination theory (SDT) – autonomy, competence, and relatedness – are extended to understand why these invasions matter to users.",

Analysing 1364 public tweets on the platform ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), the article illustrates how the hashtag, framed as humour and sports commentary, perpetuated antisemitic stereotypes through historical tropes and cultural symbols. Utilizing the Lacanian concepts of jouissance and llanguage , the study reveals how #JewGoal extended beyond mere humour, exposing an excessive enjoyment tied to its repetitive and absurd use. This dual function – offering inclusion in online communities while perpetuating harm – underscores how normalized antisemitic language infiltrates sports fandom. By framing #JewGoal as a llanguage of hate, its impact lies not in explicit content but in its provocative repetition. By detailing the persistence of antisemitism in digital spaces, the article emphasizes the need to critically address the enjoyment derived from harmful online speech.",

          "authors": "Elise 't Hoen, Elke Claessens, Dimitri Mortelmans",
          "abstract": "Previous research highlights the role of romantic relationship desire in well‐being and relationship formation. Singlehood satisfaction—one's subjective evaluation of being single—is typically lower among those who desire a romantic relationship but remain single. When this desire persists over time, it may evolve into “prolonged desire”, associated with frustration and lower life satisfaction. Yet, little is known about how this dynamic unfolds longitudinally. This study explores whether prolonged relationship desire is associated with changes in singlehood satisfaction over time and whether these vary by sex or cohort. Using random effects regression on nine waves of the German Family Panel, we found that individuals without relationship desire report the highest singlehood satisfaction. Although time and desire were associated with satisfaction, the effect of time became non‐significant when interactions were included. Notably, individuals of the youngest cohort with relationship desire reported the lowest satisfaction, whereas only individuals of the oldest cohort with desire showed improvement over time. Sex showed no significant effects. These findings offer a dynamic perspective on the implications of prolonged desire for singlehood satisfaction and underscore the importance of temporality and sociodemographic context in understanding singlehood experiences.",

          "abstract": "Some people are single despite desiring a committed romantic relationship. Past research has revealed relationship maintenance strategies—thoughts and behaviors that couple members enact to fuel overall relationship satisfaction and commitment—associated with relationship stability. From two independent samples totaling 2059 single young adults desiring a committed relationship, we assessed whether individuals know that given maintenance strategies are beneficial to long‐term relationship stability (maintenance response‐efficacy) and whether they feel they can implement these strategies in their relationships (maintenance self‐efficacy). We used the newly developed PRIME (Perceptions of Relationship Maintenance Efficacy) to measure these concepts and test several preregistered hypothesized associations. Results revealed that participants, on average, were knowledgeable about the importance of and felt efficacious regarding enacting most strategies. Both maintenance response‐efficacy and self‐efficacy were associated with the duration of recent past romances when scores were combined, but only self‐efficacy was significant when examined independently. These findings highlight the importance of assessing relationship maintenance efficacy among singles seeking a committed romantic relationship. PRIME is also the first relationship maintenance self‐report measure that does not require individuals to be in a relationship for assessment.",

A sample of 186 college‐attending emerging adults aged 18–29 completed an online questionnaire about their mental health and sibling relationship quality. Exploratory analyses examined relations among the prevalence of chronic illness or disability, sibling relationship quality, and flourishing. Results indicate that youth who have a sibling with a chronic illness or disability report lower levels of sibling relationship quality; however, for all youth (regardless of sibling diagnosis), sibling closeness was associated with greater flourishing. Results are discussed in terms of considerations for promoting the well‐being of emerging adults with a sibling living with a chronic illness or disability.

          "authors": "Sydney G. Wicks, MacKenzie Paul, H. Colleen Sinclair",
          "abstract": "Research has extensively examined how social network opinions (approval or disapproval from friends) affect romantic relationships. Friends are not the only ones to have opinions, yet there has been less exploration into whether one's friendship is influenced by opinions of the romantic partner. Balance theory suggests that individuals seek congruent attitudes within triads. Thus, this research (total N = 439) proposes that just as friend opinions (of romantic partner) impact romantic relationships, partner opinions (of friend) influence friendships. In Study 1, participants reported perceptions of a chosen friend's opinion of their partner and the partner's opinion of this friend. In Study 2, we manipulated opinion source and type using vignettes, assessing the hypothetical quality of relationships. Consistent with past research, friend disapproval was associated with lower romantic relationship quality. Uniquely, we found that perceived partner opinions—but not hypothetical ones—predicted friendship outcomes. Whereas friends' opinions did not appear to impact the friendship, partner opinion predicted romantic relationship satisfaction—revealing a potential social opinion backlash effect, whereby partners voicing disapproval of friends not only harm the friendship but also the romantic relationship. Findings suggest a bidirectional influence within networks for partners and friends, with expressing disapproval carrying added costs for romantic partners.",

I investigate how scientists integrate themselves into policy disputes. Through a survey, I identify four groups of scientists with specific self-images regarding their roles in policy disputes: Moderate Mainstreamers, Issue Advisors, Issue Advocates, and Honest Brokers . Furthermore, the findings reveal differences in how these groups of scientists perceive the importance of science in policy-making: Particularly U.S.-based Issue Advocates wish for science to direct policy-making. In addition, I find that pandemic researchers overwhelmingly do not support political causes by selectively communicating political advice. I present empirically evidence that pandemic researchers sought to clarify the relevance of research during the pandemic, but did not attempt to distort policy disputes dishonestly.",

          "abstract": "Genes are increasingly understood to influence behavior. Research—generally conducted among convenience samples— has suggested that genetic influences tend to be perceived as playing a greater role in positive (e.g. prosocial) behaviors than in negative (e.g. antisocial) behaviors. Several potential bases for this asymmetry have been explored previously. We examined, in a U.S. sample, whether an asymmetry in genetic attributions between prosocial and antisocial behavior would be observed, and if so, what might help to explain it. Results revealed that the asymmetry did occur and appeared to be robustly mediated by an asymmetry between how “natural” prosocial and antisocial behavior are perceived to be. Genetic attributions were also lower on average when the individual was described as African American, especially as an African American man. These findings provide further evidence that genetic attributions are endorsed selectively, in ways that appear to reflect pre-existing psychological motivations and views about human nature.",

People in collectivist societies are less outspoken about science in daily life, whereas lower education is associated with higher outspokenness.

          "authors": "Yingwen Wang, Yanghui Cao",
          "abstract": "As China undergoes rapid demographic aging, older Wanghong (influencers over 60) on platforms like Douyin challenge traditional digital inclusion frameworks that conceptualize access as linear progression through motivational, material, skills, and usage dimensions. This study examines how older micro-Wanghong navigate challenges during content creation, revealing critical gaps in existing digital inclusion theory. Drawing on an exploratory qualitative study of 11 micro-Wanghong, we develop the dynamic access concept that reconceptualizes digital inclusion as continuous adaptation across three dimensions: motivational resilience (maintaining creator identity despite platform constraints), adaptive skill development (ongoing competency evolution responding to platform changes), and algorithmic navigation (strategic responses to systematic platform exclusions). Our analysis reveals systematic algorithmic exclusion through temporal marginalization (algorithms favoring high-frequency posting patterns that disadvantage older micro-Wanghong’s rhythms), knowledge domain restrictions (automated content moderation limiting topics relevant to older adults), and culture misalignment (platform architectures optimized for entertainment conflicting with older micro-Wanghong’s knowledge transformation preferences) that create structural barriers independent of individual competencies. Despite these constraints, participants demonstrate sophisticated adaptive strategies enabling sustained creative participation through ongoing platform negotiation rather than static skill application. These findings extend Van Dijk’s digital inclusion theory by demonstrating how platform-mediated content creation collapses traditional access boundaries into ongoing negotiation processes. The dynamic access addresses temporal dimensions which often assumed in digital appropriation or inclusion theories, positioning meaningful participation as requiring continuous adaptive capacity rather than one-time achievement. We argue that digital inclusion policy must evolve beyond basic access provision toward supporting ongoing adaptation to platform evolution.",

We rely on an online survey fielded in 17 European countries on more than 28,000 individuals. Our findings indicate that being embedded in healthier discussions on social media is more of an important predictor of online participation for those respondents reporting higher political discussion fatigue and less so for those perceiving online discussions as fun.

          "title": "From Politics to Entertainment: Exploring “News Finds Me” Perceptions Across News Topics",
          "authors": "Afrooz Mosallaei, Luxuan Wang, Katherine Ognyanova",
          "abstract": "The “News Finds Me” (NFM) perception captures the common belief that one can stay informed without actively seeking news. This study aims to extend previous research by comparing the widely used general NFM measure with topic-specific perceptions of entertainment, sports, politics, COVID-19, and climate change news. We assess the strength, predictors, and outcomes of NFM perceptions across those different thematic domains. Our findings show that NFM perceptions are stronger for soft news (entertainment and sports) compared to hard news (politics, COVID-19, climate change). In addition, interest in a news topic is associated with lower NFM perceptions for hard news and higher perceptions for soft news. While the traditional NFM measure reflects “News Finds Me” perceptions in politics and COVID-19 well, it is not as effective in capturing perceptions of climate change and soft news. Our results emphasize the need to explore different news genres to better understand news consumption beliefs and behaviors.",

          "authors": "Alyaa Anter, Nermeen Ibrahim",
          "abstract": "Drawing on gatekeeping theory and platform governance, this study examined Arab journalists’ perspectives on news gatekeeping via social media, the challenges they faced when covering politically sensitive events, and the strategies they employed to address those challenges. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining in-depth interviews with twenty-four Arab multimedia journalists, social media specialists, and managers, along with an online survey of 171 Arab journalists from four Arab countries. The results revealed that the participants perceived algorithms as powerful intermediaries that considerably influenced their professional practices and news values on social media. They reported their experiences of shadow banning and content removal, particularly when reporting on Arab political issues such as the Palestinian issue. Journalists have reported that they must either adapt to the algorithmic dynamics or employ strategies to circumvent the algorithmic restrictions on Arab news coverage. This study underscores the need for greater transparency in algorithmic curation to ensure the fair representation of diverse voices in political news coverage.",

          "authors": "Ming M. Boyer, Cal le Gall, Carolina Plescia",
          "abstract": "Negative campaigns can have different effects on voting behavior and political attitudes. While recent work has differentiated between contexts and campaigns, few have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of negative campaigns. We argue that negative campaigning may affect whether citizens understand voting as supporting one candidate or party (positive meanings of voting), as opposing another (negative meanings of voting), or even as something useless, unpleasant or undesirable (anti-voting meanings). Using preregistered cross-sectional analyses in the 2022 Hungarian and US elections, we confirm that negative and anti-voting meanings are pervasive, and related to political parties’ use of negative and “dirty” campaigns. Two preregistered survey experiments, however, only confirm the effects of the most outrageous campaign messages. We conclude that meanings of voting are important democratic attitudes that are related to parties’ campaigning behavior. However, they are relatively stable attitudes that are only affected by relatively extreme stimuli.",

          "authors": "Linette Lim",
          "abstract": "Authoritarian regimes seek to control information and influence international public opinion about themselves. While tools of control, such as propaganda, censorship, and digital surveillance, are well documented, less attention has been paid to how these regimes exert pressure on foreign correspondents operating within their borders. Using the case of China and drawing on more than fifty interviews with former and current foreign correspondents, this study examines the multifaceted nature of authoritarian media control and the responses it provokes. It highlights the significance of less obvious forms of control. These include indirect channeling tactics – such as legal ambiguity that deters reporting by creating an atmosphere of uncertainty for journalists and sources – and the role of mobilized citizens in obstructing journalists. The findings show that journalists respond by concealing their activities to preserve professional standards or by conforming to localized restrictions, contributing to our understanding of how state power is quietly contested or reproduced in authoritarian contexts.",

          "authors": "Christopher Hart, Steve Strudwick",
          "abstract": "The communicative style of right-wing populism is characterized by embodied modes of performance as much as verbal stylistic features. This article investigates the embodied performance of one right-wing populist politician, namely Donald Trump, with a focus on one specific kinesic routine: the shrug. While the body’s role in right-wing populist communication is increasingly recognized, it is rarely approached through the kind of systematic analysis afforded by gesture studies within cognitive linguistics. This article takes a multimodal discourse-analytical approach, drawing on gesture studies within cognitive linguistics, to offer a detailed description and critical interpretation of the forms and functions of Donald Trump’s shrugging gestures. The analysis shows how Trump’s shrugs contribute to the kind of ‘corporeal presence’ typically observed of right-wing populist politicians. It further shows the range of evaluative meanings that Trump expresses through shrugs and the ideological functions that such stance-taking acts perform within the context of right-wing populism. In doing so, the article further advances a programme for gestural research in multimodal critical discourse analysis.",

          "authors": "Xiaoben Yuan",
          "abstract": "Children’s drawings serve as a medium for conceptualizing complex societal ideas. This study investigates how Japanese children aged 11–12 years employ multimodal metaphors in tax-themed postcard drawings to represent taxation. By analyzing 712 contest submissions, this research identifies frequent metaphorical categories, examines their distribution across verbal, pictorial, and multimodal modes, and categorizes them into relational and attributional metaphors. Results indicate a substantial reliance on metaphorical reasoning, particularly metaphors that frame taxation positively – as SUPPORT, BETTERMENT, or PROTECTION. Further analysis reveals children’s advanced ability to deliberately use pictorial and verbal resources, aligning multimodal strategies to communicate complex societal concepts. Importantly, relational metaphors, which involve structured conceptual mappings, emerged as significantly more frequent than attributional metaphors, suggesting deep cognitive engagement and advanced reasoning skills. These findings contribute to research on multimodal communication and children’s socio-semiotic meaning-making strategies.",
