          "authors": "Andrew Hickey, Matt Grant, Bruce Woodward",
          "abstract": "The Web opens possibilities for democratic engagement in collecting. Previously closed groups available only to aficionados/cognoscenti are now open to wider networks of collector. This paper argues that a typology of Web collecting is possible to chart. Although not disconnected to offline modes of collecting, or collecting practices that occurred pre-Web, it remains that certain ways of collecting are mediated by Web 2.0 technologies. We see that the Web enables a broader network of collectors to readily access the requisite knowledge surrounding artefacts, provenance and collectability, whilst also provisioning connections with distributed communities of collectors, sellers and brokers in a manner never before available. We suggest that Web 2.0 applications enable capacity for undertaking reconnaissance , the gaining of knowledge , and facilitation of exchange for collectables , as well as furnishing the curation and display of subsequent ownership . These platforms enable the mediated demonstration of one’s identity as a ‘collector’ and point to hallmark features of ‘connected collecting’. Taking these elements of collecting practice as foundational to the connected collector’s persona, we condense a tripartite conceptualisation that includes acquisition - maintenance - curation as an organising typology for considering Web 2.0 facilitation of collecting practice.",

          "authors": "Karen Ross, Claudia Padovani",
          "abstract": "This Special Issue was conceived in an important year for democracy – 2024 – when an estimated 1.5bn people headed to the polls. What we now know, and indeed could have predicted because of the way in which national elections held in the first half of the 2020s were already showing an alarming lurch to the right, was that the super-election year resulted in another significant triumph for populism which was too often accompanied by overtly anti-feminist positions ( Korolczuk et al., 2025 ). The European elections did indeed deliver this outcome across a number of countries, often overturning a solid left-leaning polity; Donald Trump's win in the US Presidential election in November 2024 further consolidated the trend, not just in terms of populist politics but also demonstrating a racist kickback, re-traditionalisation of gender norms and a backlash against feminism and feminists. In Trump's inauguration speech, he said, ‘This week, I will [also] end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life’ and subsequently repealed 78 executive orders signed by Joe Biden, including measures which supported racial equity and which combatted discrimination against gay and transgender people ( https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sign-orders-ending-diversity-programs-proclaiming-there-are-only-two-sexes-2025-01-20/ ). As a key player on the global and media stage, Trump's regressive views on women and diversity contribute a powerful voice to the wider populist discourse and constitute a significant backlash against gender justice. As this Special Issue goes to press, Trump and his allies have double-downed on their anti-ED&amp;I stance, including bullying American universities into abandoning their ED&amp;I policies under threat of funding cuts.",

The study of game photography is a field that has seen relatively sparse engagement from scholars in the past decade. In this article, I discuss virtual photography's potential in gaymers’ visual construction of avatar personas in massively multiplayer online role-playing games. I focus on “gaymers” as they seek alternative identity affordances, expressing dissatisfaction with the narrow range of possibilities in games. In contextualizing the phenomenon, I engage with theories on virtual photography, persona studies, and social networking. I apply this theoretical framework to a series of Instagram accounts dedicated to FFXIV Online avatars. I incorporate a queer methodology in my research to expose how gaymers resist heteronormativity in games. My findings indicate that gaymers queer FFXIV Online 's mechanics and visuals through modding and shaders to visually co-construct a digital self.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how artificial intelligence (AI) is constituted as valuable within organizational settings through communicative practices that mobilize sociotechnical imaginaries of AI and expectations of specific AI models. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a commercial collaboration between an AI company and its client, the study explores how organizational actors manage, negotiate, and anticipate expectations surrounding a customized AI model. Rather than focusing on AI’s technical properties, the analysis attends to how collectively held visions of desirable futures and anticipated capabilities constitute AI’s organizational value. The findings highlight the role of sociotechnical imaginaries and expectations in co-constituting investments and the development of AI, suggesting how AI may function as a placeholder for broader managerial aspirations, especially when actors lack technical knowledge. In doing so, the article contributes to research on AI as a co-organizing force, offering insights into the communicative (re)constitution of technology’s worth and its impact on organizational realities.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate tech workers’ occupational culture in China’s Internet industry and explain how the business context shapes the occupational culture. Design/methodology/approach This case study of tech workers’ occupational culture in China’s Internet industry uses focused interviews with 101 workers for data collection and qualitative coding for data analysis. Findings This research reveals two shared values, “optimising user experience” and “reliable delivering”, among Chinese tech workers and explains how the two values perpetuate their overwork norm and practices. It shows how the dominant user-oriented, go-big-or-go-home business model in China’s Internet industry urges management to bring pressure from the product market inside the work organisations to reconfigure tech workers’ occupational culture. Originality/value Extant studies on IT occupational culture (ITOC) have paid inadequate attention to how its cross-cultural variations are developed from specific social contexts. This research contributes to the literature by illustrating how ITOC in China’s Internet companies is configured in the business context of China’s Internet industry. Contrasting with existing studies that mainly emphasise ITOC as intrinsic values among information technology personnel, this article reveals how ITOC is shaped by extrinsic values from the product market.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to integrate the means-end chain (MEC) theory with the Kano model to better understand the preferences of female binge-watchers who demonstrate high levels of e-leisure attachment, constraints and addiction to over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services. The ultimate goal is to develop effective service design and promotional strategies. Design/methodology/approach This study investigated the OTT services using data derived from mixed-method research. A preliminary qualitative survey was conducted with 28 female interviewees to identify the questionnaire items for a subsequent survey involving 400 valid respondents. Findings The results show that all respondents considered the attributes of “copyright,” “low interference from advertising,” “quick program updates” and “easy access to frequently viewed programs” to be important factors that attract female binge-watchers using the OTT services. However, female binge-watchers with high e-leisure attachment, constraints and addiction have different perspectives on the remaining attributes. By understanding these differences, academics and practitioners can gain insights to formulate effective business strategies. Research limitations/implications This research primarily focused on female individuals aged 18–24 years; therefore, the findings of this study are limited to this specific demographic group. Practical implications The developed hierarchical value maps can assist managers, marketers and designers in the OTT media sector in formulating effective strategies for product design and marketing endeavors. Originality/value This study is the first to integrate the MEC theory with the Kano model to elucidate the cognitive hierarchies of female binge-watchers who utilize OTT services, particularly those with a strong attachment to e-leisure as well as the constraints and addiction associated with this behavior.",

          "title": "Toward generalized effects of goal level on crowdfunding performance: meta-analysis and field evidence",
          "authors": "Kwanho Suk, Sanyoung Hwang",
          "abstract": "Purpose Empirical findings and arguments regarding the relationship between goal level and crowdfunding performance have been inconsistent. This research seeks to clarify these inconsistencies by distinguishing crowdfunding performance into two types of performance metrics, target-based (e.g. goal success, fund-goal ratio and goal completion ratio) and fundraising-based (e.g. total raised funds, number of contributors and amount per contributor). It aims to examine how goal level differentially influences these two types of performance metrics. Design/methodology/approach A meta-analysis of published studies and analyses of crowdfunding data from two heterogeneous platforms (i.e. Kickstarter and Kakao Together) were conducted. Findings Meta-analysis and crowdfunding data analyses consistently present evidence that the type of performance metrics moderates the relationship between goal level and performance. The goal level is negatively related to target-based performance metrics, indicating that lower-level goals perform better in goal success, fund-goal ratio and goal completion ratio. On the contrary, the goal level is positively related to fundraising-based performance metrics, with higher-level goals performing better in the total raised funds, number of contributors and amount per contributor. Practical implications Findings suggest that goal setting in crowdfunding should be guided by the types of performance metrics used to define success, as these metrics are inherently shaped by the platform’s operational model (all-or-nothing vs keep-it-all). Originality/value This research addresses and resolves conflicting findings in the existing literature on the relationship between goal level and crowdfunding performance by clarifying the role of performance metrics in evaluating crowdfunding success.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This article aims to understand the evolution process (lifecycle) of an esports business ecosystem, with Zhongxian Esports Town in China as a case study. Design/methodology/approach A mix of primary and secondary qualitative data was collected. Primary data were gathered through 15 semi-structured interviews with respondents involved in the strategic development of Zhongxian Esports Town. Secondary data consisted of public policies and internal publications. Thematic analysis was applied, with four themes identified that align with four lifecycle phases. Findings In the birth phase (2017–2018), there was a gap between the early planning and the actual business ecosystem due to a lack of capabilities and knowledge about customers, leading to an eventual strategic focus on education. In the expansion phase (2018–2020), more stakeholders were attracted. However, conflicts and tension started to emerge among stakeholders due to limited supply capacity. In the authority phase (2020–2021), there was some evidence of authority being achieved, while new entrants forced their way into the ecosystem. In the last phase (2021–2023), the esports town encountered adverse policy changes. However, it was able to insert new ideas into the old order and therefore renew itself. Research limitations/implications The study analyses in-depth an evolving esports business ecosystem, providing valuable insights into its development trajectory and adaptability. Practical implications The manuscript helps inform decision-making and resource management for policymakers, business managers and other esports stakeholders. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to help understand the lifecycle of a Chinese esports town.",

          "abstract": "The digitalization of communication practices affords major gains for qualitative methods of communication science. What we term digital qualitative fluidity captures the way traditional boundaries between interviewing and ethnography may dissolve through the use of contemporary, digital technologies. We illustrate how communication scholars have leveraged the digital to open ethnographic spaces within interviews to examine situated communication processes of meaning-making in action, amplifying marginalized voices, evoking affect, and enabling sense making–better meeting key goals of qualitative research. We discuss examples of harnessing the fluidity of digital ethnographic interviews in different corners of communication science, dilemmas that accompany this approach, and institutional investments to ensure that qualitative data and methods are valued alongside computational approaches.",

          "title": "Media Task-Switching as Self-Control Failure",
          "authors": "Ranran Z. Mi, Catalina L. Toma, Shiwei Mo",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Media task-switching refers to the act of interrupting a primary task by turning to media distractions. Using a self-control failure framework, this paper examines why and to what effect people engage in task-switching with media. We theorize that media task-switching is dually shaped by people’s motivation to perform well on the primary task and by the presence of “tempting” media. Study 1, a lab experiment ( N = 188), shows that (1) the availability of media produced task-switching, while high motivation to perform well on the primary task reduced it; (2) some media activities (i.e., Facebook browsing) improved mood, but overall, task-switching decreased mood; and (3) task-switching led to a significant drop in task performance. Study 2, a vignette-based online experiment with mixed model design ( N = 163) replicates the effect of motivation on task-switching and further examines how the effortfulness of media activities influences task-switching. In both social media use and texting context, individuals were more likely to switch to low-effort activities (e.g., browsing social media, checking messages) compared to medium-effort or high-effort activities (e.g., composing posts, initiating messages). This paper provides evidence that both psychological and media-related factors jointly shape media task-switching, and advances self-control theory by explicating the tempting characteristics of daily media use.",

          "authors": "Lili R. Romann, Anne Oeldorf-Hirsch",
          "abstract": "Abstract: TikTok’s algorithm (the “For You Page”) leads like-minded, like-diagnosed users together. Amid users frequenting comment sections, seldom research examines how venues of algorithmically-dominated social media might contextualize mental illness discourse. In exploration of how users’ perceived realities both inform and are informed by algorithmic social media environments, the present study offers a theoretical extension of cultivation theory. A reflexive thematic analysis of TikTok comment sections from 15 videos ( N = 15,540 comments) spanning mental illness-related topics including suicidality, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, positions shared and distinguished knowledge between subject groups as a central component of health communication on the platform. Findings illuminate processes of self-diagnosing, presence of an “algorithmic clock,” emotional contagion, and confession hour, driven by the algorithmic environment. Questioning healthcare treatment, looming stigma, and distinct relational struggles thematically illuminated the sharing of such illness-related experiences.",

          "abstract": "Grounded in family financial socialization theory, the purpose of this study was to better understand parent financial socialization processes and outcomes by including multiple perspectives and by studying these processes and outcomes during adolescence (vs. retrospectively during emerging adulthood). We utilized reports from 1,117 U.S. adolescents and their primary caregiver (1,117; total N = 2,234). Through structural equation modeling, we tested the family financial socialization model, with adolescent and parent reports of socialization processes simultaneously considered to determine their relative predictive power on adolescents’ financial outcomes. Our findings in some ways supported Gudmunson and Danes’ model and aligned with previous research and in some ways contrasted with the model and previous research, highlighting the importance of using multi-informant data to study financial socialization and the importance of studying financial socialization during adolescence. Insights from this study can aid educators and practitioners in improving parent financial socialization and, ultimately, enhancing financial behaviors and financial wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "This scoping review seeks to integrate disparate research on the role of similarity in romantic relationships, a topic of long-standing interest among researchers and popular culture alike. We offer a synthesis of 339 articles measuring similarity and relationship outcomes in established romantic relationships. We report trends in extant research regarding domains of similarity, methods of calculating similarity, and sample characteristics. Our findings showed generally mixed results when examining the association between similarity and relationship outcomes. This trend remained consistent across different similarity types and measurement methods, though stronger effects were found for perceived as opposed to actual similarity. Thus, despite popular belief, similarity does not seem to be universally associated with superior relationship outcomes. Future research should incorporate more diverse samples, holistic measures of similarity, and advanced statistical techniques and should explore specific situations where similarity might be crucial.",

          "authors": "Xin Liu, Yaoyao Zhang, Fang Ran, Jinyi Zeng, Yanling Liu",
          "abstract": "Although previous studies have shown that overall psychological need frustration predicts depressive symptoms in adolescents, it is still uncertain whether this applies to the specific components—autonomy, relatedness, and competence frustration—and whether depressive symptoms, in turn, predict these components. Therefore, this study conducted a three-wave longitudinal survey and employed random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) to examine the bidirectional within-person associations between autonomy, relatedness, and competence frustration and adolescent depressive symptoms. Additionally, potential sex and developmental stage differences were explored. A total of 3,188 adolescents from Sichuan, China, participated in the study ( M age = 13.81, SD = 1.51, 51.44% girls), including 1,513 seventh graders ( M age = 12.30, SD = 0.49, 51.42% girls) and 1,675 10th graders ( M age = 15.17, SD = 0.48, 50.57% girls). The results showed that from Time 1 to Time 2, autonomy, relatedness, and competence frustration did not significantly predict adolescent depressive symptoms, but their predictive effects became significant from Time 2 to Time 3. Conversely, depressive symptoms consistently predicted all three forms of frustration across both time intervals. Further subgroup analyses revealed that these dynamic relationship patterns were consistent across sex and developmental stage. These findings underscore the importance of closely monitoring the dynamic interplay between psychological need frustration and depressive symptoms in adolescents, enabling timely interventions to prevent escalation into a vicious cycle.",

          "abstract": "Limited research has explored the connections between relational power and sexual motivations in couple relationships. Self-determination theory provides a framework to explore the links between relational power and different types of sexual motivations. Data were taken from 1,668 newly married couples that participated in three waves of the nationally representative CREATE study. Using an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) framework, this study examined how perceptions of shared relationship power were associated with both partners’ harmonious and inhibited sexual passion, and whether connections were mediated by partners’ sexual autonomy. Results demonstrated that for both partners, a sense of shared power was predictive of greater harmonious sexual passion and less inhibited sexual passion over time. Although concurrent indirect effects were found for both partners, no longitudinal indirect effects were significant. These findings highlight the importance of both partners feeling that they have influence in the relationship for both partners’ sexual well-being.",

          "abstract": "Digital technologies have become ubiquitous infrastructures worldwide, with WhatsApp emerging as one of the most widely used apps, particularly in the Global South. However, its integration into rural and Indigenous contexts in Latin America remains relatively unexplored. The Jujuy Puna, situated in Northwest Argentina and home to Quechua communities, recently gained internet connectivity through state initiatives. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in two villages, Cusi Cusi and Lagunillas del Farallón, this paper examines the use of WhatsApp in these communities. Furthermore, it investigates the intricate dynamics of WhatsApp usage within the realms of kinship and caregiving. To comprehend this phenomenon, we mobilize the concept of kinship to encompass and explain the myriad practices through which individuals in these villages establish connections and preserve a sense of collectivity using digital technologies like WhatsApp.",

          "abstract": "Older age cohorts have been found to exhibit both less interest and less use of digital technologies than younger cohorts, which suggests that they may be less flexible in comparison to younger technology users. However, frequency is not the only differentiating factor between age groups in the context of mobile technology use, as the specific ways in which technologies are used also play a significant role in the daily lives of older adults (65+). Drawing on the selective optimization with compensation (SOC) model, we ask what strategies older adults use to enhance their subjective well-being when using mobile technologies. The thematic analysis is based on 20 elicitation interviews conducted in Central Finland in 2018. Our findings suggest that mobile technologies can act as both a tool to enhance well-being and a source of problems for older adults, and that older adults show considerable creativity in navigating various mobile, digital and non-digital strategies. Furthermore, we argue that these evolving, and thus also in this sense mobile, strategies contribute to the subjective well-being and successful ageing of older adults by providing them with “workarounds” to manage mobile technologies to their benefit.",

          "abstract": "In today's digitally saturated world, mobile apps, particularly smartphone apps, have become indispensable for managing various aspects of life, including efforts to reduce digital media consumption. This study explores digital-disconnection apps as sociotechnical artifacts, examining their place within the self-helped disconnection trend and the broader app ecosystems such as app stores. Through a mixed-methods approach, 55 relevant apps were identified, with 20 app descriptions and 1,193 user reviews analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic coding. The findings reveal that “Productivity” and “Health &amp; Fitness” are the two dominant categories for these apps. While both emphasize mindfulness, habit formation, and personalized dis/engagement, they differ in the problems they address, the alternatives they encourage, and the contexts in which they are used. User reviews highlight concerns about app functionality, with technical and financial barriers revealed. This study sheds light on the gap between the idealized smartphone use and non-use promoted by app publishers, and the practical challenges experienced by users. Furthermore, this study contributes to the growing studies on technologies such as apps serving digital disconnection and well-being purposes, intertwining it with critical examinations of self-help culture within a digital framework.",

          "abstract": "This article provides an overview of empirical research at the intersection between religion, democracy, and media in the Nordic countries. Based on a scoping review of 46 studies published between January 2011 and June 2024, we identify how scholarly attention has concentrated on Islam and Muslim minorities, often in the context of mediatised conflict, securitisation, or cultural tension. The studies commonly focus on practices through which mainstream media underplays religious complexity and reproduces tensions between democratic ideals, such as freedom of religion and freedom of speech. While some studies address non-institutional actors and new media platforms, these remain relatively underexplored in Nordic literature engaging in the intersection of religion, media, and democracy. This scoping review highlights gaps in current scholarship and calls for broader engagement with how religion modulates and structures democratic participation, as well as closer attention to emerging media environments and non-institutional religiosity.",

          "abstract": "The Psychological Distance Scaling Task (PDST), originally developed to assess self‐schema structures, has recently been adapted to assess partner‐schema structures (PSS, i.e., the degree of interconnectedness in one's beliefs about their romantic partner). However, the psychometric properties of the partner version of the PDST have yet to be assessed. Across four studies ( N = 1134), we tested whether PSS (1) were associated with relationship and, to a lesser degree, personal well‐being, (2) offered predictive utility compared to self‐schema structures, and (3) represented a distinct construct from attachment orientations. PSS were correlated with relationship well‐being indices (i.e., relationship commitment, adjustment, satisfaction, quality, as well as causal and responsibility attributions) and, to a lesser extent, personal well‐being indices (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress), supporting its convergent validity. Hierarchical regression models revealed that, generally, PSS adds predictive utility to relationship but not personal well‐being after controlling for self‐schema structures. Finally, PSS were weakly correlated with attachment orientations and explained additional variance in relationship well‐being above and beyond attachment, supporting its divergent validity. We conclude that the partner version of the PDST is a useful tool for assessing partner schema structures.",

Yet, conventional understandings of friendship might not holistically describe the experiences and meaning of friendship when grappling with two ongoing, stigmatized stressors. Guided by Communicated Narrative Sense‐Making theory, this study examines how people with OUD and CJI narratively make sense of friendship. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 19 people with OUD and CJI. Participants defined friendships as instrumental , individualistic , risky , altruistic , and temporary . Findings offer a contextualized definition of friendship focused on material circumstances and deepen theoretical understanding of narrative sense‐making by revealing characteristics of negatively framed stories.",

Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, I highlight differences in how Amazon addresses such entrepreneurs, in how they produce for Amazon, and how they brand their goods for global markets. These differences do not simply reflect distinct national cultures. Rather, they emerge from how Amazon crosses national borders, bringing actors from different political and regulatory contexts, with different levels of development and symbolic resources, into direct contact and competition with one another. I propose that to make sense of these configurations, we must conceptualize global platform capitalism not only as a collection of national cases but as a world system—a differentiated unity that reproduces inequality at the same time it drives innovation.",

Yet, as local ecosystems shift, there is a need to understand the types of audiences localized social media spaces attract, and whether these spaces can foster healthy communities. This article presents the results of a multi-national, longitudinal user survey of participants ( N = 2789) on the social media platform Reddit. We show, for the first time, that people who join localized social media spaces also report higher community attachment and political participation intent than users who join other social media spaces. We find evidence that these pro-community attitudes are stronger for longer-term members of localized social media and those who actively contribute through posts and comments. Surprisingly, we also identify that new residents to an area are more likely to belong to a localized social media forum than long-time residents. This article provides context for how the affordances of technology platforms influence the audiences, behaviors, and community impacts of localized social networks.",

          "authors": "Haiwei Valerie Huang",
          "abstract": "As the space for discussing feminism and related issues on domestic social media platforms in China narrows, Chinese women and feminists are increasingly seeking new platforms that provide a more supportive digital environment for advancing gender justice. This article explores the growing transnational engagement of Chinese digital feminism, with a focus on its presence on the foreign-based social media platform, Instagram. Based on interviews with 12 Chinese female Instagram users and an analysis of 184 of their women-focused posts, this study employs thematic and content analysis to explore the intricate, multi-layered transnational connectivity and social representations that contribute to a distributed form of gendered collective memory. The article argues that the digital engagement of Chinese women on Instagram plays a critical role in offsetting the limitations found in domestic social media platforms. This is vital for preserving certain vanished recollections, disseminating feminist narratives, and building gendered collective memory that challenges and reframes the often-distorted and stereotypical perceptions of Chinese women in public consciousness within China’s domestic media landscape. Despite the constrained impact and visibility of their gendered collective memory on Instagram, largely due to the specific class and group these women socially represent, their transnational efforts in shaping a more equitable collective memory remain noteworthy.",

          "authors": "Jessica Kühn, Claudia Riesmeyer",
          "abstract": "Adolescents’ self-presentation on social media as an expression of identity development is influenced by personal norms and perceived social norms of relevant others. Snapchat is popular and widely used by adolescents to express themselves. A Bitmoji, as an alternative to a traditional profile picture, offers a wide range of self-presentation options through an avatar editor, including body stature and pose, individual facial features, and (branded) clothing. Based on 53 in-depth interviews with adolescents between the ages of 11 and 16, we investigated how Bitmojis are used for self-presentation and where the underlying action-guiding norms come from. Our study revealed the high perceived relevance of Bitmojis among adolescents who consciously use their Snapchat avatar to express themselves. True self-behavior is essential for some adolescents, evidenced by single, regular, or daily changes to Bitmojis’ hairstyles and clothing. Others engage in false self-behavior, displaying an ideal self to hide disliked body features or showing a false self to experiment with their digital identity. The perceived social norms of the peer group play an important role for adolescents as their personal norms.",
