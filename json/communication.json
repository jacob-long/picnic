          "authors": "Tingting Hu, Liang Ge",
          "abstract": "This study explores the datafication of digital intimacy in female-oriented otome games, analyzing how these games construct databases of idealized masculinities and romantic narratives, balancing empowerment and commodification. Through digital ethnography, walkthrough, and interviews with Chinese women players between 2023 and 2024, we reveal how otome games mediate intimacies between women players and virtual male characters, reflecting sociocultural values and shaping affective experiences. These women-oriented games collect intimate data to optimize design and profitability, offering immersive, customizable romantic experiences while commodifying emotional investments. This dual dynamic underscores a tension in emotional capitalism, where intimacy is both enriched and exploited. By examining the interplay between digital intimacy, datafication, and emotional capitalism, our study further contributes to the critical discourse on how role-playing games monetize personal and emotional experiences, emphasizing the need to safeguard user sovereignty as digital platforms capitalize on affective labor.",

We begin by exploring the interplays of colonialism, imperialism, and racial capitalism that have shaped the origins and uses of qualitative methods toward serving extractive agendas of global capital. This critique serves as the basis for outlining the key principles of the CCA, turning to voice, storytelling, and embodied action as the basis for situating qualitative methods amidst anticolonial struggles that resist settler colonialism and extractive neoliberal neocolonialism. Through our review of diverse culture-centered interventions, we explore the roles of voice infrastructures in anticolonial resistance, outlining the contribution made by the CCA to decolonizing research methods by offering a theoretical-methodological framework for communication interventions for social justice.",

News Inside marks an alternative to the commercial-driven logics of the mainstream press, raising questions about normative notions of journalism’s role in constructing a nation-state-bound version of the public sphere. News Inside asks what it means for a collective of people who have been unpublicked by the state to create publicity.",

Findings reveal that although job satisfaction remains high at 73.9%, it has decreased by 9.1 percentage points since 2012 to 2013. Both male and female journalists continue to report similar levels of job satisfaction. Job security and income satisfaction remain the strongest predictors of overall job satisfaction. The implications of these findings are discussed.",

A content analysis of 987 TikTok videos and 201 broadcasts of the Flemish children’s news program Karrewiet was conducted using a codebook developed through focus groups with children aged 8 to 12 ( N = 101) and validated via member-check interviews. Results revealed that television news relies on experts and child sources for consolation, while TikTok avoids sensational images and emphasizes the reporter’s role. In addition, the findings highlight challenges adults face in assessing potentially frightening content for children and recommend involving children in research and editorial decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Across two studies, the current work sought to understand the impact of elaboration questions in political discussion on perceptions of feeling heard and future discussion intentions. Participants were presented with a recorded video of a political conversation where we manipulated the presence and absence of elaboration questions in political conversations surrounding homelessness (Study 1) and abortion (Study 2). Results indicate the presence of elaboration questions increased perceptions of being heard and intentions to engage in discussion in the future. We also found significant indirect results where the relationship between elaboration questions and intentions to engage in future discussions was mediated by feeling heard. These findings were never moderated by whether participants agreed with the political stance taken in the conversation.",

          "authors": "Pascal Schneiders, Birgit Stark",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms are fundamentally disrupting public communication in two ways. First, non-journalistic actors, such as social media influencers, now have easier access to audiences, increasing the range of epistemic authorities. Second, established news outlets are increasingly reliant on platforms, pressuring them to adapt to the demands of social media. This platformization threatens the quality of public communication and citizens’ realization of their epistemic rights. Drawing on these concerns, this article offers a holistic approach to systematically analyze and practically govern epistemic threats to news quality in the platform-driven hybrid news ecosystem by developing a comprehensive three-stage framework that distinguishes between the production, distribution, and reception of news quality. News quality needs not only to be produced (input) but also to be made visible on platforms (throughput) and processed by audiences (output) in order to contribute to an informed public discourse. Focusing on the EU, the article then discusses current regulatory shortcomings and the need for additional measures to safeguard news quality along its three dimensions.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have made advancements in how to interpret, with detailed measures, the different characteristics and levels of distinct listening practices used by individuals when they are deliberating (Scudder, 2020, 2022). However, listening is not only a practice that occurs directly, but also a broader phenomenon that occurs across the public sphere (Bächtiger &amp;amp; Parkinson, 2019; Ercan et al., 2019). Public discourse occurs across hybrid media systems (Chadwick, 2017) in complex discursive exchanges (Maia et al., 2023) as networks of publics interact (Bruns, 2023). Such complexity imposes challenges for research to properly understand listening at a macro level. In this article, I present how to map and measure listening at this broader level. I reconstruct the discussion on listening as a normative foundation for political communication, from which we derive three key listening elements: attentiveness, openness, and responsiveness. I outline how listening is measured in direct interactions, to then explain how it can be assessed in public communication and mediated interactions, from the perspective of who listens, who is (or is not) listened to, and the actual listening acts.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how people employ different news consumption strategies in the personalized but overloaded information environment. Specifically, we examine the psychological mechanisms of news curation and news avoidance through fear of missing out (FoMO) and news overload. An autoregressive analysis of two-wave panel data ( N = 834) shows that news use indirectly affects both news consumption strategies first through FoMO and then through news overload on Facebook. More importantly, the indirect effect occurs only for those who engage in cross-cutting discussion at high and middle but not low levels. This finding addresses a classic dilemma: despite growing concern over increased news consumption, social media users are able to strike a balance between staying informed through news curation and protecting themselves from being overloaded by news avoidance. However, these strategies can be biased because users tend to personalize their information intake after encountering disagreeing viewpoints.",

We examine Twitter discourse before and after Elon Musk’s acquisition and the immediate dismantling of content moderation efforts to identify changes in aversiveness in conversations about LGBTQIA+ people and users’ engagement with such content. Time-series intervention analyses of 6 months of Twitter data ( n = 323,440) show that tweets with toxicity, insults, and threats increased in the 3 months after Musk’s takeover, although the differences were small. The volatility of aversive content also grew over time. Post-Musk, tweets with severe toxicity and insults received more engagement than before. This research provides insight into Twitter as one representation of the shared reality of today’s cultural moment, with implications for minoritized groups and the free flow of information on social media platforms.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how threat appraisal and self-efficacy affect parents’ coping with personalized social media advertising (PSMA) targeting children. A survey of 576 parents of young social media users aged 10 to 17 in Australia reveals that parents are more likely to explain PSMA to their children (individual coping) and support external socialization agents’ initiatives to address the potential risks of PSMA (social coping) when they perceive social media platforms’ data collection practices as significantly harmful. While the extent to which parents believe that their children are vulnerable to harm is positively associated with social coping, it does not influence individual coping. The results also show that parents’ confidence in their ability to carry out parental mediation is positively related to both individual and social coping. However, parents’ confidence in their general parenting ability does not impact PSMA coping strategies.",

          "authors": "Alice Marwick, Courtlyn Pippert, Katherine Furl, Elaine Schnabel",
          "abstract": "This article investigates the intersection of identity, power, and knowledge production on U.S. ConspiracyTok, a genre of TikTok videos promoting conspiracy theories ranging from harmless speculation to harmful disinformation. Drawing on qualitative content analysis of 202 highly viewed videos, we examine how identity markers such as race and gender shape who is empowered or undermined in conspiratorial narratives, and how creators construct and circulate “evidence” to support their claims. We find that American ConspiracyTok is populated largely by young, non-White, and/or female creators who challenge the stereotype of the White, male conspiracy theorist. These creators interpellate audiences through visible identity markers, fostering a sense of intimacy and trust. Marginalized groups are often cast as victims, while institutions like science, government, and media are portrayed as villains. Creators construct legitimacy through visual media, personal anecdotes, deep lore, and remixing fictional and mainstream texts—engaging in a form of populist knowledge production within a generous epistemology that welcomes divergent truths and alternative worldviews. These practices blur the lines between entertainment and ideology, often mimicking academic, or journalistic knowledge production while rejecting institutional authority. While ConspiracyTok can serve as a form of standpoint epistemology that empowers minoritized creators and critiques systemic injustice, it can just as easily reinforce bias and spread disinformation. ConspiracyTok is a site of vernacular theorizing where epistemology and identity are deeply entangled, offering both a critique of mainstream power and a cautionary tale about the populist appeal of conspiratorial thinking.",

          "abstract": "Political influencers are social media users who attempt to shape others’ political attitudes and behaviors through personal influences. While prior research has mainly examined political influencers in Western democracies, this study shifts attention to an international context, focusing on the self-presentation strategies and discursive frames used by non-Chinese political influencers who support China on Twitter (X). Through a thematic analysis of online profiles and a frame analysis of 3000 tweets by 10 influencers, we identified two self-presentation strategies: “the explorer,” which highlights the influencer’s attractiveness, closeness, and passionate authenticity, and “the expert,” which emphasizes expertise and intellectual authenticity. We further propose a typology of four frames used by the influencers to defend or promote China: “Western Hypocrisy,” which criticizes Western double standards; “Western Threat,” which presents the West as a major threat to global security and growth; “System Superiority,” which promotes China’s political model against Western models; and “Common Destiny,” which envisions a prosperous future shared by China’s global partners. We argue that although the political affiliations of these influencers remain ambiguous and difficult to determine, they have become de facto contributors to China’s quest for global reputation in a digital age.",

          "abstract": "The language used in public debates and in the news can influence how citizens perceive the risks and benefits of technology. While framing effects on technology perception are well understood, few studies have focused on the effects of specific terms used to describe technology. We analyze how the terms deepfake and synthetic media affect risk and benefit perceptions across application fields. Using Switzerland as a case, our manual content analysis ( n = 380 news articles) reveals a focus on risks in news coverage of deepfakes with minimal use of the term synthetic media. We then tested the effects of the terms on risk and benefit perceptions in a preregistered survey experiment (n = 736 participants). Term choice does not change perceived risks, but “synthetic media” significantly increases perceived benefits across application fields. As a theoretical contribution, we link our findings to the concept of euphemism, proposing that term choice should align with application fields to reflect the risks and benefits of technology. Overall, our study shows that the terms we use to label technology matter, especially for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "The “Al-Jazeera Effect” posits that Al-Jazeera has reshaped global news flows while challenging the hegemony of Western news outlets. However, few studies to date have measured this “Effect” or offered a method for doing so. This study addressed this gap by conceptualizing news outlets’ online following as Clout and assessing Al-Jazeera’s ability to attract high-quality digital diplomacy followers on Twitter including Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) and UN Missions. Such an analysis is important as the Clout of international news outlets arises in part from their ability to impact foreign policy makers. Using a sample of 56 MFAs, and 132 UN Missions, the study analyzed Al-Jazeera’s digital diplomacy following on Twitter and compared it to that of CNN, BBC World and Reuters. Quality of digital diplomacy followers was assessed using an innovative model consisting of fifteen variables, including offline variables, online variables, and networked variables. Statistical analyses and network analyses demonstrate that Al-Jazeera attracts high-quality digital diplomacy followers, be it UN Missions of affluent states and world powers, or MFAs that are central to diplomatic networks on Twitter. The study also assessed diplomatic institutions’ engagement with Al-Jazeera Tweets, which was found to be quite low. By developing a unique model for assessing the quality of digital diplomacy followers, this study offers a method for measuring the impact of news outlets in the age of social media.",
