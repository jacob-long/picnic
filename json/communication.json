          "authors": "Fuseini Iddrisu, Noel Nutsugah, Derek Onomah, Mavis Essandoh",
          "abstract": "A critical look at the extant literature on the history of public relations (PR) in Africa indicates that the phenomenon started only when the Europeans arrived. These historical narratives ignore PR principles that can be found in the indigenous practices of most traditions in Africa. This study embarks on a critical scholarship guided by in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, observations, and video data to argue that there exist PR principles in Akan indigenous palace communication that predate the arrival of the Europeans. Specifically, the study found several indigenous activities that connote strategic image construction, relationship-building and management, general communication concepts, and media relations function, all of which are core to PR management. Based on the above, the study developed an Akan PR model that depicts notable PR principles within the milieu of Akan palace communication in an attempt to retell the history of PR in a non-westernized context. This study holds scholarship and pedagogical significance for magnifying other voices in the evolution of PR. This is achieved by explicating that traditional African governance structures have long employed strategic communication, relationship management, and reputation management principles.",

          "title": "Big data on pornhub insights: Datafication and the making of a new sexual culture",
          "authors": "Rebecca Saunders",
          "abstract": "Big data has been crucial to the expansion of the pornography industry and its online evolution over the past 40 years. The datafication of digital users’ desire is the economic basis of free porn platforms. These now dominate the industry and foster an easy accessibility that has made pornography so profoundly culturally influential. The Pornhub Network is well-known as the world’s largest collection of free porn sites, receiving over one hundred million visits a day. Only Google, YouTube, Meta and Reddit receive more of digital users’ attention. Porn viewers therefore constitute a massive global audience. The data gathered from them provides important insights into contemporary sexual culture. Pornhub Insights is an important part of this datafication of viewers’ desire. This site parses the big data gathered from the hundreds of millions of daily ‘hits’ across The Pornhub Network, using Google Analytics ‘to dig deep into the data’ about the sexual preferences of its viewers. Where the dataveillance conducted by corporations is often a relatively clandestine practice, Pornhub Insights explicitly foregrounds its datafication. Because the ‘statisticians at Pornhub’ (Pornhub Insights) are able to draw from such huge data stores, Pornhub Insights is used as a resource for journalists and researchers. Its statistics are conceptualised as providing definitive facts about sexuality, drawing on big data’s associations with the scientific and objective. Where statistics and counting have served a regulatory function in relation to sexuality, this article explores what this big data really tells us about contemporary porn consumption and sexuality. It investigates the ideological objectives of data visualisations and asks what the company’s objectives are in publishing the data. This article asks whether the ‘bigness’ of Pornhub’s data makes it more meaningful than other important sociological studies of sexuality. Ultimately, it considers the significance of these massive data sets lies less in their insights about sexuality and more in what they reveal about cultural perceptions and expectations of big data itself.",

          "abstract": "The rapid growth of streaming platforms and their catalogues has transformed the way audiences engage with content, offering unprecedented content choices. This article delves into the presence of content from small countries on VoDs in Europe and explores how users engage with such content on different types of VoD services. Based on a literature review, an analysis of content availability in European VoD catalogues and the results of qualitative media diaries and interviews carried out in seven small European markets, the ultimate goal is to provide insight into how users engage with streaming platforms and other intermediaries to discover content, to highlight key trends regarding this matter and to discuss what these findings mean for the availability, discoverability and consumption of films from small markets.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study provides researchers and business practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) transparency in the business discipline, enabling them to navigate the evolving digital landscape, where AI transparency is an escalating concern, by identifying the conceptual foundations in the most influential studies. Design/methodology/approach This study uses bibliometric analysis techniques, including performance and co-citation analyses. These analyses are grounded in data extracted from the Social Sciences Citation Index within the Web of Science, comprising 108 primary articles and 7,459 secondary (cited) documents. Findings AI transparency research is rising with a greater focus on end-users. Six clusters of cited publications serve as the bedrock of AI transparency in the business discipline: trust, AI explanation, bias and power, undesirable usage, user acceptance/aversion and user heuristics. Analyzing these clusters revealed a framework for signaling AI transparency that can be extended to future research and business strategies. Originality/value This study addresses the following research gaps. First, the nature of AI transparency and its knowledge base remain elusive. Second, AI transparency in the business discipline is underexplored compared to information sciences and law. Third, there is ambiguity surrounding the implementation strategies for AI transparency, with companies often resorting to simplistic methods such as updating terms and conditions. Fourth, there is a lack of clear future research directions specifically for AI transparency, as opposed to the broader context of AI ethics.",

          "authors": "Yang Li, Seung Ho Park",
          "abstract": "Purpose Prior research on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has overlooked how eWOM valence ambiguity and the external environment influence the relationship between eWOM volume and platform performance. Based on signaling and information processing theories, this study differentiates various types of eWOM valence ambiguities and examines how these ambiguities, along with the external environment, affect the impact of eWOM volume on P2P lending platform performance. Design/methodology/approach Using data from Chinese P2P lending platforms (January 2018–July 2019), econometric analyses evaluate the connection between eWOM volume and platform performance as well as the moderating effects of valence ambiguity and external uncertainty. Findings The findings confirm that eWOM volume significantly influences platform performance. However, this positive effect diminishes with high inconsistencies between star ratings and textual eWOM or increased external uncertainty. Research limitations/implications This study’s scope is limited to Chinese P2P lending. Future research should explore diverse markets and user engagement through experimental designs. Practical implications This study offers practical strategies for P2P lending platforms in emerging markets, emphasizing the importance of managing inconsistencies between star ratings and textual reviews and addressing lenders’ concerns in uncertain signaling environments. Originality/value This study advances the understanding of P2P lending and eWOM dynamics by analyzing the interplay between eWOM volume and internal and external factors related to eWOM diagnosability. It highlights how inconsistencies in star ratings and textual eWOM, coupled with external uncertainty, exacerbate decision-making challenges for potential lenders and reduce the positive impact of eWOM volume.",

          "abstract": "Social media technologies have been criticized as ineffective sources of information because users seem to increase their subjective but not their objective knowledge. While different factors such as multitasking have been brought up as explanations, direct and fair comparisons of learning outcomes between social and traditional news media are missing. This two-wave field experiment (N1 = 902, N2 = 663) shows that whereas participants receiving information on social media did learn less than participants receiving the same information through an email newsletter, this difference disappeared when cognitive elaboration on social media was triggered through elaboration questions. Correlational analyses further suggest that multitasking is one factor which hinders successful knowledge acquisition on social media. Our findings suggest that learning through social media is possible if social media contents invite cognitively elaborate processing.",

This two-wave survey of adults in the USA incorporates scholarship on social media habits and social media mindsets for an expanded view of the antecedent psychological conditions of the “news-finds-me” perception. Path analyses indicate habitual use of social media to have direct effects and core beliefs about social media and algorithmic control to have indirect effects through habitual use. These patterns hold for two of the three sub-dimensions of the NFM perception, indicating habit and mindset to be fruitful theoretical directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "The present study explored the role of phubbing, or interrupting a conversation by attending to one’s cell phone instead of their communication partner, among 51 couples living together during the COVID-19 pandemic. Framed by affection exchange theory, the present study examined whether phubbing was indirectly associated with relationship satisfaction via feelings of affection deprivation. The findings indicated that phubbing was associated with greater feelings of affection deprivation, which in turn were associated with less relationship satisfaction. However, phubbing similarity (i.e., the extent to which partners engaged in similar phubbing behaviors) was not associated with affection deprivation or relationship satisfaction. Dyadic analyses revealed a partner effect between affection deprivation and relationship satisfaction. The theoretical implications for co-present phone use and its impact on relational dynamics are discussed.",

Its unprecedented analytical, personalization, and scaling capabilities could transform economic, health, and other development outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, issues associated with the AI technologies that underlie social media platforms, such as algorithmic bias and misinformation, and emerging risks of AI persuasion and autonomy could undermine LMICs’ social and human development goals, particularly those with nascent AI governance and capacities. This commentary examines AI-powered social media’s potential to contribute to development in LMICs through social and behavior change, the role of human cognition and cultural influences in mediating AI risks, and how a human-centric approach familiar to international development could help LMICs shape AI-powered social media that supports their values and development goals.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates political incivility in journalism through a discursive approach, conceptualizing journalism as continuously constituted through interpretative processes. Building on theories of hybrid journalism as an everyday condition embedded in journalistic practices rather than merely a technological phenomenon, the research examines how journalists discursively construct, interpret, and utilize political incivility. Through interviews with 32 political journalists, the study identifies three interconnected dimensions of hybridization that facilitate the spread of uncivil content in the Italian media landscape: media platforms and production processes, journalistic roles and practices, and content genres. Findings reveal that the cross-platform circulation of uncivil content amplifies its visibility, while economic pressures incentivize its use as a monetization strategy. Journalists experience tension between professional ideals and market demands, leading to role hybridization that combines traditional practices with entertainment-oriented ones. Five approaches to political incivility emerge: providing interpretive frames, spreading uncivil content, contextualizing it, fueling it, and avoiding it. The Italian context, characterized by strong political parallelism and polarization, offers a compelling case for understanding how incivility functions as a structural feature rather than a side effect of hybrid media systems. This study contributes to existing scholarship by demonstrating how multiple levels of hybridization mutually reinforce the proliferation of incivility, potentially undermining public trust in journalism and its democratic function.",

          "abstract": "Online lurking is a common behavior but defining it and understanding its motivations is complex. Various definitions and measurements for online lurking have been employed but have often suggested “lurking” to be conflated with other behaviors. This study developed and tested a scale to measure consistent online lurking (COOL), addressing the need for a clear conceptualization and measurement of this behavior. Exploratory factor analysis explicated two dimensions of online lurking – online invisibility and preference for content consumption, and confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the two-factor structure. The resulting scale demonstrated good reliability across two samples. The study differentiates consistent lurking from information-seeking and contextual factors, focusing on individuals who tend to lurk across platforms. This conceptualization provides a theoretical contribution by illuminating a subset of online users who are often underrepresented in research but are integral to online communities despite their invisibility.",

          "abstract": "Social media are key arenas for public opinion formation, but are susceptible to coordinated social media manipulation (CSMM), that is, the orchestrated activity of multiple accounts to increase content visibility and deceive audiences. Despite advances in detecting and characterizing CSMM, the attribution problem—identifying the principals behind CSMM campaigns—has received little scholarly attention. In this article, we address this gap by synthesizing existing research and developing a theoretical model for understanding CSMM. We propose a consolidated definition of CSMM, identify its key observable and hidden characteristics, and present a rational choice model for inferring principals’ strategic decisions from campaign features. In addition, we present a typology of CSMM campaigns, linking variations in scale, elaborateness, and disguise to principals’ resources, stakes, and influence strategies. Our contribution provides researchers with conceptual and heuristic tools for attribution and invites interdisciplinary and comparative research on CSMM campaigns.",

This study examines the protracted conflict between the governmental authorities of Leon Valley and First Amendment auditors to explore the re-placement of civic engagement for the age of social media, facilitated by the development of what I call paralocal relationships. Paralocal relationships describe a sense of familiarity with and concern toward a place featured in media by viewers who have never been there. First Amendment audits enable paralocal relationships by combining on-the-ground activism with clear and simple calls to action for distant viewers, helping to convert audiences into engaged and invested participants in the political life of featured places and enabling new modes of participatory politics.",

          "abstract": "Human trafficking, a grave human rights violation with far-reaching global consequences, serves as a compelling case study for analyzing multifaceted polarization dynamics in online discourse and the influence of social media on public perceptions and responses. Drawing on social identity theory and self-categorization theory, this article aims to elucidate both group polarization and opinion polarization surrounding human trafficking on social media. Through an integrated approach that combines clustering, social network analysis, text mining, and topic modeling, this study provides a comprehensive examination of community formation, influential actor identification, topic classification, and semantic analysis. The similarity between user-generated content from clustered groups and the topics identified is calculated to quantify the degree of multifaceted polarization. The findings reveal a robust community structure within the network and uncover divisions and structural characteristics across each subgroup. Utilizing the BERTopic model, thematic clusters such as vulnerable groups, persecution experiences, incident areas, law and politics, public awareness, contraband, and case events are identified, reflecting the primary public concerns regarding human trafficking. This research enhances our understanding of multifaceted polarization shaped by social identity in digital conversations about critical social issues and holds significant implications for policymakers, advocacy groups, and practitioners navigating public opinion regarding human trafficking in the digital realm.",

Drawing on literature on online sociality and gamification, this study demonstrates how Douyin’s gaming elements introduce a playful dimension to social interactions and examines the implications of transforming sociality into a game. Using a mixed-method approach comprising the walkthrough method and diary-interview technique, the study finds that gamified features—such as friendship badges, quantified levels, and virtual pets—can encourage social behavior and strengthen interpersonal bonds. However, these effects are primarily confined to small, strong-tie friendship groups and do not extend to larger, weak-tie networks. The findings suggest that Douyin users often display heightened awareness of how algorithms exploit their social behaviors, prompting them to adopt cautious and critical digital practices. The article makes both empirical and methodological contributions by offering a case study of gamification in socialization and demonstrating the utility of the diary-interview approach for analyzing user interactions.",

          "abstract": "Launched in December 2019, the European Green Deal (EGD) represents the European Union’s (EU) ambitious policy framework to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. This study employs a sentiment analysis of 582,156 tweets from the beginning of 2020 to April 2024 to understand the evolution of public sentiment toward the EGD. Grounded in Social Representations Theory and Framing Theory, we analyze sentiment trends, topic distributions, and the impact of key policy and external events (e.g. COVID-19 spread) on public sentiment. The results reveal predominantly neutral sentiment (61.68%), with more positive (28.26%) than negative (10.06%) sentiment overall and a substantially stable trend over time. EU-affiliated accounts showed higher positive sentiment compared to non-EU-affiliated accounts. Sentiment trends were correlated with key policy announcements and global events, demonstrating the intricate relationship between policy communication and the formation of public opinion. The study identified key themes and specific initiatives driving positive sentiment, including those linked to the first EU climate law and climate targets, Farm to Fork, and New European Bauhaus. Conversely, economic concerns, challenges in policy implementation challenges, ecosystem conservation status, and food system, and energy security issues appeared as associated with negative sentiment. The findings highlight the importance of targeted communication strategies, transparent response to skepticism, communication of policy processes, and stakeholder feedback collection tool enhancement to leverage public sentiment in support of the EU green transition, paving the way for future research to explore regional nuances and sentiment monitoring.",

          "authors": "Carlos Entrena-Serrano",
          "abstract": "Social media’s transition into algorithmic content recommendations, accelerated by TikTok’s entry into the ecosystem, has reshaped platforms’ consumptive curation affordances, reducing users’ ability to curate their feeds directly. While previous research has explored user experiences with TikTok’s algorithmic recommendations, there has been limited attention to how its interface shapes these interactions. This article interrogates the role of TikTok’s interface design in shaping these new consumptive curation affordances. Drawing on Davis’s concept of consumptive curation – users’ selective engagement with vast pools of content – and literature on social media affordances and mediation theory, I present consumptive curation affordances as relational: shaped by the interplay between platforms’ technological design, user practices and social arrangements. TikTok’s interface is central in this interplay, mediating consumptive curation practices with algorithmic recommendations through several affordance mechanisms. I analyse TikTok’s interface through a walkthrough method, organised according to the algorithmic experience framework, where I operationalise the concepts of friction levels and affordance mechanisms. Findings reveal the dominant role of the For You Page, where TikTok strongly encourages users toward passive consumptive curation – watch, scroll, repeat – while refusing to provide enough transparency about how interactions curate recommendations and discouraging users from disabling data collection. As a result, TikTok’s interface discourages users from strategising consumptive curation practices, demanding reliance on opaque algorithmic recommendations. This study offers a theoretical foundation for understanding how interface design influences consumptive curation affordances. Grounded in a relational view of affordances, future studies can explore how socially situated users strategise interactions with TikTok’s algorithmic environment.",

          "abstract": "Social media have transformed political campaigning by enabling direct interaction between politicians and voters, becoming a key tool for shaping public opinion. Moral language is pivotal in this dynamic as it captures attention in an overly information-saturated social media environment and wields significant influence over political opinions. Populists thrive on social media by fostering distrust in elites, using emotional language, and reducing complex issues to simple “us vs. them” binaries. We argue these factors are rooted in moral underpinnings, which may play a significant role in the appeal of populist parties and have thus far received limited scholarly attention. Consequently, this paper addresses the research question: To what extent, and in what ways, do populist parties exhibit a distinct moral-rhetorical profile on social media that sets them apart from mainstream politicians? Using Moral Foundations Theory, natural language processing, and a computational semantic network approach, we analyzed 11,205 social media posts from Dutch political parties and leaders during the 2023 Dutch election campaign across X, Facebook, and Instagram. Our findings reveal that populist parties emphasize Care and Authority over other moral foundations, while mainstream parties exhibit a different moral foundation distribution. These results align with the part of populist communication logic that frames populist actors as defenders against corrupt elites and external threats, as well as representatives of the people’s demand for sovereignty. Moreover, we found populist parties exhibit less internal consistency in their moral rhetoric across platforms than mainstream parties, suggesting a potentially higher adeptness at tailoring messages to different platforms and their affordances.",
