          "authors": "Max Kaplan",
          "abstract": "Since its inception in 2012, the film producer/distributor A24 has relied on building and sustaining hype across its niche fanbase of cinephiles. The 2021 launch of their subsidiary label A24 Music made official a longstanding aspect in A24’s marketing strategy: its tight-knit association with indie music culture. In the age of what Claudia Gorbman calls the mélomane (or music-loving auteur), A24 has established itself in many ways as a mélomane among production companies, fostering a synergy with music cultures that factors into what Jordan Brower calls its brand pedagogy. While Brower argues that A24’s brand pedagogy positions itself as a steward of global film culture, this article will argue that their brand pedagogy extends to music cultures as well. Building upon Sarah Thornton’s theories of subcultural capital, Jonathan Gray’s work on paratextuality, and Jeff Smith and Michael Z. Newman’s respective studies on film music synergy and indie film culture, I will position A24 within a lineage of cultural and industrial trends that have made it possible for a production company to assume the role of mélomane. Through analysis of A24’s musical paratexts both online and off (including trailers, podcasts, YouTube features, playlists, vinyl records, zines, and merch offerings), I will illustrate how the brand has reinvented synergy between cinephile audiences and musical subcultures for the 21st century. This article will end with a case study of A24’s 2023 re-release of Talking Heads’ concert film Stop Making Sense , wherein they deployed an arsenal of paratextual strategies to cultivate intergenerational synergy and double-down on a brand pedagogy that’s fully committed to educating viewers about music cultures of the past and present.",

          "authors": "Christopher Ball, Kuo-Ting Huang, Xuan Nie, Elaine Kong, JM Shalani Dilinika",
          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a branch of AI capable of producing novel content from human input, is poised to transform various aspects of society. However, the benefits and challenges of GenAI adoption are not equally distributed, contributing to a new layer of digital inequality, the GenAI divide. This study examines the individual factors associated with psychological barriers, GenAI competency, and adoption readiness. Using data from a stratified online survey of 305 participants, the study explores sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, age, race, education, and income), as well as competency factors (e.g., operational and creative skills) and psychological factors (e.g., attitudes toward AI, GenAI decision reliance, and self-efficacy). Findings reveal that operational skills and comfort with AI were significantly associated with lower anxiety and higher adoption readiness, whereas negative technology attitudes were associated with increased barriers. Furthermore, greater reliance on GenAI for decision-making was associated with lower self-assessed competency, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in which less confident users may increasingly depend on automated recommendations. These results highlight the multi-dimensional nature of the GenAI divide, emphasizing the interplay between individual-level factors and inequality-related outcomes. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions, such as AI literacy programs and supportive digital communities, to address these disparities and promote equitable access to the benefits of GenAI. By identifying key factors associated with GenAI adoption, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of digital inequality in the age of generative AI technologies.",

          "authors": "Signe Ivask",
          "abstract": "This article analyses how Estonian journalists negotiated professional boundaries over a decade of technological and organisational change. Based on five interview waves (2012–2023) in national and local newsrooms, it traces shifts in symbolic, epistemic, organisational and temporal boundaries. Results show migration rather than erosion: from the marginalisation of online journalism in 2012, through debates about originality and quality, to institutionalised convergence and questions surrounding metrics in 2022/2023. Journalists accepted digital integration as routine but defended verification and public value. The study provides a diachronic account of identity formation in a small Central and Eastern European market, extending boundary work research by highlighting shifting lines of legitimacy and demonstrating how commercial and organisational pressures, rather than political capture, dominate struggles over identity.",

          "authors": "Johan Farkas, Mette Bengtsson",
          "abstract": "This article investigates how professional fact-checkers defend collaborations with major platform companies such as Meta, Alphabet, and ByteDance. Drawing on 12 qualitative interviews with European fact-checkers, the study applies rhetorical apologia theory to analyse recurring justificatory arguments. We identify four modes of differentiation and three modes of transcendence employed by fact-checkers. Arguments of differentiation involve distancing fact-checking from platform company partners to emphasise editorial independence; distinguishing between different platform companies to legitimise partnerships with certain actors while rejecting others (notably TikTok owned by ByteDance); separating platform companies as a whole and specific employees within them; and contrasting platform funding with state funding to defend the former as less compromising for editorial autonomy. Arguments of transcendence invoke counter-factual scenarios of unmitigated misinformation; appealing to broader alliances against disinformation; and highlighting the potential for improving platform companies from within. These findings contribute to existing scholarship by unpacking how fact-checkers negotiate the complex institutional dependencies of platform company partnerships by simultaneously acknowledging risks and asserting pragmatic necessity. As such, the study provides a deeper understanding of the challenges facing fact-checking organisations and their efforts to establish legitimacy as epistemic authorities in the boundary terrain shared with other key actors in today's media landscape.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the role of social media and influencers in promoting harmful physical stereotypes that increase adolescents’ vulnerability to eating disorders (EDs). Using a mixed-method approach, we analyse national and international news on EDs published by El País and El Mundo in 2024 ( N = 24), along with a content analysis of 10 Instagram profiles of celebrities who have publicly acknowledged suffering from EDs. Although information about these disorders is abundant, adolescents do not always interpret it critically. Social media has become a space where unhealthy aesthetic ideals and unverified health content circulate widely. Influencers often reinforce extreme thinness and perfection, while messages on mental health or body diversity remain scarce. We also identify digital subcultures that normalise risky practices, including viral challenges and pro-anorexia communities. The study highlights the importance of enhancing media literacy, promoting positive role models and demanding greater accountability in content targeted at minors.",

          "authors": "Tamas Tofalvy",
          "abstract": "In recent years, the field of digital journalism in Hungary has undergone a profound transformation. One of the driving forces behind this change is the global platformisation of journalism, which has had far-reaching effects on journalism's business and practices. Another, local factor is the government's increasing intervention in the media industry and journalism. Using Telex.hu, one of Hungary's most read independent online news sites as a case study, this paper maps the socio-technical web of affordances and dependencies that digital journalistic content production and distribution must navigate under these circumstances. The paper concludes that the government's economic interventions weaken the financial relationship between journalism and advertisers, while platforms’ dominance over distribution channels weakens the direct relationship between journalism and audiences. The interplay of media and platform captures form a hybrid ecosystem of control in which content functions as the operational intersection point of political-economic and technological power.",

          "authors": "Igor Vobič",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how journalistic professionalism in Slovenia is continually renegotiated through the interplay of normative ideals, ideological imperatives and material constraints. By tracing how normative commitments rooted in the principle of publicity interact with ideological imperatives and material constraints, professionalism in Slovenian news journalism is shown to be relational and constantly reconfigured. These forces converge uniquely, revealing tensions and compromises inherent in maintaining journalistic professionalism amid the reconfiguration of autonomy, the pauperisation of journalistic work, the proletarisation of the journalism community and the growing digitalisation and platformisation of news production. Introducing the concept of hollow professionalism, the paper argues that notwithstanding the symbolic architecture of professionalism in place, its normative core is ever more constrained by ideological influences and material pressures, leaving professionalism more performative and a matter of instrumental rationality.",

          "authors": "Lenka Waschková Císařová",
          "abstract": "Editors are in an ambivalent position: on the one hand, their contribution to the production of journalistic content is often invisible to the outside world; on the other, their practices, responsibilities and the teamwork in which they hold decisive positions are considered key components of professional journalism. As their role is generally understudied or treated as part of the wider field of journalism, they find themselves on the periphery of journalism studies. Information about editors’ professional practices and how they change is particularly scarce in the context of Central and Eastern European post-transformation media systems. This paper addresses this gap by examining how two generations of Czech editors perceive and assess their work. Drawing on in-depth interviews, the findings uncover differences and similarities between the downturn and the transformation generations of Czech editors, including the conflicts perceived and the mutual criticisms formulated by representatives of the two generations.",

The article compares a particular discourse of climate change—the Anthropocene—in two digital games: the 4X strategy game Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (1999) and the computer roleplaying game Disco Elysium (2019). Comparing two games separated by decades, production context, and genre reveals productive differences and similarities in the representation of the Anthropocene. The article presents an overview of the Anthropocene discourse from its origins to its relationship to complementary and competing concepts such as the noosphere and Capitalocene. The fictionalized Anthropocene(s) presented in Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and Disco Elysium are then read for their resonance with these real-world visions of the Anthropocene. The article demonstrates complications to the tendency of various digital game genres to articulate specific discourses of the Anthropocene, ranging from games’ narrative genres and the broader political currents during game production.",

          "authors": "Itoro Abraham, Juliana Sutanto, Ruilin Zhu, Mahsa Honary",
          "abstract": "Purpose The study of AI ethics is rapidly expanding, but West Africa faces a disadvantage due to the lack of available data and research. This leaves the region susceptible to the negative consequences of imported AI technologies. Our study helps to identify the root causes of unethical outcomes. It provides valuable insights for dealing with AI’sunethical outcomes and understanding the social changes it may bring while addressing the pressing need for research that explores the interaction between resources, power relations, and social norms that influence AI development from the developer’s perspective. Design/methodology/approach Following critical social theory, we interviewed 45 system developers from West Africa. We adopted the postcolonial theory to examine power dynamics in AI development, algorithm colonisation, technology mimicry and decolonisation. We applied the critical thematic analysis for the data analysis. Findings This study examines the power dynamics in global AI development through the lens of postcolonial theory, highlighting the dominance of the Global North, particularly corporations and research institutions in North America and Western Europe. This dominance extends beyond technological control, including narratives, resources and policymaking processes that influence AI’sglobal trajectory. Local entities in the Global South, such as those in West Africa, heavily depend on foreign vendors for AI technologies. This reliance curtails local autonomy and perpetuates a cycle of dependency reminiscent of historical colonial practices, a phenomenon described as technological imperialism, thus driving technology mimicry and algorithm colonisation. Originality/value Our research is a valuable and timely contribution to AI ethics, providing insightful perspectives on the ethical challenges posed by AI in West Africa. Our findings serve as an essential roadmap for shaping policy decisions related to AI education, governance, and design, aiming to promote inclusive and ethical development in West Africa. Through our rigorous theoretical analysis and practical insights, we aim to foster a culture of inclusive AI development, ethical excellence, social responsibility, and accountability in our rapidly evolving world.",

          "abstract": "We report a systematic review of longitudinal studies published in SSCI-Communication journals over the 50 years, focusing on how time is conceived, measured, and analyzed as a scientific concept. To facilitate the review, we devised two novel classification schemes to distinguish between longitudinal and non-longitudinal studies and to measure how time is treated. We manually coded a random sample of 1,080 research articles, supplemented with computerized keyword scanning of the study population. The results show that longitudinal studies have steadily accounted for about 9% of the publications. Panel data studies outnumber time-series studies in a ratio of 3:2. Three-fourths of the longitudinal studies treat time as a timing index and aim to test causal effects, whereas a quarter treat time as a parameter to capture temporal dynamics. Longitudinal studies make more conceptual contributions and receive more citations than non-longitudinal studies. We offer practical recommendations for longitudinal communication research.",

          "abstract": "The “n-word” remains one of the most offensive racial slurs, yet it is used by both Black and non-Black individuals. Across three studies (total N = 1,063), we examined how Black people perceive its use based on the speaker's racial identity and racial self-identification, while also varying valence and context. In Study 1, we varied the target race who used the n-word (Black, Black–White biracial, White); in Study 2, we manipulated the valence in which the n-word was used (positive or negative); and in Study 3, we explored how a biracial person racially self-identified (Black-identified, biracial-identified, or Black-disidentified) shaped reactions. Black participants reported more negative perceptions and affective responses when a White (Studies 1 and 2) or Black-disidentified biracial (Study 3) target used the word, compared to Black, Black–White biracial (Studies 1 and 2), or Black-identified biracial (Study 3) targets, highlighting how racial identity shapes perceptions of those who use racial slurs.",

          "abstract": "Verbs, as the conventional linguistic category for expressing action and motion, possess meta-semantic associations specifically with action-orientation—associations not typically found in other grammatical classes (e.g., nouns). The central aim of this research was to examine whether the proposed association between verbs and action manifests in shorter response times for verbs compared to other grammatical forms. In Studies 1a and 1b ( N 1a = 136, N 1 b = 323), we examined the impact of exposure to verbs versus nouns on overall completion time for a complex questionnaire survey. In Studies 2a and 2b ( N 2a = 92, N 2b = 96), we employed a syntactic classification task to investigate behavioral responses to verbs and nouns, using a pseudoword paradigm in which carefully constructed lexical stimuli were devoid of semantic meaning but clearly conveyed grammatical class through suffixes. Across all four experiments, we consistently observed shorter response times for verbs and pseudoverbs compared to nouns and pseudonouns, suggesting that grammatical class exerts meta-semantic effects on behavior.",

          "abstract": "Challenges faced by adult-child caregivers can intensify during calamitous events, potentially resulting in adjustment disorder symptoms. This study examined the contribution of demographic characteristics (age and gender), self-reported number of war-related stressful events, intolerance of uncertainty, and caregiver burden to explaining adjustment symptoms among adult-child caregivers who resided in Israel during the initial months of the Israel-Gaza war. A total of 402 Israeli adult-child caregivers participated in the study. We performed a three-step multiple hierarchical regression analysis. All independent variables included in the regression model had a significant contribution to explaining the variance in the dependent variable. Being female, younger, experiencing a higher number of war-related stressful events, higher reported intolerance of uncertainty, and greater reported caregiver burden were related to higher levels of adjustment disorder symptoms. The findings underscore the complex relationship between caregiving demands, wartime stressors, caregiver characteristics, and adjustment disorder symptoms among adult-child caregivers residing in Israel. Amidst 21st-century uncertainties, the challenges associated with caring for an older parent may intensify, along with their potential negative consequences. These findings lay the groundwork for developing policies and services tailored to provide adapted support to family caregivers during such challenging times.",

          "authors": "Olivia Crawford, Phoebe E. McKenna-Plumley, Rosalyn Millar, Tanja M. Gerlach",
          "abstract": "Across many regions of the world, more people are not having children. Non-parents are viewed more negatively than parents, particularly those who deliberately choose to forego parenthood. This systematic review synthesises existing literature on social networks and support among parents and non-parents, attempting to distinguish between different groups of non-parents, namely not-yet-parents, childless, and childfree individuals. Eighty studies were included, sourced from systematic searches of six scientific databases, supplemented by a systematic search of ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, hand searches of Google Scholar, websites of relevant organisations, reference lists from prior reviews and included studies, and contacting authors. Findings are presented using narrative synthesis, supplemented by average effect size estimates for group differences for selected aspects. Parents have larger, more stable, family-centred networks, reliant on children and relatives for support. In contrast, non-parents have smaller, more diverse networks, with closer relationships with friends and siblings, but often rely on formal (i.e. paid) sources of support. The available evidence on differences and distinctions between groups of non-parents is investigated, emphasising a need for appropriate operationalisation of reproductive status groups in future research. Implications of life course-related changes in social networks for those with and without children are discussed.",

It is noteworthy that the vast majority of such research has focused on hard news beats. In contrast, we know very little about the role that soft forms of news, such as lifestyle journalism, may play in reporting inclusion. To address this issue, this study draws on interviews with lifestyle journalists from Austria and the United States ( n = 74). We find that while this particular specialty offers potential for inclusion, lifestyle journalists broadly do not believe they are tapping that potential.",

Indeed, the process of mass communication looks different today than in the early days of the field, which naturally affects how to define and measure media effects. In this forum, leading communication scholars provide arguments as to whether we should keep using the term “mass communication,” adapt its definition, or develop entirely new concepts that better reflect our fragmenting media environment.",

          "abstract": "Multiple crises have marked the formative years of young adults. These crises heightened the need for information while also creating a large audience for misinformation. This article highlights digital resilience in four countries (the US, the UK, France, and Canada) and across different age groups, using a survey conducted in February 2021 at the apex of a series of crises. Based on a sample of 6,000 respondents, the two youngest age groups are more likely to use fact-checking websites, verify suspicious information, and report misinformation to social media platforms. These practices reflect digital resilience. In terms of cross-national differences, respondents from the US have higher use of fact-checking sites, which can be explained by the structural availability of these websites, which tend to focus on American content. In line with theories about uncertainty avoidance, respondents from France have higher rates of verification of suspicious information. Canada is distinctive in its low rates of misinformation reporting to social media platforms. While much of the scholarship has focused on political ideology as shaping engagement with misinformation, this study highlights generational differences, cultural differences, digital literacy programming, structural opportunities, and regulatory frameworks that may shape practices related to digital resilience.",

Turkey was chosen for the case study to build, establish, and demonstrate this concept, but the concept is intended to be applicable transnationally, particularly in countries where global political events have local ramifications and where such forms of intersectional solidarity, coalitions, and collaboration are needed.",

          "abstract": "Older adults in China are increasingly active digital users, but they encounter distinctive challenges when navigating deceptive content online and offline, including misinformation, disinformation, and cyber fraud. Drawing on 35 in-depth interviews with older adults aged 50+ in urban Beijing, this exploratory study examines how older users encounter, interpret, and respond to deceptive content in everyday digital practices. Instead of relying solely on individual cognitive skills, participants described resilience as emerging through interconnected multiple layers of support, including family consultation, peer discussion, platform-level safeguards, and institutional assistance. The analysis identifies a recurring tension within trusted social networks: While relational expectations and norms of reciprocity may encourage information sharing, they may also discourage correction, creating what this study conceptualizes as a &lt;em&gt;human sentiment barrier&lt;/em&gt;. This concept builds on sociological research on the downsides of strong-tie social capital, illustrating how the same relationships that provide emotional support can also facilitate the circulation of misleading information. By illustrating how older adults’ evaluations of digital content are shaped by relational, cultural, and institutional contexts, this study reframes digital resilience as a socially embedded practice rather than an individual skill. Findings highlight the need for interventions that strengthen the social and infrastructural environments through which older adults make sense of online information.",

Based on 45 peer-reviewed articles published between 2010 and 2025, it maps the research landscape across journals, crisis types, and groups, and analyzes how resilience is theorized and enacted through communication. The findings show that while resilience is widely invoked, it is often framed narrowly as coping or adaptation. At the same time, the review identifies recurring communicative practices, including the reestablishment of normalcy, affirmation of identity, mobilization of networks, development of counter-narratives, and legitimization of emotion, that reveal resilience as a relational and discursive process shaped by inequality. Yet structural power dynamics, intersectional vulnerabilities, and community-led practices remain under-studied. The study contributes to the field by consolidating fragmented research, extending the communication theory of resilience (CTR) through critical perspectives, and outlining directions for future inquiry. By centering marginalized voices, it advances a more inclusive and equity-oriented agenda for crisis communication.",

Exploring the accessibility and challenges associated with mobile esports labor practices offers a critical look at Indonesia's informal economy today. This economy operates at the intersection of mobile networked creativity and “playbour\"—the blend of play and work—in a fragile employment environment. The article introduces the concept of mobile playbour to analyze specific practices in Indonesia, emphasizing the creative, social, and emotional labor of players that drives the monetization of esports. It ultimately highlights digital and community-building opportunities, the structural instability of mobile game labor, and its broader implications for creativity and monetization in mobile media and game studies.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces “data mirroring,” a methodological framework for conducting data-donation-based interviews using Data Download Packages (DDPs) from digital platforms. Since the General Data Protection Regulation took effect, DDPs have found application in research. While the literature on the value of DDPs primarily points toward scaling and validating aggregate-level data, their potential to illuminate complex user–media relationships within datafied environments at the micro-level appears underexplored. Drawing from recent conceptualizations of the “data mirror,” which captures the feedback loops between users and digital media, this article provides theoretical grounding and practical guidelines for “mirroring” DDPs to users. Based on exercises with 64 participants, we articulate through an illustrative case study how DDPs can serve as prompts, contexts, and reflections, revealing reflexive strategies users employ to curate information flows on algorithmic platforms like Instagram. In addition, we introduce an open-source web application to operationalize DDPs as data mirrors for non-technical researchers.",

Experimentation is widespread (88%), yet workflow integration remains uneven. Adoption is strongest among younger professionals, and sectoral differences are detected: marketing reports higher adoption, whereas journalists and educators report the lowest usage. ChatGPT dominates (77%), followed by Canva (38%), and DALL·E and MidJourney (27%). Frequency of use lag behind positive attitudes. National patterns also diverge, reflecting cultural, regulatory, and market factors. Results draw on SCOT, Rogers’ diffusion, and Bozdag’s AImosis to frame sociotechnical adoption of AI as a negotiation.

By revealing Douyin’s affective affordances to produce queer counterpublics through censorship, we propose a framework that explains how queer counterpublics navigate user–state tensions and balance affect with strategy in a dynamic discursive space. Based on our large-scale Douyin video dataset, we analyze 102,031 videos from 90,901 accounts by combining computational and qualitative methods. By employing computer vision and content analysis, we uncover the multimodal features and strategies calling for justice in those videos. We also show how non-influencers, influencers, and official accounts adopt distinct strategies and how these strategies are associated with user engagement. Further multimodal discourse analysis examines three key counter discourses, including maximum visibility, limited anger, and infinite hope. This study contributes to the understanding of queer counterpublics in China and the potential of short video platforms like Douyin to foster social change.",

Drawing on a hybrid methodological approach that combines computational analysis of tweet corpora with interpretive readings, the research examines how histories of racial violence circulate within the algorithmically mediated space. While lynching remains a central symbol of anti-Black terror in the United States, its meaning in public discourse has become increasingly unstable. On Twitter, lynching is deployed as a historical referent, a metaphor, political claim, and rhetorical provocation, thereby surfacing in divergent frames. We theorize this instability as frictional memory: a dynamic of circulation under constraint, operating through temporal traction (mnemonic pivots that attach past to present), semantic abrasion (collisions that produce drift, contestation, and repair), and visibility routing (platform-mediated asymmetries of attention). This framework shows how histories of racial violence are not simply recalled online but continually reconfigured in digital architectures.",

The sites for the mapping are X/Twitter and LinkedIn, where users frantically post not only about Altman but also about all manner of AI promises and pitfalls. By employing techniques from controversy mapping and digital research methods, we locate contemporary AI imaginaries, assess their salience in a cross-platform perspective, and describe the stakes gleaned from the prominence of certain dominant imaginaries, such as longtermism, regulatory ambivalence, and techno-hagiography. We discuss the issues these imaginaries raise and the AI industry’s premediation and preclusion of them: the manners by which the AI industry strives to occupy the future and absorb the present.",

          "abstract": "During the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires and amid uncertainty over a TikTok ban, Xiaohongshu (RedNote) unexpectedly emerged as a site of transnational environmental discussion. This study examines how transnational conversations unfolded and their implications for community empowerment and environmental justice during a crisis. Drawing on qualitative content analysis and social network analysis of 505 wildfire-related posts, we find that user engagement centered on participatory practices (44.45%), including reporting and the circulation of practical information. Another substantial share of posts focused on building social ties through emotional support (16.33%), while critically questioning the causes of the fires (11.02%). Social network analysis further shows that grassroots users occupied central positions in the discourse. Together, these findings suggest that Xiaohongshu enabled communicative agency and empathetic transfer across borders, facilitating emergent forms of collective resilience. However, such potentials remain contingent, as algorithmic visibility and geopolitical conditions unevenly shape participation and recognition in digital spaces.",

Drawing on an online survey representative of the adult Danish population ( N = 1,518), the study distinguishes between users of left-wing and right-wing alternative media and reveals a remarkable difference: The former only have lower trust in (purportedly) right-leaning mainstream media whereas the latter have lower trust in mainstream media regardless of their ideological leanings, indicating more all-encompassing lower trust. While the users have relatively lower news trust than the rest of the population, their trust is still fairly high in absolute terms. I conclude with a discussion of potential explanations for the left/right difference and of the democratic implications of the findings in and beyond the Danish media context.",

I make this point by building on my experiences of studying science communication projects and by reflecting on their internal heterogeneity in terms of what they were ‘about’ for those organising them. By showing this diversity in the meanings of science communication to those carrying it out, and in particular how this is exacerbated by the conditions of precarity and scarcity that frequently frame science communication activities, I argue for the importance of understanding science communication practice as not only being ‘about’ the communication or negotiation of scientific knowledge, but myriad other aspects, from personal prestige to the need for a job.",

          "abstract": "This study explores how scientists’ experiences during the pandemic influenced their trust in journalism and their willingness to engage with the media. The study employed a survey approach, collecting data from 4089 scientists affiliated with German universities and research institutions. Trust in journalism was measured across five dimensions: appropriate topic selection, accurate representation, proper fact selection, fair assessment, and desirable impact. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between dissatisfaction with pandemic-era media coverage, trust in journalism, and scientists’ willingness to engage in science communication. Results show that scientists’ trust in news media is generally limited and varies across media types. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated distrust, particularly in media outlets expected to maintain high standards, such as national newspapers and public broadcasters. Trust in journalism proved central in mediating dissatisfaction and engagement, highlighting that distrust may reduce scientists’ media involvement and, in turn, weaken public trust in science.",

          "abstract": "As a pervasive social phenomenon, climate change skepticism has been extensively studied in Western contexts, where it is deeply intertwined with local sociopolitical structures. In China, despite the government’s firm commitment to mitigation, a growing trend of public skepticism has emerged online. Using a corpus-assisted critical discourse analysis of 2426 climate skeptical posts on Zhihu , China’s largest knowledge-sharing platform, this study examined how Chinese skeptics construct their discourse. Our findings revealed that Chinese climate skeptics do not merely reject scientific evidence; instead, they frame their arguments through a synthesis of national identity, geopolitical conflicts, and cultural-historical narratives, invoking climate justice claims at both domestic and international levels. Building on these insights, our research proposed a “scientific–political framework” that distinguishes four subtypes of Chinese climate skepticism: “Geopolitical Construct,” “Western Conspiracy,” “Natural Variability,” and “Indifferent Fatalism.” By shedding light on the context-specific configurations of skepticism discourse, this study contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of climate skepticism in non-Western contexts, while also prompting critical reflection on China’s long-standing over-politicized model of climate change communication.",

An experimental survey manipulating threat (high/low) and efficacy (high/low) on 419 municipal water users in Wisconsin found that intentions to reduce PFAS exposure were higher in high-efficacy than low-efficacy messages, especially among those in later stages of change. Perceived importance was higher in the high health-threat condition than in the low-threat condition.

          "abstract": "Digital platforms have facilitated body-positive discourses that challenge appearance norms, yet these often intertwine with postfeminist elements, creating paradoxes that both resist and reinforce hegemonic ideals. By deploying computationally assisted critical thematic analysis across 1915 #RejectBodyAnxiety posts on RedNote, this study reveals both the breadth —the full variety of user-generated discursive elements and their articulation patterns—and the depth —the discursive meanings configured through these articulations, of this feminist digital activism site. The findings show that body-positivity discourses under #RejectBodyAnxiety are profoundly reconfigured through their articulation with localized postfeminist formations and platform-mediated empowering mechanisms, reframing body positivity as ideal positivity —a postfeminist discourse that refines hegemonic beauty ideals by shedding their extreme traits ( Selective Subversion ) and making them appear attainable ( Tactical Conformity ), thereby transforming them into seemingly positive forms. While fostering empowerment, this discourse risks new exclusions, marginalizing some women and intensifying postfeminist contradictions. Tracing these sensibilities through social media, the study highlights their new forms in non-Western contexts and underscores the need to address emerging discourses in body image promotion.",

We find that “Gendered Insults” exhibits the highest betweenness centrality, acting as a structural bridge connecting disparate frustrations. Women-targeting topics are both speakable and resonant within the community, anchored by a self-deprecating “sewer mouse” masculinity that navigates opportunity structures. Interviews reveal that when political opportunity structures remain closed while discursive and mediated (legacy platform) opportunities stay relatively accessible, misogyny becomes a functional language for channeling widespread socioeconomic anxieties. We conclude that in this context, misogyny operates not as a starting point for radicalization but as a core organizing principle for the socially disillusioned. This suggests that divergent structural conditions produce different mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Beuckels Emma",
          "abstract": "This article critically investigates the institutional dynamics that shape influencer sharenting, employing a constructivist framework and the concept of institutional work. Based on in-depth interviews with key industry stakeholders, the study demonstrates how children’s visibility within influencer marketing is strategically cultivated through the interdependent operation of economic, professional, and normative structures. The article introduces the concept of institutionalized sharenting to describe the processes through which sharenting becomes routinized and legitimized, enabling industry actors to capitalize on children’s presence while displacing full responsibility onto parents. This deflection is enacted through a variety of practices, such as the inclusion of children via strategic collaborations with their parents, and is framed through discourses of authenticity, intensive parenting, and personal choice. Ultimately, the paper argues that the marginalization of children, despite their centrality to the industry’s profitability, is sustained by adultist and neoliberal logics that frame children’s labour as play and familial monetization as empowerment.",

          "authors": "M. Luke Smith, Guangqing Chi, Junjun Yin, Yosef Bodovski, S. Shyam Sundar",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been characterized by political partisan differences and opinions that influenced individual behavior and political policies, correlating with varying outcomes. Measuring these differences in opinion using traditional methods, such as opinion polls, can be costly and provides only a snapshot of sentiment at a given time. Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) may offer a real-time tool for assessing opinions to explore the relationship between differing viewpoints about the pandemic and how these differences impact the occurrence and severity of disease burden. Utilizing an open-source data set of 1.75 million keyword-selected X (Twitter) posts, updated weekly from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, along with publicly available COVID-19 case and death counts and county-level data on election outcomes from the 2020 election, we analyzed how the volume of tweets on the X (Twitter) platform related to COVID-19 has changed over time and how patterns of use vary across the partisan divide. We discovered that Democratic-leaning counties exhibited higher X (Twitter) volume associated with COVID-19 topics compared to Republican-leaning counties in response to changes in case or death rates. In addition, we found a higher proportion of tweets in urban counties compared to rural ones.",

          "authors": "Luca Manucci, Hugo Marcos-Marne, Yani Kartalis",
          "abstract": "The rising electoral support for far-right parties has sparked vibrant debates about the sociopolitical dynamics driving this phenomenon. This paper investigates a crucial yet underexplored dimension: the interplay between media consumption, authoritarian nostalgia, and far-right voting behaviour. Focusing on Spain and Portugal – two countries with distinct yet comparable histories of authoritarian rule – survey data analyses suggest that readers of ABC in Spain and Correio da Manhã (CdM) in Portugal may develop higher levels of authoritarian nostalgia, which in turn correlates with a higher probability to support VOX and Chega, respectively. A content analysis conducted on these newspapers indicates that this pattern may be driven more by the tone adopted by the tabloid (CdM) and conservative ( ABC ) newspapers when discussing the authoritarian past rather than by higher levels of authoritarian nostalgia compared to other newspapers. This study contributes to political communication research by highlighting a mechanism through which media narratives shape historical perceptions and electoral choices.",

          "abstract": "This study represents an initial effort to integrate Visual Grammar analysis of book covers with an eye-tracking study of 65 Chinese viewers’ perceptions of 10 covers. While Visual Grammar usefully systematizes meaning-making resources in multimodal texts, there remains a lack of empirical evidence to support the accuracy of semiotic analysis in predicting reader responses. Drawing on eye-tracking and supplementary questionnaire data, this study tests the predictive capabilities of nine semiotic predictors, based on the two compositional systems of position and salience, for viewers’ visual processing and perceptions of book covers which combine several semiotic modes to inform and engage potential buyers. It reveals that font style and a centre-margin processing sequence are the most reliable predictors, followed by a top–bottom sequence. However, no dominant left–right or right–left sequence emerges on covers featuring vertical orthography. Furthermore, the accuracy of these predictions is moderated by the hierarchies created by position and salience, and readers’ top-down assessments. These findings reflect a complex interplay between bottom-up (compositional variables) and top-down factors (goal and attraction) in guiding readers, highlighting the need to complement semiotic analysis with more reception and experimental studies in visual communication.",
