          "authors": "Aaron Hyzen, Hilde Van den Bulck, Manuel Puppis, Michelle Kulig, Steve Paulussen",
          "abstract": "Working with the concept of epistemic welfare, defined as creating and maintaining the conditions and capabilities for individuals’ epistemic agency in the public sphere, this contribution provides a theoretical framework to demonstrate a way out of what has been described as an epistemic crisis, illustrating this with the case of algorithmic recommender systems used by media organizations. First, we identify the processes of datafication, algorithmization and platformization and their impact on the public sphere, specifically how they disrupt knowledge production, dissemination and acquisition. Next, we combine social epistemology, welfare studies and communication research to build a framework that allows analyzing how well communicative social practices, procedures and institutions fulfill epistemic standards and, thus, contribute to individuals’ opportunities to exercise their epistemic agency and reach epistemically valuable states. Finally, we discuss epistemic welfare’s implications for media governance, i.e., building conditions and capabilities that ensure epistemic agency.",

          "authors": "Yeorang Bak",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the Mediation–Extension Schema (MES) as a theoretical framework for analyzing the ontological status of artificial intelligence as media. Drawing on philosophical media theory, it argues that AI should not be understood merely as a tool but as a system that actively shapes the conditions under which meaning, communication, and subjectivity emerge. MES integrates two conceptual lineages: mediation, from Aristotle’s metaxu , and extension, from Heidegger’s techne . Mediation refers to AI’s role in connecting otherwise isolated entities, while extension captures its capacity to reconfigure experiential and social structures. Through a concrete case of AI deployment, the paper demonstrates that such media operate as techno-social assemblages that transform human existence by mediating relations and extending the field of action. MES thereby offers a unified conceptual model for understanding how AI intervenes in the formation of being, knowledge, and power, contributing to ongoing debates in media philosophy, digital ontology, and the ethics of technology.",

          "abstract": "Users and regulators alike recognise the need for public consultation around new developments in artificial intelligence (AI). However, most consultations reflect economic or political concerns and tend to focus on Generative AI (GenAI) impacts on the traditional workforce, excluding gig economy workers in general and content creators in particular. In this two-stage study, we firstly report qualitative findings from a survey of 100 content creators, using these to design a quantitative survey issued to 307 content creators. In our thematic analysis of the qualitative data, we report a nuanced response to GenAI tools. Participants recognised that they might help to reduce an unmanageable workload, but that they might also render them redundant in certain contexts. Our content creators spoke meaningfully about different forms of loss, not just of jobs or of creativity, but also of the passion and the dedication to learning that provided much of the intrinsic motivation for creation. Quantitative survey findings showed that those who’d had greater experience of AI felt less threatened by the technology, but that concerns remained about fairness, data privacy and a rise in targeted advertising. Overall, we found that more diverse experiences need to be represented and considered in the public consultations informing the development and regulation of GenAI.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the affective shift from horror to humour in Little Nightmares when transitioning from gameplay to stream viewing. Employing microethology, a methodology suitable for analysing shorter gaming experiences, this study scrutinises avatar death scenes as moments of affective transformation. It introduces the concept of ‘empathetic horror’, defined as the fear, distress, and nervousness that arises from players’ deep empathetic bond with their avatar through embodied and affective involvement in a game. Conceptualising the moment of death as an assemblage, this study examines how watching Danmaku game streams on Bilibili reframes this fear-inducing moment as humorous. It identifies three factors responsible for this transformation: a change in ludic engagement and the player’s perspective, altered meanings of critical actors within the assemblage (including monsters and death), and the introduction of new participants (such as Danmaku game streams) into the networked assemblage. This analysis underscores the role of Danmaku streams in creating a humorous environment, strengthening entertaining effects, and foregrounding the performative dimensions of play, providing insights into the evolving affective responses across gaming and streaming contexts.",

Its methodology engages with PRISMA workflow, incorporating computational and qualitative analytic methods. Our findings reveal that while most digital tools share common placemaking goals, each (semi-)immersive technology excels in specific areas. AR Location-Based tools work best in encouraging active explorations of the urban spaces, while VR aces in facilitating real-time interactive co-design simulations and MR can bring virtual and on-site participants together in one platform. We also highlight the growing popularity of (semi-)immersive games, serious games and gamification in digital placemaking and explore their varying capacities. These findings contribute to an interdisciplinary approach that advances understanding of (semi-)immersive digital tool developments and informs better placemaking strategies and policies.",

          "authors": "Anqi Huang",
          "abstract": "The term ‘coffee map’ refers to the digital mapping of coffee houses within urban environments, collaboratively produced and circulated on digital platforms. Drawing the concept of the right to the city and recent theories in geomedia studies, this article critically examines how coffee maps mediate spatial power dynamics, visibility, and entrepreneurial subjectivity among independent coffee houses in urban China. Based on fieldwork conducted in Guangzhou, it argues that independent coffee businesses occupy a liminal position shaped simultaneously by opportunities for urban autonomy and constraints from algorithmic visibility regimes imposed by digital infrastructures such as Dianping, Meituan and Xiaohongshu. On one hand, geomedia affordances enable these businesses to craft their own urban narratives and assert agency in reshaping residential neighborhoods, exemplifying a grassroots form of gentrification. On the other hand, these platforms also impose significant constraints through data-driven governance, competitive rankings, and rapidly shifting policies, contributing to a condition of precarity and digital resignation. This dual role positions independent coffee houses in a constant negotiation of spatial agency, platform dependence, and structural marginalization. Under such context, rather than escaping digital constraints, it is also found that independent coffee houses strategically engage in recursive narratives of instability and performative liminality to remain relevant. Thus, the coffee map, as both a representation and an instrument of spatial governance, reveals the complex interplay between entrepreneurial aspirations, neoliberal urbanization, and platform-mediated urban participation, highlighting critical implications for contemporary understandings of geomedia and the right to the city.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores video game documentaries as a method for researching online gaming communities. We begin by framing documentary filmmaking as a practice-based approach, a creative form of video ethnography, with the film serving as the focal output. Our analysis draws on a close reading of four recent video game documentaries that highlight European voices, alongside insights from our own fieldwork. We focus on the affordances of this approach in capturing embodied, affective, and performative aspects of play that text-based ethnography may struggle to convey. The selected films also offer different stances on the agency of both participant-protagonists and researcher-director. In light of these observations, we propose a multimodal research output in which the documentary film takes center stage.",

Accordingly, deliberate changes of a news aggregators’ choice architecture may nudge engagement. Against this background, our study aims to test the effects of 2 nudges, namely a position and an accessibility nudge, on (a) the selection of, (b) the engagement with, and (c) learning from environmental news articles by means of a 7-day field experiment using a news aggregator app in the United Kingdom. Results suggest that prominent article positioning coupled with visual highlighting significantly increases the selection of environmental news, its reading time and recall of information. In contrast, automated rewriting of environmental articles for lower text complexity had no significant effects. Additional analyses indicate that neither nudge backfired by decreasing user satisfaction, thus suggesting the practical usability of our approach.",

This study explores the self-uncertainty experienced by these mothers and investigates its connection to their identification with online maternal groups and adherence to group norms. Using national survey data from 639 South Korean mothers, this study, guided by Uncertainty-Identity Theory (UIT) and the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation (SIDE), sheds light on how these mothers often internalize intense group norms. Findings underscore the importance of considering mothers as members of a distinct social group (vs. individuals), enriching our understanding of motherhood dynamics. Both UIT and SIDE effectively explain these complex phenomena.",

          "authors": "Julian Pimienta",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Manga – Japanese comics – is a central pillar of Japanese culture and an expanding global phenomenon, yet little research has examined how individuals form and maintain meaningful connections with this medium. While previous studies conceptualized manga attachment as a multidimensional construct, no validated measures exist. This study refines and validates an existing set of manga attachment items, and introduces the Manga Attachment Scale (MAS), a psychometric tool assessing emotional, cognitive, and behavioral engagement with manga. Across three independent studies, the MAS was tested for factor structure, reliability, and validity. Study 1 ( N = 328) used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to refine the original item set, resulting in a 14-item, four-factor structure: Safe Haven, Separation Distress, Secure Base, and Proximity Maintenance. Study 2 ( N = 588) confirmed this structure via Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), demonstrating strong model fit. Study 3 ( N = 511) evaluated predictive, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity, showing significant relationships between the MAS, reading frequency, and manga’s perceived importance, while distinguishing it from other manga engagement measures. The MAS provides a validated framework for assessing manga attachment, contributing to media attachment research and extending Attachment Theory. This tool facilitates future investigations into manga’s role in well-being, identity formation, and media engagement.",

          "abstract": "Having a pregnancy end without a live baby can result in mixed effects to the relationship with one’s living children, but this has mostly been examined in the first years after the loss. Research is needed to understand the implications for relationships in later life. Thus, the current study examined whether losing a pregnancy was associated with the relationship with one’s adult children. The study used data from the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). It examined a sample of women aged 50+ who experienced stillbirth over their life and a comparison sample of women who didn’t experience stillbirth. Regression models were used to assess the association between experiencing stillbirth and the parent–child relationship. The results showed that women who lost a pregnancy reported more emotionally close relationships with their adult children. These results indicated that losing a pregnancy could have long-term implications on the relationship with one’s children in later life. These women might have been more likely to invest in the emotional bonds with their children.",

          "abstract": "Political orientation is related to many aspects of our lives. Here, we investigate how political orientation relates to how women from different parts of the world picture their ideal partner. Using data from the Ideal Partner Survey , we analyzed relationships between political orientation and long-term partner preferences in a sample of 13,257 heterosexual, single women from 144 countries. Replicating previous work, political orientation was related to a preference for political similarity, such that women holding more extreme political views showed the strongest preferences for political similarity. In addition, women leaning more to the right side of the political spectrum held higher preferences for ethnic and religious similarity. Partly consistent with the possibility that political orientation relates to women’s attraction towards men conforming to a masculine, male breadwinner stereotype, more right-leaning views were not only linked to preferring a financially secure and successful partner, but also to ascribing more importance to a partner´s height. No or only negligible relationships with political orientation were found for partner´s kindness-supportiveness and level of height. For all other preferences, results were less conclusive. In sum, results indicate that who women want as a romantic partner is partly related to their political orientation.",

          "abstract": "Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have begun to influence almost all aspects of life, including romantic relationships. Despite many companies and other entities now utilizing AI technology to produce products and media that may influence romantic relationship engagement and behavior, few studies to date have attempted to document or describe the ways that individuals engage with multiple AI technologies for romantic or sexual purposes in large national samples. Using a large quota national sample taken from the United States of 2,969 adults, in this exploratory study we sought to examine engagement with AI technologies, specifically the use of image generation of men and women on social media, chat technologies meant to simulate romantic or sexual partners, and AI generated pornography. Results suggested that engagement with AI technologies is relatively high, especially among young adults in their 20’s, suggesting that these emerging technologies represent an element of modern sexual behavior and romantic relationships that warrant further attention. A sizable minority of young adults reported using AI technologies romantically or sexually, including almost one in four young adults engaging with AI chat technologies to replicate romantic interactions. Regression results suggested that various demographic factors predict engagement with AI technologies and that AI technology use was associated with negative individual well-being. These initial descriptive results suggest the need for further research on this emerging behavioral phenomenon as an important component of modern romantic and sexual interactions.",

          "abstract": "Despite its negative reputation, gossip is a common conversational behavior that can benefit relationships. However, its potential advantages have not been explored in romantic partnerships. Using a naturalistic observation method (the Electronically Activated Recorder; EAR) we assessed how frequently 76 same- and different-gender couples gossiped with each other, and whether this frequency was associated with self-reported happiness and relationship quality. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models revealed preliminary evidence that romantic partner gossip was positively associated with both happiness and relationship quality. This association held for both same- and different-gender couples. Given that romantic partners are primary sources of conversation and emotional exchanges for many adults, gossip may play a particularly important role in strengthening these bonds. Future research should replicate this finding and explore potential causal mechanisms and specific gossip characteristics that drive these associations, as gossip may be a fruitful avenue to test as a communication strategy for improving well-being in romantic partnerships.",

          "authors": "Kriti Gupta, Arti Singh, Tanya Choudhary",
          "abstract": "Over the past decades, singlehood has become prevalent globally. In India, the same trend has been observed in recent years. Many singles are delaying marriage or choosing never to get married even though marriage is considered important in Indian society. This article explores how singlehood is experienced among Indian singles aged 30 years and older ( N = 153) and their quality of life. Using a mixed-method approach, it was found that a difference exists in the quality of life of the participants based on their gender and living arrangements. Thematic analysis revealed that our participants opt to remain unmarried due to a range of personal and cultural factors. The advantages of staying single include a sense of freedom to explore one’s interests and reduced emotional and financial responsibilities. However, there are notable disadvantages of remaining single for our participants, such as a Lack of intimacy, Apprehension related to health and financial security, Safety issues, and Perceived discrimination in the workplace. We suggest that the findings of this study can be used as a foundation for designing psychological interventions that address the needs of single adults in traditional social contexts.",

          "authors": "Mónica Guzmán-González, Fabiola Gómez, Lusmenia Garrido-Rojas, Diana Rivera-Ottenberger, Rodrigo A. Cárcamo, Joaquín Bahamondes, Ana María Fernández",
          "abstract": "Despite previous studies documenting the existence of distinct attachment models that provide complementary information, there is a gap in research examining empirically attachment profiles that integrate both global attachment and attachment in specific domains from a person-centered approach. Based in the hierarchical structure of attachment representations, the present study evaluated the existence of different attachment profiles, using continuous scores of attachment anxiety and avoidance, in both global and romantic domains among 1,925 Chilean emerging adults. Additionally, and to assess the validity of these profiles, we investigated their association with mental health symptoms and relationship satisfaction. Through latent profile analysis (LPA), we identified five attachment profiles: and overall secure profile marked by security across both domains, one by insecurity across both domains (overall insecure), two profiles with elevated attachment anxiety (particularly in romantic domain) combined with moderate global avoidance, and a profile marked by high global attachment avoidance, and moderate romantic avoidance. The identified profiles were meaningfully associated with mental health symptoms and relationship satisfaction, supporting their validity. These results underscore the heterogeneity of internal working models in emerging adults, demonstrating that domain-specific divergence is common. They also highlight the added value of examining both global and romantic attachment to more fully capture the diversity of attachment experiences and relational functioning in this population. A pesar de que estudios previos han documentado la existencia de distintos modelos de apego que ofrecen información complementaria, existe una brecha en la investigación que examine empíricamente perfiles de apego que integren tanto el apego global como el apego en dominios específicos desde un enfoque centrado en la persona. Basándose en la estructura jerárquica de las representaciones de apego, el presente estudio evaluó la existencia de diferentes perfiles de apego, utilizando puntuaciones continuas de ansiedad y evitación en el apego, tanto en los dominios global como romántico, en una muestra de 1.925 adultos emergentes chilenos. Además, y con el fin de evaluar la validez de estos perfiles, investigamos su asociación con síntomas de salud mental y satisfacción en la relación de pareja. A través de un análisis de perfiles latentes (LPA, por sus siglas en inglés), identificamos cinco perfiles de apego: un perfil globalmente seguro caracterizado por seguridad en ambos dominios; uno por inseguridad en ambos dominios (globalmente inseguro); dos perfiles con ansiedad elevada en el apego (particularmente en el dominio romántico) combinada con evitación global moderada; y un perfil caracterizado por alta evitación global en el apego y evitación romántica moderada. Los perfiles identificados se asociaron de manera significativa con síntomas de salud mental y satisfacción en la relación, respaldando su validez. Estos resultados subrayan la heterogeneidad de los modelos operativos internos en adultos emergentes, demostrando que la divergencia específica por dominio es común. Asimismo, destacan el valor añadido de examinar tanto el apego global como el romántico para captar más plenamente la diversidad de experiencias de apego y el funcionamiento relacional en esta población.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization is driving disconnection and animosity between opponents in the United States. We propose perceiving opponents as self-disclosing helps foster connection and reduce animosity. Building on research demonstrating that self-disclosure fosters interpersonal relationships, we test whether vignettes expressing political views that seem self-disclosing increase connection, respect, and willingness to interact among opponents. Across six studies, we demonstrate self-disclosure reduces partisan animosity by building connection between political opponents. Previous work shows that vignettes about opponents’ personal experiences bridge divides better than fact-based vignettes. The results from the current research suggest this is because experiences are especially self-disclosing. Leveraging this, we find that many statements partisans share can improve connection and reduce animosity when they are perceived as self-disclosing. We test this through manipulating the self-disclosure of statements in experiments and by teaching people how to make their statements more self-disclosing. Results indicate self-disclosure is consistently effective for liberal and moderate partisans but in many cases are also effective for conservatives. By highlighting the power of self-disclosure, our findings offer a promising path toward bridging partisan divides.",

A community sample of 184 adolescents (85 boys, 99 girls; 58% white, 29% Black, 13% other identity groups) participated annually from age 13 to 18. Through these six waves of data collection, participants completed a total of 859 support-seeking interactions, from which 10 thematic codes were identified. Support-seeking about socially oriented topics (e.g., conflicts with peers, romantic interests) appeared consistently across adolescence, while participants increasingly discussed future-oriented topics (e.g., considering college or work plans) with their friends as they aged. Selection of socially oriented topics was more common among female dyads and was associated with higher friendship quality, self-disclosure, and emotional support in conversations between adolescent close friends.",

          "abstract": "Connections with caregivers and friends undergo significant changes during adolescence, which are crucial for the formation of psychosocial identity and overall well-being. This study examines the importance of social connectedness among Peruvian adolescents, emphasizing the need to consider both the quantity and quality of these relationships. Social connectedness was explored among 32 adolescents, between 15 and 17 years of age, who were participants in the project “Being an adolescent in Peru”. This was done through in-depth interviews, taking into account factors such as region, academic performance and gender. The results were presented in two themes: expectations and evaluations of relationships in adolescents. This for each of the domains: family and friends. Moreover, while adolescents value their relationships with caregivers, the COVID-19 pandemic increased physical proximity but diminished the quality of these bonds. With respect to peer relationships, the pandemic limited interactions to a virtual, superficial, and infrequent level. The return to in-person interactions was positively perceived, particularly in relation to friends relationships, emphasizing the importance of interaction quality. These findings highlight the complexity of relationships in times of crisis and underscore the need to differentiate between the quantity and quality of interactions to promote healthy development and well-being.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the relation between news consumption and fostering public deliberation within democratic systems. Drawing on Jürgen Habermas’s concepts of understanding orientation (consensus-oriented, communicative rationality) and strategic orientation (goal-oriented, instrumental rationality), it explores how news media can either facilitate rational communication in public debates or, alternatively, encourage strategic interventions. To investigate these relationships, this study utilizes a survey in Chile (&lt;em&gt;N = &lt;/em&gt;903) conducted under the supervision of the Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Politics, Public Opinion, and Media (Nucleo MEPOP) between August and September 2022. The findings reveal that traditional media and social media are significantly and positively associated with a strategic orientation, whereas exposure to digital media is negatively associated with such an orientation. Additionally, incidental exposure emerges as a key factor in shaping the relationship between media consumption and deliberative predispositions. This article contributes to the understanding of classical approaches to the study of deliberation in the digital contemporary context, where homophily, polarization, and confrontation have emerged as significant challenges for both developing and established democracies.",

          "authors": "Marta Mitrović, Marija Vujović, Ivana Stamenković",
          "abstract": "The media plays a vital role in shaping public opinion about the European Union (EU), but a lack of effective communication and cooperation between the EU and the media results in inadequate coverage, fueling distrust and skepticism among citizens. In Serbia, which is a candidate for EU membership, there is an increasing trend of distrust towards EU institutions. According to the research conducted by the Ministry of European Integration in 2022, less than half of Serbian citizens would support joining the EU in a referendum. The media is expected to play a key role in clarifying topics that are unfamiliar to the public, such as European integration and the functioning of EU institutions in general. However, earlier studies on media portrayal of EU institutions in Serbia reveal a predominantly factual approach, with limited in-depth analysis, an elite-focused depiction of Europeanization, and frequent reliance on national officials as sources, with minimal inclusion of EU representatives or experts. Building on the findings of earlier research conducted in Serbia, this study seeks to answer the research question: “How did online media portals in Serbia report on the 2024 European Parliament elections?”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;This exclusive focus on online media aims to provide insights into the digital news landscape and its role in shaping public discourse around the elections&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The analysis focuses on the key topics highlighted, the main actors featured, and the tone of the discourse. A textual analysis was carried out on 1,044 articles published across 44 Serbian media portals between June 1 and June 14, 2024, covering the period immediately before and after the European Parliament elections.",

          "authors": "Kata Horváth, Gábor Polyák, Ágnes Urbán",
          "abstract": "During the 2024 European Parliament and municipal election campaigns, the ruling Hungarian party, Fidesz, significantly increased its use of populist rhetoric and disinformation techniques through a pro-government political influencer network known as the Megafon Központ (Megafon Center). This study explores the role of this organization in disseminating hostile and manipulative narratives on social media, with a particular focus on how these narratives influence voter decisions and reinforce social polarization in the context of the European Parliament elections. The research employed qualitative content analysis to examine the 105 Megafon videos with the highest advertising costs during the campaign period, identifying the target audience, key messages, as well as the linguistic and visual tools employed. The results show that most videos rely on demonization and fearmongering, often presenting distorted information. Conducted focus group studies revealed that perceptions of Megafon content are highly polarized along political lines. Based on representative public opinion polls, Megafon influencers and the brand itself are not widely recognized by the general public, but they do have visibility among certain social groups. Meanwhile, nearly all Facebook users encounter their content. Additionally, most voters are unaware that this content is paid political advertising. Although respondents often question the credibility of Megafon videos, their persistent presence contributes to social polarization and influences political discourse. The Megafon model is easily adaptable and poses a significant risk to democratic public discourse, as it effectively distorts the information environment for voters on social media.",

          "abstract": "An established body of research demonstrates that political talk shapes political participation. However, less is known about how an individual’s ease of listening interacts with conversational contexts to influence participation. This study hypothesizes that this listening disposition amplifies the effect of political talk on political participation. Using data from a 2024 US national survey (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 800), we test this using OLS regression on a composite index of political participation. The model assesses how the frequency of political talk across four contexts (strong/weak ties network, and like-minded/different-minded people) is moderated by self-reported ease of listening (to like- and different-minded people). Results show that while talking and listening to like-minded people is positively associated with participation, the main effect for talking and listening to different-minded people is not significant. However, a significant interaction emerges: The positive effect of talking with different-minded people on participation is amplified by the ease of listening to those same views. This effect is confined to cross-cutting conversations; no comparable interactions were found in strong-tie, weak-tie, or like-minded contexts. These findings indicate that the civic benefit of listening is highly contextual, with the ease of listening to differing views unlocking the participatory potential of talk during cross-cutting discussion.",

          "authors": "Dario Siegen, Daniel Vogler",
          "abstract": "Despite broad scientific support, vaccination is traditionally a contested issue among the public. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the issue of vaccination received widespread attention in news media and on social media. Although we know that public debates on such disputed issues evolve over time in hybrid media systems, there is still little knowledge about the extent to which news media and social media align or differ in their issue attention dynamics and semantics. Furthermore, empirical studies, particularly on social media data, tend to focus on periods of high issue attention, often missing relevant reference points before or after such phases. Focusing on the issue of vaccination in Switzerland, we examine 77,798 news articles by 20 Swiss online newspapers and 929,431 posts by 22,672 Swiss Twitter (now X) users to investigate the similarities and differences between the two spheres through a time series analysis between April 1, 2019, and June 30, 2022. The findings show how vaccination gained vastly in issue attention—measured as the share of total coverage and tweet volume, respectively—during the Covid-19 pandemic. Twitter and news media were closely aligned during the crisis in terms of issue attention and semantics, but less so before and after the pandemic. These findings substantiate previous works on issue agendas in hybrid media systems that converge toward a dominant issue in times of crisis.",

          "abstract": "The 2024 European Parliament elections took place against a backdrop of overlapping crises, including climate change, migration, and the Russian war against Ukraine, all of which have the potential to drive political polarization. These wedge issues can be strategically used in campaign communication to activate strong emotional and moral responses, exploit societal divisions, and fracture opposing coalitions. When combined with populist communication and illiberal rhetoric, they align closely with the attention dynamics of social media but also carry potential dangers for democratic discourse. However, research on how these elements are combined in parties’ campaign communication remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive manual quantitative content analysis of 8,748 Facebook posts from parties in 13 EU member states, examining how wedge issues were communicated and combined with populism and illiberalism during the 2024 European Parliament elections. Our analyses reveal that populist parties relied more heavily on wedge issues and combined them with populist communication and illiberal rhetoric more often than non-populist parties. Certain wedge issues appeared more conducive to these elements than others. The combination of wedge issues with populist communication and illiberal rhetoric as exclusionary rhetorical strategies thus emerges as a defining feature of populist digital campaigning. These elements can be seen as mutually reinforcing tools that structure harmful political interpretation patterns, particularly in times of polycrises. This underscores how digital platforms can be used to redefine the contours of democratic debate, making it even more essential to understand the communicative mechanisms through which parties influence public discourse in order to defend democracy.",

          "abstract": "Smartphones are widely considered a more suitable tool for those who have recently come to the digital world, such as older people. Many scholars and experts promote the spread of mobile services among the older population in order to enhance the maintenance of independence and autonomy in late age. However, few qualitative studies have thoroughly investigated older adults’ tactical use of smartphones, especially in the postpandemic context of digital acceleration. This paper investigates the tactical use of mobile services among 40 individuals, both male and female, aged 65 to 80 in Lodi, Italy, the first COVID-19 “Red Zone” in Europe. The study seeks to examine how mobile phone narratives in postpandemic settings reflect cultural models of active ageing; the dynamics of resistance, rejection, and adaptation regarding older individuals’ engagement with digital services; and the influence of social relationships in facilitating local access to predominantly digital and mobile-first public services. We argue that a tactical nonuse of mobile services emerges in narratives that, instead of reproducing a linear and homogeneous understanding of active ageing, challenge a binary opposition between users and nonusers of information and computer technologies (ICTs) in late age.",

          "abstract": "From slavery to police brutality, the Black struggle in the United States can be traced in the visual field. The online dissemination of disparate acts of violence against Black men first widely publicized when a witness recorded the beating of Rodney King on a cellphone in 1991, has evolved into a U.S. cultural phenomenon, culminating with the video of the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Insufficient attention has been paid to how audiences with lived experiences of systemic injustice bear witness to such videos. This paper seeks to understand how Black audiences engage with these sites of violence captured on cell phones and disseminated on social media platforms. The paper argues that instead of serving as a tool for accountability, the widespread dissemination of mediated Black suffering has engendered a ceaseless state of anxiety and somber acceptance of the precarity of the Black body in the United States.",

          "abstract": "Despite TikTok’s extensive popularity among children below the age of 12, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of how they use this platform for social purposes. We therefore ask how children between the ages of 8 and 12 shape their peer relations through their uses of TikTok. Through longitudinal observations of children ( n = 84) in the context of afterschool care, we found that children use TikTok to develop and employ digital, cultural and social practices. Examples of such practices are referencing popular content to connect with weak tied peers, managing their online presence to prevent scrutinization in offline social contexts and using humoristic trends and knowledge of TikTok to achieve social status and popularity. Employing these practices across on- and offline spaces can support and facilitate their development of social capital. Following these findings, we argue for initiatives and methodologies that support and explore children’s social and digital development.",

          "abstract": "Recent scholarship in critical algorithm studies has illuminated how users negotiate and resist algorithmic influence in everyday platform use, yet these perspectives remain underexplored in online consumption. Bridging theoretical frameworks of consumer culture and critical algorithm studies, this study examines the complexities of algorithmic consumer culture and practices through qualitative research on users’ experiences with Temu. We introduce the concept of platform cynicism —an ambivalent and negotiated user attitude in which skepticism, mistrust, and criticism of platforms’ exploitative, manipulative, or unethical practices coexist with pragmatic, often reluctant engagement and tactical adaptation due to structural, social, economic, or cultural constraints. Platform cynicism manifests across five interconnected dimensions: cognitive awareness, affective disillusionment, pragmatic resignation, tactical adaptation, and user–platform co-constitution. This concept can extend beyond e-commerce to broader user-platform relationships, offering insights into how consumers adapt to, contest, and remain embedded in platform capitalism despite critical awareness of their manipulative nature.",

In turn, this study looks to explore the relational impact of online mis/disinformation on romantic relationships. Through in-depth interviews (N = 28) with individuals who have terminated romantic relationships due to political difference(s) in the United States, I find that mis/disinformation plays a key role in the termination of romantic relationships, encouraging informational, and relational isolation and disrupting shared reality between partners.

Online platforms harvest and assemble data, photos, and personal digital effects to reanimate the individual via AI and reap the profits that come from their ongoing interactions with living users. The profiles of deceased individuals are directly owned and mobilized by the platform itself. Building on digital labor scholarship that shows how platforms extract value from living users, thanatechnologies represent a new kind of post-life laborer in the online economy, transforming grief and memory into exchange-value through emotional labor, social maintenance, and content generation. The specter of the zombie highlights how this digital labor intersects with histories of racial and gendered exploitation, particularly visible in the case of Bina48, where a black woman’s identity becomes a site of technological performance and commodification. Post-life laborers reveal contemporary understandings of labor, productivity, and the ongoing commodification of personal identity, affect, and sociality.",

We explore how they legitimated a change in this policy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on the theories of discursive legitimation, we examine the strategies platforms employ when presenting their actions in countering false and misleading health information. We show that the pandemic emerges as an important opportunity for platforms to narrate their legitimacy in society. Yet, the newly adopted responsibility to curb health misinformation does not signal a reform towards more truthful platforms, but temporary exceptions whose future is left open. These findings foreshadow the reversals of misinformation policies in recent years and highlight the continued importance of external regulation.",

Because of the informational outcome focus, common misinformation interventions (i.e. forewarning and debunking) have not been systematically tested for their ability to mitigate persuasive effects. In two preregistered experiments ( N = 657 and N = 427), we tested the effectiveness of forewarning versus debunking for positive and negative misinformation, focusing on attitudes and behavioral intentions as outcome measures. Results show that, as hypothesized, post-exposure corrections are most effective in reducing misinformation’s persuasive effects; pre-exposure corrections in fact do not significantly reduce persuasive effects. We also corroborate prior findings that especially effects of negative misinformation are resistant to corrections. Based on our results, we advise media outlets to not only rely on forewarnings, but to also correct misinformation after user exposure.",

Each of these discursive strategies is operated by key actors and manifests itself directly and indirectly to undermine minority discourse on social media and beyond. In sum, this article presents a conceptual framework of networked counterpublics sanctions and illustrates how the actors, the direct and indirect manifestations, and the strategies in the contemporary media environment serve as sanctions to networked counterpublics.",

It applies corpus-based discourse analysis to examine how the chatbots employ tenor resources of positioning , tuning , and orienting in the rhetoric of their refusals. This method is informed by Systemic Functional Linguistics, in particular the discourse semantic system of appraisal , which models evaluative meaning. Despite their contrite openings, chatbot refusals tend to raise stakes in terms of tenor. They deploy prosodies of propriety targeted at moral and taboo stances and behaviours. This rhetoric of oppositioning involves encapsulating key values into iconised attitudes as the chatbots advise users about what is ‘important’ and ‘not appropriate’.",

We hypothesized that for single individuals who are actively dating, lacking clearly defined dating goals may lead to greater loneliness and, in turn, account for decreased life satisfaction. We first validated the Relationship Clarity Scale (RCS) using data from both Studies 1 and 2 ( N = 375). Across two studies, we then examined single young adults' dating experiences and reports of relationship clarity cross‐sectionally (Study 1: N = 191) and longitudinally (Study 2: N = 184). Findings revealed that for single young adults who were actively dating, lower relationship clarity (i.e., not knowing what one is looking for in a romantic relationship) predicted increased loneliness over time, and this loneliness accounted for decreased life satisfaction. These findings offer insight into how the clarity of romantic goals during early dating stages may be important for single people's well‐being and, ultimately, for life satisfaction.",

          "authors": "Justus Henke",
          "abstract": "Science communication plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust in science amid complex societal challenges. This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors. It introduces the CASSCO (Complex Adaptive Systems in Science Communication) model, which integrates complex adaptive systems theory with game theory to analyze strategic interactions in science communication. The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between altruistic and self-interested roles across three communication modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios—citizen science and generative AI—the study demonstrates its potential for predicting nonlinear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications, model limitations, and future research directions.",

          "authors": "Timothy K. F. Fung, Ho Man Leung, Xiyuan Zhou, Shenting Zheng",
          "abstract": "Prefactual thinking, a form of prospective mental simulation, significantly impacts individuals’ decision-making. To understand the influence of media consumption on public opinion regarding emerging technologies, this study, in the context of generative artificial intelligence (AI), examined prefactual thinking as a cognitive process of media consumption, extending the cognitive mediation model. Using quota sampling, we conducted an online survey of 1,129 Hong Kong adult residents. The findings revealed that elaborative processing was positively associated with prefactual thinking, which, in turn, influenced emotional responses. Prefactual thinking and emotional responses shaped benefit-risk perceptions, which influenced individuals’ generative AI opinion. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.",

          "abstract": "Digital citizen science is expected to achieve equal dialogue between scientists and the public, and further the democratization of science. However, through critical technocultural discourse analysis of three Chinese citizen science digital platforms and interviews with their users, it was found that the interfaces of these platforms are embedded with scientific ideological styles and “boundary work” features. Those platforms tend to frame the public as ignorant data collection tools waiting to be guided by scientists, while scientists are framed as educators worthy of admiration. Therefore, the role of digital citizen science in democratization of science should not be overestimated.",

          "abstract": "This study uses climate change visuals to test to what extent individuals’ threat and efficacy perceptions of climate change interact with their abstract and concrete mind styles to influence their responses to the issue. Findings from online experiments reveal that abstract images intensified the negative effect of threat perceptions on psychological distance as well as the positive effect of vulnerability perception on behavioral intention. Pairing abstract images with emphasis on behaviors’ desirability also promoted intention to act. When viewing abstract images, higher levels of response efficacy raised behavioral intention among people who valued behaviors’ desirability (vs. feasibility).",

          "abstract": "Media coverage shapes public perception of science, yet gender bias can compromise its objectivity. Based on 1 million papers with 1.2 million media citations, we examine how the corresponding author’s gender relates to media citing scientific research. We reveal that more women-led papers receive at least one media mention in women-underrepresented fields, but they are cited less frequently across all fields. Women authors are underrepresented in national outlets and are more often reported by liberal media. Sentiment analysis shows that men-led papers are more often associated with positive sentiment in news text, while women-led papers elicit more negative sentiment.",

          "authors": "Zizhong Zhang, Haoyu Huang, Haixin Mu, Puxin Guo, Ke He, Tianping He",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how affective fandom publics construct transcultural mourning communities following Kobe Bryant ’s death. Drawing on 5 years of data from Reddit and Baidu Tieba, it examines how digital grief evolves across platforms and cultures. The analysis integrates theories of affective publics, fandom, and online mourning to conceptualize these publics as emotionally durable collectives shaped by cultural values and platform rituals. Findings reveal distinct mourning modes: Western discourse emphasizes personal storytelling and emotional immediacy, while Chinese discourse highlights ritual and symbolic continuity. Over time, both shift from public spectacle to sustained emotional practice, transforming grief into identity-making and collective memory work. This study contributes to affect theory, digital mourning research, and sports communication by revealing how mourning unfolds not only across platforms but also through time and culture.",

          "abstract": "Social media has redefined traditional mourning spaces, enabling new forms of digital mourning that challenge established emotional norms. While existing studies often focus on digital mourning within public social media platforms, less attention has been given to the semi-public platforms. This study takes China’s WeChat Moments as a case study to explore how individuals narrate and reflect on their digital mourning practices, specifically how they interpret platform affordances, navigate emotional tensions, and develop media strategies in response. It conceptualizes the imagination and appropriation of social media and the emotional restraint practiced to avoid conflicts as “mediated emotional repertoire.” This concept reflects individuals’ management of private emotions in the digital sphere, highlighting the complex interplay between social media platforms, cultural norms, and interpersonal interactions.",

          "abstract": "Distrust of young individuals in traditional political institutions, coupled with many youths’ heavy use of online platforms, raises questions about the nature of their online actions in light of mainstream political practices. Our study addresses this research gap by providing insights into the voices of these young individuals and their communities on TikTok, as they engage in partisan online political discourse. Using topic modeling, thematic content analysis, and sentiment analysis, we analyzed 124,963 audience comments and 100 video posts by young supporters of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States. We found that the topics discussed in the young supporters’ video posts varied significantly between the two parties, as did the audience’s reactions to these posts. Young supporters often employ the platform to reinforce in-group solidarity and target ideological opponents, and their political messaging closely aligns with their respective parties’ ideologies. They leverage the platform’s socio-technical features to engage with their audiences in “politainment” by means of humor, sarcasm, and cultural references.",
