          "authors": "Wenqing Zhao, Yan Jin, Toni van der Meer, Michael Hameleers, Xuerong Lu",
          "abstract": "Numerous global trends related to communicative conflicts—like widespread public dissent, the increasing fragmentation of the digital media landscape, the fast-paced dissemination of mis- and disinformation, polarization of public debates, and delegitimizing populist rhetoric—form a perfect storm that significantly disrupts today’s society on multiple levels. Against this backdrop, research on content, causes, consequences, and counter-strategies of conflicts has been central to the discipline of communication science and beyond over the past decades. Although many of these societal challenges are rooted in communication problems similar in nature, current research lines appear to move forward in isolation, creating largely disconnected streams of research that could benefit from more integration. With this article, we aim to bring together disconnected strands of literature in communication that revolve around conflicts in mass and digital communication under the umbrella term “informational conflict.” This framework synthesizes existing knowledge, enabling us to better understand the root causes of increasing cleavages in society and to forward potential solutions leading to conflict resolution.",

          "authors": "Cato Waeterloos",
          "abstract": "Over the past decades, political participation in an online context has gained substantive attention. However, it is only recently that conceptual advancements have been made concerning the specific expressive and mobilizing practices that occur on social media. This article argues on the importance and implications of recognizing political participation on social media as a conceptually distinct mode of political participation, shaped by unique affordances that highlight its networked and political character. Specifically, the article provides a conceptual and normative state of the art regarding online and social media political participation. By discussing the empirical implications of prominent theoretical assumptions in the field, three key research gaps are identified and I propose a research agenda for the field of political communication.",

          "title": "Thirty years since Kunda: addressing critiques to reimagine a model of motivated reasoning",
          "authors": "Camille J Saucier, Nathan Walter, Stefanie Z Demetriades",
          "abstract": "Following Kunda’s (1990) defense of the influence of motivations on reasoning, a growing body of communication research has coalesced around the idea that specific motivations can influence decision-making. At the same time, this body of research has been subjected to criticisms highlighting alternative explanations that do not involve motivated processes. The present study contributes to this conversation by reviewing the evidence around motivated reasoning as reflected in empirical communication research over the past 30 years (k = 143), focusing on the framework’s key components: motivation, reasoning, and responses. The findings identify considerable gaps, including a limited focus on distinct motivations, an underemphasis on reasoning, and a concentration on a narrow set of responses. This article concludes by proposing the Motivation-Reasoning-Response Model, which visually summarizes the findings of this review and indicates possible opportunities for future research.",

          "authors": "Parker Bach, Carolyn E Schmitt, Shannon C McGregor",
          "abstract": "While clarity is often upheld as a core element of successful communication, we argue that a lack of clarity can also benefit a speaker, a concept called strategic ambiguity. This concept has been used across disciplines for decades, but its definitions are often overly context-specific. In this article, we follow Chaffee’s (1991) framework for explication to survey the literature and provide a unified definition of strategic ambiguity as a rhetorical tactic in which a communicator creates a: (1) polysemic message with multiple reasonable interpretations supported by the text, that is: (2) aimed at audiences from varying interpretive communities; and (3) by which polysemy the communicator stands to gain some specific advantage. We offer methodological suggestions on the study of strategic ambiguity, accompanied by two case studies of strategic ambiguity, centering Congressional newsletters and conservative political satire. We close with suggestions for scholarships that could be informed by incorporating strategic ambiguity.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes the concept of platformed creativity to examine how new technologies have engaged in the social dynamics of creative practices. In recent years, a few Korean female digital creators have become visible by producing and sharing gender-bound football media content on YouTube. Based on a critical discourse analysis involving the channels of four female Korean chuktubers, I found that this user-generated media platform offers these female digital creators the opportunity to capitalize on their unpopular and unconventional characteristics and narratives, allowing them to transform their creative practices into collective resistance against gender norms and hierarchies in the football media industry. However, YouTube also limits these chuktubers’ creative possibilities to the extent that it does not fundamentally intervene in the existing gender architecture within society. This study concludes that user-generated media platforms invigorate the social dynamics of creative practices while simultaneously controlling the social potential of creative imagination.",

          "authors": "Anna Yan Liu, Harsh Taneja",
          "abstract": "K-pop, a niche genre appealing to certain audience segments in the global market, has now attracted mainstream attention of music industries and general audiences within and beyond Asia. Previous studies often attribute niche genres’ visibility in a cultural market to audience segmentation and the prominence of niche tastes; however, K-pop’s mainstream visibility in its transnational spread complicates this argument. Integrating the sociology of quantification to studies on audience metrics and social quantification, this paper takes BTS as a case and examines how they gained mainstream visibility in the U.S. as the consequences of institutional audiences construction by Billboard’s global rankings – Social 50 and Top Social Artist Award. We argue that although Billboard’s charts and awards are not designed to favor exotic music, their institutional construction of global audiences is inherently a quantification process, the nature of which inadvertently eliminates regional differences in available audience sizes and consumption cultures when aggregating artists’ worldwide social engagements into ordinal numbers. Consequently, Billboard-constructed global audiences are mis-aggregated, over-representing certain regional tastes. Billboard initially interpreted mis-aggregated audiences as BTS’s global social popularity, increasing this then niche group’s mainstream visibility in the U.S. market. Focusing on measurement regimes, such as Billboard, this paper suggests an alternative mechanism for niche genres’ visibility in a culture market – audience mis-aggregation. When measurement regimes use metrics to synthesize diverse audience segments to represent the whole market, tremendous information is eliminated through this quantification process, resulting in over-representation of certain segments’ tastes and increasing mainstream visibility of niche genres.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the experiential value of gambling within free-to-play (f2p) gamespaces. In doing so, it offers a more balanced understanding of the gambling/gaming interplay. Whilst existing understandings tend to focus on the assumedly predatory monetisation techniques that players are subjected to by game developers, I instead argue that a logic of gambling is integral to the f2p experience economy of Asian players. Drawing on an analysis of in-depth interviews with Singapore-based game players/developers, I show how the virtual items and worlds that players engage with through f2p gamespaces are imbued with experiential value, whilst developers leverage the volumes of data generated by players to maximise this value in ways that might eventually lead to their monetisation. Embracing these complementary facets of f2p gamespaces can help expand normative understandings of gambling in/and gaming.",

          "abstract": "This article examines two videogames to uncover their anti-imperial and decolonial qualities. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (2015) and Death Stranding (2019) created by the Japanese videogame designer Hideo Kojima express commentaries on American politics and their effects on the United States and the rest of the world. Kojima has used Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851/1999), a narrative account critiquing American imperialism, as an anchor to extend his own critique of American foreign policies as an outsider affected by US global hegemony. The similarities among the two games and Melville's Moby-Dick run much deeper than what the player sees, and the internal complexities of each narrative surpass the single layer of international politics. The political themes of each game complement and continue the political themes found in Moby-Dick. Both videogames affirm a decolonizing worldview by invalidating American imperial politics and encouraging global players to do the same.",

          "abstract": "Much of the philosophical discussion of video game ethics is dominated by the literature on the Gamer's Dilemma, which forces us to focus on the ethics of certain forms of extreme virtual content in video games, such as virtual murder or molestation. While a focus on the ethics of video game content is important, we argue that scrutinizing the ethics of video game systems is needed to properly capture the full range of ethical concerns raised by video games. Drawing on a distinction between intravirtual and extravirtual effects, we identify ethical issues with video game content and, by linking to the dark patterns literature, video game systems. To illustrate our view, we give examples of how a game can appear to have morally objectionable content without the game being, at least clearly, morally objectionable, and how a game can appear to be morally unobjectionable despite having morally objectionable systems.",

          "authors": "Yeunjae Lee, Dalee Yoon, Cen April Yue",
          "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore how CEOs’ interpersonal communication styles on social media can effectively enhance the relationship with employees and increase their engagement on social media platforms. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted with 404 full-time employees working in corporations across various industries in the US. Only employees who “follow” their company’s CEO on social media were included in the study. Findings CEOs’ use of a conversational tone on social media helps employees perceive them as approachable and interactive leaders, thereby improving the quality of the CEO-employee relationship and increasing employees’ engagement on social media. CEOs’ personal disclosures on social media were found to promote employees’ perceptions of CEO approachability only when paired with a conversational communication style. Research limitations/implications Our study offers theoretical implications for communication and media literature by highlighting the potential of CEOs as chief “engagement” officers, capable of leveraging online platforms (i.e. social media) to foster employee interactions and support. Practical implications This study provides CEOs and communication practitioners with practical guidelines for using social media for both professional and social purposes as a crucial tool for internal relationship management. Originality/value This study is one of the first empirical attempts to examine the value of CEO social media communication as a key tool for building and maintaining quality employee–CEO relationship and engagement.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Online games are highly popular Internet applications. Some games enable players to save game progress and accumulate experiences or changes to avatars during gameplay, whereas some other games do not, requiring players to restart from the beginning each time. That is, games differ in avatar accumulability. However, we do not know whether games should be designed to permit avatar accumulability or not and how it affects players’ gameplay experience and therefore game outcomes, indicating gaps. Research addressing these gaps can inform game makers in designing games that effectively strengthen their players’ game loyalty. Design/methodology/approach We used social identity theory (SIT) to construct a theoretical model. To test this model, three waves of survey data were gathered from the same 778 participants. Findings These findings uniquely indicate that avatar accumulability fosters avatar identification and increases players’ focused immersion, thus increasing players’ loyalty. Practical implications Game providers could include game features that enable players to accumulate their avatars’ in-game skins, levels, items (weapons and equipment) and experience points. This accumulability can help strengthen players’ game loyalty. Originality/value Overall, our study extends SIT by adding a new trigger (avatar accumulability) and two novel consequences of avatar identification (image protection and focused immersion) in avatar-related systems (games or gamified systems). The new trigger offers an actionable means to apply SIT, while the novel consequences verify the value of applying SIT to study online games.",

          "abstract": "Effective doctor-patient communication has been linked to better patient outcomes and treatment adherence, whereas ineffective communication has been linked to poorer outcomes and more medical errors. Our study used Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) to investigate across four countries which communication strategies patients preferred from their doctors. Archival data from a larger online survey research study provided a sample of 1698 participants (Male = 36.4%, Female = 61.1%, Other 1.8%, Age M = 25.5 SD = 10.67), recruited from four countries (Australia, USA, Hong Kong/China, and the Philippines). Results showed participants preferred accommodative stances over non-accommodative stances (under or over accommodation), and that accommodative interpretability was the most frequently mentioned communication strategy in all four countries. Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences across countries for all strategies, with the strongest effects for discourse management. Implications for adding CAT into medical education communication training are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: This study introduces a novel VR-based approach to measure pupillary responses during media consumption. Researchers exposed participants to 30 video messages in a virtual TV viewing room, capturing pupil dilation and constriction via VR-integrated eye-tracking. By analyzing cross-receiver similarity (inter-subject correlations) of pupillometric responses, we could identify which specific video an individual was watching. This method worked best under normal viewing conditions and was sensitive to attentional manipulations. This study also found that messages with the most robust pupil response signatures were more likely to be remembered. Theoretical implications for quantifying media exposure and developing signatures of perceptual attention in individuals and audiences are discussed. Practically, this pupillary audience response measurement could be applied to various media formats, including screen-based media, social media, and VR/AR environments. In sum, the study highlights the potential of pupillometry in understanding audience engagement and response dynamics in naturalistic media consumption settings.",

          "authors": "Keith V. Osai, Travis E. Dorsch, Kay Bradford, Shawn Whiteman, Jordan A. Blazo, Haylee Downey",
          "abstract": "The influence of families on siblings’ experiences and outcomes has been well documented outside of sport, with research dedicated to topics such as socialization, relationship quality, adjustment, resource dilution, and behavioral genetics. While these associations are understood in reference to the immediate family context, sibling dynamics are less understood in the context of youth sport. This is important because sport represents the most common extracurricular activity in which siblings participate together. Guided by family systems theory, Dorsch and colleagues’ (2022) integrated model of the youth sport system, and a social constructivist epistemology, the present study was designed to understand the interactions that take place across multiple family relationships and how these relationships impact siblings’ experiences and outcomes in organized youth sport. Twelve intact families, each consisting of two parents and two siblings, who were engaged in organized youth sport in the United States, participated in individual, semi-structured interviews. More than nine hours of interviews were conducted across these 48 participants.Three researchers engaged in the coding process, which informed the creation of case narratives for each of the 12 families. Interpretation of the case narratives led to the development of nine general themes regarding sibling relationships in youth sport. Of note, a unique pathway of influence was also recognized, wherein parents expressed support for their children’s pursuit of their own niche/identity in youth sport. Future theoretically informed research should be designed to investigate specific individual, dyadic, and family processes that influence sibling experiences and outcomes in youth sport, offering further insight into the complex and dynamic interactions that occur within and across families.",

We coded their stories for common narrative arcs and counter narratives that they used to describe their courtship. Our findings uncovered ten narrative arcs capturing different trajectories of relationship development. Embedded within these stories were counter narratives that participants used to challenge traditional courtship ideologies.

          "abstract": "Older adults are theorized to prioritize relationships with close social partners who support their emotional goals. Throughout the lifespan, social partners of varying closeness may play different roles in one’s emotional life. We investigate the relationship between age, social closeness, and social partner evaluations at relationship and social interaction levels. Participants aged 25–85 ( N = 309) completed social network questionnaires with relationship evaluations of their enjoyment and conflict with partners of varying closeness. In an experience sampling procedure (6x/day for 10 days), participants reported on closeness, pleasure, and discomfort for their most recent social interaction, as well as momentary affect. Older age was associated with higher enjoyment of relationships with peripheral social network members and higher pleasure during interactions with less-close social partners. We also examined how links between momentary social closeness, evaluations, and affect vary by age. Among older, but not younger and middle-aged adults, prior social interaction pleasure was associated with higher positive affect regardless of relationship closeness. Older adults’ disproportionately positive evaluations of peripheral network members and interactions with non-close others may result from their pruning of social partners who do not support their emotional goals. Positive social interactions, even with acquaintances or other non-close partners, may become increasingly relevant for well-being across the adult lifespan.",

          "authors": "John T. Caldwell",
          "abstract": "This article examines how the innovations of, and fallout from, the post-1980s US multichannel cable era both prefigured and were transformed by the 21st-century online platform streaming era. Intense corporate competition, in which traditional networks and studios collided with disruptive new firms, triggered producers to innovate new ways of financing, making, and conceptualizing media content. Both disruptions spurred mergers, bankruptcies, hostile takeovers, and collapsing institutional distinctions. At the same time, these periods of acute market uncertainty also triggered widespread forms of innovation in production, technical imaging, narrative content, seriality, programming strategies, and aesthetics. So much so that the periods have been deemed “The 2nd Golden Age of Television,” and a “European Television Fiction Renaissance,” respectively. Yet traditional qualitative paradigms like these can also divert scholars who intend or need to unpack, document, and explain two more modest industry realities. First, acute televisual stylizing and golden age attributions gloss over television’s and streaming’s less-remarkable but essential and problematic industrial routine. Second, celebrating industrial exceptionalisms often ignore the creative media workers that disruptive innovations inevitably displace; or they caricature routine workers as a monotonous “rule” that proves the talented rise-above-the-pack “exception.” I have tried to look beyond the vanguard masterworks in the two historical disruptions. My research focuses on habitual practices in production, in order to unpack the collateral damage, the “industrial ashes” that “media peaks” and masterpieces often (necessarily) arise from. Fieldwork and human-subjects research in media industry studies make it difficult to overlook the human costs and displaced workers that have followed in the wake of aesthetic and technical innovations in both periods. Drawing on the ethnographic fieldwork for &lt;em&gt;Specworld (Caldwell, 2023), &lt;/em&gt;this article targets one problem scholars unavoidably face if they hope to account for the habitual, the losers, and the routine in worlds of production. Taking this approach makes justifying one methodological framework a precondition for scholarship: the &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt; of the evidence or data media scholars intend to “sample” in research on the immense complex production systems that characterize both periods. As an alternative to the bracketed-off masterworks, “quality television” (or “cinemas”), and auteurs favored by arts and humanities scholars, research on complex media ecosystems requires finding a system-wide logic or basis for the evidence gathered. I argue that production rifts and fractures offer scholars unintended (unplanned and uncensored) self-portraits of what complex industries “betray” as most important to the system as a whole. In proposing “rift-trace data-sampling” for evidence I argue that industrial failures (rather than masterworks) act as unintended, even subconscious disclosures of key industrial practices. Triggered disclosures of this sort may offer a more convincing way to understand the televisual complexities—and system-wide functions—of golden-age digital innovations.",

          "abstract": "This article aims to make a contribution to the study of liberal feminism, social media, and influencer culture, especially in the Italian context. The feminism of Chiara Ferragni, Italian fashion influencer with over 29 million followers, is an interesting case study that questions the relations, as well as the interaction, between activism, gender, and influencer culture. Ferragni’s body simulacrum, exhibited through numerous social media advertising images, was displayed at Sanremo, a renowned Italian song festival, watched by 12 million people in 2023. At Sanremo, that body carried on the feminist battle through the wearing of manifesto luxury designer dresses together with the reading of a letter addressed to herself, a vector of a rhetorically powerful message that was, however, directed to the single woman rather than to women as a collectivity. This neoliberal discourse is emblematic of the instrumental use of gender issues for self-promotion, which often leads to the dilution of feminist meanings and the trivialization of social movements.",

The findings indicate most listeners trust content heard on news podcasts, which may relate to an increase in available news programs, as well as an overall increase in podcast listenership. The research also shows some listeners trust news heard on non-news podcasts. This may relate to interest in alternate sources for news and the storytelling formats used in the programs. When examining the trust of news content based on genre, news heard on comedy, news, and history podcasts are more likely to be trusted by listeners. The majority of gratifications associated with listening to podcasts based on the various genres are similar, with minimal differences seen among certain genres. Discussion of AI and its influence on trust in news heard on podcasts is also addressed.",

          "abstract": "By analyzing 120 episodes from 12 podcast accounts, representing central, provincial, commercial, and individual Chinese news outlets on the Himalaya platform, this study examines the strategies employed by news publishers to balance intimacy and professionalism. Our findings show that while all media types prioritize professionalism, their strategies for cultivating intimacy differ significantly. Compared to commercial and provincial media, central media achieved the best balance between intimacy and professionalism. Individual media demonstrated the highest intimacy scores, whereas central media excelled in professionalism. This study enhances our understanding of how institutional backgrounds shape strategies in audio journalism. It offers insights into balancing intimacy with professional standards in the podcast medium.",

          "authors": "Astrid Van den Bossche, Jelena Brankovic, Morten Hansen",
          "abstract": "Rankings are a well-established genre for evaluating diverse phenomena, yet culturally resonant critiques of them are relatively rare. This paper examines how student vloggers on YouTube challenge and reinterpret university rankings through ‘tier list’ and ‘reaction’ videos, thereby shifting genre expectations. Through a move analysis of 30 such videos, we identify 3 rhetorical actions – making sense of ranking, audience interpellation and subverting the ranking genre – and discuss how the ranking’s remediation simultaneously rejects and reinforces hierarchy as the social form underlying it. This results in often humorous critiques where vloggers challenge ‘objective’ cardinal assumptions and posit rank as collaboratively constructed. Remediation in social media has the potential to not only make visible genre work performed by the genre’s discursive community, but in doing so also reconfigures the rhetorical premises that characterise the ranking genre in the first place.",

          "abstract": "Digital communication venues are essential infrastructures for anti-democratic actors to spread harmful content such as conspiracy theories. Capitalizing on platform affordances, they leverage conspiracy theories to mainstream their political views in broader public discourse. We compared the word choice, language style, and communicative function of conspiracy-related content to understand its platform-dependent differences and convergence. Our cases are the conspiracy theories of the New World Order and Great Replacement, which we analyzed on 4chan/pol/, Twitter, and seven alternative US news media longitudinally from 2011 to 2021. The conspiracy-related texts were comparatively analyzed using a multi-method approach of computational and quantitative text analyses. Our results show that conspiracy narrations are increasingly present in all venues. While language differs vastly between platforms, we observed a style convergence between Twitter and 4chan. The results show how more coded language veils the spread of racist and antisemitic content beyond the so-called dark platforms.",

          "abstract": "Platforms have disintermediated the markets for books, film, television, and music, but the online art market has reproduced offline structures, leaving intermediaries intact. This study explores the limits of platforms by describing why disintermediation failed in the art market. Along with museums and other intermediaries, the most important function of galleries is to co-create artistic value. They not only sell art but also form a central part of the status system of art. We examine #artistsupportpledge (ASP) on Instagram. ASP uncovered a market for art that had no place in the existing system. ASP facilitated direct sales to consumers while allowing artists to maintain links to galleries for reputation, career development, exhibitions, and sales of large, expensive work. The art market experienced unique partial disintermediation under narrow conditions with continued allegiance to existing intermediaries and status structures. We conclude by discussing four implications for the theory of platforms.",

          "abstract": "The mobile app BeReal, launched in 2020, has gained popularity for its emphasis on authenticity, spontaneity, and real-time daily interactions with close ties, earning it the label of “anti-Instagram.” However, empirical evidence on its relationship with well-being is currently lacking. This study uses a quasi-experimental two-wave design to examine the relationship between BeReal use duration and well-being indicators. Results suggest that long-term BeReal use is linked to higher friendship satisfaction, positively influencing life satisfaction. In addition, long-term use is associated with reduced fear of missing out and connection overload compared to short-term use, suggesting BeReal may enhance well-being possibly by facilitating daily interactions with close ties, limiting usage time, and providing a more authentic representation of everyday life compared to other social media platforms.",

          "abstract": "Nonhuman life is increasingly analyzed and acted upon through big data and AI tools. Birds in particular are among the most datafied wild beings. However, avian—like human—data sets present challenges of bias, misclassification, and harmful collection methods. For example, avian data includes bias along lines of sex and sexuality, female, queer, and intersex birds are significantly understudied. These missing birds not only represent consequences for biodiversity loss but also “naturalize” assumptions about sex and sexuality for all species, including humans. In this article, we interrogate avian datafication practices and introduce Salvaging Birds, a multimodal project proposing “queer data surrogacy” as a method for generating “queer ecological data,” that is data resisting normative environmental frameworks. Here queer data surrogates were produced by creatively subverting AI toward generating speculative missing birds. Bridging critical data and archival studies with queer ecology, we argue that data logics demand examination at nonhuman sites and scales.",

          "abstract": "This article examines emergent communities of platform-based delivery workers in Bangkok by applying Max Weber’s concept of Vergemeinschaftung or ‘doing community’. Using offline and online ethnographic methods, the authors demonstrate how delivery workers do community on the streets of Bangkok and leverage smartphones and social media to extend their communities to the online realm. These community practices are culturally constituted and share characteristics with pre-existing communities in the transportation sector in Thailand. However, while these older communities are under pressure from rationalisation, or in Weber’s terms, Vergesellschaftung, rider communities emerge from the rational conditions of delivery platforms. Through this analysis, the article demonstrates how Weber’s theory effectively captures the dialectical dynamics of doing community and rationalisation in digital economies, suggesting that scholarship on digital platforms and media could benefit from adopting a Weberian analysis of social change.",

          "authors": "Yuqi Zhu, Jianxun Chu",
          "abstract": "The ethical dimensions of human–AI (artificial intelligence) interaction demand attention. As artificial intelligence assistants become more anthropomorphized, will the public interact with AI as humans morally? This study applied content analysis to data from an online question-and-answer platform in China ( N = 287) to explore the public’s judgments of gratitude toward artificial intelligence assistants. The findings revealed the majority supports expressing gratitude, while a significant minority disagrees, indicating diverse ethical judgments. By further analyzing people’s reasoning, this study found that supporters attribute gratitude to moral autonomy driven by virtue ethics, moral responsibility for responsible AI, and the perceived source identity of anthropomorphized AI as human, aligning with the Computers-are-Social-Actors paradigm. In contrast, opponents doubt AI’s moral agency, highlighting the perceived source of AI as machines, and they judge that treating it with human manners is useless and potentially dangerous. These insights enhance the understanding of the public’s view of ethical considerations regarding AI assistants, contribute to gratitude research in the context of human–AI interaction, extend the moral dimension of the Computers-are-Social-Actors paradigm, and emphasize the importance of moral and responsible AI use. Suggestions for future research based on the exploratory findings are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "This study examined science capital among Finnish adults ( N = 1572), who responded to 37 survey items assessing science capital. Factor analysis suggested four science capital dimensions: visiting science-related places, science attitudes, science-related self-efficacy, and early support for studying natural sciences. Higher education and higher parental education were linked to higher science capital across all dimensions. Older participants exhibited lower science-related self-efficacy, less early support, and more negative science attitudes than younger respondents. Age and education were stronger predictors of science-related self-efficacy and early encouragement for men than women, and mothers’ education had a weaker effect on science-related self-efficacy for men. The results show that science capital is a multidimensional construct and highlights that younger generations in Finland have had more opportunities to develop their science capital. These findings emphasize the need for early and equitable support to foster positive science attitudes and participation.",

I analyze these reveal videos, their comment threads, and the role of YouTube in hosting these videos, to capture the popular discourse around the relationship between DNA and racial identity. By employing critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA), I explore how Caribbean content creators discuss racial identity, and how online discourses negotiate, codify, or disrupt neoliberal notions of racial authenticity. I focus on videos made by creators who self-identify as being from the Caribbean or of the Caribbean diaspora. By bringing the Caribbean existentialist thought of Stuart Hall and Édouard Glissant into my analysis, I explore how Caribbean creators employ what C. Rhonda Cobham-Sander deems “the Creole imagination” to interrogate notions of racial authenticity while de-/re-constructing racial identity in digital spaces.",

          "authors": "Alon Zoizner, Eran Amsalem",
          "abstract": "Campaign promises are a central mechanism for voters to hold politicians accountable, and information about their breakage or fulfillment features prominently in the media during election campaigns. Despite the importance of campaign promises, previous research yields conflicting expectations regarding their influence on citizens. Some theories suggest citizens vote based on policy performance and, therefore, consistently penalize actors who break their promises. Other theoretical accounts, however, argue that exposure to information during election campaigns often has minimal effects on citizens due to strongly held prior beliefs and partisan motivations. The goal of the current study is to address these competing claims by systematically testing the conditions under which citizens penalize politicians for breaking promises. We conducted four experiments (total N = 7,030), three of them preregistered, in two countries under varying political conditions. We find that (1) broken promises decrease domain-specific evaluations of leaders but have little impact on evaluations of actors’ overall performance; (2) broken promises have limited effects when people have strong priors about the political actor who made the promise; and (3) citizens downplay and rationalize promises broken by ingroup, but not outgroup, leaders. These results suggest that even though information about broken promises is salient in campaign communications, its impact on citizens is context-dependent and often quite limited.",

          "authors": "Aliya Andrich",
          "abstract": "Research shows that female politicians often receive more negative news coverage than their male counterparts, which can undermine voter support and contribute to their underrepresentation in politics. Despite the increase in politically active women and heightened attention to gender issues in political discourse in the United States, the past decade has also witnessed a rise in divisive rhetoric and political polarization. These changes not only transformed the political environment but also may have impacted media coverage of political figures. Despite the evolving sociopolitical landscape, existing research on news sentiment lacks a longitudinal perspective. This study uses transformer-based classifiers for sentiment detection and state space models for time series analysis to provide new longitudinal evidence on the evolution of positive and negative coverage of 1,095 US politicians in almost 900,000 news articles during the 2010s. The results indicate that while some female politicians experienced more negative coverage than men, the pattern varied depending on the politicians’ party affiliation and media visibility. In both election and routine periods, the media portrayed female Democrats, who received moderate levels of media coverage, less negatively than male Republicans, but more critically than female Republicans and male Democrats. Notably, Democratic and Republican women received slightly more positive coverage in most election years of the 2010s. Highly visible politicians, especially women, received more negative attention overall. The study and its findings advance our understanding of how news sentiment varies across different groups of politicians and how it fluctuates between election and nonelection periods.",

          "authors": "Maud Reveilhac, Hajo Boomgaarden",
          "abstract": "Trust in public authorities can be crucial for a country to navigate through times of crisis. Such crises put news media into the spotlight as crucial information brokers between authorities and the public. It is argued that media coverage should affect trust in public institutions and that such effects are likely to be conditioned by individuals’ crisis risk perceptions. This article investigates the dynamics of public trust in the government during the COVID-19 pandemic over more than a two-year period. To do so, it draws on panel survey data from thirty-two waves combined with data on news media coverage of salient topics of crisis coverage. The analytical strategy relies on multilevel modeling and assesses the effect of media coverage on citizens’ trust, as well as the effect of risk perceptions and the interaction between them. Among others, the results revealed that risk perceptions related to the economy and exposure to media coverage of economic “costs” negatively impacted trust. Furthermore, it found evidence that when associated with media exposure to “costs,” societal risk perceptions (both health and economy related) had a significant impact on trust in government. The impact varied depending on the level of media exposure, with high exposure leading to higher trust in government. The study concludes by highlighting the practical and theoretical implications of these findings.",
