          "authors": "Daniel C Hallin, Philip Kitzberger, Manel Palos-Pons",
          "abstract": "This article examines seven Latin American cases in which anti-populist media played central roles in organizing political opposition to a populist regime, creating a political cleavage between populism and anti-populism which continued to structure both journalism and political competition following the end of populist rule. It contributes to the literature on media and populism by focusing on an actor usually neglected in this literature—the anti-populist media—and by shifting the focus from press freedom to political parallelism. Following the case studies we take up conceptual issues related to the logics of populism and anti-populism and to debates about the applicability of the concept of political parallelism and of mediatization to Latin America and other regions of the global South.",

          "authors": "Christos Manolas, Panos Raptis, Mark Durham",
          "abstract": "Cinematic sound design workflows are well-established and refined over many years of practice and scholarly review, and the creative and technical approaches resulting from this are widely adopted and used. Until recently, these approaches were partially dictated by the conventions and limitations of the underlying visual medium: the cinematic screen. Nevertheless, the ongoing technological revolution brings radical changes in the way we approach and consume creative media content and the accompanying soundtracks. Long-established cinematic sound design conventions are challenged and transformed, as emerging cinematic sound systems allow for greater creative freedom and more precise sound spatialisation. At the same time, advanced virtual reality (VR) systems provide an opportunity to break the boundaries of the screen and allow filmmakers to explore new ways of creative expression. With this comes an increased demand for specialised audio content that utilises the unique technological and creative characteristics of the VR medium. Through discussions and commentary based on secondary research and a series of interviews with sound design and filmmaking practitioners, this study aims at identifying some of the creative and practical opportunities and challenges sound designers may encounter when working in VR projects with a cinematic narrative structure and orientation. Ultimately, the study seeks to assist sound designers, VR filmmakers, and immersive media practitioners in better contextualising and defining the potential roles of the soundtrack in VR filmmaking and the associated workflows, contributing to the ongoing dialogue as the language of the new medium is being developed.",

          "title": "Band of blood brothers: Exploring visibility management and networking among Twitter users identifying as Filipino men living with HIV",
          "authors": "Aldo Gavril Lim, Cleofe Torres, Sarah Cardey, Anna Macready, Maria Stella Tirol",
          "abstract": "The Philippines continues to grapple with a rising number of HIV cases, particularly among Filipino men who have sex with men. Notably, Filipino men living with HIV (FMLWH) are visible on Twitter (now X), despite Facebook’s dominance in the Philippines. The Twitterverse of FMLWH may be imagined as networked publics, with these users negotiating visibility management in the face of HIV-related stigmas and navigating context collapse in a high-visibility space. In this study, we explore the visibility management practices of Twitter users identifying as FMLWH and subsequently map their network structure. Our mixed-methods approach combined analysis of online trace data from 1447 public Twitter accounts with in-depth interviews conducted with 24 Twitter users. Findings revealed that FMLWH employed a range of visibility management practices on Twitter, including the use of succinct identifiers to disclose HIV status, the maintenance of pseudonymous identities, and a strategic shift from partial to greater visibility when engaging with other FMLWH in private communication spaces. Participants expressed a strong inclination to connect with fellow ‘blood brothers’ and were frequently directed to these users through algorithmic recommendations rather than word-of-mouth. An expansive network comprising 302,934 ‘follow’ ties connected all but two of the 1447 users. Network analysis also showed high reciprocity and short distances between actors. Despite these metrics, a relatively low degree of interconnectedness was found, suggesting that users formed their own smaller pockets of conversation. Overall, FMLWH exhibited a deliberate effort to manage their visibility on Twitter and demonstrated a level of connectivity and engagement that might not naturally occur in real-world settings. Furthermore, the affordances of Twitter facilitated the open disclosure of HIV status, traditionally considered a private and sensitive matter. These findings warrant further investigation into the formation of networked HIV social identities and the emergence of pseudonymous networked counter publics among FMLWH.",

          "abstract": "Guided by social identity gratification theory, this study examines the reciprocal relationship between media consumption and social identity among 220 ethnically and linguistically diverse Muslim American adolescents over three years. Using latent growth curve modeling, we found stronger evidence for media-to-identity influence, particularly in predicting within-person changes over time. Media consumption was significantly associated with identity centrality and private esteem but not public esteem, highlighting the multidimensionality of social identity. The impact of media also varied by genre and language: native-language entertainment media positively influenced identity centrality and private esteem, whereas English-language media showed distinct effects at the between- and within-subject levels. Additionally, increased time on social networking sites was linked to a decline in Muslim private esteem over time. These findings highlight the complex ways media consumption shapes the social identity development of marginalized youth in the United States.",

Data for this study were drawn from parents (N = 1,232) of adolescents and adolescent-parent dyads (adolescent ages 13–17; N = 266 dyads) living in Australia/New Zealand, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Analyses found five profiles of media parenting: Hands-off &amp; Low Confidence, Permissive, Value-Neutral &amp; Moderately Engaged, Engaged but Low Conversation, and Proactive &amp; Engaged. We found some evidence for differences in media parenting profiles by country of residence, as well as limited evidence of differences in adolescent well-being by media parenting profiles, country of residence, or an interaction between profiles and country of residence.",

          "abstract": "Although research on misinformation and conspiracy theories has grown exponentially in recent years, false and misleading content remains difficult to combat. Understanding the fundamental drivers behind conspiracy theory engagement may provide unique insight. Drawing upon distinct literatures around self-affirmation and motivation theories, this study aims to: (a) determine if conspiracy theories serve to bolster self-worth among those predisposed to believe them and (b) examine whether a priori affirmation reduces the desire to engage with these theories. To test these predictions, two experiments assessed participants’ likelihood of engaging with a conspiracy theory. Results were mixed, suggesting conspiracy theories serve a self-affirming function, yet also illustrating the complex nature of conspiracy beliefs and the diverse means to test them. Together, these findings speak to the continued importance of research into conspiracy theory engagement with an eye toward identifying boundary conditions and elucidating underlying mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The metaverse presents an emerging domain that offers many opportunities to various stakeholders. Despite the advantages, the metaverse has been witnessing increasing cases of violence and abuse. This study aims to empirically examine the dark side of the metaverse and its consequences on users. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the theoretical premise of deindividuation theory and psychodynamic theory to conceptualize a research model. A structured survey-based questionnaire is employed for data collection from 327 metaverse gaming users from US. Structured equation modeling was used for data analysis. Findings The study reveals that the loneliness of users is positively associated with dissociative anonymity and invisibility in the metaverse, which leads to deindividuation. Further, findings suggest that deindividuation fosters deviant behaviour in metaverse. Furthermore, deindividuation and deviant behaviour predict depression among users. The study also established the moderating effects of immersive experience. Originality/value Rarely studies have attempted to comprehend the dark side of the metaverse. The study is one of the first to empirically show that metaverse engagement might aggravate the well-being of lonely individuals. Findings also offer implications for metaverse game designers and public policymakers.",

          "authors": "Qiu Jiangnan, Qian Wang, Xinwei Wang, Yan Li, Min Zuo, Jingxian Wang",
          "abstract": "Purpose An online knowledge community (OKC) is an important platform for people to produce and share knowledge. Many factors affecting the knowledge quality of OKC have been explored, but the feedback effect of knowledge quality has been ignored while feedback is a potentially powerful tool to enhance organizational effectiveness. This paper explores the cyclical causal feedback relationship among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality. Design/methodology/approach We drew on the Input-Mediator-Output-Input model (IMOI) to explore the cyclical causal feedback among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality, then used panel data with the editing history of 117 articles extracted from Wikipedia to test the causality among these variables via the two-step system GMM estimation method. Findings There is a positive feedback loop among knowledge heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality. Experience heterogeneity had no significant impact on interactive processes and knowledge quality, while knowledge quality in the previous stage had a significant negative feedback effect on experience heterogeneity in the next stage. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted in the context of Wikipedia. We expect that the results will generalize to other OKC platforms. Practical implications The findings could assist OKC managers in understanding the dynamic evolution of knowledge quality. Enriching members’ knowledge heterogeneity and promoting interaction are the keys to continuously improving knowledge quality. Originality/value This study extends the IMOI framework to an OKC context and finds the cyclical causal feedback relationship among group heterogeneity, interactive processes, and knowledge quality.",

          "authors": "Mayowa Joy David, Atta Addo",
          "abstract": "Purpose Developing countries are recording high cryptocurrency adoption rates surpassing more advanced economies. Considering that this is the opposite of the realities of most other technologies in these areas, this high uptake is puzzling. With a case study of crypto use for cross-border payments in the Nigerian context, this paper aims to address the paucity of empirical research on the phenomena of cryptocurrency adoption and diffusion in developing countries. We put forward a sociotechnical and empirically grounded innovation translation account of the high rates of crypto transactions in developing countries that overcome criticisms against extant arguments in the literature. Design/methodology/approach We take a case study approach and analyse the use of cryptocurrency for cross-border payments. Data collection involved two rounds of interviews with retailers from Nigeria, suppliers from China, informal exchangers, crypto brokers and mediators. We analysed themes using an approach sensitised by actor–network theory (ANT) constructs. Our methodological approach focuses on ANT’s relational dynamics to examine how human and non-human actors enable cryptocurrency adoption in a developing-country context. Findings We show evidence to suggest that crypto adoption and diffusion in developing countries occurs through an iterative process of technology transformation and appropriation, a strong coalition of the interests of diverse actors and a dynamic relationship between the technical elements of crypto and contextual political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental influences. Findings have implications for crypto-focused companies, development institutions and policymakers who increasingly show interest in the popularity of cryptocurrencies in developing countries. Originality/value This research breaks ground as a sociotechnical and empirically grounded description of the widespread use of cryptocurrencies in developing countries. The study provides an insightful approach to understanding technology adoption as a relational and context-sensitive process. Insights from the framework might be useful for addressing adoption challenges and designing inclusive financial systems in similar contexts.",

          "authors": "Yulu Sun, Qixing Qu",
          "abstract": "Purpose Seller trust plays a pivotal role in adopting and using digital technology in cross-border e-commerce (CBEC), and research has also consistently highlighted the role of trust in the interaction between humans and technology. Based on empowerment and value co-creation (VCC) theories, this study innovatively classifies VCC into four dimensions and explores how PDE influences platform trust (PT) through VCC. Design/methodology/approach To examine our proposed research model, 400 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed from sellers on CBEC platforms. Findings The empirical results reveal the mechanism by which PDE strengthens PT through VCC. Specifically, PDE significantly facilitates VCC activities between the platform and sellers and enhances the level of seller trust in the platform. The interdependence formed by VCC enhances PT, and it partially mediates the relationship between PDE and PT. Research limitations/implications This study provides theoretical support for promoting the transformation of PDE to PT through effective VCC on CBEC platforms and extends empowerment theory, VCC theory and trust field. The results provide valuable guidance for sellers to leverage PDE as a driver of win-win cooperation and development through effective VCC with the platform. Originality/value Previous research has focused on consumers’ views of e-commerce and developing practical solutions to enhance their confidence in participating in online transactions while lacking sufficient understanding of sellers’ demands on the CBEC platform. We address this gap in the literature by exploring the mechanism of how PDE influences VCC and PT from the seller’s perspective.",

          "authors": "Aishwarya Deep Shukla, Jie Mein Goh, Laksh Agarwal",
          "abstract": "Purpose Online reviews shape consumer decisions, even in healthcare, a credence service where expertise is difficult to evaluate. Like unethical retailers, some healthcare providers post fake reviews. However, the impact of fake reviews on potential patients remains unclear. Using a dataset of fake reviews, this study examines how patients perceive the helpfulness and trustworthiness of fraudulent vs genuine physician reviews. Design/methodology/approach We used an archival dataset containing a representative sample of 5,000 online physician reviews, both fake and genuine, and performed empirical analysis. In addition to the helpful votes obtained from the data, we used large language models to derive the perceived trustworthiness score. Findings Fake physician reviews are paradoxically perceived as more helpful and trustworthy than genuine reviews. To unravel the underlying mechanism, we investigated the extent of personalized and specific health information. We found that fake reviews often contain more personalized and specific health information, making them appear more credible. Research limitations/implications Results may not generalize beyond online physician reviews. Future research could extend this investigation to other contexts. Practical implications Online platforms may need to reconsider their approach to managing online reviews, address ethical concerns, and strengthen regulatory oversight in sensitive areas, particularly in healthcare. Originality/value This study highlights an ethical paradox: while patients seek detailed health information, privacy concerns limit real patients from sharing such details, creating an information gap that fake reviews exploit. This is the first study to make use of unique data that contains real fake online physician reviews.",

The ToMM empowers researchers to ask how messages deemed unhelpful, harmful, or incomplete (e.g., absent) can be disrupted, or meaningfully transformed, to make room for new messages and meanings. To this aim, we first overview 40 years of atheoretical memorable messages scholarship, before detailing recent advancements in the ToMM. Next, we offer warrants for five propositions of the ToMM, aligning with metatheoretical assumptions for an interpretive approach to memorable messages scholarship. Lastly, we discuss future directions for ToMM scholarship, including opportunities to advance qualitative approaches to communication research and approach the ToMM from alternative metatheoretical perspectives.",

          "abstract": "Positive mediated intergroup contact improves intergroup relations. By examining such effects in the foreign-language film context with varying verbal delivery methods, the study explores outgroup characters’ language accommodation to viewers as a critical mechanism. This experiment ( N = 204) investigated how different verbal delivery methods in a foreign language movie featuring Asian Americans (titled Minari ) influenced attitudes toward Asian Americans. Among native English speakers in America, watching the film with a native speaker's English dubbing (vs. foreign-accented English dubbing vs. foreign language with subtitles) led to more positive attitudes toward Asian Americans, mediated by two theory-driven mechanisms: perceived similarities and processing fluency with the target Asian American character. Results indicated that exposure to the target Asian American character in the native speaker's English dubbed (vs. subtitled) condition resulted in more perceived similarities with the character and fluent processing of the character's speech. Subsequently, these factors translated into positive evaluations of the character and Asian Americans as a group. With an emphasis on the role of language accommodation to viewers, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Words carry gender associations from cultural influences like gender stereotypes, and spoken words are affected by speakers’ vocal characteristics. Listeners’ experiences and attitudes may also shape their perceptions. This study examined how individual differences in listener demographics, experiences, and attitudes influence the impact of speakers’ perceived vocal gender on listeners’ word-gender associations. Participants heard 21 words said by speakers of different gender identities and rated gender associations with each word on a masculine-feminine scale. Rating patterns were compared to those of separate participants who rated the speakers’ genders or the same words in print. As predicted, listeners with transgender experience or positive attitudes were less influenced by vocal gender in rating word gender. Findings suggest exposure to diverse experiences can enable listeners to focus more on linguistic content than voice characteristics. Understanding these dynamics is important for addressing biases in individual cognition and broader societal communication.",

          "abstract": "Three studies developed and validated a linguistic dictionary to measure negative affective polarization in English and Spanish political texts. It captures three dimensions: negative affect, delegitimization, and political context. In the first study, two independent judges evaluated the candidate words, and reliability indicators were calculated, showing acceptable values for short texts (.572 in English, .541 in Spanish) and higher values for larger corpora (.964 in English, .957 in Spanish). The second study tested discriminant validity by comparing negative affective polarization scores in social media comments on politics and entertainment. Results showed significantly higher polarization scores in political content, confirming the dictionary's validity. The third study compared the dictionary to an existing online polarization measure, finding greater coverage and alignment with the construct. Additionally, it was observed that polarization scores were higher in texts containing hate speech compared to those where it was absent. The findings suggest that the dictionary in both languages have strong psychometric properties, making it a valuable tool for analyzing online content, particularly social media comments. It can be used as an independent measure or as input for machine and deep learning models.",

          "abstract": "This article embarks on a detailed exploration of Lisbon's evolving linguistic landscape, focusing on a specific neighborhood shaped by mass tourism and migration. Lisbon, traditionally considered a monolingual society, has experienced significant linguistic diversification due to globalization, making it an ideal context for studying how languages coexist and interact in urban spaces. Drawing from linguistic landscape research and sociolinguistic theories, this study examines how Asian immigrant communities, alongside international tourists, contribute to the city's dynamic linguistic environment. Our data collection, conducted through a combination of conversational interviews and photographic analysis, resulted in a corpus of 143 signs from a neighborhood densely populated by Asian immigrants. We show that the neighborhood's linguistic landscape is not just shaped by practical communication needs but also reflects deeper socio-cultural dynamics, such as identity preservation and economic adaptation to tourism. This research contributes to the growing field of linguistic landscapes by analyzing how immigrant languages, local languages, and global languages coexist and influence each other in Lisbon. It highlights the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in urban environments and suggests pathways for fostering greater linguistic inclusivity and intercultural dialogue in multicultural cities like Lisbon.",

          "authors": "Cixin Wang, Pingping Xu, Juan Liang, Feiran Zhang, Beilei Li",
          "abstract": "This study sought to examine whether emotional resilience mediated the relation between victimization and depression, and whether friendship (quality and quantity) and gender moderated these relations among middle school students in China. Data were collected from 765 middle school students (seventh and eighth graders, Mage = 13.14 years) from three middle schools in Beijing, China in November 2019 (T1) and November 2020 (T2). Results showed that emotional resilience at T2 mediated the relation between victimization at T1 and depressive symptoms at T2 (indirect effect = 0.10, 95% CI [0.06, 0.14]). Friendship quality at T1 moderated the relation between victimization at T1 and emotional resilience at T2 ( β = 0.16, p &lt; .05), and served as a buffer for girls, but not for boys. Friendship quantity at T1 moderated the relation between T1 victimization and T2 emotional resilience at T2 ( β = −0.09, p &lt; .05), particularly for boys. Additionally, friendship quantity at T1 moderated the relation between T1 victimization and T2 depression ( β = 0.04, p &lt; .05), especially for girls. Specifically, slope analysis showed that having more friends was protective for resilience and depression only for students who experienced lower levels of victimization, but not for those who experienced higher levels of victimization. Furthermore, the three-way interaction term between T1 friendship quality, T1 friendship quantity, and T1 victimization significantly predicted T2 emotional resilience ( β = 0.11, p &lt; .05). Our findings clarified the effect of friendship quality versus quantity for Chinese youth who experienced victimization. The findings highlighted the importance of fostering high-quality friendships and emotional resilience to support the well-being of students who experienced peer victimization.",

          "abstract": "This article analyses how the use of artificial intelligence shapes the way news gets produced and distributed, based on 143 interviews with news workers at 34 leading publishers in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. Drawing on gatekeeping theory and the concept of rationalisation, it describes and explains the use and effects of the technology in the news. Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in all parts of the gatekeeping process to drive efficiency gains, optimise processes and bring about greater effectiveness, with these effects being real but task-dependent and hard to quantify. Overall, AI reshapes and retools the production and distribution of news by providing publishers with new means in the service of achieving existing ends, rationalising the work of news organisations in the process, and pushing it more strongly towards logics of efficiency, predictability and calculability. I discuss these findings with respect to their impact on the public arena and the reconfiguration of power and control within the information ecosystem.",

This research investigates what homeopathy users believe about (a) whether and how homeopathy should be used to treat serious conditions like cancer, and (b) science and the relevance of scientific evidence regarding homeopathy. Using latent profile analysis (N = 225), we identify subgroups of homeopathy users that differ in their normative beliefs about the use of homeopathy in serious conditions: supporters of standalone use of homeopathy in serious conditions (~9%), those who are open toward standalone use (~43%), supporters of supplementary use (~35%), and supporters of both supplementary use and nonuse in serious conditions (~13%). Subgroups that supported or were open toward the standalone use of homeopathy in serious conditions held the most negative attitudes toward science. These findings are relevant for interventions aiming to prevent the risks associated with homeopathy use.",
