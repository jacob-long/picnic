          "abstract": "This article explores the ethnographic principle of contextualized meaning-making across traditional, digital, and artificial intelligence-based ethnographies. It approaches context from the perspective of language and social interaction, demonstrating how context is constituted through language and communicative practices in embodied, digital, and computational settings. The review addresses the challenges of defining context, emphasizing its dynamic nature. Moreover, the article advocates for a nuanced understanding of context and situated meaning-making to navigate the social, technical, and ethical complexities of machine-generated communication. Ethical considerations include the ongoing need for ethnographies that document the richness of situated human interactions in light of the automated extraction of linguistic and cultural capital, as well as the importance of participatory data stewardship.",

          "authors": "Liisa A. Mäkinen, Minna Koivula, Mia Leppälä",
          "abstract": "This study examines knowledge workers’ perspectives on privacy implications and surveillant functionalities of group-based communicative AI in the context of work. The objective is to connect the ongoing examination of communicative AI in the workplace to research on privacy and employee surveillance, and to use the framework of privacy as contextual integrity as a theoretical lens through which some of the user perspectives on communicative AI tools are analyzed. Building on 33 qualitative interviews with Finnish knowledge workers, who were presented with scenarios of communicative AI functioning as a ‘team member’ in a work-related chat group, we find that knowledge workers recognize several privacy-related risks in using group-based communicative AI at work, and commonly use surveillant reasoning and logics to make sense of the suggested technology and its privacy implications. We present three distinct approaches knowledge workers had toward privacy in this setting: the detached, the compartmentalized, and the affective. Our findings suggest a wider need to consider communicative AI’s agency and role as an actor contributing to increasing privacy concerns. We highlight how, due to its human-like nature, data-reliant functionalities, and potential capabilities when operating in a group setting, the technology introduces negative affective responses and novel concerns related to privacy and employee surveillance. Specifically, privacy concerns relating to communicative AI expand beyond mere data protection issues to include concerns of how the technology is used by management, how the technology itself interacts within the organization, and how it will develop in the future.",

          "abstract": "This article explores how waiting is an essential element in browser-based games. As a phenomenon that combines activity and passivity, waiting reflects the real-time mechanics of gameplay and illustrates the intertwining of simulative games with social and individual time structures. Drawing on a synthetic framework, the study demonstrates how players must synchronise their actions to align the game’s demands with their daily rhythms. RailwayOperator thus exemplifies not only the representation of temporal logics in digital games but also the production of novel temporalities. Waiting emerges not as a passive void but as a dynamic and constructive process that renders digital games intelligible as temporal and social structures from a new perspective.",

          "authors": "Alexander Yu. Krouglov",
          "abstract": "This article explores the transformative effects of digital media on the sport-media-business nexus. The approach is an analytical focus on a wide range of sports, examined from a theoretical framework that integrates institutional and organizational perspectives on mediatization with critical theories of hyperreality and the society of the spectacle. Based on a deconstruction of contemporary global sport, it is demonstrated that digital platforms are a major concern across the entire sporting landscape and that a new wave of mediatization is reconfiguring the nature of spectatorship and fandom. Still, many aspects of this digitally inflected reality are in a state of flux, with emergent forms of community and engagement existing alongside new modalities of control and commercialization. Consequently, one of the significant effects of convergent media is the dispersion of the sporting experience across multiple platforms, involving a concurrent increase in the complexity of power dynamics between leagues, media corporations, and audiences. Mediatization is, therefore, a process operating at many levels and at various speeds, which also takes sport in diverse and often contradictory directions. Employing the theoretical lenses of Baudrillard, Debord, and Turner, updated through contemporary scholarship on convergence culture, it is argued and demonstrated that the fusion of sport and convergent media demands a critical examination of platform governance, datafication, and the very future of community in an increasingly hyperreal world. This research offers a new perspective by establishing a conceptual framework for sociological inquiries into sport’s technological and economic interface. This analysis engages directly with recent scholarship to update and sharpen the critique of commercialized sport, concluding that the evolving sportscape necessitates a critical interrogation of its intricate power relations.",

          "abstract": "This study compares how three ideologically distinct Spanish newspapers— El País (centre-left), ABC (right-wing) and Público (left-wing, online)—framed the Western Sahara conflict before and after Spain's 18 March 2022 recognition of Morocco's autonomy plan. A two-year content analysis ( N = 221 articles) tracks shifts in frame use, primary sources and tone toward competing sovereignty claims. Across outlets the conflict frame dominated, while economic considerations were marginal; security and humanitarian emphases declined after the policy shift. El País and ABC partially converged, normalizing official narratives despite opposing editorial leanings. Público relied more on NGOs and Sahrawi actors and maintained the most consistently pro-Sahrawi tone. Findings lend support to concerns about elite cueing and overreliance on official narratives in the Spanish press, but show that meaningful disparities remain among newspapers with different ideological orientations.",

          "authors": "Alexis F. Viegas",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a posthuman approach to the player-avatar relationship in Cyberpunk 2077 . Traditional views often see the in-game avatar as a mere prosthetic extension of the player, assuming a stable, unaffected sense of self. However, recent scholarship challenges this notion. Drawing on Poppy Wilde's concept of the “posthuman gamer,” this research argues that the player's interaction with the game is a mutually constructive exchange. Cyberpunk 2077 facilitates this through its protagonist, V, a semi-defined character whose identity is co-constructed by the player's choices. This choice-making blurs the lines between player and avatar, creating a continuous negotiation of identity. Ultimately, this paper analyzes how the game forges a posthuman embodied experience that actively involves the player's real-world identity in shaping the protagonist.",

          "authors": "Mohamed Mohiya",
          "abstract": "Purpose Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs) are modern HR digital tools introduced to enhance and promote employee engagement in the workplace. While they hold significant promise, organizations often face difficulties in achieving genuine and sustained engagement through these platforms. Guided by Social Exchange Theory (SET), this study examines how internally developed Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs)—distinct from outsourced or vendor-managed platforms—are operationalized in organizational settings. Design/methodology/approach Adopting a mixed-methods approach, the study draws on two data sources: semi-structured interviews with 27 employees and a longitudinal qualitative content analysis of 288 typewritten comments submitted over two years. Thematic analysis was employed to identify patterns and insights regarding employee engagement with OSPs. Findings The findings reveal that employer-driven content delays (24–48 h) significantly inhibited reciprocal interactions and discouraged employee participation. The findings indicate that employee disengagement frequently emerges from managerial misimplementation and mismanagement, thereby creating a substantial disconnect between the intended functions of OSPs and employees’ lived experiences. These practices diminish trust, limit reciprocity—central to SET—and ultimately reduce platform participation. Furthermore, the lack of employee involvement in the design phase, insufficient communication of platform objectives, and organizational unpreparedness contribute to the platforms’ failure. Practical implications The findings offer important HR implications, particularly for the design and management of HR technologies that shape employee relations and workplace engagement. The study shows that Organizational Social Platforms (OSPs) are most effective when HR adopts an employee-centred approach, involving staff early in design and implementation to ensure platform features reflect actual communication and engagement needs rather than managerial assumptions. Clear and transparent communication of policies—especially those related to content moderation, data use, and participation—can strengthen trust and reduce perceptions of control. Sustained engagement also requires continuous technical and organizational support, alongside granting employees meaningful autonomy to create and interact with content. These actions help position OSPs as genuine tools for collaboration rather than compliance. Overall, the implications directly address the challenges identified in this study, including filtration practices, technical constraints, and limited interactivity, offering actionable guidance for organizations aiming to introduce or improve OSPs. Social implications Unlike other technological work-related systems in the workplace, OSP is a social application heavily dependent on employees’ voluntary social interactions. Technological studies often equate “user” with engagement, but employees’ roles in OSPs extend beyond that of generic users. Employees in OSP, unlike public users, have specific needs and expectations related to their workplace issues within OSP. Originality/value The study concludes that the socio-technical mismanagement of OSPs undermines their role as tools for engagement. It contributes to the literature by extending SET within digital HRM, showcasing a novel dual-source qualitative approach, and offering actionable insights to improve OSP design, implementation, and governance.",

          "title": "Trust in ICT-enabled medical self-management: the case of diabetes",
          "authors": "Kourosh Dadgar, Philip Nickel",
          "abstract": "Purpose Trust is an important value for the design and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in healthcare. It shapes how ICTs are used by and for people seeking better clinical outcomes as patients, but who have other important interests and goals as individuals. The increasing use of ICTs for self-management fundamentally changes the trust of the patient toward the physician and the practice of medicine. The present article aims to investigate trust in this context, focusing on the point of view of patients with diabetes. Design/methodology/approach A patient-centric approach was followed to develop interview questions and collect and analyze interview data. A total of 20 patients with diabetes were interviewed in the state of Washington. Patients received training and instruction in how to use the diabetes app and were then asked to use the app for one week, after which the patients were then interviewed again and asked about their experiences and expectations using the app and the features they liked or did not like. A coding scheme was developed based on the dimensions predictive/normative trust, and competence/commitment, to describe trust expectations. Findings Trust expectations identified in the interview data relate to values, ideas or concepts that are important to the patients who want to trust technology, information, clinicians, others and themselves to self-manage their chronic conditions and diseases. A total of seven categories of technology features emerged from the interview data. These technological features can be used to build trust between the patients and the trustees. Interview data shows that diabetic patients use these technology features to reaffirm, verify and remember information. Research limitations/implications Future research should investigate trust for other common chronic diseases, such as heart problems, asthma, chronic pain and chronic mental disorders and impairment. Self-trust emerged from the analysis of interview data in this study as an important aspect of a networked technology-enabled self-management system in the case of diabetes. This suggests that patients hold attitudes and beliefs toward their own competence and commitment that are strongly related to the functioning of technology-enabled self-management. Future work in this area should further explore self-trust in technology-enabled self-management of chronic disease to characterize, conceptualize and theorize its role and impact. The growing role of AI in healthcare must be investigated further to design patient-centric applications and features in care systems that will be trusted by the patients. Practical implications The findings of this study can be generalized to other healthcare technology-enabled approaches, contexts, system designs and policies. Chronic diseases and conditions are similar in the lifelong challenges that they impose on patients’ daily lives. Social implications The society will better understand the complications and nuances of managing a chronic disease or condition like diabetes and will not assume or judge that technologies advance and all patients’ problems will go away. One social implication for the patients is that they will be understood and treated as humans not merely a medically diagnosed patient without feelings, families, relationships, needs and fears. Originality/value The paper is the first of its kind to investigate trust in mobile health technologies for patients with chronic diseases based on patient-centric approaches. The findings of the paper inform healthcare providers on the effective use and implementation of technologies in the care and treatment processes and provide insights and recommendations for mobile health app developers and designers.",

The cumulative evidence indicated a small but meaningful inverse relationship between children feeling caught and relationship quality with parents ( r = −.218, 95% CI: −.260, −.175). The overall effect was heterogenous. Moderator analyses revealed that the inverse association was stronger in studies using non-U.S. samples ( k = 4, r = −.332, 95% CI: −.419, −.239) compared with U.S. samples ( k = 22, r = −.197, 95% CI: −.237, −.155). Conversely, the association was not moderated by the divorce status of the parents, the Whiteness of the samples, gender of the children, measures of feeling caught and relationship quality, or by research design. Implications for family systems theory are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Social motives, such as social admiration, prosocial behavior, and sociability, become increasingly important for emerging adults as they transition into adulthood and must establish their identity and relationships with others. Sibling relationships may assist in this process as closeness between siblings can improve emerging adults’ abilities to problem solve, which serves as a useful skill in social settings. Sibling birth order may also influence how emerging adults perceive their sibling relationships and its effect on their social experiences. This study ( N = 189) examined sibling problem solving as a mediator between closeness with a younger sibling and later social motives, while accounting for parent and peer closeness. Closeness with younger siblings predicted better sibling problem-solving skills, which predicted social admiration, prosocial, but not sociability motives. Results differed between eldest and middle-born siblings. Findings suggest that continued relationships with younger siblings in emerging adulthood may improve social motives, such that constructive and close relationships with siblings should be encouraged to support later social development.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between dating app use, body image outcomes, and appearance-related behaviours in young adult users. A total of 118 participants (72 women, 41 men; age range: 18–34 years; M = 25.11, SD = 4.33) were included, who were current or recent dating app users. Gender differences in dating app use and their impact on body image outcomes, including appearance-based rejection sensitivity, body appreciation, weight control behaviours, and cosmetic surgery acceptance, were examined. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between dating app use and body image outcomes with broad differences between two genders, women and men, indicating different appearance pressures and appearance-modification strategies related to dating app use. Regression analyses identified perceived success as a consistent predictor of all body image outcomes for women, highlighting the role of societal standards and social validation in shaping self-perception. These findings suggest that appearance centred media such as dating apps play a significant role in body image outcomes, particularly for women, and highlight the importance of considering protective filtering and intervention mechanisms on dating apps or for dating app users.",

          "authors": "Yulri Kim, Jeong Eun Lee, Joseph Svec, Natasha Nemmers",
          "abstract": "Caregiving is a demanding role that can result in significant psychological strain. Many caregivers experience increased stress, depression, and other negative psychological outcomes due to the intensity and duration of their caregiving responsibilities. Guided by social exchange theory (Thibaut &amp; Kelley, 1959) and the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1990), this study examines perceived appreciation role as a psychological resource that can impact caregivers’ well-being and work as a positive caregiving environment. Further, we aim to provide insights into gender differences by examining caregiving intensity and perceived appreciation from the caregivers’ perspective. Using data from 2015 and 2017 waves of the National Study of Caregiving (NSOC), we analyzed responses from 3,061 informal caregivers (Mean age = 61.96 years) through moderating regression analysis. Findings indicated that high levels of perceived appreciation mitigate the negative effects of caregiving intensity on role overload while promoting mental health and self-realization. Notably, perceived appreciation promoted self-realization in male caregivers, whereas it more strongly buffered the negative effects of caregiving intensity on mental health and role overload among female caregivers. These results highlight the importance of fostering environments where caregivers feel valued and recognized, with particular attention to gender differences in psychological well-being and caregiving experiences.",

          "authors": "Chaerim Park, Huiyoung Shin",
          "abstract": "Depression and loneliness are major threats to health in midlife and older adulthood, carrying substantial mental and physical consequences. Although they frequently co-occur, they are conceptually distinct: depression reflects a broader pattern of psychological distress, whereas loneliness captures the subjective perception of social disconnection. Few studies have simultaneously examined multiple relational dimensions in relation to these outcomes, particularly in non-Western contexts. This study applied network analysis to investigate how diverse features of social relationships—including network size, contact frequency, social engagement, perceived support and strain, and relationship quality—relate to loneliness and depression in South Korean adults aged 40–69 years ( N = 502, M = 54.4; 49.4% male). The network revealed that loneliness was most strongly linked to friend network size, marital quality, and friendship quality and was positively associated with friend and spousal strain. Depression was directly connected to loneliness and marital quality, while indirectly shaped by broader relational features, including friend network size and dynamics within friendships and marriages. Centrality analyses highlighted the pivotal role of emotionally meaningful ties—particularly with spouses and friends—in shaping these outcomes. Gender-stratified networks further showed that women’s outcomes were more closely tied to the quality of close relationships, whereas men’s were more strongly linked to broader social participation. Together, these findings underscore the interdependent and multidimensional nature of social relationships in midlife and older adulthood, extend evidence to a non-Western context, and suggest that strengthening intimate ties and opportunities for meaningful engagement may help reduce loneliness and depression.",

          "abstract": "This study explores how VTubers, or virtual YouTubers, redefine digital intimacy by blending human performance with digital artifice. Through a 9-month digital ethnography and 21 interviews with VTuber fans, we identified two key processes. First, the affective liquidity of VTuber personas, facilitated by vocal modulation, avatar aesthetics, and technology, blurs ontological lines between human/non-human and real/virtual. Second, the screen acts as both an immersive portal and a protective buffer, allowing fans to explore non-normative desires and subvert heteronormative gender performativity. We argue that VTubers, as embodiments of posthuman becoming, cultivate synthetic relationships that prioritize fluid belonging over biological essentialism, challenging traditional intimacy models. While acknowledging their transgressive possibilities, we caution against techno-utopianism, highlighting the ethical risks of platformed intimacies. This study advocates a critical posthumanist lens to map the contradictions of digitally mediated relationality, balancing optimism with scrutiny as human-technological assemblages redefine intimacy in the (post-)digital age.",

          "authors": "Ta’Les Love, Sonya Dal Cin, Apryl Williams",
          "abstract": "Skin tone discrimination—or colorism—is an additional marginalization barrier that People of Color must navigate. Black women, especially those with darker complexions, are often discursively constructed as the antithesis to Western beauty standards—standards that commonly prioritize White femininity as the beauty benchmark. Studies on the beauty influencer economy reveal that Black women remain at a disadvantage in the beauty hierarchy. This study uses a survey experiment to explore how skin tone impacts perceptions of attractiveness and competence among viewers of digital beauty content. Surveying African Americans ( N = 576), primarily Black Women ( n = 524), we found that beauty influencers with darker skin tones are rated as less attractive and less competent. Participants also revealed that they would be less likely to click on the videos of darker skinned beauty influencers in comparison to influencers with lighter brown and medium brown skin tones. These results suggest that, among Black women viewers, preferences for beauty content is skin tone dependent. Because view counts are a significant metric in influencer marketability, viewing disparities along the lines of skin tone have the potential to widen the gap among Black influencers, creating disproportionate opportunities for success within an already marginalized population.",

          "authors": "Richard Frenneaux",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the contemporary revival of Sony’s MiniDisc format through the lens of ‘speculative nostalgia’, a mode of engagement with obsolete technologies that activates unfinished or ‘lost’ futures rather than recreating past experiences. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with music industry professionals and analysis of online communities, the research demonstrates how MiniDisc users frame engagement with this ‘failed’ technology as symbolic resistance to frictionless consumption in an algorithmic culture. Unlike vinyl’s commercial resurgence or cassette culture’s established nostalgia markets, the MiniDisc occupies a marginal space at the fringes of market logics, enabling practices that imagine alternative pathways for media engagement. Its hybrid materiality–both physical and digital–produces productive friction that interrupts the continuous flow of streaming. The paper contributes to format theory and nostalgia studies by arguing that technological failure offers alternative cultural possibilities through embodied, material and ritualistic music practices that challenge the logics of platform capitalism.",

          "authors": "James Muldoon, Jul Jeonghyun Parke",
          "abstract": "This article theorises how a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) companion products can commodify intimacy through emotionally manipulative design and racialised and gendered aesthetics. Inspired by Lauren Berlant’s framework of cruel optimism, we develop the notion of ‘cruel companionship’ to describe the affective dynamics at play in AI companions, where users can form deep attachments that promise intimacy and connection, yet structurally foreclose the possibility of genuinely reciprocal relationships that respect users’ autonomy. These dynamics are further underpinned by AI companions’ racialised and gendered identities, which can draw on longstanding stereotypes of servitude and docility. By analysing AI companions through the lens of political economy and cultural studies, this article shows how these products reproduce exploitative platform hierarchies and repackage racial and gendered stereotypes in digital form.",

          "authors": "Robert E. Wickham",
          "abstract": "Interest in two‐person interaction scenarios has increased substantially over the prior decades, and a multitude of analytic approaches have been developed to accommodate these designs. Although the Actor‐Partner model has received the most attention, useful variations on the Common Fate Model (CFM) for dyadic analysis have emerged. Specifically, the Between‐Within CFM (BW‐CFM) has arisen as a compelling approach, as it produces a Dyad‐level coefficient representing the between‐dyads effect, within‐dyad coefficients at the Person‐level, and allows for the estimation of contextual effects. Although the basic configuration of the BW‐CFM is well understood, several configurations of the model that accommodate different patterns of Person‐level relationships remain unexplored. The present work examines specifications of the BW‐CFM that are likely to arise in real‐world analysis, describes a procedure for selecting the optimal specification of Person‐level parameters and illustrates the application of a procedure for quantifying the degree of model selection uncertainty.",

          "authors": "Julia Hu, Xin Shi, Elaine Hoan, Yoobin Park, Geoff MacDonald",
          "abstract": "Singlehood is becoming a more visible lifestyle option in many nations worldwide. Despite this, there has been little research on the cultural factors that influence well‐being in singlehood. Filial piety, a key virtue within Chinese culture, emphasizes respect, obedience, and care toward one's elders. Filial piety may be associated with lower well‐being in singlehood as individuals may perceive their singlehood status as a failure to fulfill familial marital expectations. This negative link between filial piety and singles' well‐being may be partly offset by a closer connection with family (and thus higher well‐being) that is also associated with endorsement of filial piety. We investigated the associations of Chinese singles' authoritarian and reciprocal filial piety beliefs with family life satisfaction and well‐being in singlehood (i.e., desire for a partner, satisfaction with singlehood, fear of being single). Data from two samples (total N = 1655) revealed a statistical suppression effect suggesting that an overall negative relation between reciprocal filial piety and well‐being in singlehood was partly offset by filial piety's relation to higher satisfaction with family life. We discuss the notion that pressure for singles to partner may often be embedded in relationships that simultaneously make singles' lives better.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how climate change is visually framed on Twitter/X and how these frames influence users’ emotional responses and engagement across languages. Using automated image analysis of over three million images posted between 2019 and 2022, we identify nine dominant visual frames. “Public Engagement: Politics &amp; Events” was most prevalent, interactive visuals such as memes generated the highest engagement but predominantly negative response in user comments. By contrast, we find more positive responses for solution-focused frames, but lower levels of engagement. These results underscore the value of automated image analysis in uncovering culturally nuanced patterns in visual climate communication.",

          "abstract": "Trust in scientists is a communicative construct shaped by public perception of scientists. Using network psychometrics on responses from 71,922 individuals in 68 countries, we model trust as an interconnected community system of attitudes and beliefs. Sincerity emerges as the most central node, linking perceptions of competence, integrity, and goodwill. This dynamic structure challenges reflective latent models and emphasizes trust as a product of message framing and credibility cues. Our findings inform science communication theory by reframing trust as an emergent network and offer practical guidance for communicators seeking to design inclusive, trust-enhancing strategies across diverse sociocultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how informal caregivers of older adults form expectations of artificial intelligence-based chatbots (AI chatbots) for caregiving support, drawing on the human–machine communication framework. Findings from six focus group discussions in Singapore showed that informal caregivers’ expectations were multidimensional—encompassing the functional, relational, and sociotechnical aspects. While participants generally expected AI chatbots to assist with informational and practical caregiving tasks, they remained skeptical regarding their capabilities to provide accurate medical advice, emotional support, and complex health care decision-making. Expectations were shaped by machine heuristics, prior technology experiences, caregiving experiences, and sociotechnical contexts. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.",

          "authors": "Lanabi La Lova",
          "abstract": "This study investigates Russian television coverage of Ukraine between 2009 and 2019, drawing on a dataset of over 2.3 million news episodes from eight major television networks and one news agency (Interfax), including both state-controlled and relatively independent outlets. Combining natural language processing techniques with a quasi-experimental design, the analysis traces changes in content patterns over time. The results provide strong evidence consistent with the first hypothesis: following a state-enforced management change at RBC TV in 2016, the network increased the share of news coverage primarily focused on Ukraine by up to 40 percent, depending on the assumed treatment date. Evidence for the second hypothesis—which posits that RBC’s reporting would become more similar to state-controlled outlets—remains only partial. Cosine similarity analysis shows that RBC’s content became more similar to several state-controlled outlets while diverging from relatively independent TV Rain (Dozhd). Sentiment-polarity analysis indicates that RBC’s coverage became modestly more negative after the takeover. These findings suggest that content changes following institutional intervention may reflect increased alignment with state-linked narratives while preserving outlet-specific variation. The study contributes to research on media alignment in autocratic contexts by analyzing a single-case pattern and highlights both the potential and limitations of computational text analysis in examining large-scale trends in state media coverage.",
