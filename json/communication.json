          "authors": "Jiyoung Lee, Jiyoun Suk",
          "abstract": "In the current media landscape, misinformation has evolved into a multimodal challenge, presenting misinformation through various modalities simultaneously, particularly through text and visuals. Despite increasing scholarly attention to visual misinformation, as one type of multimodal misinformation, there is a lack of a unified theoretical framework for understanding the cognitive processes involved in how people process visual misinformation and become susceptible to it. In this paper, we introduce a psychological processing model—the Visual Misinformation Processing Model (VMPM)—to bridge this gap. This model outlines four key cognitive stages: (1) encountering visual misinformation; (2) allocating attention to visuals; (3) engaging in dominant processing of visuals alongside text; and (4) becoming persuaded by misinformation. We discuss the current state of research on visual misinformation and suggest directions for future research.",

          "authors": "Qian Huang, Jing Zeng, Hiromi Tanaka, Saif Shahin",
          "abstract": "This special issue explores the complex dynamics of digital visibility negotiation in Asian contexts. Emerging scholarship on this topic reveals how users strategically negotiate their visibility online. However, we still need to broaden the scope of our knowledge, especially outside Western contexts, in order to advance our theoretical understanding of such negotiations. Asian societies and communities, with their distinctive platform political economies and socio-cultural landscapes, offer rich yet underexplored contexts for advancing visibility theories beyond Western-centric frameworks. Responding to Brighenti’s call to treat visibility as an interdisciplinary social scientific category, this special issue presents 19 articles organized into four thematic clusters that analyze visibility practices across Asian communities and diasporic spaces. By centering Asian case studies and perspectives, we illustrate how visibility negotiations in Asian contexts can inform broader theoretical understandings of digital visibility negotiation practices and the power dynamics that shape them.",

          "abstract": "The paper discusses who are the voices in the opinion pieces on #MeToo in the Portuguese mainstream press. It starts from the idea that opinion spaces are fundamental for conveying different points of view in society and for strengthening democratisation and gender justice. It reflects on existing hierarchies and calls for the importance of a ‘place of speech’ that can bring the voices of women and feminists to the centre of the discussion about harassment and sexual violence. This analysis helps to refocus attention on the sphere of media production.",

While social media connects people across distances, enabling global discourse and expanding the reach of public conversations, physical proximity continues to play a key role in translating awareness and collective opinion into tangible action. The analysis adapts Tarde's framework to contemporary communication contexts, offering a refined understanding of how proximity influences the flow from conversation to action in increasingly interconnected communication landscapes.",

          "abstract": "This article contends that gender mainstreaming in today's world constitutes a wager for all societies at the crossroads of democracy, technology and justice where multiple crises are experienced. At the same time, gender mainstreaming can be seen as the cornerstone of a possible cultural and political shift, to strengthen and revive democracy, in vision and in practice; it can be mobilised as a democratic innovation. Different actors, institutional and from civil society, have recently called for renewed efforts in mainstreaming gender in digital developments and governance. The paper assumes those calls as a basis from which to critically interrogate European regulation of AI through the dual lens of gender equality and mainstreaming. Could gender mainstreaming constitute a transformative principle in EU normative interventions for the digital age? And what research agenda may contribute to guiding the transformation towards renewed democratic visions and practices?",

          "authors": "Jacqueline Burgess, Elina Roinoti, Alexander Muscat, Anthony Grace, Christian Jones",
          "abstract": "This article compares small (19 employees or fewer) video game developers’ commercial and creative mindsets in three marginal video game industries, Australia, New Zealand, and Greece, to understand how these industries differ. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 62 participants across the three countries and analysed using thematic analysis. Despite all three national industries’ marginal status, there were similarities and clear differences in how the participant developers approached video game production. In particular, the lack of institutional support available for the Greek industry resulted in developers utilising networks and reputation. The research highlights how marginal, national video game industries cannot be simply grouped together because the developers within them display differences, as a result of their industry contexts, which influence and impact their video game development. These findings have implications for support from governments and education.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores consumer experiences shaped by digital technologies, focusing on the evolving concept of “phygital” or hybrid experiences arising from the integration of virtual and physical elements. It specifically investigates the challenges of reconciling performers’ virtual immersion with the physical experiences of crowds at esports tournaments. Design/methodology/approach Using a triadic lens involving producers, performers and audiences, the study employs a comprehensive methodological approach. It combines ethnographic and netnographic data, in-depth interviews and archival data to provide a holistic understanding of the phygital experience. Findings The findings uncover the complexities of value creation and destruction in social phygital experiences. It identifies key strategies employed by producers to mediate these experiences, such as amplifying, bridging, restricting and transposing. These strategies are essential in managing the divergent expectations of performers and audiences, ensuring a cohesive and engaging experience. The findings offer a framework for understanding and managing conflicting expectations in phygital settings. Research limitations/implications Data collection focused primarily on Western esports tournaments. Future research could explore how cultural factors influence the dynamics of social phygital experiences. Practical implications The study provides actionable insights for live performance producers and marketers in esports and other industries, emphasising the need for strategic planning to balance virtual immersion with physical engagement. It highlights opportunities to leverage sensory technologies and atmospheric management to enhance phygital experiences. Originality/value This research advances the conceptualisation of phygital experiences by introducing the notion of social phygitality and demonstrating the importance of triadic management in co-located hybrid events.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Does telecommuting enhance employees’ self-leadership and thereby facilitate thriving at work? By drawing on the socially embedded model of thriving at work, we aimed to explore the interactive effect of telecommuting and perceived visionary leadership on thriving at work through the lens of self-leadership. Design/methodology/approach Two-wave survey data were collected from a sample of 230 Chinese workers. Hierarchical linear regressions were performed to test our hypotheses. Findings The results suggested that telecommuting increases employees’ thriving at work through self-leadership when receiving a high level of visionary leadership but decreases their thriving at work through self-leadership when receiving a low level of visionary leadership. Research limitations/implications By integrating leadership research with studies on telecommuting, this study not only provides a new perspective to the literature on telecommuting but also helps teleworkers overcome the challenges they face, supporting the broad application of telecommuting technologies. Practical implications As telecommuting becomes increasingly prevalent in the workplace, we provide managers with insights on how to effectively manage and engage with employees in telecommuting environments. This helps them develop strategies to sustain employee productivity and maximize the benefits of implementing teleworking. Originality/value Beyond the traditional technostress perspective within the information systems field, we offer a leadership perspective on the effects of telecommuting on employees. Specifically, our findings indicate that the impact of telecommuting on self-leadership and subsequently thriving at work – whether it is beneficial or detrimental – depends on the presence of perceived visionary leadership.",

          "abstract": "Sexuality is central to well-being in many romantic relationships. Equity theory suggests that perceiving equal contributions within the relationship—presumably also within the sexual relationship—is associated with better outcomes, while a perceived imbalance may lead to distress or dissatisfaction. The current research examines whether equity of received and provided partner contributions to sexual self-esteem, as perceived by men and women, is associated with sexual satisfaction and sexual function for both partners. We conducted Dyadic Response Surface Analyses using data from 327 mixed-gender couples. Our results indicate that perceiving high, but not necessarily similar (i.e., equitable) levels of partner contributions to sexual self-esteem are associated with greater sexual satisfaction and function of both partners. When analyzing the subscales of partner contributions to sexual self-esteem, i.e. partner contributions to sexual self-worth and sexual self-efficacy, separately, we found a broad equity effect between received and provided sexual self-worth and sexual satisfaction for both partners. This means, that equality in received and provided sexual self-worth is associated with higher sexual satisfaction compared to when inequality is perceived. Additionally, perceived overbenefit in partner contributions to sexual self-efficacy in men was linked to lower sexual function in men. Our findings have implications for research and practice and suggest that gendered sexual scripts should be considered alongside equity theory when conducting research on sexual health in couples.",

          "abstract": "In response to growing concerns about the early age at which children receive smartphones, this study examines the factors influencing parents’ decisions on when and why to allow their children access to these devices. A total of 642 parents from a region in the Basque Country (northern Spain) participated in an open-ended survey. The sample was diverse in terms of gender, child age (2–16 years, M = 9.26), and place of residence. While 26.9% had purchased a smartphone for their child, most either allowed shared use (65.3%) or restricted access entirely (7.7%). The data were analyzed using the Reinert method via Iramuteq software. Five key thematic categories emerged: the desire for children to be part of peer groups, social pressure perceived by parents, enabling children’s autonomy in public spaces, facilitating local communication practices, and exercising parental control. These findings reveal how smartphone-related decisions are shaped by community norms, safety concerns, and evolving definitions of childhood independence. The study highlights the importance of culturally responsive resources that support diverse parenting approaches without prescribing universal rules about the “right” age for smartphone ownership.",

          "abstract": "Singlehood is often described as a binary: some single people struggle, while other singles thrive. Yet, single people likely experience challenging and beneficial aspects of singlehood simultaneously. We used qualitative approaches to provide insight about how single people navigate aspects of singlehood that are challenging and aspects that offer opportunities to thrive. Eleven single adults took part in 30–45-minute semi-structured interviews. Single participants were of diverse ages and ethnic backgrounds, represented a gender balanced sample, and reported diverse relationship histories ranging from never coupled to divorced. Using reflexive thematic analyses, we identified three themes that reflected broader complexities about navigating singlehood challenges and benefits: (I) whether and when should single people invest in singlehood, (II) balancing the tension between singlehood facilitating autonomy versus romantic relationships facilitating deep emotional connection, and (III) how to respond to feelings or experiences of societal pressure to partner that encourages romantic coupling. These findings shed light on how single people manage mixed feelings about singlehood and romantic coupling.",

We examine the relationship between feedback on comments, hate speech presence, and commenter types, with analysis of news comments during the 2022 South Korean presidential election campaigns. The data include 25 million comments, analyzed with a deep learning hate speech detection model. It was found that positive feedback encourages more commenting for non-hateful content, and negative feedback reduces subsequent non-hateful comments. However, surprisingly, negative feedback was found to rather increase the frequency of hateful comments, particularly among light commenters. Implications of the findings are discussed.",

          "authors": "Guy Itzchakov, Niv Navon, Jarret T. Crawford, Netta Weinstein, Kenneth G. DeMarree",
          "abstract": "Conversations with people who hold opposite partisan attitudes can elicit defensiveness, reinforce extreme attitudes, and undermine relationships with those with opposing views. However, this might not be the case when speakers experience high-quality (attentive, understanding, and non-judgmental) listening from their conversation partners. We hypothesized that high-quality listening would increase speakers’ positive views toward, and their willingness to further interact with, others who hold politically opposed attitudes, and that these effects would be mediated by greater state openness. We conducted three experiments using different modalities to manipulate listening. In Study 1 (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 379), participants recalled a conversation with an opposing political party member, with listening quality described as high-quality, low-quality, or control. Study 2 (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 269) used imagined interactions, with participants reading vignettes describing either high-quality listening or a control condition. In Study 3 (preregistered; &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 741), participants watched a video of a listener modeling high-quality or moderate-quality listening and imagined themselves engaging in a similar interaction. Across studies, we found that high-quality listening consistently increased speakers’ state openness to politically opposed others but did not change political attitudes. We found inconsistent evidence for speakers’ increased willingness to engage in future interactions (meta-analytic effect: = 0.20, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.015). However, we observed a consistent indirect effect of listening on positive attitudes and willingness for future interactions through increased openness.",

          "authors": "Simon M. Luebke, Nadezhda Ozornina, Mario Haim, Jörg Haßler",
          "abstract": "Climate change is a major political challenge affecting millions of people worldwide. Journalists—while following media logic—have a strong responsibility to inform the public of the scientific evidence on the causes and consequences of climate change and to explain the motivations driving the climate policies under discussion. However, within hybrid media systems, journalists increasingly compete for attention with climate stakeholders, who tend to follow a political logic in climate communication and bypass journalism to share their perspectives on climate change. Despite this dynamic, the extent to which the climate communication of media organizations and stakeholders diverges in terms of content and focus remains largely unexplored, as does whether their topics and communication styles show signs of convergence. This article addresses these gaps by comparing how journalistic media and climate stakeholders communicate about climate change on social media and by examining the user engagement their content creates. We conducted a manual quantitative content analysis of visual posts about climate change published by media organizations and climate stakeholders in Germany on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube during the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,050). The results deepen our understanding of the national climate discourse in Germany and show that journalistic content in climate communication adheres strongly to media logic, presenting climate change in a more event-oriented, personalized, and negative manner. However, climate stakeholders’ communication is characterized by political logic, using strategic framing and focusing less on current climate events.",

          "abstract": "Amid growing ecological threats to wildlife, organizations are increasingly exploring multimedia solutions to spur action. One such strategy involves enabling audiences to embody threatened wildlife (animal embodiment) via augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). Despite AR/VR’s capacity to visualize threats onto one’s virtual body, little is understood about how these platforms differ in their uses and effects. Thus, A field study was conducted at a music festival where attendees ( N = 99) evaluated custom-designed AR and VR games enabling animal embodiment. Results showed clear modality preferences for the AR game, though both AR and VR elicited high levels of connection, or body transfer (BT), with the animal body. BT also predicted pro-environmental behavior intentions, though this effect was strongest for direct (donations, volunteering) rather than indirect actions (social media advocacy). Results yield insight into the requirements for BT with animal bodies and establish support for animal embodiment as a viable environmental communications strategy.",

I ask: How do cultural transitions and intercultural encounters influence people’s perceptions of their algorithms? How do key issues regarding algorithmic production get translated and reinterpreted? Based on 50 semi-structured interviews with Israelis who immigrated to Silicon Valley, I show that their interpretation of the cultural differences between Israeli and Silicon Valley cultures—and their culturally specific logic of difference —informs how they perceive the algorithms they develop and their ethical implications. I argue that these perceptions stem from deep-seated cultural tropes but are also potentially ameliorated by their encounter with Silicon Valley’s culture. Thus, this article calls for a more diverse view of Silicon Valley’s ideologies, showing that attention to cross-cultural encounters can both reveal and complicate the performative logics sustaining Silicon Valley’s liberal image.",

This study ( n = 293) explores the association of OnlyFans usage—including viewing and interaction—with different types of satisfaction: sexual self-esteem, relational satisfaction with sexual partners, and sexual satisfaction. The study also examined the role of upward comparisons (e.g. comparing oneself to performers, comparing sexual partners to performers, and comparing one’s sex life to depicted performances) in these dynamics. Contrary to expectations based on previous pornography research, the data revealed a positive relationship between OnlyFans use and satisfaction through upward comparisons. The findings suggest that OnlyFans use was associated with upward comparisons with content creators, which in turn may relate to increased sexual knowledge, skill development, and inspiration.",

          "abstract": "Although there are studies that have investigated how urban women negotiate sexual intimacy, pleasure, and positions, how rural women negotiate sexual intimacy remains understudied. In an attempt to contribute to scholarship on African women's sexual experiences, this article examines how Bette‐Obudu women in northern Cross River State, southeastern Nigeria, negotiate sexual intimacy with their partners in romantic relationships. The ethnographic data were generated through nine‐month fieldwork exercises in five selected Bette‐Obudu communities from 20 participants who were purposively selected for this study. The women's nuanced narratives were analyzed using the conceptual lens of pragmatic context, which stipulates that contextual meaning is interpreted through shared knowledge and social conventions. The study shows that heterosexual Bette women, though constrained by cultural norms, deploy diverse communicative strategies to negotiate sexual intimacy and pleasure with their partners. Through critical linguistic analysis of the sampled women's narratives, this article deconstructs the notion of homogenization of rural women's sexuality and concludes that rural women can (re)negotiate and (re)construct their sexuality as well as redefine their passive sexual roles under conditions of patriarchal dominance and inequality.",

In Study 2, participants ( N = 148) evaluated up to four best friendships 7 weeks apart and indicated whether their best friends had entered romantic relationships during this period. People recalled experiencing a decrease in friendship need fulfillment and increases in uncertainty and negative affect after a best friend started a romantic relationship (Study 1); however, people did not perceive those unique changes when reporting on best friendships before and after their friend entered a romantic relationship (Study 2). Greater relationship‐specific attachment anxiety and avoidance also amplified perceived friendship changes and negative affect when reporting retrospectively (Study 1) but not when reporting prospectively (Study 2).

          "abstract": "Although the consequences of parental divorce for specific family relationships are increasingly studied, its impact on the broader family network, including relationships with and between parents, children, and grandparents, remains unexplored. This study aims to unravel how three‐generational, bilateral contact patterns manifest in the larger family network and how they differ when families experience parental divorce. 4,411 families from the multi‐actor Divorce in Flanders data with 1–5 family members (one child, father, mother, and paternal and maternal grandparents) reporting on contact with 1–7 family members are analyzed using a Social Relations Model. Results show that mothers have less frequent contact with paternal grandparents than with maternal grandparents, while fathers have less frequent contact with maternal grandparents than with paternal grandparents, revealing a clear fault line. This gap is even wider in divorced families. Mothers have more contact with maternal grandparents compared to fathers with paternal grandparents, and fathers do not have more contact with maternal grandparents than mothers with paternal grandparents. Less frequent contact with paternal (maternal) grandparents coexists with more frequent contact with maternal (paternal) grandparents, indicating substitution, which is stronger for children in divorced families.",

          "authors": "Soohee Choi, Meng Chen, Zhuo Guo",
          "abstract": "This meta-analysis examines the effectiveness of narrative versus statistical evidence in environmental communication. Narrative evidence significantly enhances risk perception and behavioral intention, while statistical evidence plays a more conditional role in shaping attitudes. Moderator analyses reveal that video-based messages enhance the impact of narratives on risk perception, while locally framed statistical messages strengthen their effect on attitude. Longer messages are more effective at influencing behavioral outcomes than shorter ones. Explicit statistical messages enhance risk perception and intention, while non-explicit narratives remain effective. These findings highlight the importance of integrating narrative and statistical evidence in environmental communication campaigns.",

          "title": "Social Media Influencers as “Dirty Workers”: An Explorative Study on How They Use Strategies to Reduce the Moral Taint",
          "authors": "Claudia Gerhards",
          "abstract": "Since social media influencers have become popular and monetize their content with the help of advertising deals, they have been associated with morally questionable, deceptive behavior. The list of misconduct is long. It includes, for example, not disclosing sponsored content, withholding negative experiences with promoted products, buying fake followers, and promoting false ideals of beauty. Building on the concept of “dirty work” as a theoretical framework, this article asks which strategies influencers use to soften this moral taint. Qualitative interviews with influencers living in Germany show that they are aware of their negative image in public and use various stigma management strategies. This article offers a perspective that has not yet played a role in the ethics debate about influencers. It asks how influencers, who are often associated with morally questionable practices, immunize themselves against this negative image and find a positive work identity.",

          "authors": "Yueming Luo, Yu-Leung Ng",
          "abstract": "Sharing memes has emerged as a prevalent form of social grooming behavior on digital platforms, yet research has largely focused on the content of internet memes rather than the behavior of sharing them. This study explores whether sharing memes with different humor styles (affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating humor styles) relates to subjective well-being through the mediating roles of online bonding and bridging social capital. Using survey data from a representative sample of 1000 participants in the United States, the findings showed that affiliative and aggressive meme-sharing were positively associated with psychological well-being and positive feelings via enhanced online bonding social capital. The findings could contribute to a deeper understanding of social and psychological implications of engaging with memes in online communication.",

          "title": "From #MelaninMansion to #BlackTikTokStrike: Black TikTok, Joy, and the Politics of Refusal",
          "authors": "Elena Maris, Mel Monier",
          "abstract": "In this article, we critically analyze TikTok videos related to the #MelaninMansion trend and the #BlackTikTokStrike. Videos analyzed were posted during the hashtags’ peak engagement, 2019–2020, and the summer of 2021, respectively. Drawing from Black cyberfeminism and literatures on Black cyberculture, platform politics, visibility, affect, resistance, refusal, and copyright, we identified shared themes and thematic differences between the hashtags. Based on these findings, we argue #MelaninMansion and #BlackTikTokStrike illustrate two significant moments on TikTok for Black creators, and a marked change in their tactical and affective response to on-platform racism, appropriation, and content theft. We contend the messaging and imaginings found in the videos reveal Black TikTok’s negative experiences on-platform and their understanding of potential technological and policy solutions. We especially note the affective change during the strike, where Black TikTok creators turn from humorous utopian imaginings of on-platform equity and celebrations of Blackness and community, to frustrated refusal of on-platform labor and pessimistic reflections on the (im)possibilities for Black content creation. Despite the sharp turn in tactics and expectations, content from both moments reflects a commitment to Black joy and intracommunity support. We argue our findings reveal how the TikTok platform and non-Black TikTok community together create a toxic technoculture rife with the violence of racism, cultural appropriation, and creative theft. Finally, we note the centrality of Black women to these viral moments, how #BlackTikTokStrike especially centered Black women’s labor and creativity, and that despite this, Black women performed an outsized amount of labor during the strike.",

          "title": "Softblocking: Disconnective Practices, Imagined Affordances, and Reciprocity on Twitter",
          "authors": "Caitlin Hogan",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the social meaning of softblocking, a practice on social media in which a user blocks and then immediately unblocks another user, causing a mutual unfollowing. This study finds that softblocking highlights that social media users exercise agency in creating imagined affordances through novel use of pre-installed features to do social work. It also discusses what the rise of softblocking suggests about the demand for reciprocity within social media interaction. With a corpus of 96,541 tweets mentioning softblocking from 2009 to 2020 and corpus-assisted discourse analysis, this study explores (1) how softblocking is differentiated from pre-packaged affordances, (2) how softblocking is negotiated metadiscursively, and (3) how expectations of reciprocity are addressed by softblocking. I find that users expect sustained interaction and value-sharing with those they are in mutual following relationships with and also expect these relationships to be broken reciprocally. This study argues that softblocking meets the demand for disconnective action in a mutual manner, in line with emerging norms of politeness on social media that see reciprocity as politeness.",

          "title": "Doing the Lord’s Work: Deconstructing Fundamentalist Christianity Through Cathartic Anti-Fandom on Reddit",
          "authors": "Caitlin E. Lawson, Cecilia R. Hafferty",
          "abstract": "r/fundiesnarkuncensored is a Reddit community that monitors and critiques fundamentalist Christian, namely evangelical, content creators. Many members of the community were formerly conservative Christians who have since deconstructed some or all of their beliefs. This study approaches “fundie snarkers,” particularly those who have deconstructed, through the lenses of anti-fandom and affect theory, to deepen our understanding of anti-fandom as a simultaneously ideological and affective phenomenon. Through individual, semi-structured interviews with 20 members of r/fundiesnarkuncensored, we explore the role that “fundie snarking” plays in members’ deconstruction journeys and vice versa. Participants organized content on the subreddit into three categories based on their affective and intellectual responses to that content: petty snark, or superficial critiques that participants find both guiltily pleasurable and frustratingly rude; structural snark, or systemic critiques of fundamentalism that participants universally esteem; and dark snark, or content that participants find too distressing to engage. Taken together, this “structure of snark” reveals the ambiguity of their anti-fandom by emphasizing that participants have empathy for the fundies they criticize and see the subreddit’s ideal purpose as a tool for deconstruction. Ultimately, through our discussion of the gratifications participants obtain through their engagement with the subreddit, we propose an additional form of anti-fandom: cathartic anti-fandom. Cathartic anti-fandom involves the dislike and critique of ideologies, practices, and communities in which the anti-fan formerly participated and/or by which they were harmed. By filtering fundamentalist Christian teaching through critical commentary and making these ideologies laughable, r/fundiesnarkuncensored provides an accessible and enjoyable space for members to unlearn harmful ideologies.",

          "authors": "Yu Li",
          "abstract": "Lettering styles mimicking the brushstrokes of Chinese calligraphy, known collectively as the ‘chop suey’ letterform, have featured prominently in the construction of visual Chineseness in global linguistic landscapes. This study examines and critiques the worldwide circulation of the chop suey letterform as a form of cultural hegemony. Drawing on visual data from both commercial and cultural domains, it reveals how the lettering style serves to manufacture and maintain representations of Chineseness that exoticize, otherize, and commodify the Chinese culture, serving the interest of a global power structure with Whiteness at its center. The analysis focuses on two mechanisms through which cultural hegemony functions: the dominant group dictates cultural norms, and cultural norms reinforce themselves and the power structure. The author argues that homogenization and commodification of the Chinese ethnocultural identity through the chop suey letterform not only reinforce a narrow, biased, and monolithic view of what it means to be Chinese, but also, by instituting marketable and consumable stereotypes, sideline and diminish opportunities to engage with more nuanced and complex articulations of the Chinese culture in non-Chinese societies.",
