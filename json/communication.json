          "authors": "Kirsten Pool",
          "abstract": "Traumatic events, such as car accidents, interpersonal violence, and natural disasters, can create a sense of horror, fear, helplessness, and/or threaten people’s well-being (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022). The chaos that ensues from a traumatic event can disrupt the functioning of a person’s romantic relationship and create an environment ripe for relational uncertainty. As a result, many scholarly questions arise about the connections among relational uncertainty, communication, and trauma. However, a guide for determining the theoretical lens best suited for explorations of the aforementioned questions remains to be explicated. To fill this gap, I employ a critical narrative review of the literature to identify, evaluate, and critique the uncertainty theories most advantageous for investigating relational uncertainty among couples navigating the aftermath of traumatic events.",

          "authors": "Andreas Hepp",
          "abstract": "This article aims to foster the systematic integration of “digital futures” into media and communication research. The concept of “digital futures” encompasses all imaginations of possible futures that envision a social world in which, first, digital media and their infrastructures play a constitutive role in constructing sociality, and second, these media are seen as primary drivers of societal transformation. A scientific engagement with digital futures should be integral to a media and communication research approach focused on “emergence.” This requires broadening our perspective on media-related transformations, which have predominantly been characterized through a focus on “consequences.” To date, research has largely focused on the effects and impacts of established media and their infrastructures. However, by expanding our view to include emergence, we inevitably confront questions about the future—an essential dimension of human agency, inherently tied to our capacity to project possible futures.",

          "authors": "Kateryna Kasianenko",
          "abstract": "Studies of public communication in digitally networked spaces have increasingly adopted the notion of practice to make sense of patterned doings in such spaces. They have identified and theorized about practices ranging from highly mundane and intimate doings to more collective and organized instances of grassroots platform governance to doings likely to result in harm. Despite this, it remains unclear how doings in networked publics must look, what properties they must have, who needs to engage in them, and for how long, to be considered practices. By synthesizing insights from practice theory and interdisciplinary Internet studies, I develop a model of practices in digital publics and outline interrelated elements of such sustained doings—action, language, materiality, collectivity, knowledge, and normativity. This model can enable future empirical studies to define, identify, and differentiate practices more systematically within and across digitally networked spaces and consider their broader impact on digital citizenship.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces the Dynamic Intermediary Model (D[X]IM) to address how knowledge processes have evolved with digital platforms by shifting from a dyadic to a triadic communication model of content flow with a potential intermediary. This intermediary, which can be a journalist, influencer, artificial agent, or another platform actor, provides services to the source and recipient of a message, thereby transforming traditional direct communication. It aims to better understand information diffusion in the networked public sphere by recognizing the intermediary’s role in altering source-recipient dynamics. The D[X]IM applies across different communication levels (macro, meso, and micro) and is designed for empirical research using diverse methodologies. It focuses on single instances of platform communication to explore the impact of intermediated communication. The article concludes with a research agenda and examples of how D[X]IM can be applied in empirical research.",

          "authors": "André Jansson, Stina Bengtsson, Karin Fast, Johan Lindell",
          "abstract": "Whereas media reliance is one of the classical concepts in media and communication studies, this article argues that deep mediatization imposes a renewed relevance of the term, as well as a need to develop a more nuanced framework for studying its social implications. Traditionally, media reliance was used to explain how people develop a citizen identity. Today, while connective media, datafication and AI have transformed what it means to be reliant on media, the very concept is marginalized and theoretically under-developed. Against this backdrop, the article starts out from an overview of how media reliance, and related terms, have been utilized in media research and then develops an analytical framework that accounts for different social modes and realms of media reliance. The matrix is implemented to crystallize blind spots in the research field and to highlight new types of questions that different research strands could address in times of pervasive connectivity.",

          "authors": "Abby Youran Qin, Fan Xiao, Linjie Dai",
          "abstract": "In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has intensified its propaganda efforts beyond the Great Firewall, aiming to ‘tell China’s story well’ to global audiences. Meanwhile, many YouTube influencers have emerged to tell the opposite kind of stories – anti-CCP conspiracy theories – which have attracted millions of Chinese-speaking viewers both inside and outside China. Drawing on Habermas’s theory of communicative action, this study combines social network analysis and critical discourse analysis to examine the networks and narratives of these conspiratorial actors. We identified a strategically coordinated Falun Gong group, a tightly knitted Whistle-blower Movement block, and a loosely connected residual of political dissidents. Through critical discourse analysis of seven central channels, we illustrate how anti-CCP conspiracy theorists legitimize their extraordinary claims by (1) leaping from basic facts to morally embellished informative fictions and (2) making reassuring doomsday predictions that dissipate revolutionary potential. We show how anti-CCP conspiracy theorists exploit progressive ideals for strategic purposes, complicating the notion of dissent while demonstrating that the dichotomy of ‘authoritarianism versus anti-authoritarianism’ is inadequate for capturing the complexities of the transnational Chinese-language media ecology today.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on digital media and well-being showed that the impact of media technologies on users largely depends on specific usage characteristics, context, and individual user factors. This research report explores the existence of distinct user profiles in virtual reality (VR), using an existing dataset and applying latent class analysis. The results point to the existence of three classes: two of them primarily include VR game users, who differ in the intensity of their psychological engagement (sense of presence) during gameplay, and a third class that includes users of social VR platforms, who report a relatively very high level of engagement with these platforms. The three groups differ in symptoms of addiction to the technology. These results provide valuable proof of concept for the usefulness of identifying usage profiles as a way to reveal how the relationship between VR and well-being might vary across different usage situations.",

          "abstract": "Social media activities do not occur in isolation, and it is possible that the well-being effects of an initial activity modify the effects of a subsequent one. This article examines this possibility by focusing on a specific, theoretically grounded sequence of social media activities: engaging with one’s own profile self-presentation (i.e., a self-affirmational activity) followed by browsing a superior peer’s profile (i.e., an activity eliciting upward social comparison). Two pre-registered experiments were conducted. Study 1 confirmed that both reviewing and crafting one’s own Instagram self-presentation provided self-affirmational benefits, reducing participants’ defensiveness and inducing positive affect. Study 2 showed that becoming self-affirmed by engaging with one’s own Instagram self-presentation diminished feelings of envy resulting from browsing a superior peer’s self-presentation. By conceptualizing and empirically testing the interdependence of social media activities, this research offers a framework for examining how sequences of social media activities jointly shape users’ psychological experiences.",

          "authors": "Isaac Vaghefi",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the temporary discontinuance of social media. Building on stimulus-response binding and priming mechanisms, we propose a research model illustrating how compulsive social media use–through hedonic consumption, social interaction and content sharing–shapes temporary discontinuance. We argue that compulsive use can be modulated by cognition-based priming effects (cognitive dissonance and attitudes toward discontinuance) and affect-based priming effects (somatic and self-evaluative mood states), with exposure to cues (e.g. social media apps on smartphones) acting as a potential moderator. Design/methodology/approach We tested our model through a field study and quantitative analysis of Facebook users who voluntarily took a break from the platform. An objective assessment of participants’ temporary discontinuance was used to validate the model. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze relationships between compulsive social media use, priming effects and discontinuance behaviors. Findings The results indicate that compulsive social media use can both directly and indirectly influence temporary discontinuance. Cognition-based priming (cognitive dissonance and attitudes) and affect-based priming (mood states) significantly shape discontinuance behavior, while exposure to cues moderates these relationships. The findings highlight the complex mechanisms underlying social media disengagement. Originality/value This study extends discontinuance behavior research in information systems (IS) by identifying priming effects as key mechanisms influencing temporary disengagement. The findings offer practical insights for users seeking to manage social media use, service providers designing interventions and policymakers addressing digital well-being.",

          "authors": "Fei Xiang, Chuanchuan Wu, Ting Cao, Guanyu Chen, Hong Wu",
          "abstract": "Purpose Women with gynecological illnesses frequently utilize Online Health Communities (OHCs) to share experiences and seek online consultations. However, the disclosure of sensitive health information heightens privacy risks. This study, grounded in the Multidimensional Development Theory (MDT), Communication Privacy Management Theory (CPM) and research on privacy fatigue (PF), developed a theoretical model to elucidate the factors that influence women's willingness to disclose reproductive health information in OHCs. Design/methodology/approach A total of 417 valid surveys were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to determine the impact of independent variable on information disclosure, the mediating role of PF and the moderating role of perceived industry regulation effectiveness. Additionally, a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was conducted to explore the multi-configurational pathways of information disclosure. Findings This study found that self-ego-related variables, such as disease stigmatization, positively influenced privacy concerns (PC) and disclosure willingness. PF positively influenced disclosure willingness and partially mediated the relationship between PC and information disclosure. Perceived industry regulation effectiveness negatively moderated the impact of PF on information disclosure and played a dual role. Four antecedent configurations were identified that influence women's willingness to disclose reproductive health information in OHCs. Originality/value This study advances the integration of MDT and CPM by incorporating PF to explain women's disclosure of reproductive health information in OHCs. By conceptualizing PF as boundary exhaustion, it extends CPM, while the application of fsQCA uncovers multiple causal configurations, thereby enhancing the explanatory capacity of MDT. This study offers both significant theoretical and practical contributions.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The prominence of online social networks (OSNs) has made them ideal platforms for viral marketing. Otome games efficiently use OSNs for viral campaigns, making them a valuable case for studying viral marketing strategies. This study identified key elements of viral marketing posts to inform the operational strategies of commercial accounts. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed China's sizable otome game market using operational behavioral data from the top five games, compiled into the OtomeVM dataset. Following the knowledge discovery in databases framework, this study identified key characteristics of the top 25% most viral posts and proposed the ViralGD model, a multimodal machine learning model for virality prediction. The model's decision logic was further interpreted through a global surrogate method to ensure transparency. Findings This study identified lottery mechanisms as significant predictors of post virality, with optimal performance observed for content combining short videos of 180 s or less and long-text descriptions of 175 characters or more. Commercial social media accounts often produced emotionally homogeneous content, with emotions having minimal impact on the viral spread of their posts. Originality/value This study is the first to apply large-scale real-world data and data mining to uncover overlooked patterns in viral marketing, offering theoretical insights into defining virality and refining campaign design. Practically, the iterative application of the ViralGD model uncovers high-impact features that boost content diffusion, effectively guiding operators in selecting optimal improvements.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Gamification is a valuable educational tool. However, research indicates that while gamified learning systems cater to users' gaming motivations, they may induce maladaptive usage. Integrating the gamification affordances-psychological outcomes-behavioral outcomes paradigm and goal orientation theory, this study examines maladaptive goal orientation processes and their unintended psychological and behavioral impacts. Design/methodology/approach We tested the model through a scenario-based approach in the context of Duolingo, which is a leading and highly influential mobile language learning application. Data from 100 forum users who discussed score-boosting strategies were collected via online questionnaires and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings Gamification affordances include instruction design (i.e. instant individualistic feedback and instant competitive feedback) and interface design (i.e. multisensory interaction). Results reveal that, compared to instant individualistic feedback, instant competitive feedback is more likely to foster maladaptive psychological outcomes, namely, competence feeling and focused attention on game goals. Multisensory interaction shows no significant effect on competence feeling, whereas it exerts a significant impact on focused attention on game goals. Competence feeling, rather than focused attention on game goals, contributes to maladaptive behaviors within the gamified system. Originality/value This study is among the first to highlight maladaptive goal orientation in gamified learning. It distinguishes types of instant feedback and their effects, emphasizes the role of multisensory interaction and reveals how game objectives may override educational goals. The findings extend gamification theory and provide practical insights for designing learning systems that mitigate maladaptive outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Enterprise social media (ESM) application in knowledge management is critical for individuals and organizations. However, there is limited empirical evidence regarding how ESM enhances individual knowledge management capability or whether prior experience affects the value derived from ESM. This study aims to understand the intricate relationships among ESM affordance, employees’ meta-knowledge, prior usage experience and knowledge management capability. Design/methodology/approach This study constructs an integrated framework based on the technology affordance perspective and meta-knowledge theory. It was validated through a two-stage survey, yielding 322 usable responses. Findings The affordance of ESM has a positive influence on individual meta-knowledge, which, in turn, enhances knowledge management capabilities. Additionally, visibility has a direct impact on meta-knowledge. Furthermore, prior experience significantly moderates the relationship between ESM affordance and meta-knowledge. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the literature by offering a strategy for conducting theory-driven research on how ESM enhances individuals’ knowledge management capability from an affordance perspective. This study develops a framework by integrating ESM affordance and meta-knowledge, and offers a nuanced perspective that considers who knows what and who knows whom as individual meta-knowledge concepts. Practical implications The impact of ESM affordance on knowledge management capability is expected to enhance individual knowledge management skills.

The field study confirmed these findings and further revealed that the need for human interaction moderates both the relationship between AI robot gratitude expression and OBSE, and the indirect effect of AI robot gratitude expression on change-oriented OCB via OBSE. Practical implications Our findings suggest that expressing gratitude via AI robots is beneficial.

          "authors": "Xining Liao",
          "abstract": "Abstract: The present study explores how moral and threat language in news media influences public opinion within the context of the US–China relationship. Drawing on Moral Foundations Theory and Intergroup Threat Theory, I employed a computational approach combining the dictionary method with Large Language Models to identify moral and threat language in coverage of China by six major US news outlets from 2005 to 2022. I then analyzed the relationship between distinct types of moral and threat language and longitudinal polling data on Americans’ attitudes toward China. The results reveal a unified pattern: both liberal- and conservative-leaning outlets employed more binding than individualizing moral language, and emphasized realistic threats over symbolic threats when covering China. However, it is symbolic threat language that more strongly correlates with negative attitudes toward China. Furthermore, realistic threat language only predicted negative attitudes when accompanied by sufficient levels of moral language, with this relationship intensifying as moral language increased. The findings offer insights into the moral and threat dimensions of foreign news and public opinion towards foreign countries, highlighting a critical and complex interplay between these elements in a global context.",

The current study examines the types of moral intuition exemplars most commonly found in AI-generated narratives. Using randomized prompts that specified different types of narratives (quality-level, genre, medium, target audience, and intended response), ChatGPT-4o was instructed to create ten thousand stories, which were coded for the presence of the five moral intuitions from Moral Foundations Theory. Results show that higher-quality stories were more likely to include moral intuitions that were upheld rather than vioated. Likewise, the upholdings/violations of each moral intuition varied when prompted to create stories for different genres, mediums, and target audiences. The degree to which AI-generated stories reflect the intuition exemplars prominent in the media landscape in general and for audiences across moral subcultures is discussed.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: The care/harm moral foundation is a key antecedent of health behavior change, and care-based moral appeals, persuasive messages that integrate the care/harm foundation with specific health behaviors, have demonstrated effectiveness in health promotion campaigns. However, the role of care-based moral appeals within pictorial warnings (PWs), a widely implemented tobacco control strategy, remains understudied. Moreover, little is known about how smokers from diverse sociocultural backgrounds respond to the same type of care-based moral appeals, particularly in countries that have yet to adopt PWs on cigarette packaging. To address these gaps, this study reports secondary analyses of two randomized multi-message experiments using real-world tobacco control campaign messages ( K US  = 319, K China  = 510) among American and Chinese smokers ( N US  = 1,392, N China  = 2,306). Each participant viewed six PWs randomly selected from a large stimulus pool and rated their perceived message effectiveness, yielding 22,188 total observations. Cross-classified multilevel regression analyses revealed that smokers in both countries perceived shocking care appeals as more effective than non-shocking care appeals and other PWs that did not employ care-based moral appeals. Non-shocking care appeals were also rated more effective than the control category. Significant cross-level two-way interactions emerged between message features (shocking care appeals) and respondents’ care/harm foundation endorsement, as well as between country and care/harm foundation. The three-way interaction was non-significant. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of care-based moral appeals in tobacco control campaigns and contribute to theoretical inquiries in message effects research from global and comparative perspectives",

          "abstract": "Abstract: People regularly receive algorithm-based recommendations (e.g., in social media and online shopping). Today, such algorithmic recommendations cover a wider range of applications, such as finding recipes that match an individual’s needs and food preferences. To give better-fitting recommendations, algorithms incorporate large amounts of personal information about the individual, which raises the issue of privacy concerns. When are people willing to share such information that can then be considered by algorithms? While previous research has indicated that perceived benefits of platform use and provider trustworthiness influence whether people are willing to disclose personal information, these studies often have two major limitations: they are either survey-based – thus, not allowing causal conclusions – or lack realistic usage (i.e., rely on vignettes). Thus, in the present experimental study ( N = 329), we manipulated provider trustworthiness and asked participants about their willingness to disclose information directly after interacting with an algorithm-based system for recipe recommendations. Results indicate that higher perceived benefits and provider trustworthiness are related to more willingness to disclose information. However, these effects are independent of each other. Thus, the present research suggests that provider trustworthiness causally leads to a higher willingness to share information and high benefits do not compensate for low provider trustworthiness.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: In this study, we examine how readers perceive the credibility of polarizing news purportedly written by a machine. In particular, we study whether a machine attribution can decrease the polarization inflicted by the self-confirmation bias. To that end, we expect that attitude-confirming polarizing news is perceived as less credible when attributed to a machine than when attributed to a human author. We assume this is due to the lower source credibility of machines and less emotional involvement. In a preregistered online experiment, we presented N = 508 participants with a polarizing news article attributed either to a human author or a machine. The article also either confirmed or disconfirmed participants’ attitudes towards the polarizing issue. Our results show that participants did not differentiate between human and machine-attributed news. Moreover, we found no evidence that machine-attributed news affected the self-confirmation bias. However, we found that, while machine authors were perceived equally competent as human authors, they were perceived as less trustworthy. In addition, we found that the machine attribution induced less emotional involvement in terms of experienced enthusiasm but not experienced anger.",

          "abstract": "Marriage is a fundamental right and personal choice for all people. However, societal attitudes present significant challenges for women with disabilities when contemplating marriage. This paper explores the experiences of Northern Vietnamese women with physical disabilities who faced opposition from their partners’ families regarding marriage. It draws on a qualitative study that explored the lived experiences of women with physical disabilities regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and maternal healthcare conducted in 2018. A two-staged in-depth interview was utilised. Initially, 29 women were interviewed, with 27 follow-up interviews conducted. Data was thematically analysed using Braun and Clarke’s approach (2013, 2019). Two key themes, with five subthemes, emerged: “marriage denied: gendered and ableist exclusion” and “marriage opposition: stigma and discrimination”. Findings underscore the pervasive influence of Vietnamese socio-cultural norms on the marital prospects of women with physical disabilities. Gender roles ascribed to wives, daughters-in-law, and mothers, coupled with ableist assumption and social stigma surrounding disability pose significant barriers to their marriages. These findings enhance understanding of the intersection of gender and disability, with implications for developing policies and programs that go beyond focusing solely on these factors, prioritise dismantling ableist and gender norms, and challenge negative perceptions of women with disabilities as “unworthy” of marriage.",

          "authors": "Arístides A. Vara-Horna, Zaida B. Asencios-Gonzalez, Noelia Rodríguez-Espartal",
          "abstract": "This study examines the often-overlooked health consequences experienced by women who provide informal support to survivors of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) in their communities. In contrast, extensive research has documented the physical and psychological impacts of violence on survivors; far less attention has been paid to the invisible costs borne by supporters—neighbors, friends, coworkers, or relatives—who are repeatedly exposed to traumatic disclosures and the demands of caregiving. Grounded in the complementary frameworks of Secondary Traumatic Stress, Vicarious Trauma, Compassion Fatigue, and Allostatic Load, this study conceptualizes the “cost of caring” as the cumulative psychological and physiological burden of informal caregiving. Unlike previous research that has focused mainly on professional providers, our analysis highlights the experiences of women embedded in gendered, community-based care networks. A two-phase cross-sectional probabilistic household survey design was implemented in two South American countries with a high prevalence of IPVAW. The exploratory phase was conducted in a high-incidence district in Peru ( n = 507), followed by a confirmatory phase using a nationally representative sample in Ecuador ( n = 2,501). Standardized instruments measured support intensity, emotional and physical morbidity, and personal victimization. Multivariate analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and violence-related covariates, showed that women providing support to IPVAW survivors reported significantly higher levels of emotional morbidity (β = .075–.083) and physical morbidity (β = .038–.058), even after adjusting for their own experiences of violence. Findings reveal a robust and statistically significant association between informal caregiving and increased health burden, underscoring that the impacts of violence extend beyond survivors to those who sustain them. By making these hidden costs visible, this study contributes to both the social support literature and the IPVAW field, reframing community-level caregiving as a critical public health issue. Although causal inference is limited by the cross-sectional design, the consistency of results across two countries strengthens the external validity and global relevance of the phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the role of media in risk communication during crises by comparing two theoretical perspectives. The first paradigm views media as a determining factor, while the second sees media as a mediator. The study analyzes two survey data sets: cross-sectional data on nuclear waste issues from eight regions (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom; N = 8,591) and longitudinal panel data on the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong ( N = 920). Results consistently support the the greater explanatory power of the first paradigm. Individuals’ willingness to adopt preventive measures highly depends on the media-constructed risks.",

          "authors": "Chuanlin Ning",
          "abstract": "On May 5, 2022, a food blogger named Yishiji (一食纪) with over 700,000 followers on the Chinese social media platform Bilibili, posted a farewell video expressing his struggles as a gay man and his lack of attachment to the world. Shortly thereafter, it was confirmed that he had died by suicide, sparking widespread discussion across social media. Over three years later, his self-obituary continues to foster significant engagement, leading to a unique digital mourning space. Drawing on theories of obituary and digital mourning, this study analyzes the digital mourning spaces generated by self-obituaries on social media platforms through a case study of Yishiji. Employing multimodal discourse analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation thematic analysis, the research identifies four key features characterizing this emergent digital mourning space: sustained spatial content production; precise spatio-temporal dialogue, notably through the danmu feature; functional zoning of semi-open spaces; and its profound capacity to facilitate self-communication and connection among mourners. The study argues that such digital mourning spaces formed by self-obituaries are not merely extensions of traditional physical mourning rituals; rather, they constitute a novel democratic memorial institution co-constructed by the deceased’s obituary, user-generated content, and the platform’s algorithmic logic. This research enhances our understanding of how digital platforms transform mourning practices. It emphasizes the potential of digital mourning spaces to foster inclusive environments for expression and connection, providing valuable insights into the evolving nature of grief in the digital age.",

          "abstract": "This article interprets the Stealth Slavery Sticker Campaign, a grassroots counter-mapping project led by the artist-activist collective Slavers of New York, as a chapter in the broader Living Black Atlas. Started during the racial reckoning of 2020, the campaign placed unauthorized stickers on street signs and other surfaces across Brooklyn to reveal suppressed histories of slavery embedded in commemorative place names. The stickers transformed daily encounters with taken-for-granted road names into unexpected opportunities to confront prominent historical families who profited from enslavement and to acknowledge the contributions of enslaved Africans in shaping the city. The collective framed their campaign as a “guerrilla educational” action that disrupted memorial landscapes, challenged discourses of white innocence, and provoked broader conversations about racial justice and accountability. At a time when official institutions are increasingly retreating from confronting racism, small, temporary interventions, such as these Stealth Stickers, can play a crucial role in encouraging critical audits of commemorative infrastructures, layering counter-narratives onto public spaces, fostering embodied confrontation with historical truths, and remaking everyday places through bold, unexpected acts of resistance.",

          "abstract": "Co-present smartphone use—the use of smartphones in the presence of others—is a prevalent behavior in social contexts. However, the situational mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. While previous research has primarily conceptualized co-present smartphone use as a stable individual disposition and focused on person-level determinants, the role of specific situational characteristics has remained largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, the present study investigates co-present smartphone use from a situational perspective, aiming to gain insights into the situational predictors of co-present smartphone use. We conducted an experience sampling study with 87 participants, reporting on 829 social interactions to examine how co-present use is linked to different types of connection cues (technical, spatial, and mental). The findings show that a person's smartphone use during an interaction is related to the smartphone use of others present and the number of notifications received.",

          "authors": "Tom Divon, Tobias Ebbrecht-Hartmann",
          "abstract": "TikTok has become a space where playfulness is the dominant lingo for engaging with serious subjects. On the platform, the Holocaust is mediated through meme-based performances like the #POVHolocaustChallenge, a trend that invited users to re-enact fictionalized memories of Holocaust victims. Our analysis of 250 videos identifies 3 types of Holocaust-related memetic narratives—mem(e)ories: (1) Testimonial Mem(e)ory, where “victims” testify from “heaven” as confessional storytelling; (2) Punitive Mem(e)ory, where “victims” choose to be sent back to the Holocaust as punishment; and (3) Escapist Mem(e)ory, where “victims” time travel from the 1940s to the present for a brief escape. Drawing on interviews with 15 creators and 7 Holocaust institution representatives, we argue that #POV challenges re-mediate past events, transform into education, and serve as a means for forging personal connections to the Holocaust. We introduce TikTok’s affordance of playability as a structural condition that governs participation, with users merging performative storytelling with remix culture and inscribing Holocaust (post)memory into their platformed experiences.",

          "abstract": "This study explores how digital humor functions as a form of critique in contexts where overt dissent is constrained. Focusing on memes shared by members of a Facebook support group for Israeli reservist soldiers’ wives during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the study analyzes how humor helps negotiate personal and collective tensions. Using thematic and critical discourse analysis, we identify four spheres of critique—targeting spouses, social circles, institutions, and broader expectations. These memes convey frustration and resistance not through direct confrontation, but via irony and satire, allowing women to express grievances while remaining aligned with hegemonic national narratives. We conceptualize this as quasi-political expression, where personal complaints, framed humorously, subtly challenge and reinforce dominant discourses. By introducing this concept, the study highlights how individuals in ideologically constrained settings use digital culture not only to resist or reproduce power, but to navigate the blurred boundaries between personal and political life.",

          "abstract": "We are now living in a platform society, where platforms are widely acknowledged to exert significant control over users. But how can user agency exert power to influence the platform? To explore this question, the study conducts in-depth interviews with 21 Xiaohongshu users and analyzes their imagined affordances of this Chinese UGC platform. It finds that users creatively engage with and repurpose the platform based on their imagination, thereby transforming Xiaohongshu from a “developer-envisioned platform” into four distinct forms of the “platform in actual use.” These user agency-driven practices serve as ways of reshaping the platform’s meanings, functions, and values. By centering user agency, this research may offer platform studies a new perspective on power dynamics, shifting the current focus away from the dominance of platforms.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how digital affinity groups construct collective identity in the context of the TikTok ban in the United States, which led to a large-scale migration of American users to the Chinese social media platform REDNOTE (Little Red Book). Using Collins’ Interaction Ritual Chains theory as a framework, we conducted participant observation, content analysis, and computational textual analysis of over 1000 high-engagement posts and 9000 comments under the #TikTokRefugee hashtag on REDNOTE. Our findings show that platform algorithms facilitate virtual co-presence and help form symbolic boundaries between American and Chinese users. Through shared experiences, emotional exchanges, and multimodal interactions (such as bilingual memes and cultural symbols), users developed a sense of group belonging and constructed a new “TikTok Refugee” identity. The study reveals a dynamic process of confrontation and integration: while users express resistance to the ban and reinforce group solidarity, they also engage in cross-cultural dialogue and adapt their identities. These results highlight the dual role of platform algorithms and emotional energy in shaping digital communities, offering new insights into how online platforms mediate identity formation in transnational contexts.",

          "abstract": "This study analyzes how short-video platforms, with Douyin as a case, depend on cultural intermediaries (e.g. multi-channel networks and digital marketing agencies) to sustain operations and expand platform power. Unlike existing studies that exaggerate or underestimate cultural intermediaries’ agency, this study offers a middle-ground perspective and conceptualizes it as “infrastructural intermediation,” in which cultural intermediaries act as external dispositifs of platform power in cultural production. Using participant observation and interviews with intermediaries and creators, we identify three primary infrastructural functions: (1) visualizing: converting data into actionable guidance for platform strategy implementation; (2) reinforcing: optimizing creators’ practices to advance monetization; and (3) repairing: remedying deficiencies in technical and institutional mechanisms. As an indispensable component of the platform, they reinforce platformization structures, complete the “last mile” of platform power implementation. This study also reveals how China’s distinctive state-platform relationship shapes the role and strategies of cultural intermediaries.",

          "abstract": "This research examines whether language styles in U.S. health news relate to scientificness. Study 1 uses human ratings to train machine learning models that classify sentences as scientific or nonscientific. A text mining approach predicts the proportion of scientific sentences, on the basis of language features. Two style categories emerge: one reflecting ideal professional standards of science journalism (hedging, neutrality, objectivity) and another linked to science complexity (low readability, complexity, formality). Study 2 then tests whether perceptions of these six features influence perceived scientificness and intended outcomes through message experiments.",

          "authors": "Waqas Ejaz, Mary Sanford, Richard Fletcher",
          "abstract": "Despite the importance of climate news in shaping public engagement, little is known about how different types of media – mainstream and non-mainstream – relate to pro-climate behaviour, and what psychological processes condition these effects, particularly in cross-national contexts. This study addresses that gap by examining the emotional and evaluative mechanisms linking climate news use to pro-climate behavioural intentions (e.g., using less energy at home, flying less often, and repairing rather than replacing), and how these relationships vary across countries. Drawing on online survey data from 8,541 respondents across eight countries – Brazil, France, Germany, India, Japan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, and the United States – we test a multi-group structural equation model with climate anxiety as a mediator and media trust as a moderator. Results show that mainstream news use is consistently associated with stronger behavioural intent across all countries. Non-mainstream media use has positive but more context-dependent effects, especially in settings where digital platforms dominate climate information. Climate anxiety emerges as a robust and universal predictor of behavioural intention, though it is not consistently shaped by media use – indicating that emotional responses may stem from sources beyond the news. Media trust amplifies the direct effects of mainstream news use but does not moderate the indirect pathway via anxiety. Overall, the findings reveal a surprising degree of cross-national consistency in how news use, media trust, and emotional responses shape climate engagement.",

          "abstract": "Laura Mulvey’s ‘Visual pleasure and narrative cinema’ (1975) is the most widely cited, heavily anthologized and endlessly summarized essay in Film Studies. It is a foundational text that frames mainstream narrative cinema as a type of discourse that disseminates patriarchal ideology. Rather than summarize the essay again or repeat the many critiques developed by other scholars, this essay presents a line-by-line commentary on Mulvey’s interpretation of visual features in Josef von Sternberg’s films presented in section III C2 of her essay, in order to determine the logical relation between those visual features and theoretical concepts (especially fetishism). This involves rationally reconstructing the implicit operational procedures (empirical methods and evidence) Mulvey employed to interpret patriarchal values in mainstream narrative cinema. Operationalizing demystifies Mulvey’s interpretive activity by bridging the gap between her abstract theoretical predicates and filmic images, rendering the act of interpretation replicable by students new to film analysis.",
