          "authors": "Norma Musih, Eran Fisher",
          "abstract": "In this article, we evaluate the politics of recommendation engines by focusing on an indispensible feature of their operation: training. We use the notion of training as a key word which helps us link three bodies of knowledge: data science, the history of automation, and aesthetic and political theory. Training is a staple in the operation of algorithmic systems, and artificial intelligence more generally; it is a practical methodology by which these systems become intelligent. Training is also a key feature of how workers throughout history came to perform their labor, and how, during the 20 th century, machines came to acquire this human ability, that is, automation. And lastly, drawing on Immanuel Kant’s theory of aesthetic judgment, Hannah Arendt offers a political theory where training is key to political judgment. We trace the meaning and significance of ‘training’ in these three fields in order to draw conclusions from one field to another.",

          "authors": "Rituparna Banerjee, Saumava Mitra",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the visual politics of gender in electoral politics in West Bengal (WB). We examine how women political candidates visually construct their non-verbal political performance on social media, and how such visuals relate to social mores and societal expectations surrounding femininity. Drawing on theories of the social construction of gender and visual political communication, we conducted a content analysis of 1,033 visual artefacts from eight individual women candidates and 205 from the Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) pages of the four main political parties taking part in the January-April 2021 electoral campaign for state-level elections in WB. We analysed how these candidates construct gendered relationships with the electorate through different cues on the platforms, such as sartorial choices (traditional or Western attire), use of culture-specific religious symbols (sindoor or vermillion, bindi – forehead marking worn by married Hindu women), and gendered/non-gendered political actions like cooking or serving food, giving speeches or meeting constituents in political processions. Our findings about the visually performed politics show a combination of cultural, political, and gender signifiers, which are mediated and remain connected to societal expectations, and historical narratives. The candidates’ negotiation of these aspects, in turn, underscores a reproduction of colonial legacies and, in the present day, an ongoing production of societal differences. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on visual politics of gender, particularly in Asian contexts. It sheds light on the nuanced ways women politicians use social media to construct their visual identities, and how the deployment of body politics into the relatively ‘new’ online sphere reifies ‘old’ social, political, cultural symbolisms, and norms regarding gender. In this way, this article highlights the importance of considering pre-digital forms of gendered identity construction and visual representation when analysing the contested terrain of digital visibilities.",

          "authors": "Ausma Bernot, Fan Yang, Sara E Davies",
          "abstract": "In China, the escalating repression of gender and sexual diversity has given rise to ‘queer necropolitics’. ‘Queer necropolitics’ – a concept we build on – refers to the hegemonic ability to determine who is allowed to suffer, survive, or thrive. We examine China’s sustained re-enforcement of traditional gender norms, which has rendered queer communities non-existent from official recognition. In this context, we aim to understand how China’s state queer necropolitics has shaped queer organising in the country. From 2021 to 2022, we conducted 26 semi-structured interviews with a diverse cohort of self-identified LGBTIQ+ members and activists across 12 provinces in China. We find that the interplay of legal invisibility and politicised, moralised visibility has placed queer communities under hegemonic governance techniques of suppression. The paper argues that China’s queer necropolitics has established invisible activism. The juxtaposition of invisibility with activism denotes the quiet, implicit, and everyday embodied acts of communal care among queer communities as a form of resistance. Building on the metaphor of ‘glowing fireflies’ shared by a research participant, invisible activism presents a more sustainable approach than conventional rights-based activism. The paper expands our understanding of politically antagonistic practices, acknowledging the diversity and complexity embedded within queer activism.",

          "authors": "Konrad Bleyer-Simon, Kata Benedek",
          "abstract": "The portrayal of ethnic communities in the media can have a significant impact on the everyday life of these groups – both in a positive and negative way. Often, the dominant depictions in mainstream media are created without the community's involvement and are dominated by stereotypes. To deal with a lack of access to mainstream media channels or even to establish an own positive identity, a community can launch its own ethnic or minority media initiatives. However, as evidence from Hungary shows, there are situations in which those in power are interested in capturing successful ethnic media outlets to influence how members of the minority group make meaning of the world. This paper aims to elaborate on the dynamics of media capture in ethnic settings. Relying on interviews with representatives of post-transition Hungary's Romani media, the authors provide a field theory-based explanation, which they see as a fruitful new addition to the concept of media capture.",

          "authors": "Shihe Pan, Jungwon Kuem",
          "abstract": "Purpose People are often recognized as the weakest part of thwarting phishing attacks. The goal of preventing phishing can conflict with the goal of keeping a good level of productivity in daily work; however, we still lack an understanding of this multigoal scenario. This paper aims to develop and test a new model of antiphishing performance, especially in relation to individuals' task performance in daily work. Drawing on the extended multiple-goal pursuit model (MGPM*), we examined the relationship between task performance at a time point and the subsequent antiphishing performance as well as how this relationship differs across varying types of phishing emails and attention levels to phishing cues. Design/methodology/approach We tested the model by conducting a field experiment with a survey questionnaire. Four legitimate work emails and four phishing emails (consisting of two work-related and two work-unrelated emails) were sent to 357 participants. The data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Findings The results indicate that task performance at a time point has a curvilinear relationship with subsequent antiphishing performance. This relationship is moderated by the types of phishing emails and individuals' attention to phishing cues. For work-related phishing emails, task performance is negatively associated with antiphishing performance when it reaches an intermediate level; however, when task performance is low, or high to an extent, it is positively related to antiphishing performance. For work-unrelated phishing emails, there is a positive association between task performance and antiphishing performance. Moreover, attention to phishing cues moderates the curvilinear relationship between task performance and antiphishing performance such that when task performance reaches an intermediate level, as attention to phishing cues increases, the relationship between task performance and antiphishing performance will turn from negative to positive. Practical implications This paper has practical implications that bear on the conflict between antiphishing performance and task performance. Originality/value This paper sheds light on the potential of the extended multiple-goal pursuit model in studying antiphishing behavior.",

          "authors": "Ahmad Aljarah, Blend Ibrahim, Manuela López",
          "abstract": "Purpose Synthetic advertising, which involves creating or modifying ads through artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has recently transformed the field of media and advertising. Despite its emerging importance, our understanding of consumer perceptions in this context is limited. This study is one of the first to explore the impact of synthetic advertising on consumer behavior. Design/methodology/approach Across two between-subject experimental studies, using coffee shop customers in the USA, we tested how, why and when awareness of falsity in AI-generated corporate social responsibility (CSR) ads affects online brand engagement. Findings In Study 1, awareness of falsity in AI-generated CSR ads negatively impacts online brand engagement, with perceived sincerity mediating this relationship. Additionally, a higher level of CSR authenticity mitigates the negative effect of awareness of falsity on online brand engagement. CSR authenticity does not moderate the mediation effect of perceived sincerity in the relationship between awareness of falsity and online brand engagement. In Study 2, the relationship between awareness of falsity and online brand engagement is moderated by brand familiarity. Importantly, perceived sincerity only mediates this effect for unfamiliar brands, not familiar ones. Practical implications This study provides key insights for managers using AI to promote CSR initiatives. While AI can save time and budget, it may lead to negative consumer reactions due to perceptions of insincerity. To mitigate this, companies should focus on enhancing the authenticity of their CSR efforts and humanizing AI-generated ads. Additionally, established brands should be cautious of reduced consumer engagement with AI-generated content, while unfamiliar brands can benefit by emphasizing sincerity in their messaging. Originality/value This paper is one of the first studies that discuss how, why and when awareness of falsity in AI-generated corporate social responsibility ads affects online brand engagement.",

          "authors": "Mahesh Gadekar, Mbaye Fall Diallo, Victoria-Sophie Osburg",
          "abstract": "Purpose Brands can build meaningful, effective connections with consumers through digital influencers. This paper aims to understand the factors determining digital influencers’ success concerning brand-related (i.e. intention to follow influencer advice) and influencer-related (i.e. intention to recommend the influencer) outcomes. We present a conceptual model derived from established theories and psychological reasoning, identifying influencer authenticity and perceived value as important antecedents. We present satisfaction with the influencer and influencer credibility as the psychological mechanism explaining why antecedents transform into favorable outcomes. Design/methodology/approach With structural equation modeling and two studies (N1 = 814; N2 = 685) relying on active followers from two countries (the UK and India), this paper examines the direct and indirect effects of the value and authenticity of digital influencers on followers’ behavioral outcomes and the cultural context’s potential moderating effect. Findings Authenticity and value of digital influencers positively affect intention to follow influencer advice and recommend the influencer. Such effects are mediated by follower satisfaction and influencer credibility. The effects of influencer authenticity and value on intentions to follow and recommend are not stronger in India than in the UK. Originality/value We contribute to the literature by presenting a theoretically informed framework capturing the antecedents of successful influencers and the importance of differentiating brand-related and influencer-related outcomes. Furthermore, our studies highlight that research findings about influencers’ impact may not be generalizable to other cultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "Siblings are children’s most frequent daily companions in middle childhood and these relationships are theorized to be dynamic in nature but are rarely studied in a way that captures their day-to-day variation. Guided by cultural-ecological and relationship perspectives, this study examined the role of older siblings’ familism values and caring roles as predictors of average levels of and day-to-day variation in siblings’ positive and negative exchanges across seven days and tested moderation by child sex. Participants were older ( M = 10.6 years; SD = 0.39; 46.6% female) and younger siblings ( M = 8.2 years; SD = 1.07; 47.2% female) in 307 Latino sibling dyads recruited from 11 elementary schools in the southwestern U.S. Data were collected via home visits with parents, and in afterschool sessions and seven nightly phone calls with siblings. Analyses were conducted using a random variability model in a multilevel structural equation modeling approach. Findings revealed consistent associations between older siblings’ familism values and sibling roles and both average levels of and intraindividual variation in older siblings’ positivity and negativity. For younger siblings, some findings were moderated by child sex with more consistent links to younger sisters’ positivity and negativity than younger brothers’. Discussion highlights how older siblings’ cultural values and roles shape both overall levels of and day-to-day fluctuations in siblings’ exchanges and offers future directions of research.",

          "abstract": "The rise and development of serious games have shown promise in addressing critical social issues, including school bullying. However, prior work often compares game-based interventions with the conventional non-game approach, failing to generate insights about which game features should be emphasized to create more effective games. To bridge this research gap, in light of video games’ advantages for creating immersive experiences that benefit persuasion, we created a narrative-based serious game addressing school bullying and conducted two studies (Study 1, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 130; Study 2, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 250) to explore the persuasive effects of two game features, respectively player–avatar similarity and in-game control, on player experience (including player–avatar identification, narrative engagement, and empathy) and prosocial intention. We found mixed results subject to player perspective such that only when players took the bully’s perspective did one of the game features—in-game control—successfully create the intended empathy via amplified narrative engagement toward the desirable prosocial intention.",

          "abstract": "Using citizens’ data not only enables precise targeting of campaign messages online, but also the deliberate exclusion of certain groups of citizens. This study asks (a) to what extent have citizens been excluded from political (online) ads during the Dutch 2021 and 2023 election campaigns and (b) how acceptable citizens find the practice of exclusion. To answer these questions, we use data from the Meta Ad Targeting dataset to investigate any employed exclusion criteria by parties and rely on survey data collected during the 2023 Dutch general election to learn about citizens’ opinions. Our study reveals that political parties across the spectrum allocated less budget to targeting and excluding citizens in 2023 compared to 2021. Predominantly, exclusion is based on age, gender, and place of residence, with criteria such as political views, migration background, and religious beliefs being relatively uncommon. Despite citizens considering all forms of exclusion unacceptable, they view exclusion based on political views as the most tolerable. Moreover, individuals leaning towards the political right exhibit greater acceptance of exclusion, particularly based on migration background. In scrutinizing the extent of citizen exclusion from political campaign messaging and citizens’ perceptions, we contribute to the discourse on the unintended consequences of data-driven campaigning.",

          "authors": "Jenniffer Soto de la Cruz, Sara Cortés Gómez, Pilar Lacasa",
          "abstract": "This study reviews existing literature on how video games are being used to convey contemporary political discourse. Digital games, as meaningful cultural artifacts, have become a communication medium in their own right. They can serve as social mirrors, framing contemporary reality through metaphors that represent and recreate transcendent events or social facts through immersive experiences. Likewise, video games have played a significant role in shaping our current politics and culture. This article seeks to answer the research question: How has contemporary political discourse been explored through digital games in academic literature? To do so, we conducted a systematic literature review following the SALSA (search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis) framework. We identified &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 25 journal articles written in English and Spanish, published between January 2013 and September 2023. We found that first-person shooter games were the most frequently discussed game genre in the academic literature, followed by newsgames. We propose a new method for categorizing political messages in digital games, which we have called the PRICE dimensions model (participation, representation, ideology, conflict, and education). The studied papers were classified into five main thematic groups: (a) video games as a tool for digital propaganda; (b) video games aiming to raise awareness of political issues; (c) games and gamification elements for radicalization; (d) game design that justifies, minimizes, or downplays violence; and (e) players’ role in conveying political messages.",

          "abstract": "Following the wave of immersive production that occurred between 2015 and 2018, and in the face of new virtual, augmented, and mixed-reality devices, this article discusses the need to move from a technology- or device-focused perspective in the analysis and use of immersive technology towards a story-focused or story-first perspective. It starts with a technological perspective, contextualising the evolution of immersive technologies and their interpretation from a technological determinism point of view. Secondly, the ecological perspective provides an integrative reading of the technique, its use, and its experience, based on the concept of the environment. Finally, and after acknowledging previous research on the effects of immersive media on the audience, the article considers the narrative elements that are reinforced by immersive technologies in journalism and nonfiction, based on the qualitative analysis of projects. The article highlights narrative resources associated with the social character of the story, the spatio-temporal framework, and the emotional impact. It suggests a shift towards “narrative determinism,” which would allow us to analyse and employ immersive resources in terms of their contribution to storytelling and to overcome the limitations of perspectives that are highly dependent on specific platforms or technologies.",

          "abstract": "While the connection between social networking sites (SNSs) and body image has been reported more broadly in prior literature, the link between SNSs and muscle dysmorphia (MD) is less understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the strength and nature of the relationship between MD and SNSs among men in the general population. With SNSs allowing users to view and interact with online content, this study focussed on three SNS activities: (a) viewing men’s celebrity and fashion content, (b) viewing fitness-related content and (c) the importance of received likes and comments. Young men ( N = 95) completed an online questionnaire recording demographic information, SNS activities and MD symptomatology. A hierarchal regression revealed that the importance of received likes and comments significantly predicted MD symptomatology over and above demographic factors. These findings reflect a need to emphasise the interactive components of SNSs within body image literature.",

          "abstract": "A funa, a public denouncement aimed at raising moral condemnation of a person accused of perpetrating a crime or injustice, has become a major digital activism instrument in Latin America, particularly in Chile. Originated in the human rights movement in the 1990s, funas re-emerged as a new form of online activism that hybridized with a Latin American and historical form of protest to exert informal justice through social media. Drawing on a face-to-face survey of Chilean youth aged 18–29 years, we examine the factors that explain young people’s attitudes and behaviors regarding funas. We find that funas are gendered, with issues like sexual harassment and misconduct being the primary subject of funas. We also show that women hold more positive views about funas and are more likely to engage in online funas. Finally, our findings indicate that individuals who trust the judicial system are less likely to share funas on social media.",

(a) A preliminary qualitative project that collected potential ways to invest in couple relationships. (b) We identified 46 ways to invest in relationships and grouped them into six tactics using EFA, and then we validated a relational investment tactics scale. The six tactics are (1) emotional gestures, (2) material gestures, (3) personal space, (4) physical attractiveness and sex, (5) shared activities, and (6) help the partner's family and friends. (c) Finally, we evaluated the frequency of use of each of the 46 ways of relational investment among 483 respondents. Findings show that respondents who provide emotional and material gestures are involved in shared activities with their partner and help their partner's family and friends report higher marital satisfaction. We propose several practical implications based on these results.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence in general and ChatGPT in particular have risen in importance. ChatGPT is widely known and used increasingly as an information source for different topics, including science. It is therefore relevant to examine how ChatGPT portrays science and science-related issues. Research on this question is lacking, however. Hence, we simulate “interviews” with ChatGPT and reconstruct how it presents science, science communication, scientific misbehavior, and controversial scientific issues. Combining qualitative and quantitative content analysis, we find that, generally, ChatGPT portrays science largely as the STEM disciplines, in a positivist-empiricist way and a positive light. When comparing ChatGPT’s responses to different simulated user profiles and responses from the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions, we find similarities in that the scientific consensus on questions such as climate change, COVID-19 vaccinations, or astrology is consistently conveyed across them. Beyond these similarities in substance, however, pronounced differences are found in the personalization of responses to different user profiles and between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.",

Therefore, individuals’ attitudes toward risk preventive behavior developed or changed through systematic processing are likely to be more persistent over time than those whose attitudes are based on heuristic processing. To examine this proposition, we conducted to a two-wave panel study in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings supported the proposition that processing influenced attitude strength, which influenced individuals’ attitude toward behavior a year later.

Analyses were conducted by means of structural equation modeling (SEM) using the AMOS SPSS software, where a statistical model was performed for each type of psychological distance. The findings revealed two statistically significant paths that go from social media to violent environmental collective action, mediated, first, by each of the psychological distances and, second, by social identity and negative emotions (anger and fear). In addition, it was observed that only probability distance on its own acted as a mediator in the relationship between social media and violent environmental collective action. It was also observed that a path from social media to violent environmental collective action was mediated, first, by three types of distances (probability, spatial, and temporal) and, second, by participative efficacy.",

While researchers have focused on BSMPs within specific platforms, this study presents a systematic examination of BSMPs across multiple platforms to facilitate theoretical durability. Interviews with users of BSMPs across diverse platforms ( N = 35) reveal that BSMPs discourage the affordance of visibility as they are considered private due to visibility management mechanisms and trust in known audiences. They encourage personalization as users believe they receive relevant content from and can send relevant content to specific audiences, in the absence of algorithms. BSMPs also encourage synchronicity by facilitating continuous conversations. The strength of encouragement or discouragement of these affordances varies across different BSMPs and is informed by users’ social positions. This study therefore contributes a framework and shared terminology for future research on BSMPs across social media.",

Instead, GAMMA (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon) released statements and/or policies surrounding commitments to data privacy seemingly incongruous with surveillance-based business models. We examine GAMMA’s policies, statements, and associated news coverage post-Roe through commodity activism and politics of care. We reveal recurring discourses that cast technical privacy features as sufficiently protective alongside scrupulous data practices by users and that constrain the purview of company responsibility to full-time employees. A focus on responsible data management sidesteps critiques of data collection, framing GAMMA’s policy changes as corporate care but furthering commodification of individual privacy, reproducing the neoliberal subject, and upholding surveillance capitalism.",

          "authors": "James Fitzgerald, Ayse D. Lokmanoglu, Debora Salles, Rose Marie Santini",
          "abstract": "This comparative study examines the interplay of religious messaging and disinformation in the election campaign material of Jair Bolsonaro and Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the 2022 Brazilian and 2023 Turkish presidential elections. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining computational keyword filtering and content analysis with qualitative discourse analysis and applied to a corpus of 10,519 posts across seven social media platforms. The analysis informs two key findings. First, in both Bolsonaro and Erdogan’s presidential campaigns, religious rhetoric and symbolism is used to bolster personal authority and in-group support to consolidate the idea of (presiding over) a majority bloc. Second, while disinformation interfaces with religious messaging in both presidential campaigns, we find that religion is overwhelmingly instrumentalized as a vector for political disinformation—thus, we did not identify any significant presence of “religious disinformation,” classically understood. Ultimately, our article creates space for further comparative and region-specific scholarship to explore how religion, politics, and disinformation intersect with authoritarian populism in modern elections and beyond, while also contributing to the conceptual refinement of “religious disinformation.”",

          "authors": "Dennis Steffan, Maria Elizabeth Grabe, Umberto Famulari",
          "abstract": "An evolving body of research generally referred to as visual politics has brought the heavy research focus on linguistic modalities of political communication closer to parity with visual emphasis. The study reported here transcends this schism by joining momentum toward multimodality as an ontological departure point for research. We expanded an existing visual instrument into a multimodal one and provided evidence that it reliably captures character framing of political candidates (stateliness, compassion, mass appeal, ordinariness, and sure loser) in German, Polish, and United States commercial online news. We focused on election coverage in these countries because they represent three distinct political and media systems (democratic-corporatist, polarized-pluralist, and hybrid) of the Global North. The quantitative content analysis sample we used spans 2,688 online news stories with seven political candidates identified in 6,560 cases across six modalities (still images, moving images, frozen video images, text, audio, and superimposed text). We found support for the hypothesis that political and media system latencies affect how news media frame the character traits of political candidates in both visual and linguistic modalities. Specifically, the competitive tendencies of majoritarian democracies manifested more clearly as candidate-centered, simplistic, and polarizing character framing in US media content than in journalistic output of multiparty consensus democracies. For example, US news media were more consistent in their portrayal of election winners and losers than German and Polish news media, emphasizing stateliness, compassion, and ordinariness in the winner while unambiguously assigning the negative sure loser frame to the election loser.",

          "abstract": "Comics have increasingly served as a tool for delivering scientific information to diverse audiences. However, little is known about how visual elements in comics influence their persuasive potential. Inspired by McCloud (1993)’s ‘masking effect’ theory featured in Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art, this study examined how different degrees of realism in comic characters, combined with background details, affected readers’ character identification. The findings suggested that exposure to comics featuring unrealistic, cartoonish characters minimized the gap in character identification between Black and white US participants. Contrary to McCloud’s hypotheses, exposure to comics with less detailed backgrounds resulted in higher character identification across conditions, regardless of character realism. The authors discuss the implications for future research and practice of using comics for public communication of science.",

          "title": "An Australian agri-industrial landscape sublime",
          "authors": "Joshua Zeunert",
          "abstract": "Agriculture has the largest visual and environmental impact on Australia’s landscape, ecologies and environments. It is frequently visually communicated through romantic imagery and reinforced by messaging that emphasizes trust, environmental stewardship, and ethical livestock practices. The quality of satellite imaging is generally inadequate for verifying these practices and illuminating the state of agricultural environments. This visual essay presents a photographic counter narrative based on a comprehensive visual research process spanning the breadth of the continent. It presents 56 unaltered still images selected from over 10,000 captured by the author using a consumer drone. Images have been chosen to represent all of Australia’s major commodities by economic value, all land-dominant practices, and all primary government classifications. Photographs are accompanied by industry quotes to challenge bucolic notions, and to posit that human production scales are superseded by commercial agribusiness. The research seeks to depict an ‘agri-industrial landscape sublime’ to highlight paradoxes within Australian agriculture as a Western practice providing food abundance from a weathered and volatile continent, while adversely affecting ecosystems and drawing animal suffering into question. Finally, the essay seeks to highlight the importance of recognising insensitive agribusiness as systemic of imposing neoliberal systems on Australian farmers and embracing extractive paradigms. Accordingly, this essay carefully composes imagery that both celebrates production capability while suggesting the need to evolve insensitive agri-philosophy and practice to food systems realising improved ecological, environmental, and animal welfare outcomes.",
