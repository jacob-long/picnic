          "title": "Character assassination as a communicative phenomenon: a retrospective review of concept development and extensions",
          "authors": "Madeline J Moore, Lili R Romann, Rachel V Tucker, Elizabeth A Hintz",
          "abstract": "This retrospective review synthesizes communication scholarship concerning character assassination (CA) or the deliberate destruction of a target’s character by an attacker. We first review the five pillars of CA, before tracing the development of CA across the three subfields of communication most prevalent in our sample: Political communication, rhetoric, and persuasion; mediated/mass communication and new communication technologies; and public relations and strategic communication. We offer an agenda for future CA research in three intellectual territories underrepresented in our sample, including sociological, sociopsychological, and sociocultural approaches; health and science communication; and interpersonal and instructional communication. In all, our review underscores the contemporary salience of CA as a communicative phenomenon, and outlines directions for further developing this burgeoning area of research.",

          "authors": "Pranav Malhotra, Natalie-Anne Hall, Yiping Xia, Louise Stahl, Andrew Chadwick, Cristian Vaccari, Brendan T Lawson",
          "abstract": "We argue for more serious consideration of interpretive qualitative approaches in research on information credibility evaluation in digitally mediated contexts. Through reviewing existing literature on credibility and drawing on our own experiences of conducting research projects on credibility evaluation in diverse cultural contexts, we contend that interpretive qualitative approaches help researchers develop a much-needed communicative and relationally and culturally situated understanding of credibility, complicating dominant quantitative and psychologically-oriented accounts. We detail how these approaches add important nuance to how credibility is conceptualized and operationalized and reveal the complexity of credibility evaluation as a social process. We also outline how they aid researchers studying misinformation engagement, especially in popular bounded social media places like private groups and chats. The approach we develop here provides new insights that can inform ongoing global efforts by researchers, policy makers, and citizens to more fully understand the complexity of information verification online.",

          "authors": "Neil Sadler",
          "abstract": "The concept of narrative has been widely employed in the disinformation literature. Nonetheless, its use has been dominated by loose intuitions of what narratives are and do alongside vague accounts of specific stories. Theorized more carefully, thinking in terms of narrative has much to offer disinformation studies by helping to better define what constitutes disinformation and providing sophisticated frameworks for assessing specific content. To enable a nuanced view of narrative truth, I propose a “hermeneutic realist” approach in which stories “disclose” wider realities rather than constructing or simply reflecting them, supplemented with Phelan’s “narrative ethics” to facilitate inquiry into how far stories are morally legitimate. I apply these ideas in a case study of Twitter content posted by a Venezuelan political influencer blaming Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine on NATO enlargement. In so doing, I show that content may be referentially and ethically problematic without necessarily being false.",

          "authors": "Elaine Jing Zhao",
          "abstract": "This article proposes the politics of streaming time as a productive analytical lens to unflatten more general accounts of nonlinearity and acceleration, to reveal the mediating role of streaming services and broader power relations around terms of access in value reconfiguration, and to critique the cultural-economic logics of the streaming economy. Building on the literature on media and time in the internet society, and integrating platform studies and television studies, this article analyses the politics of streaming time with reference to Chinese streaming services’ turn to the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) model, a process negotiated among multiple parties including streaming services, advertisers, audiences and regulators. The analysis shows how streaming services orchestrate elastic schedules in concert with flexible pricing and dynamic bundling to manipulate temporal and affective experiences of viewers while causing contingent boundaries of subscriber benefits. It explains how the data-contingent approach confronts subscribers with a boomerang moment of temporal displacement and surge pricing. Further, it reveals how multiple temporalities including artificial ephemerality, collusive synchronicity and metric thresholding as well as reconfigured televisual linearity are mediated to entice and extract value from subscribers. The conclusion reflects on how exploring the politics of streaming time allows a more textured understanding of emerging temporalities and the negotiation around terms of access in an increasingly contingent cultural market.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, emerging technologies and neoliberal policies have transformed the way people work. This article explores the impact of sociotechnical change on platformized cultural production, where creators depend on digital platforms to make a living. By examining the case of American romance writers, the paper reveals how unique solidaristic practices, including gender-focused community building, an emphasis on pan-hierarchical connections, and communicative norms of open information-sharing, empowered romance authors throughout the platformization of publishing. Through 57 in-depth interviews and 40 years of archival research, the study demonstrates how these practices facilitated the diffusion of digital self-publishing, reducing romance writers’ precarity. By introducing a novel, multi-level communicative framework, this paper integrates meso-level theories of innovation with macro- and micro-level understandings of platform power. This framework provides a new model for understanding collective agency within platformized industries The paper contributes to broader discussions of “good work,” suggesting that communicative strategies can reshape power imbalances even under platformized conditions.",

          "authors": "Curd B Knüpfer, W Lance Bennett, Ulrike Klinger",
          "abstract": "This study examines the mechanisms by which illiberal politics make the news by disrupting democratic systems. During the late 20th century, a liberal journalistic consensus in most democracies developed guidelines for gatekeeping political voices and views in the news. In recent years, illiberal politics and changing media systems have challenged those press norms. Politically marginalized parties can make the news by disrupting party systems, elections, and policy processes. The presented case of German news coverage of the United Nations Global Compact for Migration shows that disproportionate media attention to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party was not related to its size or policy impact, but to the strategic disruption of the political process itself. Making news via democratic disruption constitutes what we term “indexing by proxy” that undermines a core democratic journalism norm by amplifying coverage of illiberal actors that challenge the legitimacy of various public institutions, including legacy journalism.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Storme, Martin Storme",
          "abstract": "In many languages, masculine forms are used generically. However, extensive research demonstrates that these forms exhibit a male bias that can adversely affect the perception of opportunities by women. To address this issue, alternative linguistic forms have been proposed, typically categorized into two main strategies: feminization and neutralization. Both approaches have proven effective in reducing the male bias of masculine forms. However, their relative effectiveness remains unclear. This study investigates this question in French. We compare gender representations elicited by three linguistic forms—masculine forms, pair forms (feminization), and neutral forms (neutralization)—against a stereotypical baseline. Our findings reveal that, in stereotypically neutral contexts, neutralization and feminization are equally effective in counteracting the male bias of masculine forms. However, in male- or female-dominated contexts, feminization is less sensitive to contextual bias and therefore more successful in mitigating the influence of stereotypes. Implications and limitations are discussed.",

To fill this gap in the literature, this study adopted a single-center perspective and a network approach to explore and identify the sociodemographic and intrapersonal determinants of well-being (emotional and psychological well-being) and ill-being (anxiety and depression) among single individuals. Data were collected from two samples of Polish single individuals for Study 1 ( N = 650; age 18–56; 56.50% women and 43.50% men) and Study 2 ( N = 1406; age 18–92; 61.90% women and 38.10% men). The network analysis revealed that the overall network structure in the two samples was highly stable and similar, and the most influential factor was satisfaction with singlehood. These findings emphasize the need for a focus on satisfaction with singlehood beyond the general assessment of single individuals’ well-being and ill-being.",

          "abstract": "The interpersonal consequences of anger coping (i.e., anger-in, anger-out, anger-control) in everyday life are unclear. This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study tested whether momentary variations in anger coping style were associated with the perceived quality of subsequent interpersonal interactions throughout the day. Lifetime discrimination and race were tested as moderators of these associations. A sample of 518 Black and Latinx participants (age range = 23–65, M = 38.9; 50.4% men, 49.6% women) completed surveys measuring demographics and perceived discrimination, and EMAs of anger coping and perceptions of interpersonal interaction quality every 20 minutes during waking hours. At a between-person level, those who reported more frequent use of either anger-in or anger-out also reported more negative interactions throughout the day. At the within-person level, observations during which people reported using anger-in (vs. anger-out or anger-control) were negatively associated with the quality of the interpersonal interaction on the subsequent observation 20 minutes later. Discrimination moderated the effects of anger coping. For individuals who reported experiencing higher levels discrimination, observations in which they held anger-in (vs. did not) were associated with worse subsequent interpersonal interaction quality. In contrast, for those who reported experiencing lower levels of discrimination, observations in which they expressed anger-outwardly (vs. did not) were associated with worse subsequent interpersonal interaction quality. This study provides evidence of person by context interactions in the interpersonal consequences of anger expression and may inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to mitigate the effects of discrimination.",

          "title": "Does sacrifice always lead to burnout in romantic relationships? The role of relational equity and appreciation",
          "authors": "Pınar Özdemir",
          "abstract": "Earlier studies have extended the literature on sacrifice by examining the positive and negative effects and addressing two different aspects of sacrifice, i.e., perceived as satisfying and perceived as harmful. However, there has been less focus on the psychological mechanisms that underlie the perception of sacrifice as harmful within couple relationships. The present study investigates whether the perception of sacrifice harmfulness is associated with couple burnout and explores the roles of relational equity and appreciation in these relationships. The participants comprised 749 married individuals residing in various cities across Türkiye ( M age = 33.41, SD ¼ = 9.12). Data were collected using the Demographic Information Form, the Couple Burnout Measure, the Appreciation in Relationships Scale, the Relational Equity Scale, and the Perceived Sacrifice Harmfulness Scale. The PROCESS macro was used to simultaneously test the mediation effect of relational equity and the moderation effect of being appreciated (Model 8). The findings indicated that perceived sacrifice harmfulness was positively associated with couple burnout and negatively associated with relational equity. Relational equity partially mediated the relationship between perceived sacrifice harmfulness and couple burnout. Moreover, the perception of being appreciated moderated this mediation at the first stage of the process. Furthermore, among partners who perceive their sacrifices as harmful, those with low levels of being appreciated feel unequal within the relationship. The results from this study extend research on the potential consequences of perceived sacrifice harmfulness and emphasize the importance of uncovering the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, while these findings do not provide direct practical implications, they offer insights that may inform behavioral recommendations for couples in clinical settings.",

          "abstract": "The growing ‘digital nomad’ movement flourishes amid concerns about the impacts of remote work on workplace culture. This ethnographic study combines a Massey-inspired perspective on space, place, and spatial divisions of labor with a geomedia lens to interpret digital nomad infrastructure as producing a ‘global sense of workplace’. By adopting this perspective, the nomadic lifestyle appears less as a radical departure by professionals from office/life and more as a spatial manifestation of digital labor in the context of neoliberal capitalism.",

          "abstract": "Friendships are important throughout the lifespan, but groups of friends who disperse geographically need communication media to stay connected. Prior research on the use of media in long-distance communication focused on dyads, thereby neglecting issues like the heightened coordination effort in groups. We conducted a survey on a representative sample of German adults to discover the media ensembles of (geographically dispersed) friend groups and to explore the relationship between these ensembles and connectedness. A cluster analysis revealed four clusters, ranging from a traditional cluster occasionally communicating through emails and voice calls to a cluster that frequently uses several media, including games and discussion forums. The use of group chats was common in three clusters. Feelings of connectedness increased with communication frequency and number of media used. Psychological processes, namely social presence and ambient awareness, influenced connectedness as well.",

          "abstract": "Social media and artificial intelligence have made it easier than ever to create and widely spread manipulated content. Recent geopolitical and digital developments underscore the need for more research on the topic, even in the Nordic countries with their recognised resilience against dis- and misinformation. This integrative review ( N = 359) examines how dis- and misinformation have been studied across disciplines in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden between 2014 and 2024. The diversity of terminology and fields in this research highlights its significance and the potential for cross-disciplinary and cross-border collaboration. The article identifies five main topics within the literature: security and Russia’s actions; media and fact-checking; health; media literacy; and social media. While Nordic countries share similarities in dis- and misinformation research, Finland, Norway, and Sweden are more closely aligned with each other than with Denmark or Iceland. This study also identifies research gaps, including the need for more psychological and cognitive science research on dis- and misinformation. Overall, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of dis- and misinformation in the Nordic countries than previously available.",

          "abstract": "Ghosting—or indirectly ceasing communication to end a relationship—has become common with the rising popularity of online dating. Despite its ubiquity, little is known regarding the immediate causal impact of being ghosted compared to explicit rejection. In two studies, participants were immersed in a sequential dating scenario simulating the early development of an online relationship to experimentally test emotional and behavioral responses to ambiguous rejection (i.e., ghosting), explicit rejection, and acceptance. Ghosted and explicitly rejected participants reported high negative emotion as well as low positive emotion and self‐esteem. However, ghosted participants reported ongoing emotional attachment to the target compared to those who were explicitly rejected. Ghosted participants also intended to monitor the target's social media and dating app status and text/call over time to the same extent as accepted participants, demonstrating a lack of closure. This work illustrates the causal effects of being ghosted, characterized by emotional pain without closure and disengagement.",

Using a three-condition between-subjects survey experiment ( N = 723), we found that respondents in the experimental (vs. control) conditions reported greater perceived aggression, which was negatively associated with perceived trustworthiness of the scientist. The negative effects of the audio clips with satire on perceived trustworthiness were mediated by experienced mirth. Our results offer evidence that scientists who use satire may be seen as less trustworthy than those who do not, likely because of the aggression perceived in the jokes.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the intricate interplay between identity construction and multimodal communication in the evolving landscape of Virtual Influencers (VIs), with a particular focus on Lil Miquela . It addresses a critical gap in understanding how algorithmic infrastructures mediate identity performance through complex semiotic and chronotopic configurations. Adopting a techno-affective and social semiotic approach, the research conducts a chronotopic analysis of 35 (sponsored) posts from Lil Miquela ’s official Instagram account (21 January–June 2024), integrating Bakhtin’s chronotope with Danesi’s semiotic model. Guided by three key questions, the article explores: (1) the role of emojis as semiotic resources in her digital identity construction; (2) the mediation of her spatiotemporal identity dynamics by algorithmic infrastructures; and (3) the relationship between multimodal affordances, techno-affective elements and perceptions of authenticity. By interrogating the intersection of chronotopic configurations, algorithmic mediation and digital semiotics, this research reveals how her identity is continuously (re)negotiated in response to shifting algorithmic and socio-discursive conditions. Ultimately, it contributes to a deeper understanding of how VIs navigate digital authenticity and identity performance within the constraints and affordances of algorithmic mediation.",
