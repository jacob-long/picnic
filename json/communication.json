          "abstract": "This article explores the specifics of cross-sector cooperation within the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) from the perspective of the Video Game Industry Ecosystem (VGIE) based on integrating desk research (utilising a systematic literature review of 61 papers) and field research (through a focused group interview with ten experts representing mainly the actors from VGIE). Our two-step parallel study identifies key drivers and barriers in establishing such cooperation, highlights three coordination mechanisms essential during its execution (static-adaptive management, proximity, and knowledge management), and uncovers a significant research gap regarding the ending phase of such cooperation, despite our FGI revealing relevant factors contributing to its termination or dormancy. This work offers a theoretical contribution to the existing knowledge by synthesising and expanding the understanding of cross-industry cooperation between the VGIE and other CCIs. Moreover, it highlights significant research gaps, particularly in the final phase of cross-industry cooperation.",

          "authors": "Abdul Hameed Pitafi, Fazeelat Masood, Sheena Pitafi",
          "abstract": "Purpose The present research aims to explore the influence of enterprise social media (ESM) features on employee agility through knowledge sharing and hiding. ESM strain was taken as a moderator in the association among knowledge sharing, knowledge hiding and employee agility. Communication visibility theory is used to underpin the hypothesized research model. Design/methodology/approach Data is collected from 374 Chinese employees working in different companies. A structural equation modeling (SEM) is applied using AMOS software 21.0. Findings Findings illustrate that ESM features namely analysis, tracking and communication are significantly connected to knowledge sharing and negatively to knowledge hiding. Knowledge sharing is significantly related to employee agility while knowledge hiding is negatively linked to employee agility. Further, ESM strain strengthens the negative connection between knowledge hiding and employee agility. However, ESM strain has an insignificant moderating effect in the connection between knowledge sharing and employee agility. Practical implications The current research has practical implications for ESM users and ESM-enabled organizations. For individuals who use ESM to promote knowledge within an organization, this study highlights the important functioning of ESM features that include analysis, tracking and communication. For managers, this study suggests the use of ESM features to promote knowledge sharing and inhibit knowledge hiding. Originality/value The current research investigates how ESM features are associated with employee agility in the workplace. This study proposes that knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding are the mediators of the effect path between ESM features and employee agility. Moreover, the present study extends to ESM literature by highlighting the moderating role of ESM strain using communication visibility theory as a theoretical lens. Lastly, this study quantifies the benefits of ESM features to help organizations train agile employees.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This research examines how digital communication technology can act as an intervention tool to develop online social capital and resilience when normal bonding and support reduces during crisis. Design/methodology/approach Using 21 semi-structured interviews, the experiences of women are explored to understand how they strengthened their capabilities to acquire support and achieve resilience during crisis. Findings Findings demonstrate different ways women developed their bonding and bridging social capital at personal, family and community level to seek online support and empower themselves to achieve disaster resilience. While the context of this study is pandemic, findings are applicable to other crisis scenarios. Originality/value The research enhances the importance of online social capital in developing agency, capabilities and resilience during crisis. It enables to understand how practitioners should not limit technology use to disaster preparedness and prevention, but it could also be used in responding and recovering from crisis.",

          "authors": "Mahdi Abouei, Nima Kordzadeh, Maryam Ghasemaghaei, Bilal Khan",
          "abstract": "Purpose Users contribute to online communities by posting and responding to discussion threads. Nonetheless, only a small fraction of threads gain popularity and shape community discourse. Prior studies have identified several factors driving thread popularity; however, despite their prevalence, the role of emotional expressions within discussion threads remains understudied. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of thread starters’ valence and embedded discrete emotions of anger, anxiety and sadness on thread popularity, drawing on the negativity bias and the emotion-as-social-information theories. Design/methodology/approach Using two samples from Reddit, this study employs negative binomial regression analysis to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results demonstrate that negativity in thread starters significantly influences thread popularity; however, the expression of discrete emotions impacts popularity variously. In some contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccination subreddits, embedded anger in thread starters decreases thread popularity, whereas anxiety and sad expressions enhance it. In other contexts, such as professional discussions (e.g. r/Medicine subreddit), anger and anxiety expressions increase thread popularity, while sad expressions have no significant influence. Research limitations/implications The study is limited by its focus on specific emotions and contexts. Future research could examine a broader range of emotions, post-content modalities and the impact of cultural and linguistic differences. Originality/value This study contributes to theory by offering a new definition of thread popularity and enhancing our understanding of the impact of emotions in online discussions. It also provides practical implications for online community members and moderators seeking to promote discussion posts that help achieve community goals.",

          "authors": "Xiao Deng, Jiayu Li, Yaying Huang",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study explores how employees respond to social media-induced fear of missing out (FoMO) in the workplace and examines the subsequent impacts of these responses. Based on the transactional theory of stress and coping, the research focuses on how FoMO affects employees’ adoption of stress-coping behaviors: active work interruption (a problem-oriented strategy) and social network interaction (an emotion-oriented strategy). It further investigates the outcomes of these coping strategies – job burnout (resulting from the problem-oriented strategy) and workplace relationships (resulting from the emotion-oriented strategy). Additionally, the study explores how the perceived competitive climate moderates the effect of FoMO on these coping behaviors. Design/methodology/approach A two-phase survey yielded 244 responses, which were then analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling to validate the relationships among the variables. Findings The findings revealed that FoMO increases employees’ active work interruption, leading to job burnout. In addition, FoMO leads employees to engage in more social network interaction, which promotes workplace relations. The perceived competitive climate positively moderates the indirect effect of workplace FoMO through active work interruption and job burnout. Originality/value This study emphasizes that individuals are not merely passive recipients of stress but active agents in coping with it. This shift from “passive impacts” to “active responses” helps uncover the bidirectional impacts of social media-induced FoMO on employees, thereby enriching our understanding of FoMO and expanding the application of the transactional theory of stress and coping. Additionally, we explore the boundary conditions of the FoMO mechanism and advance research related to the perceived competitive climate.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the effect of de-influencing and its related content on consumer behavior compared with influencing content. It considers the gender of de-influencers and consumers’ varied reactions to distinct types of de-influencing. Design/methodology/approach Based on informational social influence theory, we conducted three experiments to investigate how consumers perceive and respond to de-influencing: the first explores consumer perception of social media de-influencers compared to influencers; the second examines the effect of de-influencers’ gender and the last compares consumer attitude toward various types of de-influencer content. Findings Consumers find de-influencers more credible than “traditional” influencers. De-influencing messages significantly affect attitude and purchase intention. The de-influencing creator’s gender does not affect brand attitude, perceived message effectiveness or perception. However, de-influencing video content influences attitudes toward brands and video effectiveness. Messages focusing on ethics and health elicit more negative perceived attitudes toward the brand. Research limitations/implications This pioneering research introduces “de-influence” as a new dynamic in social media marketing, revealing consumers’ preference for authentic, skeptical content over traditional influencer promotions. This lays the foundation for future research on consumer behavior and brand perception in digital spaces. Practical implications Brands in trust-sensitive industries should embrace authenticity and engage with de-influencers to build trust, turn criticism into growth opportunities and align themselves with consumer value. Originality/value Our study represents pioneering research in the emerging field of de-influencing, filling gaps in the literature and offering a comprehensive contribution to social media research.",

          "abstract": "This research delves into the dualistic nature of datafication, revealing its capacity to both illuminate and mask realities within media organizations. Datafication, the strategic use of data in organizations, offers insights into, and transforms, how work and individual outcomes are perceived and evaluated. This study examines how data-centric practices—embodied in metrics, rankings, and algorithms—can skew the playing field, creating scenarios where workers may feel (un)fairly (dis)advantaged or (mis)represented. The findings indicate that while data can provide valuable insights fostering cooperation and learning, it can also create competition and apprehension among journalists. Through the concept of “coopetition” we show how media professionals employ data opportunism to leverage information while also grappling with data skepticism amid potential misinterpretations and increased competition. Hence, the findings contribute to the research on datafication by demonstrating how workers utilize interpretative flexibility depending on what the data and metrics make visible.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine whether the use of affective language by politicians impacts the social evaluation of their image, as measured by the semantic differential method developed by Cwalina et al.. In the study, Polish participants ( N = 958) evaluated the profiles of three well-known Polish politicians from different parties: Bosak (right-wing), Trzaskowski (center), and Biedroń (left-wing). Participants made evaluations before and after reading hateful, kind or neutral tweets about refugees from Ukraine. We controlled for participants’ political views and demographic variables. The results confirmed changes in evaluations of the image of politicians depending on the language they used. The ‘positivity bias’ identified in the study provides encouragement to use kindness speech in public discourse, showing that this type of communication can improve a politician's ratings.",

          "abstract": "How do couples differ from other couples in how they regulate their own and their partner’s emotions? Although research on emotion regulation is blooming, insights into joint emotion regulation profiles—that is, the overlap between partners’ specific strategies to regulate themselves and their partner—remain limited. To address this gap, we identified joint intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation profiles in 120 mixed-sex couples; clustering couples together based on both partners’ reported intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation strategies. Additionally, we examined associations between profile-membership and well-being indicators. The identified joint emotion regulation profiles differed in three ways: (1) degree of regulation (e.g., no use of any vs. high use of all strategies), (2) strategies predominantly used; and (3) degree of similarity—or lack thereof—between partners. Together, these findings provide the first insights into the role of joint emotion regulation profiles in the health of couples and their relationships, highlighting the unique roles played by both partners in regulating their own and their partner’s emotions. Further research is needed to assess if these results generalize to inclusive samples and daily life.",

          "authors": "Jana Zündel",
          "abstract": "This essay explores how seriality and televisuality inform and fuel meme culture. Television and streaming series not only provide material for internet memes, i.e., appropriable audio-visual extracts that circulate on social media and video-sharing platforms, but often already feature meme-like visuals themselves, e.g., visual or scenographic imitations of artwork, reenactments of movie scenes, or even entire iconographies of a media franchise. In a semi-historical approach, this essay explores these “memefications” as intertextual practices for recalling, recycling, and preserving cultural artifacts. Citing various cases in US series from an autobiographical collection of such revisualizations and elaborate referential networks in both legacy TV series and popular contemporary shows, this essay proposes a taxonomy of pre-internet memefication within and between series: intermedial, interserial, and intraserial memefications. I discuss them as aesthetic and praxeological precursors of current moving image memes such as TikToks, which similarly restage scenes, characteristics, or tropes from other shows, films, or media. As it is a key characteristic of televisuality to adopt and transform modes of representation from other media, I argue that television may have premeditated and mastered memefication before the conception of internet memes, which are now prevalent in everyday communication.",

          "abstract": "Recommendation algorithms have acquired a central role in the suggestion of content within both subscription video on demand (SVOD) and advertising-based video on demand (AVOD) services and media-sharing platforms. In this article, we suggest the introduction of the datacasting paradigm, which takes into account the increasing relevance algorithms have in selection processes on audiovisual platforms. We use TikTok as a case study as it is an entirely algorithmic platform, and therefore embodies the heart of our discussion, and analyse how the algorithmic flow within the platform influences user experience, the impact it has on the enjoyment of content, and whether the platform can be considered televisual. We have opted to frame TikTok within debates on flow, as we believe that is what is at the core of the platform experience. Through the analysis of in-depth interviews, we extracted two main categories of responses: TV on TikTok and TikTok as TV. The former includes all responses related to the consumption of traditional televisual material on the platform, while the latter looks at all potential connections between the platform and television viewing habits.",

          "authors": "Kate Lacey",
          "abstract": "This article interrogates the privileging of intimacy in contemporary discussions of media in general and audio journalism in particular (within a broadly Anglo-American frame). It posits that the prominence of the term in relation to podcasting specifically, together with the communicative practices it purports to describe, has become ideological. The article begins by exploring how the intimate address of radio and podcasting has been variously invoked and celebrated in public and academic discourse across a century of spoken word media. This historical overview provides a context and counterpoint to the ways in which intimacy is invoked in contemporary discourses and the contradictions encapsulated by the notion of an “intimate public sphere” (Berlant, 1998). It highlights how the language of intimacy in the public realm—with all its positive connotations, including in relation to building trust—can be appropriated or transformed under the logics of communicative capitalism (Dean, 2005) to disguise unequal power relations, restrict communication across difference, and feed into a culture of atomised individualism. The article turns instead to a cosmopolitan ethics of “proper distance” (Silverstone, 2004) combined with a feminist ethics of care as a way to negotiate the balance between intimacy and trust for the listening public.",

          "authors": "Simone Knox, Kai Hanno Schwind",
          "abstract": "This article offers a comprehensive analysis of how increasingly globalised infrastructures, marked by industry expansion, consolidation, and the impact of streamers, affect the workflows and practices within local dubbing industries. Informed by extensive, original interviews with managerial and creative dubbing practitioners, and industry fieldwork observations since 2017, the article is located within a post-Bourdieuian framework, exploring what significant change for the field and its habitus has meant for agency. Having identified a persistent lack of engagement with the dubbing of television in existing scholarship across several disciplines, the article considers how dubbing practitioners negotiate a wider industrial push towards more streamlining, standardisation, and more attendance to issues concerning equity, diversity, and inclusion. Here, the article offers the notion of oblique agency, to capture how creative agency is moved away from local creative practitioners, through more managerial oversight, prescriptive guidance and tools, and feedback cultures shaped by corporate agendas. Simultaneously, some agency is left to these practitioners, most acutely felt in the case of dubbing contemporary television (marked by narrative and tonal complexity), due to a lack of investment and recognition of dubbing as inherently creative. The article takes care to explore the complexities of these dynamics, especially a pronounced heterogeneity of views, including simultaneous criticism and enjoyment by creative practitioners, as well as a considerable gap between their perspectives and those of managerial practitioners. In this way, the article seeks to make a much-needed contribution to nuanced engagement with dubbing infrastructures and working practices.",

This article applies critical disability studies and theory of accumulation by dispossession to analyze the dynamics within China’s data labeling industry. We examine the interplay among capital, central and local governments, Disabled People’s Organizations (DPOs), and workers with disabilities in the AI data labeling value chain. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of DPOs in reallocating surplus labor and capital across spatial and temporal dimensions. By supplementing functions traditionally associated with government entities, these organizations significantly influence the industry’s landscape. Furthermore, we reveal how DPOs foster labor agency, creating spaces for work dignity among workers with disabilities. Through their efforts to navigate and mitigate algorithmic control, DPOs contribute to a more inclusive labor environment, challenging societal norms.",

          "abstract": "Drawing from interviews with 39 online extremism and terrorism researchers, this article provides an empirical analysis of these researchers’ experiences with institutional ethics processes. Discussed are the harms that these researchers face in the course of their work, including trolling, doxing, and mental and emotional trauma arising from exposure to terrorist content, which highlight the need for an emphasis on researcher welfare. We find that researcher welfare is a neglected aspect of ethics review processes however, with most interviewees not required to gain ethics approval for their research resulting in very little attention to researcher welfare issues. Interviewees were frustrated with ethics processes, indicating that committees oftentimes lacked the requisite knowledge to make informed ethical decisions. Highlighted by interviewees too was a concern that greater emphasis on researcher welfare could result in blockages to their ‘risky’ research, creating a ‘Catch 22’: interviewees would like more emphasis on their (and colleagues’) welfare and provision of concomitant supports, but feel that increased oversight would make gaining ethics approval for their research more difficult, or even impossible. We offer suggestions for breaking the impasse, including more interactions between ethics committees and researchers; development of tailored guidelines; and more case studies reflecting on ethics processes.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the performance of search engine chatbots powered by large language models in generative political information retrieval. Applying algorithmic accountability as a central theme, this research (a) assesses the alignment of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot responses with timely political information, (b) investigates the factual correctness and transparency of chatbot-sourced synopses, (c) examines the adherence of chatbots to democratic norms and impartiality ideals, (d) analyzes the sourcing and attribution behaviors of the chatbots, and (e) explores the universality of chatbot gatekeeping across different languages. Using the 2024 Taiwan presidential election as a case study and prompting as a method, the study audits responses from Microsoft Copilot in five languages. The findings reveal significant discrepancies in information readiness, content accuracy, norm adherence, source usage, and attribution behavior across languages. These results underscore the contextual awareness when applying accountability assessment that looks beyond transparency in AI-mediated communication, especially during politically sensitive events.",

          "abstract": "Public discussions of controversial science fields like COVID-19 or climate science increasingly address inner-scientific structures and the norms guiding the scientific system—aspects that are normally discussed within the scientific community. However, not much is known about the endorsement of scientific norms by non-scientists and how those endorsements differ between controversial und uncontroversial science fields. We conducted a cross-sectional national survey in Germany ( N = 1007) to capture the public endorsement of scientific norms and explored the role of the science field, political ideology, and science news consumption. Results suggest that the endorsement of scientific norms is significantly higher in controversial fields than in less controversial fields. More left-leaning political ideology is connected to higher levels of norm endorsement; science news consumption is partly associated with lower scientific norm endorsement. We discuss our findings regarding their implications for the public’s image and understanding of controversial science fields.",

          "abstract": "Implementing artificial intelligence also requires examinations of public attitudes and perceptions. One approach is by examining media framing of artificial intelligence, including news coverage, which is a reflection of societal perceptions and a key influence over people’s understanding. As such, this study examines the framing of communicative artificial intelligence in Singapore, looking at how the news media frame communicative artificial intelligence and characterize it as a social actor. Through a manual content analysis of 336 news articles from three major news websites in Singapore, this study found that the news media in Singapore tend to focus on the benefits and advances of communicative artificial intelligence and portray communicative artificial intelligence as a tool rather than social actor. However, when comparing news coverage of communicative artificial intelligence after the advent of ChatGPT, the news framed communicative artificial intelligence more in terms of risks, regulations, responsibilities, and conflict.",

          "abstract": "Public and vocal calls by Algerian feminist groups to revise restrictive laws about women during the 2019 Hirak (“protest” in Arabic) were met with physical and online violence from both pro-government and reformist groups. Theories considering the role of public spaces in advancing democratic efforts differ on strategy and method for inclusion of marginalized voices. Through structured open-ended questionnaires with Algerian feminist demonstrators, this study probes the perceived efficacy of various democratic-advancing tactics. Findings show a reticence on the part of Algerian feminists in cultivating open social media spaces or efforts to assimilate into a single public and echo previous findings of those advocating for a more disputed perspective on democracy.",

          "authors": "Zehang Xie",
          "abstract": "Generative chatbots based on artificial intelligence technology have become an essential channel for people to obtain health information. They provide not only comprehensive health information but also real-time virtual companionship. However, the health information provided by AI may not be completely accurate. Employing a 3 × 2 × 2 experimental design, the research examines the effects of interaction types with AI-generated content (AIGC), specifically under virtual companionship and knowledge acquisition scenarios, on the willingness to share health-related rumors. In addition, it explores the impact of the nature of the rumors (fear vs hope) and the role of altruistic tendencies in this context. The results show that people are more willing to share rumors in a knowledge acquisition situation. Fear-type rumors can stimulate people’s willingness to share more than hope-type rumors. Altruism plays a moderating role, increasing the willingness to share health rumors in the scenario of virtual companionship, while decreasing the willingness to share health rumors in the scenario of knowledge acquisition. These findings support Kelley’s three-dimensional attribution theory and negativity bias theory, and extend these results to the field of human–computer interaction. The results of this study help to understand the rumor spreading mechanism in the context of human–computer interaction and provide theoretical support for the improvement of health chatbots.",

          "authors": "Yash Vekaria, Zubair Shafiq, Savvas Zannettou",
          "abstract": "Online platforms have enacted various policies to maintain a safe and trustworthy advertising environment. However, the extent to which these policies are adhered to and enforced remains a subject of interest and concern. In this work, we present a large-scale audit of adult advertising on Twitter (now X), specifically focusing on compliance with its adult (sexual) content advertising policy. Twitter is an interesting case study in that it—uniquely from other social media platforms—allows posting of adult content but prohibits adult content in advertising. We analyze approximately 35,000 ads on Twitter with respect to their compliance with the adult content ad policy through Perspective API and manual annotations. Among other things, we find that nearly 38% of ads violate Twitter’s adult content advertising policy—of which, the platform eventually removed only about 63% of these non-compliant adult ads. We also find inconsistencies in the moderation of such ads across languages, highlighting the need for more reliable and consistent moderation practices across different languages. Overall, our findings highlight blindspots in Twitter’s adult ad policy enforcement for certain languages and countries. Our work underscores the importance of external audits to monitor compliance and improve transparency in online advertising.",

They do so by reporting on the findings of visual content and semiotic analysis of smart home images published in architectural media. They identify two modalities of smart home images published in these media – images in which smart home technologies are visible and those in which they are implicitly hidden. They read these images as constituting two semiotic myths of home: as familiar places of belonging for both people and smart objects, and as exceptional spaces of luxury associated with freedom from domestic labor delivered by smart technologies. They argue that these myths are central to securing social acceptance of the smart home by signifying it to be both trustworthy and aspirational.",

          "abstract": "Wealth inequality is deepening in many countries around the world, presenting increasing challenges to public notions of fairness while simultaneously proving resistant to democratic intervention. This article looks at one element of the politics of wealth inequality which has so far received relatively little attention: visual representations in political communication. The authors collected an original dataset of 243 images posted on Facebook by UK news media and civil society organizations to explore how different actors visually represent the problem of wealth inequality. They used content analysis to demonstrate that news media in particular tends to visualize inequality through images of wealth itself, such as luxury goods and property, whereas civil society more often tries to contrast richness and poorness. They conducted social semiotic analysis on two sets of recurring tropes to investigate the complex trade-offs in how visual content frames inequality, whether through ambivalent focus on the super-rich or a claim to objectivity and completeness through birds-eye aerial photography.",
