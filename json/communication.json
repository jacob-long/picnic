          "authors": "Julia Limb, Earvin Charles Cabalquinto, Justine Humphry",
          "abstract": "This article investigates how the home is performed by two differing groups of women in Australia through gendered care practices and domestic representations in digital spaces. Specifically, it examines the ways Australian women craft bloggers use Instagram and older Filipina-Australians use Facebook to enact diverse modes of mediated care in and beyond the home setting. The analysis draws on two separate ethnographic studies. The first study involved six Australian women to investigate their craft blogging practices on Instagram from 2014 to 2019 where they engaged their varying sized online audiences ranging from 1000 to more than 100,000 followers. The second study included 15 older Filipina-Australians in Victoria, Australia in March 2023 to understand their digital care practices using Facebook to maintain transnational connections among family members and peers. The studies utilised in-person research interviews, visual methods and a digital ethnography. This article extends the model of the moral economy of the household to highlight a range of mediated domestic and care practices carried out across physical and digital spaces shaped by gendered labour practices, transborder care expectations and digital platform affordances. These practices reveal the role of the home as a site and symbol for these different groups in negotiating the tensions of the unequal division of social reproduction and care within the Globalised Care Chain.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we evaluate the politics of recommendation engines by focusing on an indispensible feature of their operation: training. We use the notion of training as a key word which helps us link three bodies of knowledge: data science, the history of automation, and aesthetic and political theory. Training is a staple in the operation of algorithmic systems, and artificial intelligence more generally; it is a practical methodology by which these systems become intelligent. Training is also a key feature of how workers throughout history came to perform their labor, and how, during the 20 th century, machines came to acquire this human ability, that is, automation. And lastly, drawing on Immanuel Kant’s theory of aesthetic judgment, Hannah Arendt offers a political theory where training is key to political judgment. We trace the meaning and significance of ‘training’ in these three fields in order to draw conclusions from one field to another.",

          "authors": "Rituparna Banerjee, Saumava Mitra",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the visual politics of gender in electoral politics in West Bengal (WB). We examine how women political candidates visually construct their non-verbal political performance on social media, and how such visuals relate to social mores and societal expectations surrounding femininity. Drawing on theories of the social construction of gender and visual political communication, we conducted a content analysis of 1,033 visual artefacts from eight individual women candidates and 205 from the Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) pages of the four main political parties taking part in the January-April 2021 electoral campaign for state-level elections in WB. We analysed how these candidates construct gendered relationships with the electorate through different cues on the platforms, such as sartorial choices (traditional or Western attire), use of culture-specific religious symbols (sindoor or vermillion, bindi – forehead marking worn by married Hindu women), and gendered/non-gendered political actions like cooking or serving food, giving speeches or meeting constituents in political processions. Our findings about the visually performed politics show a combination of cultural, political, and gender signifiers, which are mediated and remain connected to societal expectations, and historical narratives. The candidates’ negotiation of these aspects, in turn, underscores a reproduction of colonial legacies and, in the present day, an ongoing production of societal differences. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on visual politics of gender, particularly in Asian contexts. It sheds light on the nuanced ways women politicians use social media to construct their visual identities, and how the deployment of body politics into the relatively ‘new’ online sphere reifies ‘old’ social, political, cultural symbolisms, and norms regarding gender. In this way, this article highlights the importance of considering pre-digital forms of gendered identity construction and visual representation when analysing the contested terrain of digital visibilities.",

          "authors": "Ausma Bernot, Fan Yang, Sara E Davies",
          "abstract": "In China, the escalating repression of gender and sexual diversity has given rise to ‘queer necropolitics’. ‘Queer necropolitics’ – a concept we build on – refers to the hegemonic ability to determine who is allowed to suffer, survive, or thrive. We examine China’s sustained re-enforcement of traditional gender norms, which has rendered queer communities non-existent from official recognition. In this context, we aim to understand how China’s state queer necropolitics has shaped queer organising in the country. From 2021 to 2022, we conducted 26 semi-structured interviews with a diverse cohort of self-identified LGBTIQ+ members and activists across 12 provinces in China. We find that the interplay of legal invisibility and politicised, moralised visibility has placed queer communities under hegemonic governance techniques of suppression. The paper argues that China’s queer necropolitics has established invisible activism. The juxtaposition of invisibility with activism denotes the quiet, implicit, and everyday embodied acts of communal care among queer communities as a form of resistance. Building on the metaphor of ‘glowing fireflies’ shared by a research participant, invisible activism presents a more sustainable approach than conventional rights-based activism. The paper expands our understanding of politically antagonistic practices, acknowledging the diversity and complexity embedded within queer activism.",

          "abstract": "The present study explores early adopters’ domestication processes of ChatGPT and Midjourney in the early phase of generative AI’s public breakthrough. To study this process, we conducted an online ethnography in two dominant AI forums on Reddit: r/chatgpt and r/midjourney. Drawing on domestication theory (Silverstone and Hirsch, 1992), we describe three modalities of domestication and argue they represent an emerging cultural approach to generative AI with potential to influence broader domestication and adoption of generative AI. Our findings show that early adopters’ domestication processes are collaborative and fueled by playful and nontelic activity, that is, non-purpose-driven behavior (Abend et al., 2020), where new content genres and transmedia practices (Jenkins, 2007) emerge and serve as an entryway into understanding and domesticating the technology. We identify three distinct modalities of domestication in relation to generative AI: jailbreaking, roleplaying, and playing ‘what if’. Our analysis highlights how non-purpose-driven and playful engagement with generative AI drives a highly collaborative domestication process among users. In this process, generative AI serves a double role as both the object and enabler of domestication. Based on the analysis, we argue for the need to take collaboration, affect, and playfulness into consideration in studies of users’ technology domestication processes.",

          "authors": "Signe Ivask, Pille Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt",
          "abstract": "While a substantial body of research has explored the intricate relationship between journalists and metrics, there remains a notable gap in systematically understanding how evolving metrics over time influence journalists’ use of data as feedback. This study addresses this gap by investigating how alterations in the most valued metrics influence the utilisation of audience data for reflection and feedback in national and local newsrooms. The study spans multiple waves from 2012 to 2023 and comprises 72 interviews with Estonian journalists. It employs the Data Loop framework to analyse the circulation of audience data among media institutions, audiences, newsrooms, and individual journalists’ reflexive actions. Examining data reflexivity within newsrooms involves considering the interplay between newsroom culture, metrics-gathering technology, external pressures from changing business models, and journalistic agency. Over time, the metrics valued by newsroom managers have shifted – from prioritising clicks as a measure of audience interest to rewarding journalists based on minutes spent on stories or the acquisition of subscriptions. In this article, we argue that instead of considering the audiences behind the data, journalists and editors mostly use the data offered by metrics to reflect on their work. Noteworthy trends include journalists conforming to data dominance and shaping their work to align with prevailing metrics, particularly in the context of paywalls where individual article readership can be linked with direct income through subscriptions. Contextualising newsroom data within the Data Loop, this study illustrates how data serves as a source for reflections at both the individual and newsroom culture levels. Despite assertions of an audience turn, our findings indicate that a focus on metrics does not necessarily signify a focus on the audience but rather an unwavering interest in journalistic production.",

          "authors": "Shihe Pan, Jungwon Kuem",
          "abstract": "Purpose People are often recognized as the weakest part of thwarting phishing attacks. The goal of preventing phishing can conflict with the goal of keeping a good level of productivity in daily work; however, we still lack an understanding of this multigoal scenario. This paper aims to develop and test a new model of antiphishing performance, especially in relation to individuals' task performance in daily work. Drawing on the extended multiple-goal pursuit model (MGPM*), we examined the relationship between task performance at a time point and the subsequent antiphishing performance as well as how this relationship differs across varying types of phishing emails and attention levels to phishing cues. Design/methodology/approach We tested the model by conducting a field experiment with a survey questionnaire. Four legitimate work emails and four phishing emails (consisting of two work-related and two work-unrelated emails) were sent to 357 participants. The data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Findings The results indicate that task performance at a time point has a curvilinear relationship with subsequent antiphishing performance. This relationship is moderated by the types of phishing emails and individuals' attention to phishing cues. For work-related phishing emails, task performance is negatively associated with antiphishing performance when it reaches an intermediate level; however, when task performance is low, or high to an extent, it is positively related to antiphishing performance. For work-unrelated phishing emails, there is a positive association between task performance and antiphishing performance. Moreover, attention to phishing cues moderates the curvilinear relationship between task performance and antiphishing performance such that when task performance reaches an intermediate level, as attention to phishing cues increases, the relationship between task performance and antiphishing performance will turn from negative to positive. Practical implications This paper has practical implications that bear on the conflict between antiphishing performance and task performance. Originality/value This paper sheds light on the potential of the extended multiple-goal pursuit model in studying antiphishing behavior.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Brands can build meaningful, effective connections with consumers through digital influencers. This paper aims to understand the factors determining digital influencers’ success concerning brand-related (i.e. intention to follow influencer advice) and influencer-related (i.e. intention to recommend the influencer) outcomes. We present a conceptual model derived from established theories and psychological reasoning, identifying influencer authenticity and perceived value as important antecedents. We present satisfaction with the influencer and influencer credibility as the psychological mechanism explaining why antecedents transform into favorable outcomes. Design/methodology/approach With structural equation modeling and two studies (N1 = 814; N2 = 685) relying on active followers from two countries (the UK and India), this paper examines the direct and indirect effects of the value and authenticity of digital influencers on followers’ behavioral outcomes and the cultural context’s potential moderating effect. Findings Authenticity and value of digital influencers positively affect intention to follow influencer advice and recommend the influencer. Such effects are mediated by follower satisfaction and influencer credibility. The effects of influencer authenticity and value on intentions to follow and recommend are not stronger in India than in the UK. Originality/value We contribute to the literature by presenting a theoretically informed framework capturing the antecedents of successful influencers and the importance of differentiating brand-related and influencer-related outcomes. Furthermore, our studies highlight that research findings about influencers’ impact may not be generalizable to other cultural contexts.",

          "authors": "Ahmad Aljarah, Blend Ibrahim, Manuela López",
          "abstract": "Purpose Synthetic advertising, which involves creating or modifying ads through artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has recently transformed the field of media and advertising. Despite its emerging importance, our understanding of consumer perceptions in this context is limited. This study is one of the first to explore the impact of synthetic advertising on consumer behavior. Design/methodology/approach Across two between-subject experimental studies, using coffee shop customers in the USA, we tested how, why and when awareness of falsity in AI-generated corporate social responsibility (CSR) ads affects online brand engagement. Findings In Study 1, awareness of falsity in AI-generated CSR ads negatively impacts online brand engagement, with perceived sincerity mediating this relationship. Additionally, a higher level of CSR authenticity mitigates the negative effect of awareness of falsity on online brand engagement. CSR authenticity does not moderate the mediation effect of perceived sincerity in the relationship between awareness of falsity and online brand engagement. In Study 2, the relationship between awareness of falsity and online brand engagement is moderated by brand familiarity. Importantly, perceived sincerity only mediates this effect for unfamiliar brands, not familiar ones. Practical implications This study provides key insights for managers using AI to promote CSR initiatives. While AI can save time and budget, it may lead to negative consumer reactions due to perceptions of insincerity. To mitigate this, companies should focus on enhancing the authenticity of their CSR efforts and humanizing AI-generated ads. Additionally, established brands should be cautious of reduced consumer engagement with AI-generated content, while unfamiliar brands can benefit by emphasizing sincerity in their messaging. Originality/value This paper is one of the first studies that discuss how, why and when awareness of falsity in AI-generated corporate social responsibility ads affects online brand engagement.",

However, many users lack knowledge of their existence and application. This study reports the results of a pre-registered longitudinal experiment aimed at encouraging Internet users to install and use Tor, which enables anonymous browsing. The study compares two soft-paternalistic interventions: a social norm nudge and an educational boost, each with positive and negative framing. The data ( N T1  = 1,450; N T2  = 1,171) were based on a sample representative of German online users. The study finds that targeting users’ literacy and framing Tor as a PET, rather than as a darknet technology, increases users’ motivation to install and use the browser. However, the effects are only observed in the short-term and do not translate into actual behavior. We discuss implications for theory and practice regarding the effectiveness of interventions encouraging PET adoption.",

However, the model’s conceptualization of PSI and its implications have not been empirically tested yet. The study aims to test two central assumptions of the model. In an experiment with 128 participants, obtrusiveness and addressing of a persona were manipulated and the effects on experienced perceptual-cognitive, affective, and conative parasocial interaction were tested. As expected, obtrusiveness appeared as a significant predictor of the intensity of parasocial interactions. An effect of addressing could not be found. The study partially supports the assumptions of the Two-Level Model.",

          "abstract": "Siblings are children’s most frequent daily companions in middle childhood and these relationships are theorized to be dynamic in nature but are rarely studied in a way that captures their day-to-day variation. Guided by cultural-ecological and relationship perspectives, this study examined the role of older siblings’ familism values and caring roles as predictors of average levels of and day-to-day variation in siblings’ positive and negative exchanges across seven days and tested moderation by child sex. Participants were older ( M = 10.6 years; SD = 0.39; 46.6% female) and younger siblings ( M = 8.2 years; SD = 1.07; 47.2% female) in 307 Latino sibling dyads recruited from 11 elementary schools in the southwestern U.S. Data were collected via home visits with parents, and in afterschool sessions and seven nightly phone calls with siblings. Analyses were conducted using a random variability model in a multilevel structural equation modeling approach. Findings revealed consistent associations between older siblings’ familism values and sibling roles and both average levels of and intraindividual variation in older siblings’ positivity and negativity. For younger siblings, some findings were moderated by child sex with more consistent links to younger sisters’ positivity and negativity than younger brothers’. Discussion highlights how older siblings’ cultural values and roles shape both overall levels of and day-to-day fluctuations in siblings’ exchanges and offers future directions of research.",

          "authors": "Yunzhi Zheng, Daniel K. Smedley, Jonathan G. Kimmes",
          "abstract": "Building upon the evidence supporting the interpersonal benefits of trait mindfulness, efforts to understand mindfulness in the context of intimate relationships (i.e., relationship mindfulness) have been made to better predict relationship outcomes. To further understand the relationship benefits of mindfulness, it is crucial to take a closer look at for whom and under what conditions trait mindfulness translates into relationship mindfulness. In this study, we examined the moderating effects of one’s own and their partner’s mental well-being on the positive link between trait mindfulness and relationship mindfulness. Specifically, we expected this link to be weaker for those who themselves or their partners reported worse mental well-being as poor mental well-being may pull couples inward, away from showing up mindfully in relationships. A sample of 115 different-sex married couples completed an online questionnaire that included measures of trait mindfulness, relationship mindfulness, and markers of mental well-being (i.e., depression, anxiety, loneliness). A series of actor-partner interdependence moderation models showed that, consistent with our hypotheses, the link between husbands’ trait mindfulness and relationship mindfulness was weaker if husbands or their wives reported higher depression or anxiety. Therefore, couples may benefit more if mindfulness-based couple interventions directly target how partners can use mindfulness skills to stay connected even when facing mental health challenges. This study also further highlights the importance of considering various relational contexts for mindfulness research and interventions.",

However, prior work often compares game-based interventions with the conventional non-game approach, failing to generate insights about which game features should be emphasized to create more effective games. To bridge this research gap, in light of video games’ advantages for creating immersive experiences that benefit persuasion, we created a narrative-based serious game addressing school bullying and conducted two studies (Study 1, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 130; Study 2, &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 250) to explore the persuasive effects of two game features, respectively player–avatar similarity and in-game control, on player experience (including player–avatar identification, narrative engagement, and empathy) and prosocial intention. We found mixed results subject to player perspective such that only when players took the bully’s perspective did one of the game features—in-game control—successfully create the intended empathy via amplified narrative engagement toward the desirable prosocial intention.",

          "abstract": "Using citizens’ data not only enables precise targeting of campaign messages online, but also the deliberate exclusion of certain groups of citizens. This study asks (a) to what extent have citizens been excluded from political (online) ads during the Dutch 2021 and 2023 election campaigns and (b) how acceptable citizens find the practice of exclusion. To answer these questions, we use data from the Meta Ad Targeting dataset to investigate any employed exclusion criteria by parties and rely on survey data collected during the 2023 Dutch general election to learn about citizens’ opinions. Our study reveals that political parties across the spectrum allocated less budget to targeting and excluding citizens in 2023 compared to 2021. Predominantly, exclusion is based on age, gender, and place of residence, with criteria such as political views, migration background, and religious beliefs being relatively uncommon. Despite citizens considering all forms of exclusion unacceptable, they view exclusion based on political views as the most tolerable. Moreover, individuals leaning towards the political right exhibit greater acceptance of exclusion, particularly based on migration background. In scrutinizing the extent of citizen exclusion from political campaign messaging and citizens’ perceptions, we contribute to the discourse on the unintended consequences of data-driven campaigning.",

It starts with a technological perspective, contextualising the evolution of immersive technologies and their interpretation from a technological determinism point of view. Secondly, the ecological perspective provides an integrative reading of the technique, its use, and its experience, based on the concept of the environment. Finally, and after acknowledging previous research on the effects of immersive media on the audience, the article considers the narrative elements that are reinforced by immersive technologies in journalism and nonfiction, based on the qualitative analysis of projects. The article highlights narrative resources associated with the social character of the story, the spatio-temporal framework, and the emotional impact. It suggests a shift towards “narrative determinism,” which would allow us to analyse and employ immersive resources in terms of their contribution to storytelling and to overcome the limitations of perspectives that are highly dependent on specific platforms or technologies.",

          "abstract": "While the connection between social networking sites (SNSs) and body image has been reported more broadly in prior literature, the link between SNSs and muscle dysmorphia (MD) is less understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the strength and nature of the relationship between MD and SNSs among men in the general population. With SNSs allowing users to view and interact with online content, this study focussed on three SNS activities: (a) viewing men’s celebrity and fashion content, (b) viewing fitness-related content and (c) the importance of received likes and comments. Young men ( N = 95) completed an online questionnaire recording demographic information, SNS activities and MD symptomatology. A hierarchal regression revealed that the importance of received likes and comments significantly predicted MD symptomatology over and above demographic factors. These findings reflect a need to emphasise the interactive components of SNSs within body image literature.",

Drawing upon the intergroup contact hypothesis and social penetration theory, a national sample of U.S. adults ( N = 1,596) participated in a 3 (sexual identity cue: explicit-cue vs implicit-cue vs no-cue) × 5 (coping with mental disorders: good-coping vs balanced-coping vs poor-coping vs no-coping vs control) between-subjects experiment. Results revealed that while dual stigma disclosure occasionally showed enhanced positive impacts, it never exacerbated stigmatized attitudes compared to single stigma disclosure. In addition, the two self-disclosure strategies interacted to influence destigmatization, mediated by perceived competence rather than perceived authenticity. Implications from the findings are provided.",

          "abstract": "A funa, a public denouncement aimed at raising moral condemnation of a person accused of perpetrating a crime or injustice, has become a major digital activism instrument in Latin America, particularly in Chile. Originated in the human rights movement in the 1990s, funas re-emerged as a new form of online activism that hybridized with a Latin American and historical form of protest to exert informal justice through social media. Drawing on a face-to-face survey of Chilean youth aged 18–29 years, we examine the factors that explain young people’s attitudes and behaviors regarding funas. We find that funas are gendered, with issues like sexual harassment and misconduct being the primary subject of funas. We also show that women hold more positive views about funas and are more likely to engage in online funas. Finally, our findings indicate that individuals who trust the judicial system are less likely to share funas on social media.",

In the Danish news media, PtX has experienced a steep rise in attention, which calls for studies of how PtX is made sense of as a societal, not only a technological, phenomenon. Informed by the notion of sociotechnical imaginaries, this article investigates the local introduction of PtX in Frederica, one of the forerunner towns for PtX in Denmark, as represented in the coverage of the daily newspaper Fredericia Dagblad . The study analyses how PtX is made sense of by being connected to local actors, circumstances, and imagined futures. Two diverging sociotechnical imaginaries are identified, centring on 1) local (business) cooperation for green energy solutions towards a PtX adventure, and 2) concerns for scarce nature in a densely industrialised area. The findings show both similarities with and differences to already known mediatised environmental conflicts and point to dynamics between media, market, politics, and civil society in future mediatised environmental conflicts.",

          "abstract": "Attachment anxiety is expected to motivate people to seek excessive attention, reassurance, and help from their attachment figures. However, prior studies assessing links between attachment anxiety and this hyperactivating support‐seeking strategy have yielded inconsistent results. To advance this literature, the current research focused on the disclosure of negative personal experiences (i.e., disclosure decisions and disclosure strategies), an overlooked step in the support‐seeking process where hyperactivation may occur. Participants ( N = 444) reported whether and how they shared up to four recent negative events with up to three attachment figures, and they reported their relationship‐specific attachment toward each figure (to improve measurement precision). Participants were more likely to report sharing negative events with attachment figures to whom they reported greater attachment anxiety, especially when they also perceived low responsiveness in that relationship. Additionally, participants reported that they displayed greater distress, downplayed their personal responsibility more, and emphasized a need for help more when disclosing negative events in relationships with greater attachment anxiety (behaviors that facilitate support receipt and decrease the risk of rejection). This study helps to clarify links between attachment anxiety and support seeking and provides one of the first empirical demonstrations of strategic support seeking in anxiously attached relationships.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence in general and ChatGPT in particular have risen in importance. ChatGPT is widely known and used increasingly as an information source for different topics, including science. It is therefore relevant to examine how ChatGPT portrays science and science-related issues. Research on this question is lacking, however. Hence, we simulate “interviews” with ChatGPT and reconstruct how it presents science, science communication, scientific misbehavior, and controversial scientific issues. Combining qualitative and quantitative content analysis, we find that, generally, ChatGPT portrays science largely as the STEM disciplines, in a positivist-empiricist way and a positive light. When comparing ChatGPT’s responses to different simulated user profiles and responses from the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions, we find similarities in that the scientific consensus on questions such as climate change, COVID-19 vaccinations, or astrology is consistently conveyed across them. Beyond these similarities in substance, however, pronounced differences are found in the personalization of responses to different user profiles and between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.",

To examine this proposition, we conducted to a two-wave panel study in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Analyses were conducted by means of structural equation modeling (SEM) using the AMOS SPSS software, where a statistical model was performed for each type of psychological distance. The findings revealed two statistically significant paths that go from social media to violent environmental collective action, mediated, first, by each of the psychological distances and, second, by social identity and negative emotions (anger and fear). In addition, it was observed that only probability distance on its own acted as a mediator in the relationship between social media and violent environmental collective action. It was also observed that a path from social media to violent environmental collective action was mediated, first, by three types of distances (probability, spatial, and temporal) and, second, by participative efficacy.",

          "abstract": "This study focuses on the affordances of bounded social media places (BSMPs), low visibility places within social media platforms like private messaging and private groups. While researchers have focused on BSMPs within specific platforms, this study presents a systematic examination of BSMPs across multiple platforms to facilitate theoretical durability. Interviews with users of BSMPs across diverse platforms ( N = 35) reveal that BSMPs discourage the affordance of visibility as they are considered private due to visibility management mechanisms and trust in known audiences. They encourage personalization as users believe they receive relevant content from and can send relevant content to specific audiences, in the absence of algorithms. BSMPs also encourage synchronicity by facilitating continuous conversations. The strength of encouragement or discouragement of these affordances varies across different BSMPs and is informed by users’ social positions. This study therefore contributes a framework and shared terminology for future research on BSMPs across social media.",

          "abstract": "After the Dobbs decision ended federal abortion protection in the United States, experts raised concerns about digital data collected from people seeking abortions. U.S. technology corporations—Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon—were conspicuously silent. Instead, GAMMA (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon) released statements and/or policies surrounding commitments to data privacy seemingly incongruous with surveillance-based business models. We examine GAMMA’s policies, statements, and associated news coverage post-Roe through commodity activism and politics of care. We reveal recurring discourses that cast technical privacy features as sufficiently protective alongside scrupulous data practices by users and that constrain the purview of company responsibility to full-time employees. A focus on responsible data management sidesteps critiques of data collection, framing GAMMA’s policy changes as corporate care but furthering commodification of individual privacy, reproducing the neoliberal subject, and upholding surveillance capitalism.",

          "abstract": "Data-driven political campaigning strategies often remain a black box for citizens; however, educational interventions provide a means to enhance understanding, conscious evaluations, and skills. In this context, we term this combination digital campaign competence (DCC). We conducted an online pre-registered experiment in Austria ( N = 553) using a 2 × 2 between-subject design to compare intervention formats (reading a voter guide vs. playing a campaign game) and content framing (emphasizing risks vs. benefits of data-driven campaigning) plus a control condition. Results show no significant differences in framing on DCC. However, variations are observed among different formats, with the non-interactive voter guide proving to be the most effective one. Contrary to our expectations, the voter guide emphasizing the risks of data-driven political campaigning enhanced conceptual understanding levels, influenced evaluative perceptions, and aided skill development to detect highly targeted ads. We argue that innovative interventions do not always guarantee success in enhancing competencies.",

          "authors": "James Fitzgerald, Ayse D. Lokmanoglu, Debora Salles, Rose Marie Santini",
          "abstract": "This comparative study examines the interplay of religious messaging and disinformation in the election campaign material of Jair Bolsonaro and Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the 2022 Brazilian and 2023 Turkish presidential elections. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining computational keyword filtering and content analysis with qualitative discourse analysis and applied to a corpus of 10,519 posts across seven social media platforms. The analysis informs two key findings. First, in both Bolsonaro and Erdogan’s presidential campaigns, religious rhetoric and symbolism is used to bolster personal authority and in-group support to consolidate the idea of (presiding over) a majority bloc. Second, while disinformation interfaces with religious messaging in both presidential campaigns, we find that religion is overwhelmingly instrumentalized as a vector for political disinformation—thus, we did not identify any significant presence of “religious disinformation,” classically understood. Ultimately, our article creates space for further comparative and region-specific scholarship to explore how religion, politics, and disinformation intersect with authoritarian populism in modern elections and beyond, while also contributing to the conceptual refinement of “religious disinformation.”",

          "authors": "Dennis Steffan, Maria Elizabeth Grabe, Umberto Famulari",
          "abstract": "An evolving body of research generally referred to as visual politics has brought the heavy research focus on linguistic modalities of political communication closer to parity with visual emphasis. The study reported here transcends this schism by joining momentum toward multimodality as an ontological departure point for research. We expanded an existing visual instrument into a multimodal one and provided evidence that it reliably captures character framing of political candidates (stateliness, compassion, mass appeal, ordinariness, and sure loser) in German, Polish, and United States commercial online news. We focused on election coverage in these countries because they represent three distinct political and media systems (democratic-corporatist, polarized-pluralist, and hybrid) of the Global North. The quantitative content analysis sample we used spans 2,688 online news stories with seven political candidates identified in 6,560 cases across six modalities (still images, moving images, frozen video images, text, audio, and superimposed text). We found support for the hypothesis that political and media system latencies affect how news media frame the character traits of political candidates in both visual and linguistic modalities. Specifically, the competitive tendencies of majoritarian democracies manifested more clearly as candidate-centered, simplistic, and polarizing character framing in US media content than in journalistic output of multiparty consensus democracies. For example, US news media were more consistent in their portrayal of election winners and losers than German and Polish news media, emphasizing stateliness, compassion, and ordinariness in the winner while unambiguously assigning the negative sure loser frame to the election loser.",

          "authors": "Hwayong Shin",
          "abstract": "News sources that correct misinformation seek to foster an informed citizenry and promote democratic accountability. One such effort is being made by fact-checking sites across the globe. However, public trust in these outlets remains limited. Is their politics-focused coverage one factor behind the limited trust? Politics-focused coverage highlights partisan competition, which can harm credibility by activating identity-protective biases or resistance to persuasive intent. Prior research suggests depoliticized contexts can help mitigate defensive psychological tendencies in news source assessments. Thus, a potential approach to build broad-based trust could be to broaden the scope of coverage to include nonpolitical topics. Through a preregistered survey experiment in the United States, I test how the topical scope of coverage affects source credibility perceptions. Compared to politics-focused coverage, science-focused coverage improves credibility assessments. Focusing solely or partially on popular culture topics such as entertainment, sports, and lifestyle reduces source credibility. The effects of nonpolitical coverage on source credibility perceptions are similar across partisan groups. The results suggest the public shares the notion that serious public affairs coverage is central to reputable journalism. Overall, coverage of politics and science fares relatively well in building source credibility, whereas coverage of popular culture undermines credibility assessments. People find news sources that correct misinformation more credible when they cover a range of serious topics, but less credible when they cover lighter topics.",
