          "abstract": "This study examines 4,313 research articles published in 94 Social Science Citation Indexed (SSCI) communication journals in October 2020-September 2021 to determine the journals’ research orientations and compare how journal-level attributes affect the three major citation metrics: Journal Impact Factor (JIF), SCImago Journal Ranking (SJR), and H5-indexes. Quantitative orientation and technology-related focus are the two most important journal attribute predictors of JIF. Journals publishing both quantitative and qualitative research in balanced proportion have the highest citation metrics in SJR and H5-index but not JIF. Our study also documents the continuing dominance of English language journals and publishers in communication scholarship.",

          "authors": "Vera Tolz, Stephen Hutchings, Vitaly Kazakov, Sofia Tipaldou",
          "abstract": "This article offers a new conceptual model of disinformation which accounts for the performative status of disinformation accusations, and the dialogistic interaction between accusers and accused, within a multi-aspectual dynamic process involving diverse actors (including those disassociated from various forms of deceit). The model shows how claims acquire or lose their disinformation status, as they transgress temporal, geopolitical, and linguacultural boundaries, those of media genre and platform, as well as, crucially, the boundary separating primary (disinformation) from secondary (counter-disinformation) discourses. We call our model “the lifecycle of disinformation,” as it captures both disinformation’s linear trajectories, and its capacity for constant self-renewal. While eschewing relativism, the article challenges the understanding of disinformation as referentially stable, demonstrably false content which still frames much disinformation research and underpins the working principles of counter-disinformation units (CDUs). To reconceive disinformation according to this model, we develop a 5-step analytical apparatus applicable in future research.",

          "abstract": "Remote-control technologies have expanded into homes, potentially transforming domestic dynamics by altering how pets are monitored, interacted with, and cared for within domestic environments. This study delves into the user experiences and societal implications of Enabot, a mobile surveillance robot designed for pets in China. We employ telepresence to gauge operators’ perception of being present in a mediated and physical environment, focusing on human-animal interactions and relationships. Drawing from semi-structured interviews with 22 Chinese users, this research puts forth a typology of ‘embodied projection’ to articulate rich telepresence encounters. Moreover, we establish connections between various forms of telepresence and mediated interactions within the triadic relationship of operator-pets-others (e.g., families, friends, colleagues), surpassing the design intent for operator-pet interactions. Notably, this study finds that when operators regard Enabot as an extension of themselves, they actively seek attention from their pets, which might signal a shift of power in the human-pet dynamic and a novel relationship. Ultimately, we conclude that the utilization of this robot fundamentally serves as an act of self-care for operators.",

Apart from film and TV production groups, European broadcasters/streamers are more nation-centric and less regionally integrated than in the late 20th century. The first section charts the international expansion of European broadcasters and documents how their regional integration began to unravel in the 2010s. Looking at the determinants, the second section argues that legacy broadcasters struggle to lift their digital revenue and are under immense pressure from streaming giants whose scale has created an uneven playing field. Using the global value chain (GVC) framework, the article draws a distinction between European lead firms (broadcasters and streamers) and their suppliers (e.g., film and TV content production groups). It contends that while the EU legislative framework supports the latter, it does not protect the former from global market forces.",

          "abstract": "This article analyses how the role and remit of public service media (PSM) and its relationship to current media and societal developments are framed in recent media policy discourses in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, countries often described as Media Welfare States (MWS). Employing the framework of discursive (media) institutionalism and frame analysis as a method, we analyse policy documents covering a 10-year period to identify differences in national PSM framing. Our findings confirm shared challenges related to platformisation, disinformation, audience fragmentation, and competition with commercial media. More interestingly, clear national differences emerge in how PSM is framed. Comparing these national findings to the four pillars of the MWS, we identify a recent paradigm shift where the consensus on the societal role and remit of PSM has weakened. We argue that future policymaking should consider these developments when discussing how best to safeguard Nordic PSM.",

          "abstract": "In World of Warcraft (WOW) , thousands of players work together to analyze the game's rules and maximize their rewards. Organized boosting—a paid player service—is widely seen as undermining the meritocratic ideal that ties rewards to effort and skill. Drawing on semistructured interviews with six former providers of boosting services, this study argues that optimization in digital games is not solely a strategic choice, but often a necessity shaped by financial pressures. The introduction of token-based economic elements, such as the WoW token, nudges players into financial speculation and wealth accumulation, transforming optimization into a form of labor. This study considers boosting within the framework of financialization, highlighting how optimization mirrors broader tensions in a game culture shaped by corporate commodification practices.",

In recent years, new developments in technology and changing societal structures have prompted researchers to consider how traditional theories fare when applied in new contexts. In this introductory essay, we begin with a discussion of the theoretical and pragmatic importance of this topic to researchers across the field of communication. We then introduce each of the five manuscripts included in the special issue and pose overarching themes. We conclude by identifying ongoing challenges to the study of communication and the self and offering suggestions for strategies to approach these topics moving forward.",

          "authors": "Ting Deng, Chunyong Tang, Yanzhao Lai",
          "abstract": "Purpose Research indicates that negative online reviews can detrimentally impact platform workers by decreasing their appeal. However, there is an existing gap in our understanding of how platform workers prevent such reviews from averting algorithmic challenges. Based on impression management theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how platform workers use impression management strategies to prevent negative online reviews during the delivery process. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a multi-method approach and employed two data sources: online communities and interviews. Our analysis is grounded in a comprehensive content review of 68,727 comments sourced from an online worker community and enriched by detailed interviews with 20 workers. Findings Our findings revealed that platform workers employ three main impression management strategies to prevent negative online reviews: cultivating relationships with restaurants, enhancing customer experience and strategically using the platform’s algorithmic rules. Practical implications Given the critical importance of impression management in the app-based work environment, platforms should actively support workers in managing impressions with various stakeholders. This involves adjusting evaluation systems to account for uncontrollable factors and enhancing customer perceptions through real-time updates. Additionally, improving algorithm accuracy and flexibility is crucial for reducing tensions between workers and platforms. Furthermore, stronger government oversight is necessary to ensure fair working conditions and protect workers’ rights in this evolving landscape. Originality/value This study sheds light on how platform workers prevent negative online reviews, making significant contributions to the existing literature on platform workers’ responses to algorithmic reputation. Our insights not only enhance existing impression management theory but also reveal how platform workers manage their interactions with restaurants, extending the focus beyond customer-platform dynamics. By highlighting worker autonomy and strategic behavior, the study deepens insights into their adaptive resilience within digital labor ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Purpose As the concept of the Metaverse continues to gain traction, the potential for esports within this virtual space is becoming increasingly clear. The public’s understanding of this recently emerged field has yet to be thoroughly investigated through empirical research and using naturally occurring data. This study aims to address this gap, providing valuable insights for both esports and technology industries. Design/methodology/approach The research employed machine learning to scrape comments made by social media users on the 50 most popular YouTube videos about Metaverse esports. The raw data ( N  = 40,140) went through extensive cleaning processes, and eventually, 19,871 comments were analysed through thematic analysis. The findings were subsequently anchored in the integration of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT) and the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI). Findings The thematic analysis identified 8,865 comments as uncategorised and 11,006 comments to conceptualise 5 key themes of public beliefs about Metaverse esports: (1) immersive experience and social connectivity (62%), (2) technical limitations of the current ecosystem (20%), (3) future possibilities (8%), (4) accessibility, inclusiveness and cost barriers (5%) and (5) health risks (5%). Practical implications Businesses must invest in moderation technologies and improve VR hardware, graphics and esports content; develop affordable access models; and prioritise user well-being via safety guidelines, health initiatives and engagement strategies. Originality/value To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to structure public beliefs about Metaverse esports using a qualitative analysis of naturally occurring data, making it of substantial value to society, as well as practice and scholarship in this rarely researched domain.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Existing research on how lottery-based promotions influence consumers’ online decisions and behaviors is limited. Drawing on prospect theory and regret literature, this study investigated the unexpected negative effect of online lottery promotions on consumer responses toward online retailers and the underlying mechanism as well as the boundary conditions. Design/methodology/approach We conducted three experimental studies to test hypotheses. Study 1 explored the main effect of outcome valence and the mediating role of consumer regret. Study 2 examined the moderating effect of dispositional optimism. Study 3 further examined the three-way interaction of outcome valence, dispositional optimism and promotion type. Findings Results revealed a significant effect of lottery promotion outcome valence on consumers’ overall online shopping satisfaction and repurchase intention, which is driven by feelings of regret and moderated by consumers’ dispositional optimism because of the difference in their internal reference point and perceived loss. Promotion type further moderates the above effect. In particular, outcome valence has a greater impact for optimistic consumers than for pessimistic consumers in hedonic, but not in utilitarian, promotions. Originality/value This research explored the adverse effect of online lottery outcome valence on consumer responses and the underlying mechanism. This study is among the first efforts examining the impact of non-price promotions on consumer regret from a prospect theory perspective and in an online context. Our findings also contribute to optimism literature by showing that individual differences in optimism bias can influence consumers’ online consumption decisions and experiences.",

          "abstract": "The implementation of warning labels has been shown to slow the spread of harmful content on social media, but the mechanisms by which these interventions affect individuals' sharing decisions are not yet known. This study sought to establish the efficacy of these interventions and to explore the mechanisms of their influence using two parallel studies conducted within the United States: an online experiment that tested the effects of cannabis warning labels on sharing intentions (N = 1,776), and a neuroimaging study (N = 40) to examine how warning labels influenced activity in brain regions implicated in sharing decisions. Results demonstrated that warning labels paired with cannabis posts reduced intentions to share and were associated with decreased activation of brain regions associated with self-processing compared to cannabis posts alone. These results suggest that warning labels may discourage sharing by negatively influencing perceptions of self-relevance.",

          "abstract": "While authenticity has been identified as pivotal on social media, it has not been studied as part of a broader value ecology shaping content evaluation. Addressing this gap, we investigated users’ evaluations of prominent Instagram genres in relation to perceptions of authenticity. A survey of 1,000 users from the United States, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea revealed transnational similarities in value-related interpretations of genres, alongside local variation. Participants described the most liked genres as expressing happiness, togetherness, and peacefulness, and authenticity was positively correlated with favorable evaluation of content across countries and genres. Ultimately, evaluation on Instagram is shaped by the intersection of perceived authenticity and pleasure derived from peaceful solitude or close social bonds. We conclude by reflecting on the utility of our multi-method approach and the importance of situating authenticity vis-à-vis other values in social media research.",

In the first preregistered study ( N participants = 338 and N trials = 9,464), the influence of GFL—using the middle dot—on gender representations of science and care jobs was assessed with self-reports. GFL shifted these representations towards gender parity compared to masculine and feminine generics. We observed small effects with this direct measure. Moving to an indirect measure, a second preregistered study ( N participants = 81 and N trials = 18,144) designed a new version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to evaluate gender and science/care job associations, presented in generic vs. GFL forms. We replicated the IAT effect of stereotype congruency. This effect was moderated by GFL. Findings support the relevance of GFL to modify gendered representations and stereotypical associations of science and care jobs, along with that of both feminization and masculinization of job titles.",

Further, anxiously attached individuals utilized more future focused language in their text messages to their partner; avoidant attachment did not independently predict language use in text messages. Overall, there is evidence to support the impact of attachment style on the frequency of, and language use in, text messages between romantic partners, which serves as a next step to understand how attachment may affect everyday communication.",

          "abstract": "Latent semantic similarity (LSS) is a measure of the similarity of information exchanges in a conversation. Challenging the assumption that higher LSS bears more positive psychological meaning, we propose that this association might depend on the type of conversation people have. On the one hand, the share-mind perspective would predict that higher LSS should be associated with more positive emotional experiences across the board. The broaden-and-build theory , on the other hand, would predict that higher LSS should be inversely associated with more positive emotional experiences specifically in pleasant conversations. Linear mixed modeling based on conversations among 50 long-term married couples supported the latter prediction. That is, partners experienced greater positive emotions when their overall information exchanges were more dissimilar in pleasant (but not conflict) conversations. This work highlights the importance of context in understanding the emotional correlates of LSS and exemplifies how modern natural language processing tools can be used to evaluate competing theory-driven hypotheses in social psychology.",

          "abstract": "This study examined similarities in adolescent sibling and friend relationship quality over an 8-month period during COVID-19. We hypothesized that youth would perceive the qualities of their friendships and sibships in similar ways and that these patterns would remain stable during this period. Participants included 312 adolescents ( M = 15.75, SD = 1.20) who rated positive (e.g., companionship) and negative (e.g., conflict) aspects in both relationships at both times. Cross-sectional latent profile analyses supported two profiles, namely an ambivalent sibship/harmonious friendship (i.e., moderate sibling warmth and conflict, high friendship positivity, low friendship negativity) profile and an affect-intense (i.e., high positivity, high negativity) profile that were similar across both relationships. Latent transition analyses demonstrated that most adolescents fit into the ambivalent sibship/harmonious friendship profile (89% at T1, 91% at T2) relative to the affect-intense profile (11% at T1, 9% at T2). Most (97%) adolescents in the ambivalent sibship/harmonious friendship profile at T1 remained in the profile at T2, whereas 57% of youth in the affect-intense profile remained in the same profile at T2. Adolescents who remained in the affect-intense profile reported more frequent sibling and friend aggression perpetration and friend, but not sibling, aggression victimization than those who remained in the ambivalent sibship/harmonious friendship profile. These results highlight the contextual dynamics of adolescent relationships, especially the importance in recognizing the similarities among sibships and friendships.",

          "abstract": "Trust is widely regarded as a fundamental psychological concept in the study of relationships yet—rather than being investigated as a primary, material focus—is often relegated to serving as a proxy for and/or a means to facilitate the exploration of aspects of relationship quality and functioning. We conducted two measurement-focused studies to garner deeper insight into the nature of trust in romantic relationships and explore an account of trust that reframes its development as a process of construction, rather than addition. In Study 1 ( N = 494), we explored the nature and structure of the construct of trust as put forward by Rempel et al. (1985) . In Study 2 ( N = 847), we then confirmed our findings from Study 1 and, using measurement invariance techniques and a refined version of Rempel et al.'s (1985) assessment, investigated the extent to which the trust of individuals involved in newly-formed relationships ( n Newly-formed = 387) versus individuals involved in long term relationships ( n Long-term = 460) reflect different conceptualizations of the construct. Across both studies, we (a) identified a compilation of items reflecting key factors of trust—Predictability (3 items), Dependability (4 items), and Faith (10 items)—resembling Rempel et al.'s (1985) framework; and (b) found broad sameness in the construct of trust across newly-formed and long-term relationships but also some granular differences that potentially suggest how the construct may change across stages of relationship development.",

          "abstract": "The present study explored the approaches employed by gay fathers to socialize their children regarding their family diversity and surrogacy origins. In-home, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 80 gay fathers (representing 40 families) with at least one child aged 3–9 years ( M = 5.94, SD = 2.35; 52.50% assigned female at birth) who had been conceived via surrogacy. Three distinct socialization approaches were identified using reflexive thematic analysis: proactive, cautious, and neutral. The proactive approach was most prevalent, with fathers initiating discussion and fostering pride in their family structure, while equipping children to navigate potential heteronormative bias, teasing, and bullying. The cautious approach reflected a reactive strategy, with fathers addressing the topic only in response to their children’s inquiries, driven by concern that early discussion could provoke undue anxiety or alarm. Finally, the neutral approach emphasized the normality of the family structure by minimizing explicit discussion about being a two-father family. These findings highlight the diverse strategies gay fathers through surrogacy use to navigate heteronormative societal contexts, which hold significant relevance for policy and clinical practices aimed at supporting diverse family structures.",

          "abstract": "Being the only child in the family means concentrated responsibilities for parental care. This study presents findings from 23 semi-structured interviews with Chinese only children, exploring their care motivation, provision, and experiences within the context of Chinese filial piety and social change. We developed a typology by examining how Chinese only children responded to their parents’ care needs and why they provided care (or chose not to). Four caregiver types emerged, each with distinct experiences. Wholehearted intensive caregivers generally had positive experiences, whereas obligatory intensive caregivers often had negative experiences. Partially engaged caregivers felt either content or guilty, and minimal-sufficient caregivers exhibited fewer pronounced positive or negative experiences but were concerned about parent’s future care needs. In a social context characterized by a lack of public care support and an emphasis on filial piety, the caregiving experiences of only children was influenced by whether there was alignment between their intrinsic motivations and actions, and their ability to achieve internal balance and external understanding from their social network. Being the only child profoundly impacted their care motivation, provision, and experiences. Our findings suggest that factors influencing the caregiving experiences should be considered holistically, with attention to the broader social context.",

Through pairwise comparisons, we identify distinct structural patterns and key relational links that reveal the complexity of audience responses. The results show that attitude networks vary qualitatively across news outlets, highlighting structural differences that might be overlooked by relying solely on aggregate scores.

Through a content analysis of 860 verification articles published between January and December 2022 and interviews with seven experts, the study demonstrates that (external) fact-checking practices are deeply embedded in these agencies’ operations, leveraging extensive global communication networks to deliver timely and accurate verifications, reinforcing journalistic authority in the digital age. Partnerships with tech platforms were viewed as a strategic opportunity, a sustainable digital-age revenue stream at the time, enabling the creation of dedicated fact-checking units to combat disinformation. Nonetheless, these agencies prioritize verifying content from ordinary social media users over domestic political claims stated by public figures, with 90% to 100% of their articles focusing on online rumors, except for dpa. Key selection criteria include virality, particularly on Meta platforms, timeliness, and social impact. Despite criticisms, the collaboration between historically influential global news agencies and tech platforms offers critical insights into the workings of (dysfunctional) hybrid media systems.",

Results reveal that AI (vs. human) role-based agencies have separate but also interaction effects on heuristic activation. Moreover, potentially because conspiratorial orientation originates from skepticism towards humans, AI fact-checkers can be associated with higher corrective action intention for individuals with high conspiratorial orientation by activating AI fact-checker’s positive machine heuristics.",

          "authors": "Lucas Proto, Paula Lamoso-González, Luis Bouza García",
          "abstract": "This article critically examines the strategic decision of the European Union External Action Service (EEAS) to reframe the concept of misinformation as Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference. The EEAS, particularly its Strategic Communications Division, has been at the forefront of combating disinformation within the EU. Initially mandated by the European Council in 2015 to counter Russian disinformation campaigns, the EEAS pioneered the framing of this complex phenomenon as an external threat, significantly shaping subsequent European perceptions and policies. While the Covid-19 pandemic and the surge of accompanying disinformation originally shifted the EU focus towards a more regulatory approach, culminating in the approval of the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine soon after prompted a return to geopolitical considerations, reinstating both the disinformation-as-external-threat dimension and, therefore, the prominent role of the EEAS. This research argues that the EEAS, which recognizes the limitations of the EU in effectively countering the phenomenon of misinformation, adopted the framing of Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference to both make the problem more manageable and align it with its mandate. Through this reframing, the EEAS has addressed disinformation similarly to traditional security threats, such as cyberattacks, thereby aligning with existing security paradigms and the competencies and limitations granted by the EU.",

          "abstract": "This article critically examines the regulation of disinformation under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA). It begins by analysing how the DSA applies to disinformation, discussing how the DSA facilitates the removal of illegal disinformation, and on the other hand, how it can protect users’ freedom of expression against the removal of certain content classified as disinformation. The article then moves to the DSA’s special risk‐based rules, which apply to Very Large Online Platforms in relation to mitigation of systemic risks relating to disinformation, and are to be enforced by the European Commission. We analyse recent regulatory action by the Commission in tackling disinformation within its DSA competencies, and assess these actions from a fundamental rights perspective, focusing on freedom of expression guaranteed under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.",

          "authors": "Regina Cazzamatta",
          "abstract": "This article examines the hyperlinking practices of European fact-checking organizations as one of many indicators of efforts to establish a transnational community and identify organizations perceived as “opinion leaders” in combating disinformation. Through a content analysis of 1,976 fact-checking articles from 12 organizations (independent, in-house, and global news agencies) in Germany, Portugal, Spain, and the UK, the study reveals significant variations in hyperlink practices. We measured internal and outbound hyperlinks to fact-checking units used as verification sources or further reading material. The article also evaluates the transnational character of disinformation by analyzing the scope of verified falsehoods. Among the core findings, independent organizations are more likely to establish cross-border connections through outbound links to peer organizations, primarily linking to global news agencies like Reuters and AFP or to other independent fact-checking units from former colonies. In contrast, legacy media units rarely hyperlink to other fact-checkers as evidence sources or for reading suggestions. The study identifies European global news agencies as key opinion leaders, frequently linked for their reliability, particularly amid the heightened disinformation landscape following the Russia–Ukraine war. US fact-checking units, such as PolitiFact and Snopes, also maintain significant influence. This research enhances fact-checking studies by extending beyond liberal systems and emphasizing the strategic importance of hyperlinks in creating a global network of organizations. It offers new insights into linking practices within this domain, complementing existing literature on journalism and political communication. Additionally, the findings advance disinformation research by demonstrating the transnational nature of the issue.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of social media companies, and the spread of disinformation as a result of their “surveillance capitalist” business model, has opened wide political and regulatory debates across the globe. The EU has often positioned itself as a normative leader and standard-setter, and has increasingly attempted to assert its sovereignty in relation to social media platforms. In the first part of this article, we argue that the EU has achieved neither sovereignty nor normative leadership: Existing regulations on disinformation in fact have missed the mark since they fail to challenge social media companies’ business models and address the underlying causes of disinformation. This has been the result of the EU increasingly “outsourcing” regulation of disinformation to corporate platforms. If disinformation is not simply a “bug” in the system, but a feature of profit-driven platforms, public–private cooperation emerges as part of the problem rather than a solution. In the second part, we outline a set of priorities to imagine alternatives to current social media monopolies and discuss what could be the EU’s role in fostering them. We argue that alternatives ought to be built decolonially and across the stack, and that the democratisation of technology cannot operate in isolation from a wider socialist political transformation of the EU and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Recent research on the EU institutional response to post-truth politics has shown a gradual shift of focus from external threats to internal democratic challenges, including populist parties and elections. The case of Spain is particularly relevant as the country’s “disinformation landscape” has been assessed as exhibiting “acute political and media polarisation” originating from weak media regulation and changes in political and media environments. Furthermore, the Spanish media landscape is characterised by high levels of media ownership concentration with a lack of transparency regarding media influence on governments and politicians. In this context, this article examines how Spanish left and right radical parties discursively constructed media elites for their political purposes and the (potential) evolution of their electoral campaign discourse in 2019 and 2024. We expect that the increasingly central role of the debate on digital regulation at the EU level and the context of post-truth politics more broadly serve as a new ground for radical parties with a populist discourse to de-legitimise mainstream media. The primary sources of the study include the left-wing (Unidas Podemos/Sumar) and the right-wing (Vox) party leader campaign speeches and manifestos in national and EU elections in 2019 and 2024. Our findings show that, when it comes to European elections, the Spanish populist discourse has an increasing trend towards the inclusion of more transnational discourses on media and media elites, especially regarding disinformation and post-truth, although with significant differences between the left and the right.",

This article argues for additional efforts and more focused approaches to sustain societal resilience amid increasing geopolitical uncertainties and national political and economic risks, resulting in challenges of a more “epistemic character,” such as growing information-related vulnerabilities, informational inequalities, and polarization. To expose inconsistencies and gaps in the current strategies and agendas for countering disinformation, the article proposes a human-centred approach based on the critical realist framework elaborated by Margareth Archer (1995, 2020). While Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have advanced beyond mere risk awareness in their national policies, this article argues that a more targeted approach is necessary—one that goes beyond the protective logic of securitization and toward evidence-informed awareness of the divergences and information-related inequalities among people.",

In this process, it has empowered anti-democratic domestic and foreign actors, and challenged the business model of traditional media companies, substantially changing journalistic practices. This process has led policy-makers across the world, but more specifically in the EU, to conceive of disinformation as a “problem” (sometimes even a “threat to democracy”) that needs to be “solved.” The thematic issue critically contributes to the increasing literature on the topic by opening avenues that reorient the debate towards the relationship between Big Tech regulation, disinformation, journalism, politics, and democracy in the EU context.",

          "abstract": "Policies to address disinformation aim to protect a number of key public goods, such as self-determination by citizens, fair elections, and a healthy media and information ecosystem. The literature on resilience to disinformation finds striking differences between states, resulting from particular combinations of factors. Consequently, there is a need to maintain a delicate balance between coordinated action at the global level and localized interventions in response to particular vulnerabilities. Starting from this premise, this article explores the complexities of local contexts that contribute to resilience and addresses the tensions in developing evidence-based policies grounded in a wider societal context and system of values. Our study relies on data collected in an EU-funded project, Strategic Planning to Strengthen the Disinformation Resilience and the Management of Hybrid Threats, implemented jointly by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration (Bucharest) between 2020 and 2023. By using insights from key project activities (public opinion survey and policy brief), we assess Romania’s needs and vulnerabilities, which can be addressed through personalized interventions for countering disinformation; we distinguish a particular architecture of policy responses and debate the possible courses of action for a systematic approach to disinformation. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of how effective policies for countering disinformation need to be fed by an awareness of relevant global and regional contexts as well as local factors, values, vulnerabilities, and sensibilities.",

In the first part, I offer metatheoretical reflections on strategies to revitalize the theoretical framework of mobile communication studies. I analyze the limitations of how mobile (and digital) studies have, so far, framed the issue of gender. I propose an initial paradigm shift in these studies by broadening the scope of gender and mobile communication research beyond the confines of traditional studies on gender differences, moving toward an exploration of the relationship between women and capital in mobile communication. I continue by proposing a second shift in mobile phone studies, illustrating how mobile communication is increasingly becoming human–machine communication and how the use of mobile phones is actually structured as reproductive labor. I then introduce the theory of value, a well-established sociological theory first proposed by Marx and later reelaborated by feminist scholars. I apply this theory to mobile communication, by expanding it further. Following this, I present a third paradigm shift, advocating a transition from studying the social consequences of mobile communication to investigating the deeper socioeconomic forces driving the adoption of mobile phones and digital technologies for women. The feminist reworking of the theory of value supports these paradigm shifts, enabling us to explore mobile communication within the domestic sphere in a novel way, particularly as it relates to housework and digital labor.",

We address this question tracking news exposure across TV, the web, and YouTube for approximately 55,000 unique US panelists over a period of 39 months. We find important variations in the demographic profiles of those who choose to consume news within platforms and those who consume news across, casting light on the contingencies of news divides. We also show evidence of a systematic amplification effect: the slice of the population that chooses to consume news across platforms increases their overall levels of exposure, suggesting that a multi-platform media environment widens the gap between news consumers and those who decide to opt out.",

This online experiment ( N = 461) examines cognitive (perceived acceptability), affective (negative emotions), and behavioral (intervention intentions) responses to varyingly hostile comments (impolite vs uncivil vs intolerant) directed at a female science communicator with different ethnic (Black vs White) and LGBTQIA+ identity cues (heterosexual vs homosexual vs trans), thus shedding light on intersectional identities comprising social group affiliations with varying levels of marginalization. While intolerance triggered stronger emotional reactions than impoliteness and incivility (likely due to its discriminatory nature), participants were, somewhat paradoxically, more inclined to act (and advocated for more institutional action) against incivility. Furthermore, ethnic cues had a much stronger influence than LGBTQIA+ identity cues across response domains.",

The short-lived, well-delineated nature of this theory, coupled with its simultaneous emergence across multiple platforms, makes it a distinct case for studying the dynamics of online conspiracy development and spread. Using intermedia agenda-setting theory and computational approaches, we analyzed 1.2 million posts to explore cross-platform interactions. We examined how platform affordances shaped discourse and enabled the conspiracy’s dissemination. Reddit’s anonymity and detailed discussions sustained narratives, while Twitter amplified emotional content and broadened the audience. Hourly time-series analysis reveals a bidirectional influence: Reddit set thematic agendas that Twitter amplified, while Twitter’s emotional content shaped Reddit’s discussions. These findings shed light on the digital development of child abuse conspiracy theories while advancing the understudied aspects of intermedia agenda-setting literature.",

The sensitive capture of changes in the policy environment enabled FoN to develop a flexible campaign repertoire that maintained the campaign’s continuity and visibility. The results also showed that Weibo blurred the boundaries between the private and public spheres. By merging personal reputation with the movement’s practices, FoN underscored the legitimacy and importance of the organization’s efforts. Moreover, the immediacy and anonymity offered by Weibo facilitate fluid transitions between protest spaces, effectively addressing asymmetrical visibility challenges.",

          "abstract": "Journalists’ social media use is a recent example of long-standing gaps between journalistic discourse and journalistic practice. This manuscript applies the sociological concept of rationalization to explain the persistence of this gap, theorizing that the need for rational explanations of one’s work is so powerful for journalists that they offer one description publicly, or to their bosses, while practicing something different. We apply rationalization theory to reflect on journalism’s love affair with Twitter, now that many journalists and their organizations have deprioritized the platform. In interviews, journalists indeed could readily offer rational explanations for Twitter’s use and purpose in journalism, but further questions revealed that common practices didn’t serve the stated purposes; instead, journalists’ attachment to the platform was primarily relational. We argue humans’ inherent sociality, individuals’ response to a field in crisis, and journalism’s acute need for social validation may contribute to this disconnect.",

The review is structured around the five “spaces of datafication” of the news industry, which allows for a holistic look at datafied news work and for accounting for the different uses of data in different areas of the organisations. Our dataset consists of 32 peer-reviewed publications on datafied news work, which have been identified through a combination of a systematic literature search in the Scopus database and a systematic sampling of key non-indexed Nordic journals and publishers. The scope is Nordic, situating the notion of datafied news work in the media-systemic context of the democratic corporatist model. In conclusion, what the research shows is that while different kinds of data are used across news organisations, data are consistently regarded as a resource; what changes, dependent upon the specific organisational context, is the understanding of when and how they constitute resources.",

Mapping the extent and focus of research on crises like the global Covid-19 pandemic, the 2011 Utøya terror attack in Norway, and the Jokela school shooting in Finland, the review identifies key challenges faced by journalists. These include balancing service and watchdog roles, navigating ethical dilemmas, and managing the growing influence of social media. The 32 studies (2007–2024) reveal a modest but growing research focus on journalistic practice during crises in the Nordic region. Findings show that, particularly in the acute phase, journalists prioritise information dissemination over critical scrutiny, often aligning with government messaging. While crises drive technological innovation and accelerate digital adaptation, they also raise ethical challenges, such as how to approach those affected and verify user-generated content.

          "abstract": "Migration to the United States (US) for work can be seen as a family financial strategy to maximize human resources and income. However, adolescents may value migration as a “life changer” for their family's future. This qualitative study explored male Latino migrant adolescents' views about their siblings and future children following in their footsteps as migrant farmworkers in the US A total of 20 migrant adolescents in agriculture (aged 15–20; M age = 17.75; 50% H‐2A visa holders; 50% undocumented; 50% from Mexico; 50% from Guatemala) were interviewed in Spanish in Georgia and Florida. Audio‐recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed in Spanish using NVivo 14. Thematic analysis highlighted three core themes: (1) The future of agricultural work for adolescents' siblings is unclear, (2) Adolescents want to ensure their future children have a successful life, and (3) Adolescents are working toward a better future for themselves. Implications for future research are discussed in the context of unaccompanied migrant farmworker adolescents. Particularly, as LMFA come of age without the company of their siblings or parents, family priorities could be further complicated by precarious work situations, US living costs, and the possibility of raising a family in the US.",

          "abstract": "Tensions between scientific organizations’ conceptions and demands regarding public communication on the one hand and the public communication of individual scientists on the other hand exist and may even become more prevalent. Such tensions revolve around issues of institutional reputation management and academic freedom, centralized messaging and individual autonomy, or scientific neutrality and political engagement, and can be catalyzed by changes in media landscapes and sociocultural contexts surrounding scientific institutions. This essay identifies sources and key dimensions of these tensions. It also explores how institutions manage such tensions and how scientists respond, ranging from loyalty to institutional policies to open dissent, self-censorship, and exit. To mitigate conflicts, it advocates for inclusive and transparent communication policies that balance institutional goals with scientific autonomy, fostering trust and ensuring that both organizations and researchers contribute effectively to public discourse.",

Findings reveal that, of the major news genres represented (e.g. stock, religion, and science reports), all provided indirect information about the pill for potential consumers, with conflicting news-genre-specific narratives highlighting the pill’s: (a) volatility and unpredictability, (b), divisiveness and complexity, and (c) placement within the trajectory of scientific progress, respectively. Lay people interested in using the pill were not primary audiences for this coverage but were, instead, unintended or secondary audiences, and evidence of women’s thoughts or professional opinions about the pill were rarely included.",

          "abstract": "In developing and least developed economies, traditional and spatially bound communities play a critical role in bridging the gap when formal social welfare systems fall short in meeting essential needs. While the role of traditional communities in addressing societal issues is well recognized, research on imagined communities as agents of social welfare is a new and rapidly developing area of study. This study uses the foundational tenets of Ubuntu to examine the ways in which imagined communities—influenced by social media—use their collective agency to address gaps in Kenya’s formal social welfare system. Drawing data from three storytellers’ YouTube channels, we conducted a thematic analysis of 15 personal accounts to determine how storytellers leverage their social media presence, institutional knowledge, and community trust to address gaps in an under-resourced social welfare system. Findings indicate that personal stories shared and amplified through these digital platforms resonate with the imagined community, forming emotional connections that transcend geographic and socioeconomic boundaries. We identify key actors—storytellers, beneficiaries, public institutions, and the globally dispersed imagined community—and explore how their interactions enhance community well-being. This exploration highlights the crucial role that storytelling through social media plays in mobilizing support and fostering social connections.",

Through a 2-year-long digital ethnography and interviews, this study revealed how Chinese mainlanders and those living abroad have confronted, separated, and integrated each other in identity negotiations. The results highlight the good, bad, and ugly sides of social VR as a novel convergence of VR, Massively-Multiplayer-Online-Role-Playing Games, and social media, particularly how the immersive experience of VR embodiment, avatars, and real-time voice chat may rejuvenate intercultural communication. These findings also illuminate a possible alternative global village enabled by social VR that not only has inherited certain violence from intercultural conflicts but also pioneering new paths to restore constructive communication.",

          "abstract": "This editorial introduces the Social Media + Society special issue “Comparative Approaches To Studying Privacy.” Recognizing the importance of privacy in today’s digital societies and volatile political and regulatory environments, the editorial highlights the pressing need for comparative research on the topic and describes the articles in this special issue. The special issue addresses the theoretical, methodological, and practical challenges and opportunities of researching privacy across cultural, social, political, economic, and technological units of comparison. The articles in the special issue explore diverse privacy understandings, attitudes, and practices across contexts, challenging decontextualized and mono-cultural understandings in relation to social media and adjacent technologies. The special issue articles also illustrate fruitful ways privacy can be studied across different units of comparison with qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Several contributions in the special issue, including this editorial, not only broaden the scope of privacy research but also encourage engagement with multi-stakeholder perspectives in the context of social media, considering the role of policy, industry, and civil society. In the editorial, we briefly relate the special issue and its contributions to the comparative privacy research framework (CPRF), which serves as a useful starting point and a solid conceptual foundation for comparative privacy research. Finally, we develop a research agenda for future comparative privacy research, which critically examines position of power and epistemological biases, evaluates the comparability of the subject of study, determining and justifying relevant units of comparison, and helps to analyze how these units interact in shaping the concept of privacy.",

          "abstract": "Grassroots activism constitutes the backbone of civil society across political regimes. While many studies explored the role of social media and digital platforms in social movements, we focus on the ways local activists use these social media platforms to organize collectively against unwanted urban development. Localized (place-based) contention differs from large-scale social movements: it is less endowed with resources and it is directly related to physical space. We analyze 26 urban conflicts in six Russian cities based on 185 interviews with activists and experts to show how the residents leverage digital platforms’ affordances and argue that the former extensively rely on the latter for coordination, communication, and recruitment purposes. Yet, the nature of place-based conflicts makes blending online and offline organizational activities inevitable. We also demonstrate that despite their benefits, digital platforms also bring organizational challenges. The authoritarian state imposes further constraints, requiring activists to take into account state surveillance and repression in their engagement with social media. Our study contributes to the scholarship on digitally mediated actions, urging a reevaluation of social media’s role in local collective actions.",

Our analysis is informed by the existing literature on digital feminism, gendered abuse, and conceptions of harm, but also recognizes how social media marketing strategies shapes the expertise provided. We conclude that while the emerging expert discourses around online dating seek ostensibly to advocate for women, they are contradictory, likely to contribute to social anxiety, and could risk diluting and individualizing the material reality of abuse.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates how social media can enable and constrain civil society organizations’ (CSOs) discharge of accountability. Based on a comparative analysis of the Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter (X) posts of the Swedish Red Cross during 1 year ( N = 1014), we propose a framework of affordances that illustrate how platform features, practices, norms, and perceptions about audiences jointly shape the accountability potential of a platform. Accountability is overall more content- than process-oriented, emphasizing visibility of action rather than far-reaching social interactivity. Our study, however, reveals important differences between Instagram and Facebook, on the one hand, and Twitter, on the other. Whereas accountability is more short-term, scripted, and donor-oriented in the former, it is more abstract and ad hoc, with mainly indirect efforts at interactivity, in the latter. Our framework of affordances sheds light on the hitherto under-researched intersection between the literature on CSO accountability and the literature on CSO use of social media.",

          "abstract": "A few social media platforms have come to play a central role in civil society organizing, often functioning as organizing partners. But on whose terms? As organizing partners, commercial social media platforms shape the conditions under which civil society actors organize, also shaping organizational dynamics, visibility, and collective action. Far from being neutral partners, these platforms become battlegrounds where civil society actors and platform owners negotiate power, visibility, and control—differently affecting various forms of civil society actors and organizing. Therefore, we need to move beyond the notion of platforms as mere organizing agents to critically examine the opportunities and constraints they create for different civil society actors, as well as how different civil society actors navigate these. This requires considering both exogenous, contextual elements, and endogenous, actor-centered elements of civil society organizing. Doing so allows us to examine how organizing efforts emerge not simply on social media platforms but with them, requiring constant negotiation with platform logics. The collection of articles in this special issue shows how social media platforms enable civil society organizing, but also how platform-driven asymmetries emerge and play out differently according to the different features that characterize the civil society organizations at stake.",

          "authors": "Karolína Bieliková, Alena Pospíšil Macková, Martina Novotná",
          "abstract": "Resilience to disinformation on social media relies on the user’s ability to critically assess disinformation and even counter it. Active users, who, with their actions, can curate the information environment of others, can play a crucial role in stopping the dissemination of disinformation. Their activities, such as correcting or reporting, in the decentralized social media environment may prove more effective than institutional responses. Considering this, the study looks specifically at how active users engage with disinformation. Through 60 semi-structured interviews over 3 years, we explore how crises like COVID-19 and the Russia–Ukraine war impact Czech users’ motivations and strategies. Findings indicate that users are driven by a moral obligation to provide accurate information. Both people sharing and correcting disinformation believe in their critical skills, with their desire to help amplified by crises. However, the ones correcting often face frustration and demotivation due to hostile interactions and a lack of visible impact, while the ones sharing remain persistent. Strategies are influenced by the perceptions of the individuals and the type of disinformation. Completely false information is often ignored as not worth debunking, whereas partially false information prompts active correction due to the perceived ease of rebuttal. The study highlights the need for social media platforms to support users in corrective actions and address algorithmic issues that may impede these efforts.",

          "authors": "Christoph Ivanusch, Paul Balluff",
          "abstract": "Media coverage of political actors and debates is a crucial avenue for voters to learn about political parties and their policies. However, nowadays party-media agenda-setting is increasingly shaped by large-scale transformations and the fragmentation of political communication across various party channels (e.g., press releases, social media, speeches) and media types (e.g., newspapers, television, online news), potentially affecting the provision of political information. This article examines these dynamics using large-scale textual data from political parties ( n = 17,677) and media outlets ( n = 90,531) published in the run-up to the Austrian national election in 2019. Building on the measurement of text similarity with state-of-the-art transformer-based models and multiverse analysis, we investigate the success of party messages from press releases, parliamentary speeches, Facebook and Twitter making it into important national newspapers, online news sites as well as television and radio news programs. The article shows that the variety in party channels and media outlets—with their distinct characteristics, modalities, and (technological) affordances—create different flows of information between the parties and the media. Press releases remain crucial tools for parties to get their messages into the media, while social media and parliamentary speeches also matter, albeit with varying effects by party. We also find that online news is more receptive to party messages than print, television, or radio news. Despite these differences, journalistic gate-keeping consistently favors large and government parties across all media types. These findings underscore the need for nuanced research into the interaction between party communication channels and media outlets in contemporary democracies.",
