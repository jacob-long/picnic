          "abstract": "The media portray older adults stereotypically, making it critical to study the influence of different media forms’ portrayals on age stereotypes. This study advances dynamic age-group dissociation as a novel theoretical framework, integrating social identity, self-categorization, meta-stereotype, and communication accommodation theories to explore how older Chinese adults navigate conflicting age portrayals across hybrid media ecosystems. Through in-depth interviews with 15 retirees, findings reveal that both traditional media and social media simultaneously reinforce positive and negative age-related stereotypes. Older adults actively negotiate their self-perception, selectively aligning with or distancing from these portrayals based on their lived experiences and cultural norms. These findings illuminate the intersectional influence of media on identity construction, with significant implications for communication theory.",

          "authors": "Claudio Celis Bueno, Steve Jankowski, Jakko Kemper",
          "abstract": "This article contends that the promises and perils that people ascribe to so-called generative AI are in fact not so singular and that the debates around AI and the arts can be situated within a longer discursive lineage. We claim that antithetical responses to emerging new media historically tend to activate a perceived schism between culture and technique. As such, whenever a new technology appears to impact the artistic process, there is a tendency to present human culture as a constellation of specific friction-laden tasks that should either be protected from or supplanted by technology. To support this claim, we engage in a ‘topos study’ ( Huhtamo, 1997 ) to compare current discourses on the effects of generative AI on the arts with debates about the relationship between media and art that took place nearly two hundred years ago: François Arago’s 1839 report on the daguerreotype and Charles Baudelaire’s 1859 denunciation of photography. We identify four recurring topological commonplaces – usefulness of a new medium for the arts , democratization through technological means , antagonism between industrialization and art , and the impoverishment of artistic imagination , and argue that, when combined, they contain discursive contradictions about friction and frictionlessness that historically define the meanings ascribed to technology and its impact on the realm of culture.",

          "authors": "Andy Nguyen, Shohil Kishore, Yvonne Hong, Saima Qutab, Belle Dang",
          "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to explore the initial formation of organizing visions within digital platforms regarding the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in education. It examines how these emerging visions align with official guidelines. Understanding the early development of these organizing visions and the consensus formation around official guidelines for GAI in education has significant research and practical implications. Design/methodology/approach The present study uses a multimethodological approach with qualitative content-coding and inductive thematic analysis of digital trace data from the social media platform X and deductive thematic analysis of guideline documents. It first examines organizing visions within digital platforms through 1,260 tweets, focusing on opportunities and challenges posed by GAI, particularly ChatGPT, in educational settings. The study then analyses practical guidelines from international organizations, governments, and universities. Findings The empirical findings demonstrate that, although all three Organizing Vision (OV) functions are present in the early development of OVs for GAI in education, early-stage online discourse predominantly emphasizes the legitimation function. The findings also indicate a noticeable alignment between the topics discussed in the early development of OVs for GAI in education and the official guidelines and policies issued by international organizations, governments, and universities worldwide, indicating the need for educational reform, and ethical considerations. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature on the emergence of OVs in digital platforms by examining the context of GAI in education. This study also provides insights into the collective stance and recommendations from various authoritative sources, offering a comprehensive perspective on early-stage GAI policy development in an educational context.",

          "authors": "Shuai Chen, Zhengyao Dai, Wenjun Chen, Xingwu Luo, Shuyue Zhang, Kai Sun",
          "abstract": "Purpose In the gig economy, online ride-hailing drivers experience occupational stigma perception (OSP), which may surpass that experienced by traditional service providers and significantly affect their service performance. However, how these drivers counteract OSP in the new online labor relationship has not been well studied. To address this issue, this paper presents an analysis of the moderating roles of online ride-hailing drivers' internal locus of control over work (iLOC) and customers' positive feedback on the basis of the conservation of resources theory. Design/methodology/approach To test our hypotheses, this paper conducted a field questionnaire survey in a Chinese city, collecting data from online ride-hailing drivers across various platforms. Findings The results reveal that online ride-hailing drivers' OSP negatively impacts their service performance and that both drivers' iLOC and customers' positive feedback mitigate this adverse effect. Moreover, the moderating effect of customers' positive feedback is mediated by drivers' iLOC, confirming the presence of a mediated moderation effect. Practical implications By focusing on the roles of the public, online ride-hailing platforms, and online ride-hailing drivers themselves, this study provides actionable and comprehensive insights into how to mitigate online ride-hailing drivers' OSP in the gig economy. Originality/value Previous studies have identified online ride-hailing drivers' iLOC as a stable moderator in the relationship between OSP and service performance. However, this paper empirically demonstrates that customers' positive feedback can induce changes in the iLOC, which subsequently moderates the relationship between OSP and service performance.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This study examines the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) companions on users' social well-being by integrating the Triangular Theory of Love and Attachment Theory. Specifically, this study explores how the three components of love (including intimacy, passion and commitment) shape users' attachment (interactive engagement, emotional attachment, emotional trust) toward AI companions and how attachment, in turn, impacts social well-being. The study also investigates the moderating role of sweet deception in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted with 527 users of AI companion apps, recruited through a panel service provided by a marketing agency. The proposed path relationships in the conceptual framework were analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0. Findings The results show that the three components of love significantly impact users' attachment and both interactive and emotional attachment subsequently influence social well-being. Additionally, sweet deception was found to strengthen the relationships between interactive engagement and social well-being, as well as that between emotional attachment and social well-being. Originality/value This study makes a unique contribution to the literature by empirically examining how human–AI companion relationships impact users’ social well-being. Specifically, it introduces the novel concept of sweet deception – the strategic use of affectionate yet deceptive communications to foster emotional bonds – and empirically test its role in strengthening the relationship between users’ emotional attachment and social well-being. By integrating Triangular Theory of Love and Attachment Theory, this study offers a new theoretical framework for understanding the emotional dynamics of human–AI interactions. Moreover, this study provides innovative practical insights for businesses on designing emotionally engaging AI companions that promote user well-being.",

          "abstract": "Despite the role friendship can play in the physical and mental health of adults, little is known about its relationship with suicidality. To address this gap, we conducted a scoping review on adult friendship and suicidality in Medline, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library from inception to April 9, 2024. We used a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms to find studies reporting on the themes of suicidality and adult friendship. We summarized key findings on the association between friendship and suicidality. We identified only 43 studies on adult friendship and suicidality. The study designs, goals, measurements, and populations were highly heterogeneous, and friendship was not measured consistently. Nevertheless, most studies (60.5% or 26 out of 43 unique studies) found friendship was protective against suicidality. This review highlights the inconsistent measurement of friendship and lack of conceptualization of friendship. Yet, friendship appears to be protective against suicidality. Further study is needed to understand the relationship between friendship and suicide.",

Contributions show how infrastructures of manipulation, emotional and visual repertoires, and algorithmic logics amplify populism, disinformation, and polarization, while weakening deliberation. Analyses of youth orientations, electoral arenas, and media systems reveal how negativity and symbolic performance increasingly outweigh substantive dialogue. Comparative perspectives highlight the global scope of these dynamics.

Covering a broad spectrum of governmental bodies (e.g., ministries and officials), the research highlights the variety of influencer–government partnerships and collaborations. The study comes at a time when diverse regulatory frameworks are emerging globally to govern influencers’ activity, mandating transparency in sponsorships, protecting consumer interests, and setting boundaries on influencer involvement in governmental and political campaigns. The methodology combines two main steps: (a) a web search of news articles and blogs to identify relevant examples of government–influencer collaborations; (b) a manual annotation of government-led influencer strategies of the retrieved examples based on thematic areas, degree of autonomy in the partnership, and narrative strategy. The study focuses on France, the US, and Canada, chosen for their advanced digital environments and initiative-taking approaches in both social media regulation and public diplomacy. The main contribution of the study is to develop a typology of government–influencer collaborations to align public perception with (inter)national policy goals and reach their target audiences.",

          "authors": "Mauro Bomba",
          "abstract": "TikTok’s rapid rise in media and information consumption among young Italians has recently prompted Italian politicians to stake out this space during election campaigns to engage a younger electorate, traditionally sidelined by mainstream news and political communication. However, attempts to tailor Italian political communication to the TikTok ecosystem are still undergoing a process of adaptation and familiarization (Boccia Artieri &amp;amp; Donato, 2024). This may reflect the challenges of engaging with TikTok’s peculiarities: it is driven by youth-centered usage and language focused on entertainment and escapism (Cervi et al., 2023), and its predominantly algorithmic architecture shifts content circulation from relational networks to personalized recommendations. This configuration transforms the political experience on social media for both politicians and users, moving from relational interactivity toward a more aesthetic, performative dimension. In this context, our study examines how these TikTok characteristics affect the production, circulation, exposure, and evaluation of political content during the 2024 European Parliament election campaign. The analysis revolves around three main foci: How politicians used TikTok and leveraged the platform’s features; how users encountered and assessed political content; and how the topics addressed by politicians on TikTok compare with those young Italians deem most important. The second-order election setting of the European elections (Reif &amp;amp; Schmitt, 1980), contrasted with youth voter appeal (Consiglio Nazionale dei Giovani, 2024), adds complexity, making the alignment of political and user interests a key driver of TikTok content circulation less predictable.",

Given that any direct effectiveness of digital disconnection is limited, recent approaches emphasized its conditionality. Conducted in two culturally dissimilar countries (the United States and Indonesia), the present large-scale cross-sectional youth surveys ( N s = 1,922 and 2,107, respectively) explored whether different popular feature- and rules-based digital disconnection strategies (digital detox app use vs. reflective smartphone disengagement vs. digital solitude) may serve as an ambivalent moderator for relationships between habitual and compulsive smartphone checking, on one side, and digital stress experiences, on the other. For U.S. youth only, results indeed suggested that reflective smartphone disengagement might minimize detrimental side effects of firm checking habits, whereas it exacerbates links to digital stress for people who struggle with smartphone checking compulsiveness.",

          "abstract": "This article studies the negotiation of humanness in artificial sociality by examining the cyborg case of humanlike virtual influencers and their performance of authenticity, drawing on phenomenological ethnographic research. Based on the findings, I propose the framework of “meta-authenticity”—the flexible, co-constructive process of self-referential (in)authenticity performances. Virtual influencers’ meta-authenticity was a dynamic outcome of collaborative performances by entangled human and nonhuman actors. Meta-authenticity’s theoretical and practical contributions are demonstrated, including through an illustrative application. Then, I reflect on meta-authenticity’s implications on human cultures, such as regarding artificial sociality’s capacities to provide authentic interaction on and as per demand, followed by suggestions for ethical practices. As an accountability-integrated framework, meta-authenticity encourages nuanced critical assessments of artificial sociality’s “real” actors and consequences.",

Building on extant work indicating cross-materiality Sense of Place (SoP) to be a function of symbolism, purpose, identity, relationality, and emotion (SPIRE), the current study tested the validity of a five-factor SPIRE measure and examined variance as a function of physical (vs. digital) and positive (vs. negative) places. Among cross-national participants (N = 348 from &gt; 30 countries), response patterns forward a two-factor solution: One combines SPIR elements anchored to identity items representing an egocentric orientation toward the place (55% of variance explained), and another comprises only emotion items representing idiosyncratic emotion dynamics (14%). Validation analyses found egocentricity to be strongly and positively associated with metaphorical conceptualizations of SoP, emotionality less so, differentially across place materiality and valence. Findings hold implications for digital and physical space design, especially as generative technologies increasingly afford place personalization.",

          "abstract": "Developed by a Korean start-up called ScatterLab, Luda Lee is an AI-powered social chatbot designed to embody the persona of a 20-year-old, youthful college girl and promoted as “your first AI friend.” A year after the suspension of Luda 1.0 in 2021 amid a heated controversy surrounding Luda 1.0 in 2021 regarding user-initiated abuse and the unethical sourcing of language data, ScatterLab recently reintroduced a generative AI-powered Luda 2.0 to the public, while pursuing the expansion of its operation as a software-as-a-service provider. The article traces the evolution of both Luda and ScatterLab, highlighting the crucial role of user engagement in the making and repurposing of the company’s “proprietary dataset.” It explores how user engagement is not only an objective but also a strategy for corporate growth in the artificial sociality enterprise. Strategies to encourage user engagement, like gendering of the chatbot design, create unanticipated kinds of user engagements and user-generated data. Those data, conceived as materials from which the AI’s competence is absorbed, is constructed as an asset, a material and discursive anchor for the company’s future promises.",

Social media form a powerful tool for the social inclusion of people with disabilities, allowing them to seek and share information. Self-representation is a part of this dynamic, revolving around conscious creative choices and curated self-expression within a mediatized habitat. The current study examined disability influencers on social media to understand their self-representation strategies and the discourse they use to communicate about disability. Content from disability influencers ( N = 14) was textually and visually analyzed for self-representation strategies, and comparison of the medical and social models of disability was made. Findings revealed these models are not always in opposition. Disability was found to be a complex topic, especially in light of visible and invisible representation with influencers positioning themselves in relation to larger societal structures, social media affordances, and disability discourses.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on the “Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test”—a science fiction version of Turing’s famous thought experiment—we propose the Conversational Action Test (CAT): a new approach to evaluating conversational artificial intelligence (AI) voice agents. We compare social actions in a range of telephone service encounters where one party is an artificial conversational agent to a range of similar human-human calls. The CAT demonstrates a novel paradigm that addresses long-standing theoretical and methodological problems for ostensible “tests” of conversational AI by (a) revealing the conceptual confusion of attempting to “detect” an AI in routine service interactions and (b) focusing, instead, on the situated interactional practices through which an AI “passes” for human. We discuss the implications of the CAT for the design and evaluation of conversational AI, and for the notion of “humanness” as a goal or benchmark for such systems. Data include publicly available human/AI service calls and comparable human-human calls in British and American English.",

          "abstract": "Conducting conversations with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as ChatGPT is becoming an everyday experience for large masses of people. However, we still know very little about the emerging communicative dynamics facilitated by these technologies. This special issue tackles a dimension of AI that is becoming increasingly relevant and ubiquitous: artificial sociality, defined as technologies and practices that construct the appearance of social behavior in machines. The notion of artificial sociality aims to emphasize that machines construct only an illusion or artifice of sociality, stimulating the humans who interact with them to project social frames and meanings. In this introduction to the themed issue, we discuss the dynamics and implications of artificial sociality and show how these technologies are increasingly incorporated and normalized within digital platforms. The issue includes contributions that offer empirical findings and theoretical insights by examining a broad array of AI technologies, ranging from ChatGPT to Replika.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we turn to the domestication theory to study what strategies users develop to appropriate social chatbots – dynamic algorithmic tools mimicking human interactions via large language models and scripted dialogue content. As an example, we use the case of Replika, a popular but controversial social chatbot designed to serve as companions, friends, and even romantic partners for millions of people. In 2023, Replika underwent a series of major fixes and algorithmic updates leading to significant changes in how it responds to users. Through analyzing posts from a popular Reddit community dedicated to Replika, we showcase that users developed various re-domestication strategies to come to terms with these changes. Our study illustrates that Replika should be understood as a quasi-domesticated object that constantly requires users to find new ways to re-integrate it into their lives. We conclude the paper by highlighting how our findings can inform communication research.",

          "abstract": "This study examines influencer Andrew Tate’s social media content as embodying virtual manhood acts (VMA)—technologically facilitated misogyny in online spaces. Through content analysis of 13 Tate videos from 2022, we demonstrate how his performances of masculinity extend beyond reinforcing gender binaries to potentially facilitating gender radicalization leading to misogynistic, homophobic, and transphobic attitudes and behaviors. Applying McCauley and Moskalenko’s radicalization framework, we map Tate’s content to pathways at macro (jujitsu politics, hatred, martyrdom), group (polarization, isolation, competition), and individual levels (personal and group grievance, slippery slope, love, risk and status, unfreezing). Our findings suggest that the combination of VMA and digital platforms creates fertile conditions for gender-based radicalization, particularly for members of the social media manosphere. Tate’s extensive influence, amplified by algorithms, represents a concerning escalation in the potential for widespread gender radicalization with real-world implications.",

          "abstract": "This article examines false online job ads and user susceptibility by drawing on three research areas: automated deception detection, cognitive bias (Dunning–Kruger effect), and digital and algorithmic literacy. Leveraging a data set of 17,879 ads, we develop machine learning models to distinguish false from legitimate ads and survey a representative US sample ( N = 635) to assess user susceptibility. Results show that ad veracity is predicted by visual (e.g. company logo) and linguistic cues (e.g. “team,” ‘we’) that signal credibility. Survey findings indicate a strong Dunning–Kruger effect: overconfident individuals were less accurate in detecting false ads, perceived them as more credible, and were more likely to share them. Literacy effects were complex: while general Internet skills improved detection accuracy, algorithmic literacy had more nuanced influences on ad perceptions. These results highlight the psychological mechanisms that contribute to the spread of false information in digital communication, deepening our understanding of online deception.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools that appear to perform with care and empathy can quickly gain users’ trust. For this reason, GenAI tools that attempt to replicate human responses have heightened potential to misinform and deceive people. This article examines how three GenAI tools, within divergent contexts, mimic credible emotional responsiveness: OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the National Eating Disorder Association’s Tessa and Luka’s Replika. The analysis uses Hochschild’s concept of feeling rules to explore how these tools exploit, reinforce or violate people’s internalised social guidelines around appropriate and credible emotional expression. We also examine how GenAI developers’ own beliefs and intentions can create potential social harms and conflict with users. Results show that while GenAI tools enact compliance with basic feeling rules – for example, apologising when an error is noticed – this ability alone may not sustain user interest, particularly once the tools’ inability to generate meaningful, accurate information becomes intolerable.",

To understand users’ attitudes and behavior, we conducted a digital ethnography on a pioneer online community related to Replika, through the lens of immaterial labor and AI imaginary. Our analysis revealed that Replika users invest a significant amount of intellectual and affective resources into the chatbot through algorithm training, driven by fascinating imaginaries of an ideal AI partner. Moreover, users’ perceptions of Replika’s ventriloquism mechanism – where Replika serves as both the chatbot partner and the intermediary between users and the company – helps to facilitate and obscure the exploitation of users’ intimacies and immaterial labor. Our study contributes to understanding AI imaginaries through real user experiences and introduces the immaterial labor concept to decipher Artificial Sociality .",

          "abstract": "Research on AI has extensively considered biases related to gender and race. However, much less attention has been dedicated to another sociological tenet: that of class. Inspired by Bourdieu’s work on cultural stratification and distinction, this work sheds light on the sociocultural roots of artificial sociality, and on how these become manifest as ‘habitus’ within the outputs of generative AI models. We conducted 39 interviews with three AI chatbots – ChatGPT, Gemini and Replika – after asking them to impersonate individuals with different occupational positions: highly skilled professionals, blue-collar workers, university professors in the humanities, construction workers, computer scientists and hairdressers. Our qualitative study shows class-based regularities in how popular AI chatbots represent the lifestyle and tastes of fictional personas in artificial conversations, partly mediated by infrastructural and design elements. The article proposes a sociological perspective on bias in artificial sociality and experiments with interview methods in the study of generative AI.",

          "abstract": "This research examined whether people's own and their partner's financially focused self‐concept are associated with relationship satisfaction in a sample of UK couples ( N = 388 participants). Results showed that financial harmony in a romantic relationship is influenced not only by an individual's own financial focus but also by their partner's financial focus. Contrary to expectations, however, the degree to which financial resources were integrated (i.e., pooled) between partners did not moderate this link. Exploratory analyses tested financial stress, financial harmony, and financial infidelity as possible mediators of the link between people's own and their partner's financially focused self‐concept and relationship outcomes. When perceiving the partner as overly focused on financial success, they were more likely to endorse financial infidelity and reported lower financial harmony, which in turn was associated with poorer relationship outcomes. Indeed, the perception of excessive financial focus appeared to be more detrimental to the relationship than the partner's actual financial focus. These findings highlight the importance of assessing the financial attitudes of both partners as well as their perception of each other's financial attitudes in shaping romantic relationship outcomes.",

Traditionally defined by roles such as Informer and Watchdog , journalists adapted to new roles during the crisis, including Collaborator with health officials, Science Communicator , and Fact-Checker . Drawing on data from three waves of the Austrian Corona Panel Project with approximately 1,500 participants per wave, we analyze audience expectations of nine journalistic roles. Our findings show strong support for emerging roles like the Fact Checker and Science Communicator , highlighting the demand for accurate information and scientific clarity. However, audience expectations fluctuated significantly over time, reflecting shifts in public trust and the diminishing rally-around-the-flag effect. These results underscore the volatility and context-dependency of audience demands during crises, emphasizing the need for journalism to remain adaptable in rapidly changing environments.",

In this study, we employ a cross-level design by comparing campaign strategies in the 2024 European Parliament (EP) election and the 2024 National Parliament (NP) election in Austria. We focus on campaign strategies related to dissonant public spheres: Populist content, negative campaigning, and the polarizing issues of immigration and environmental policy. To do so, we apply a quantitative content analysis ( N = 1,794) of the Facebook posts of political parties and candidates during both campaigns. Using binary logistic regression, we find that negative campaigning is significantly more likely and the issue of environmental policy is significantly less likely to occur in the NP campaign compared to the EP campaign. However, there are no significant differences between the EP and NP campaigns regarding populist content and the issue of immigration. Our findings demonstrate that the second-order elections theory may be less applicable to the analysis of digital campaign strategies. Instead, other frameworks—such as populist discourse as a global phenomenon, the transnationalization of issues like immigration, and the increasing salience of global concerns such as climate change—may offer more analytical traction.",

          "authors": "Aqsa Farooq, Elske van den Hoogen, Marina Tulin, Claes de Vreese",
          "abstract": "The 2024 European Parliament (EP) elections (EP24) were regarded as a “testing ground” for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered disinformation threats. Instances of multimodal, AI-generated disinformation were found across European democracies, leading to questions about just how prevalent this threat may be in the eyes of citizens poised to vote in the EP elections, and its influence on electoral processes. Utilizing a three-wave panel approach, we surveyed a sample of citizens in the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland ( N = 2929) to track changes over the course of the election cycle. We explored the association between citizens’ concerns about and perceived encounters with AI-generated content, including disinformation. We were also interested in how these concerns and perceived encounters differ over the course of the campaign, differ by country, and ultimately, how they relate to citizens’ perceptions of the fairness of the electoral process. We found that increased reported exposure to AI-generated election content, including disinformation, is associated with heightened concern about AI’s threat to democratic integrity in the EP24. While reported exposure to AI-generated content positively influenced perceptions of electoral integrity and democratic satisfaction at the EU-level, disinformation eroded these perceptions, albeit modestly. Reported exposure to AI-generated disinformation peaked just before elections, suggesting strategic timing. Understanding citizens’ perspectives can be crucial for the development of a robust, democratic and resilient information ecosystem—particularly during elections.",

          "authors": "Phoebe Maares, Kim Löhmann, Folker Hanusch, Daniel Nölleke",
          "abstract": "As an institution, journalism relies on several key normative values to claim authority and legitimacy— autonomy, objectivity , and transparency . Although these concepts have been widely studied, most research employs quantitative approaches or focuses on specific beats, often political journalism. Drawing on fifty-five in-depth interviews with Austrian journalists, we examine the meaning of these journalistic values and their relevance in political, lifestyle, sports, and economic journalism. We find that autonomy is universally valued, though commercial influences and pressures are more frequently noted in lifestyle and sports journalism. Objectivity is emphasized in political and economic journalism but less prioritized in “softer” news beats, where subjective perspectives are more widely accepted. Transparency is important across all fields, yet differences emerge between “hard” and “soft” news regarding the necessity to disclose sources or funding agencies. Thus, universality across beats cannot be assumed, and the heterogeneity of the journalistic field, in terms of its application of different normative values, needs to be considered in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Dry stone constructions, recognized by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage, face increasing challenges due to abandonment and environmental degradation. This article explores how collaborative visual ethnography can contribute to the documentation and revitalization of endangered practices associated with dry stone construction in Catalonia. Through photographic interventions and interdisciplinary collaboration with dry stone experts and artists, this research showcases alternative ways of engaging with cultural memory and landscape transformation in the geohumanities field. The study presents visual outcomes from four photography interventions, and discusses their implications for the documentation and revitalization of heritage from a geocreativity perspective. The research contributes to shared knowledge on how visual ethnography, grounded in interdisciplinary collaboration, offers a transformative approach to rethinking and revitalizing cultural landscapes.",

          "authors": "Nicholas Vanderschantz, Nicola Daly, Vouchleang San",
          "abstract": "With the establishment of Māori medium education in the 1980s, picturebooks featuring Te Reo Māori have been needed and are increasingly being developed, produced, and used in full immersion and mainstream education in Aotearoa New Zealand. In recent years, the number of bilingual picturebooks featuring Te Reo Māori and English has increased. Improved access to bilingual picturebooks in a society that includes both an Indigenous and colonial language as two of its three official languages is vital to support the status of Te Reo Māori as an official language and to support English speakers learning Te Reo Māori. Studies by Daly ( Dual-Language Picturebooks in Māori and English , 2016, and The Linguistic Landscape of English–Spanish Dual-Language Picturebooks , 2017) have explored the layout of such bilingual picturebooks, suggesting that the order of languages reflects the linguistic hierarchy or relative status of the two languages. Yet, to date, no empirical studies have investigated how designers’ typographic order choices affect readers’ perceptions of the status of languages. In this article, we present the findings from a mixed-methods study of 50 readers’ perceptions of typographic and linguistic hierarchy in pages of bilingual picturebooks when the order of languages was a variable. Results show that order did affect the opinions of readers, and this effect varied depending on the linguistic repertoire of the participants.",

          "authors": "TJ Thomson",
          "abstract": "To the general public, text-to-image generators, such as Midjourney and DALL-E, seem to work through magic and, indeed, their inner workings are often frustratingly opaque. This is, in part, due to the lack of transparency from big tech companies around aspects like training data and how the algorithms powering their generators work, on the one hand, and the deep and technical knowledge in computer science and machine learning, on the other, that is required to understand these workings. Acknowledging these aspects, this qualitative examination seeks to better understand the black box of algorithmic vision through asking a large language model to first describe two sets of visually distinct journalistic images. The resulting descriptions are then fed into the same large language model to see how the AI tool remediates these images. In doing so, this study evaluates how machines process images in each set and which specific visual style elements across three dimensions (representational, aesthetic and technical) machine vision regards as important for the description, and which it does not. Taken together, this exploration helps scholars understand more about how computers process, describe and render images, including the attributes that they focus on and tend to ignore when doing so.",
