          "authors": "Madeline J Moore, Lili R Romann, Rachel V Tucker, Elizabeth A Hintz",
          "abstract": "This retrospective review synthesizes communication scholarship concerning character assassination (CA) or the deliberate destruction of a target’s character by an attacker. We first review the five pillars of CA, before tracing the development of CA across the three subfields of communication most prevalent in our sample: Political communication, rhetoric, and persuasion; mediated/mass communication and new communication technologies; and public relations and strategic communication. We offer an agenda for future CA research in three intellectual territories underrepresented in our sample, including sociological, sociopsychological, and sociocultural approaches; health and science communication; and interpersonal and instructional communication. In all, our review underscores the contemporary salience of CA as a communicative phenomenon, and outlines directions for further developing this burgeoning area of research.",

          "authors": "Neil Sadler",
          "abstract": "The concept of narrative has been widely employed in the disinformation literature. Nonetheless, its use has been dominated by loose intuitions of what narratives are and do alongside vague accounts of specific stories. Theorized more carefully, thinking in terms of narrative has much to offer disinformation studies by helping to better define what constitutes disinformation and providing sophisticated frameworks for assessing specific content. To enable a nuanced view of narrative truth, I propose a “hermeneutic realist” approach in which stories “disclose” wider realities rather than constructing or simply reflecting them, supplemented with Phelan’s “narrative ethics” to facilitate inquiry into how far stories are morally legitimate. I apply these ideas in a case study of Twitter content posted by a Venezuelan political influencer blaming Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine on NATO enlargement. In so doing, I show that content may be referentially and ethically problematic without necessarily being false.",

          "authors": "Elaine Jing Zhao",
          "abstract": "This article proposes the politics of streaming time as a productive analytical lens to unflatten more general accounts of nonlinearity and acceleration, to reveal the mediating role of streaming services and broader power relations around terms of access in value reconfiguration, and to critique the cultural-economic logics of the streaming economy. Building on the literature on media and time in the internet society, and integrating platform studies and television studies, this article analyses the politics of streaming time with reference to Chinese streaming services’ turn to the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) model, a process negotiated among multiple parties including streaming services, advertisers, audiences and regulators. The analysis shows how streaming services orchestrate elastic schedules in concert with flexible pricing and dynamic bundling to manipulate temporal and affective experiences of viewers while causing contingent boundaries of subscriber benefits. It explains how the data-contingent approach confronts subscribers with a boomerang moment of temporal displacement and surge pricing. Further, it reveals how multiple temporalities including artificial ephemerality, collusive synchronicity and metric thresholding as well as reconfigured televisual linearity are mediated to entice and extract value from subscribers. The conclusion reflects on how exploring the politics of streaming time allows a more textured understanding of emerging temporalities and the negotiation around terms of access in an increasingly contingent cultural market.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The Metaverse’s ongoing evolution and emerging disruptions pose ethical concerns. Hence, we aim to establish a comprehensive understanding of potential ethical issues in the Metaverse. Design/methodology/approach We conducted an integrative review of 64 relevant works within the context of ethical concerns in the Metaverse and its associated technologies. Findings We identified four themes, developed a multi-layered conceptual framework and proposed 18 research questions for future studies. We demonstrated that ethical problems in the Metaverse are broader than those arising from technologies constituting it and highlighted the evolving nature of the Metaverse with emerging disruptions corresponding to an ever-changing ethical landscape. Research limitations/implications Recognizing the evolving nature of the Metaverse, with technological disruptions contributing to an ever-changing ethical landscape, we propose a framework and research questions with an actionable research agenda for empirical studies focused on ethical concerns within the Metaverse. Practical implications We offer insights for integrating ethics into the design and development of Metaverse solutions. The framework highlights the complex, multi-layered ethical issues and emphasizes the need for platform stakeholders to collaborate with consumers and policymakers to address these concerns. Additionally, the review reinforces the importance of data management in the Metaverse, urging policymakers to prioritize data privacy on the Metaverse platforms and revise regulations to tackle these challenges. Originality/value The review underscores the unique nature of ethical issues in the Metaverse, which extends beyond those associated with its foundational technologies and calls for increased attention to these issues in information systems research.",

          "authors": "Curd B Knüpfer, W Lance Bennett, Ulrike Klinger",
          "abstract": "This study examines the mechanisms by which illiberal politics make the news by disrupting democratic systems. During the late 20th century, a liberal journalistic consensus in most democracies developed guidelines for gatekeeping political voices and views in the news. In recent years, illiberal politics and changing media systems have challenged those press norms. Politically marginalized parties can make the news by disrupting party systems, elections, and policy processes. The presented case of German news coverage of the United Nations Global Compact for Migration shows that disproportionate media attention to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party was not related to its size or policy impact, but to the strategic disruption of the political process itself. Making news via democratic disruption constitutes what we term “indexing by proxy” that undermines a core democratic journalism norm by amplifying coverage of illiberal actors that challenge the legitimacy of various public institutions, including legacy journalism.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Storme, Martin Storme",
          "abstract": "In many languages, masculine forms are used generically. However, extensive research demonstrates that these forms exhibit a male bias that can adversely affect the perception of opportunities by women. To address this issue, alternative linguistic forms have been proposed, typically categorized into two main strategies: feminization and neutralization. Both approaches have proven effective in reducing the male bias of masculine forms. However, their relative effectiveness remains unclear. This study investigates this question in French. We compare gender representations elicited by three linguistic forms—masculine forms, pair forms (feminization), and neutral forms (neutralization)—against a stereotypical baseline. Our findings reveal that, in stereotypically neutral contexts, neutralization and feminization are equally effective in counteracting the male bias of masculine forms. However, in male- or female-dominated contexts, feminization is less sensitive to contextual bias and therefore more successful in mitigating the influence of stereotypes. Implications and limitations are discussed.",

To fill this gap in the literature, this study adopted a single-center perspective and a network approach to explore and identify the sociodemographic and intrapersonal determinants of well-being (emotional and psychological well-being) and ill-being (anxiety and depression) among single individuals. Data were collected from two samples of Polish single individuals for Study 1 ( N = 650; age 18–56; 56.50% women and 43.50% men) and Study 2 ( N = 1406; age 18–92; 61.90% women and 38.10% men). The network analysis revealed that the overall network structure in the two samples was highly stable and similar, and the most influential factor was satisfaction with singlehood. These findings emphasize the need for a focus on satisfaction with singlehood beyond the general assessment of single individuals’ well-being and ill-being.",

          "abstract": "The interpersonal consequences of anger coping (i.e., anger-in, anger-out, anger-control) in everyday life are unclear. This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study tested whether momentary variations in anger coping style were associated with the perceived quality of subsequent interpersonal interactions throughout the day. Lifetime discrimination and race were tested as moderators of these associations. A sample of 518 Black and Latinx participants (age range = 23–65, M = 38.9; 50.4% men, 49.6% women) completed surveys measuring demographics and perceived discrimination, and EMAs of anger coping and perceptions of interpersonal interaction quality every 20 minutes during waking hours. At a between-person level, those who reported more frequent use of either anger-in or anger-out also reported more negative interactions throughout the day. At the within-person level, observations during which people reported using anger-in (vs. anger-out or anger-control) were negatively associated with the quality of the interpersonal interaction on the subsequent observation 20 minutes later. Discrimination moderated the effects of anger coping. For individuals who reported experiencing higher levels discrimination, observations in which they held anger-in (vs. did not) were associated with worse subsequent interpersonal interaction quality. In contrast, for those who reported experiencing lower levels of discrimination, observations in which they expressed anger-outwardly (vs. did not) were associated with worse subsequent interpersonal interaction quality. This study provides evidence of person by context interactions in the interpersonal consequences of anger expression and may inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to mitigate the effects of discrimination.",

          "title": "Does sacrifice always lead to burnout in romantic relationships? The role of relational equity and appreciation",
          "authors": "Pınar Özdemir",
          "abstract": "Earlier studies have extended the literature on sacrifice by examining the positive and negative effects and addressing two different aspects of sacrifice, i.e., perceived as satisfying and perceived as harmful. However, there has been less focus on the psychological mechanisms that underlie the perception of sacrifice as harmful within couple relationships. The present study investigates whether the perception of sacrifice harmfulness is associated with couple burnout and explores the roles of relational equity and appreciation in these relationships. The participants comprised 749 married individuals residing in various cities across Türkiye ( M age = 33.41, SD ¼ = 9.12). Data were collected using the Demographic Information Form, the Couple Burnout Measure, the Appreciation in Relationships Scale, the Relational Equity Scale, and the Perceived Sacrifice Harmfulness Scale. The PROCESS macro was used to simultaneously test the mediation effect of relational equity and the moderation effect of being appreciated (Model 8). The findings indicated that perceived sacrifice harmfulness was positively associated with couple burnout and negatively associated with relational equity. Relational equity partially mediated the relationship between perceived sacrifice harmfulness and couple burnout. Moreover, the perception of being appreciated moderated this mediation at the first stage of the process. Furthermore, among partners who perceive their sacrifices as harmful, those with low levels of being appreciated feel unequal within the relationship. The results from this study extend research on the potential consequences of perceived sacrifice harmfulness and emphasize the importance of uncovering the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, while these findings do not provide direct practical implications, they offer insights that may inform behavioral recommendations for couples in clinical settings.",

          "authors": "Bissie Anderson",
          "abstract": "Acknowledging the networked nature of journalism and shifting power relations between actors in the hybrid media system, this article invokes the metaphor of “the curtain” that separates journalists and external actors/forces in discussions on journalistic autonomy (Coddington, 2015) and applies it to the engaged journalism practices of four media startups. It places “the curtain” in the hybrid media systems paradigm and its relational ontology (Chadwick, 2017) to examine to what extent that concept applies to engaged journalism, a participatory media practice that, by definition, involves publics in journalistic processes. Drawing on interviews with engaged journalism producers in Pakistan, Romania, Malaysia, and the UK, this comparative cross-border study explores the power relations within the actor constellations involved in journalistic co-creation. The outlets examined favour a relational approach to knowledge production, in which they prioritise mutual listening and learning—together&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with their communities. However, there is still a separation between journalists and audiences/publics. Examining the power negotiations that shape engaged journalism in different parts of the world, this study sheds light on the unique texture of each hybrid media space of co-creation. It offers a nuanced conceptualisation of hybridity, suggesting that engagement can lend itself to varying degrees of openness. The study findings challenge idealistic notions of participation by showing that, even in engaged journalism practice, participation remains tightly controlled by journalists and is subject to their negotiation of capacity-enabling and capacity-limiting forces within the constraints of the context-specific material realities.",

          "authors": "Ioana Grancea, Viorel Ţuţui",
          "abstract": "The challenges of scaling up deliberative processes to mass audiences have long been highlighted by deliberative theorists. Apart from the difficulty of keeping content quality at a high enough level as more and more people get involved, the technical feasibility of mass participation in a structured form of deliberation has been a serious constraint. The development of digital platforms and AI systems are now making it technically possible to extend structured participation to wider audiences. This article addresses the following question: How can we ensure that good listening is scaled up in these new contexts? Drawing on an analytical framework based on recent contributions in the areas of deliberative democracy and AI, we evaluate the ability of current models of AI-powered mass deliberation to incentivize receptive, responsive, and apophatic&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;listening. We further develop an assessment tool, the “Listening Incentives Score,” that can be used to assess whether AI-powered mass deliberation models provide participants with the adequate channels, facilitation, training, and systems of rewards and sanctions to incentivize them to engage in good listening.",

          "abstract": "The growing ‘digital nomad’ movement flourishes amid concerns about the impacts of remote work on workplace culture. This ethnographic study combines a Massey-inspired perspective on space, place, and spatial divisions of labor with a geomedia lens to interpret digital nomad infrastructure as producing a ‘global sense of workplace’. By adopting this perspective, the nomadic lifestyle appears less as a radical departure by professionals from office/life and more as a spatial manifestation of digital labor in the context of neoliberal capitalism.",

          "authors": "Ariuntsetseg Erdenebat, Admilson Veloso da Silva",
          "abstract": "The global proportion of people aged 60 and above is projected to double by 2050, exceeding 20% of the population. Despite this demographic shift, mass media often misrepresents senior women, associating their value with appearance, while “anti-aging” marketing perpetuates the desire to conceal signs of aging. These portrayals contribute to internalized ageism and gerascophobia, disproportionately affecting women. Visual social media platforms like TikTok have become spaces to explore and challenge these narratives. This study examines how women's aging is depicted on TikTok through user-generated content. Using netnography and qualitative content analysis, 300 TikTok posts tagged #aging and #antiaging from November 2023 to January 2024 were analyzed. Findings reveal that aging is framed largely as a physical process, with women more likely to focus on appearance-related content, reflecting societal pressures. Seven key portrayals were identified: “Anti-aging,” “Looking younger and glowier,” “Illustrating the aging process,” “Accepting aging,” “Promoting healthier and longer life,” “Challenging ageist stereotypes,” and “Addressing premature aging.” Finally, this study contributes to understanding age-related discourses in digital spaces and their implications for combating ageism.",

          "abstract": "The goal of this study was to examine the role of older adults’ demographic, socio-economic, and health background in their perceptions of health-related mobile device usefulness. This examination was performed through the prism of the social stratification and the social diversification hypotheses. Data were obtained from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5 Cycle 4 and analyzed using logistic regression models. The sample included 1373 U.S. mobile device owners aged 60 years and older. An interaction between age (being 75 years old or older) and race (self-affiliation with White race) was found with respect to the perception of usefulness of mobile devices for achieving health-related goal and patient–provider communication. Being married, female gender, self-rated health, and hypertension diagnosis positively related to the perception of usefulness for achieving health-related goal. Being diagnosed with mental health disorder positively related to the perception of usefulness for health decision-making and patient–provider communication. Education and income levels also demonstrated several associations with the dependent variables. The findings mostly supported the third-level digital divide perspective and both theoretical hypotheses. The findings imply that some groups of older adults tend to benefit more than others from health-related mobile device use.",

Prior research on the use of media in long-distance communication focused on dyads, thereby neglecting issues like the heightened coordination effort in groups. We conducted a survey on a representative sample of German adults to discover the media ensembles of (geographically dispersed) friend groups and to explore the relationship between these ensembles and connectedness. A cluster analysis revealed four clusters, ranging from a traditional cluster occasionally communicating through emails and voice calls to a cluster that frequently uses several media, including games and discussion forums. The use of group chats was common in three clusters. Feelings of connectedness increased with communication frequency and number of media used. Psychological processes, namely social presence and ambient awareness, influenced connectedness as well.",

Recent geopolitical and digital developments underscore the need for more research on the topic, even in the Nordic countries with their recognised resilience against dis- and misinformation. This integrative review ( N = 359) examines how dis- and misinformation have been studied across disciplines in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden between 2014 and 2024. The diversity of terminology and fields in this research highlights its significance and the potential for cross-disciplinary and cross-border collaboration. The article identifies five main topics within the literature: security and Russia’s actions; media and fact-checking; health; media literacy; and social media. While Nordic countries share similarities in dis- and misinformation research, Finland, Norway, and Sweden are more closely aligned with each other than with Denmark or Iceland. This study also identifies research gaps, including the need for more psychological and cognitive science research on dis- and misinformation. Overall, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of dis- and misinformation in the Nordic countries than previously available.",

          "abstract": "Ghosting—or indirectly ceasing communication to end a relationship—has become common with the rising popularity of online dating. Despite its ubiquity, little is known regarding the immediate causal impact of being ghosted compared to explicit rejection. In two studies, participants were immersed in a sequential dating scenario simulating the early development of an online relationship to experimentally test emotional and behavioral responses to ambiguous rejection (i.e., ghosting), explicit rejection, and acceptance. Ghosted and explicitly rejected participants reported high negative emotion as well as low positive emotion and self‐esteem. However, ghosted participants reported ongoing emotional attachment to the target compared to those who were explicitly rejected. Ghosted participants also intended to monitor the target's social media and dating app status and text/call over time to the same extent as accepted participants, demonstrating a lack of closure. This work illustrates the causal effects of being ghosted, characterized by emotional pain without closure and disengagement.",

Furthermore, only identification was positively related to story-consistent beliefs, which were positively associated with the intention to engage in further communication behaviors.

The negative effects of the audio clips with satire on perceived trustworthiness were mediated by experienced mirth. Our results offer evidence that scientists who use satire may be seen as less trustworthy than those who do not, likely because of the aggression perceived in the jokes.",

          "authors": "Daria Kravets",
          "abstract": "Prior research has demonstrated that the algorithms of the Kremlin-controlled search engine Yandex are biased toward the interests of Russia’s ruling elites. However, it has focused primarily on Yandex’s web and news search algorithms and largely neglected Yandex’s popular top-5 news recommender algorithm. Therefore, this study investigates the role of news embedded on Yandex’s homepage—on the side to its search functionality—in disseminating Russia’s propaganda to foreign audiences and tracks its evolution over time. To do so, I audited Yandex’s top-5 news algorithm in Belarus from 2010 to 2022. By analyzing 474,663 news headlines from Yandex’s homepage ( yandex.by ) in Belarus, I found that (1) on a monthly average, the majority (52.2%) of Yandex’s top-5 news in Belarus came from sources with explicit connections to Russia’s ruling elites, and (2) a substantial portion of the news was political, with the share of political news increasing over time. In addition, Yandex in Belarus (3) frequently featured news about Russia or Russian actors, which appeared almost exclusively in the default domestic top news section for Belarus as opposed to the top news happening in the world, and (4) experienced a notable decline in the presence of Kremlin-critical news sources, marked by the complete disappearance of Western and Russian opposition websites in late 2018–2019 and the disappearance of Belarusian opposition websites shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. These findings demonstrate the gradual political appropriation of Yandex’s top-5 news algorithms by Russia’s ruling elites, marking Yandex as a propaganda tool of the Kremlin.",

The suggested framework distinguishes between the immediate agenda, which addresses problems perceived as most urgent, and the delayed agenda, which focuses on issues deemed most important for the future. Enriching agenda-setting theory with insights from construal level theory, the study examines the psychological and media-related factors shaping the placement of topics on these agendas. Drawing upon original survey data and a large-scale news content analysis from the French 2022 Presidential Elections, as well as survey data from the 2023 to 2024 war in Israel and Gaza, the findings provide empirical support for the proposed framework. The results indicate that participants prioritize psychologically proximate issues on the immediate agenda, whereas psychologically distant issues gain importance on the delayed agenda. Additionally, we identify media agenda-setting effects that extend beyond the immediate temporal layer. Specifically, both studies provide evidence for a media priming effect, where news exposure increases issue salience without affecting temporal layering. The Israeli case reveals additional initial evidence for an urgency effect, where news exposure boosts issue salience of some issues primarily on the immediate agenda. Overall, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of public agendas and news media effects, introducing a temporally nuanced perspective that enriches classical approaches to agenda-setting research.",

          "authors": "Nashwa Elyamany",
          "abstract": "This study examines the intricate interplay between identity construction and multimodal communication in the evolving landscape of Virtual Influencers (VIs), with a particular focus on Lil Miquela . It addresses a critical gap in understanding how algorithmic infrastructures mediate identity performance through complex semiotic and chronotopic configurations. Adopting a techno-affective and social semiotic approach, the research conducts a chronotopic analysis of 35 (sponsored) posts from Lil Miquela ’s official Instagram account (21 January–June 2024), integrating Bakhtin’s chronotope with Danesi’s semiotic model. Guided by three key questions, the article explores: (1) the role of emojis as semiotic resources in her digital identity construction; (2) the mediation of her spatiotemporal identity dynamics by algorithmic infrastructures; and (3) the relationship between multimodal affordances, techno-affective elements and perceptions of authenticity. By interrogating the intersection of chronotopic configurations, algorithmic mediation and digital semiotics, this research reveals how her identity is continuously (re)negotiated in response to shifting algorithmic and socio-discursive conditions. Ultimately, it contributes to a deeper understanding of how VIs navigate digital authenticity and identity performance within the constraints and affordances of algorithmic mediation.",

          "authors": "Inbal Klein-Avraham, Zvi Reich",
          "abstract": "Despite their attractive and effective nature, journalistic interactive visualizations (JIVs) are highly susceptible to bias and manipulation. Based on a quantitative content analysis of 600 JIVs from six leading general and financial news sites ( The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , The Guardian , The Economist , Haaretz and Calcalist ), this study traces the emergence of four visual biases in JIVs – visual ambiguity, exaggeration/understatement, missing visual information and visual misrepresentation – exploring their correlation with organizational factors and with the strategies associated with their production. Findings indicate that visual biases emerge in over 60 percent of the studied cases, correlating especially with news site characteristics. The article merges theories of knowledge quality from information studies, journalism and visual communications, and concludes with four principles that demarcate justified from unjustified use of visual biases in JIVs.",
