          "authors": "Yotam Ophir, Dror Walter, Ayse Lokmanoglu, Nathan Walter",
          "abstract": "We use a large-scale mixed-method analysis to examine changes in misinformation research over three decades, with a particular attention to the role of media research. We examine a corpus of more than 7,000 academic studies, published between 1993 and 2022, analyzing changes in volume, topics, and methods used. Employing computational text and network analyses, we show how the meteoric rise in misinformation research in the 2010s was driven by a paradigm shift brought about by technological innovations and changes in the media and political landscape. We discuss the growing role communication scholars played in misinformation research, and offer recommendations for areas of strength in which communication research could further extend our understanding of the prevalence, nature, and effects of misinformation moving forward.",

          "authors": "Veronika Šlapáková Losová, Marko Orel",
          "abstract": "Purpose This study proposes how to empirically measure and explain virtual reality’s (VR) impact on meeting engagement compared to traditional video conferencing through a novel methodological framework grounded in social presence theory, combining social network analysis with conversation analysis to address the lack of empirical evidence on VR’s effectiveness in authentic workplace settings. Design/methodology/approach Through a 16-week longitudinal experiment in a multinational company, we analyzed eight retrospective meetings to compare engagement patterns across platforms. The framework operationalizes engagement through group cohesion metrics and content characteristics, employing both quantitative network analysis and qualitative content analysis of interaction patterns. Findings Results suggest that VR meetings generate higher engagement levels through three key mechanisms: enhanced network density, more balanced participation patterns, and improved social presence behaviors. The most striking finding reveals VR’s capacity to enhance peripheral participant engagement, demonstrated by an increase in degree prestige for least active participants. Additionally, while VR meetings exhibited lower task-orientation, they fostered more dynamic and inclusive interactions, challenging traditional assumptions about meeting efficiency as a function of task-orientation. Originality/value The study presents empirical evidence of VR’s impact on meeting engagement in authentic workplace settings through an innovative methodological framework. The integration of social network analysis with conversation analysis establishes a non-intrusive method for evaluating meeting effectiveness, capturing both structural and qualitative aspects of engagement. These findings advance our understanding of how VR technology transforms interaction dynamics, suggesting a paradigm shift in virtual collaboration practices.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The study investigates how limitations within creativity support systems (CSS) can enhance virtual team collaboration and creativity. Recognizing the challenge of technological overload due to CSS’s increasing features and functionalities, the research aims to show how strategic constraints can foster rather than hinder creative processes. Design/methodology/approach Adopting a design science research (DSR) methodology, this study synthesizes kernel theories and insights from expert interviews to develop 11 meta-requirements and five design principles for constraint-based CSS. These principles were then tested through a series of real-world experiments to evaluate their effectiveness and refine them based on empirical results. Findings The findings reveal that implementing constraints in CSS can significantly boost radical creativity, adaptation and activity in virtual teams. It also helps reduce cognitive overload, feature fatigue and topic drift, thereby enhancing the efficiency of creative collaboration across different phases. Each design principle was empirically validated and refined, underscoring the benefits of constraint-based approaches in managing feature-rich environments. Originality/value This research contributes to the understanding of how constraints can be systematically designed and applied in CSS to promote creativity. By empirically testing and refining design principles for constraint implementation, the study offers a novel perspective on balancing functionality and simplicity to optimize creative collaboration in virtual settings.",

          "authors": "Mengxiao Zhu, Lin Liu, Noshir Contractor",
          "abstract": "Purpose While existing research shows that employees’ use of collaboration technologies can be influenced by their social relationships, whether and how these effects change under organizational disruptions remains unclear. This study aims to narrow this gap by examining how telework transitions affect the impacts of social networks on collaboration technology use. Design/methodology/approach To examine our research model, we utilize the massive shift to telework prompted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in China. We collect multisource data, including digital trace data on collaboration technology use, roster-based survey data on social networks and demographic profile data, from 183 employees in an international technology company’s human resource (HR) department. Findings Our findings reveal that centrality in instrumental networks (represented by influence networks) and expressive networks (represented by friendship networks) positively affects collaboration technology use across the phases of before, during and after telework. Notably, influence centrality had a stronger effect on collaboration technology use during telework than it had before telework, and this enhanced effect persisted after employees returned to the office. In contrast, the impact of friendship centrality on collaboration technology use was weaker during telework than it was before telework, and this reduced effect gradually recovered after employees returned to the office. Moreover, we identified a consistently negative interaction effect between influence centrality and friendship centrality on collaboration technology use before, during and after telework. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by adopting a dynamic perspective to investigate how the effect of social networks on collaboration technology use evolves amid organizational disruptions, particularly the shift to telework. Practically, our findings offer actionable insights for organizations to promote technology-based collaboration and optimize technology application through informal relationships among employees during times of organizational disruption.",

          "abstract": "Purpose As environmental turbulence intensifies, big data analytics (BDA) has become a cornerstone for modern firms seeking to manage uncertainty and enhance organizational resilience. Drawing on the organizational capabilities-based theory and information technology (IT)-enabled organizational capabilities perspective, this study aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms and diverse pathways through which BDA capability influences organizational resilience. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining advanced analysis for composites–structural equation modeling (ADANCO-SEM) in Phase 1 and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) in Phase 2 to analyze survey data from 239 Chinese firms. Findings The ADANCO-SEM analysis revealed that BDA capability significantly enhances organizational resilience by fostering resource flexibility and coordination flexibility. The fsQCA analysis further elucidated how firms of different sizes and BDA experience configure their BDA capability and strategic flexibility to achieve proactive and reactive resilience. These findings validate and extend the results of the ADANCO-SEM analysis. Originality/value This study makes a valuable contribution to Information systems (IS) research by theoretically and empirically uncovering the mechanism through which BDA capability influences organizational resilience.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Based on flow theory, this research aims to explore how posting about different purchases (“what they did” vs “what they have”) affects the engagement of others in the consumer’s social network. Design/methodology/approach In study 1, the experimental design and survey methods are used to collect data. Study 2 analyzed UGC posted to Sina Weibo, which is a popular social media platform in China, testing the study’s proposed model with negative binomial regression analysis. Findings Study 1 indicates that posting UGC related to “what I did” (vs “what I have”) will increase the engagement of others in a consumer’s network, and the flow experience underlies this effect. The results of study 2 replicate the findings of study 1 and show that the UGC related to “what I did” is more likely to increase the shares and comments of others in a consumer’s network. Originality/value This work makes theoretical contributions to both social media and customer engagement research. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flow experience can be used to explain the role of UGC in eliciting the engagement of receivers to the posts.",

          "authors": "Mustapha Cheikh-Ammar, Nura Jabagi",
          "abstract": "Purpose Universities are increasingly encouraging students to join LinkedIn, a professional networking site (PNS), to enhance their employability prospects. Our study explores the double-edged sword of LinkedIn use among university students with a focus on its contrasting psychological impacts of stress and well-being. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), conservation of resources theory (CORT), and recent social media research, this study proposes a theoretical model to explain users’ motivations for LinkedIn use, their experiences of LinkedIn-induced stress and well-being and how users deal with these experiences. Our model was tested via a survey of 221 undergraduate students and the use of structural equation modeling. Findings Results indicate that LinkedIn-induced well-being, stemming from the digital support of students’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, belongingness and competence, enhances their intrinsic motivation to engage with the platform. However, LinkedIn is also found to generate stress – driven by excessive demand and privacy threats – which undermines intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, LinkedIn well-being is found to be a personal resource that students leverage to manage this stress. Originality/value This study examines students’ experiences on LinkedIn, a PNS that has received less scholarly attention than hedonic social networking sites. Using SDT and CORT, we highlight the coexistence of stress and well-being on non-compulsory, utilitarian PNSs like LinkedIn. We further demonstrate how LinkedIn-derived well-being helps students manage LinkedIn technostress, addressing a key research gap, as few studies explore how social media users mitigate stress through positive mechanisms.",

          "authors": "W. Q. Elaine Perunovic, Emily A. Vogels, Andrew Molinsky, Clinton Holmes",
          "abstract": "This research examines the paradoxical effects of nonnative speakers’ language fluency on how they are perceived by native speakers, focusing on likability and competence. Although poor fluency has been shown to shield nonnative speakers from negative evaluations of culturally inappropriate behavior, our findings indicate that this effect is confined to likability and does not extend to competence. Specifically, our results show that Russian professionals with lower English fluency were rated as more likable (Studies 1 and 2) but less competent (Study 2). Mediation analyses (Study 2) revealed that perception of effort and felt sympathy, rather than lack of cultural knowledge or intentional rudeness, mediated likability ratings, demonstrating the “effort-sympathy heuristic,” where poor fluency enhances likability by triggering greater sympathy and perceived effort. Overall, these findings highlight the dual-edged nature of language fluency in professional and social contexts, providing insights into how perceptions of nonnative speakers shape interpersonal and professional evaluations.",

          "authors": "Kokil Jaidka",
          "abstract": "Social-media–based protests often unfold across multiple, semi-autonomous communities that cooperate, compete, and overlap, yet most research still treats “the movement” as a single unit. I introduce the 3R framework—Rhetoric, Reach, Reinforcement—to trace how collective-identity messages are produced, circulated, and amplified among these communities. The study analyzed a multilingual corpus of 800,000 Facebook posts (200,000 textual posts) spanning three months, using unsupervised topic modeling, multiple linear regression, and social-network analysis. Results show systematic heterogeneity: communal organizations react most intensely to posts criticizing the government, signaling identity-affirming outrage. Journalistic pages function as “bridge nodes,” injecting new topics into the network and diffusing them widely, thereby disrupting potential echo chambers. High-reach, high-rhetoric messages are disproportionately reinforced through repeated sharing and cross-posting, magnifying their visibility well beyond the originating community. This study maps how rhetoric, reach, and reinforcement interact across organizational boundaries, offering a unified theoretical and empirical approach to understanding how online protest movements construct, contest, and sustain collective identities.",

          "abstract": "Quantitative research illustrates that people have a range of motives for engaging in online dating. Although this work has yielded important insights, the experiences of participants from marginalized backgrounds are sometimes obscured or omitted in quantitative research. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-synthesis of 21 qualitative studies that focus on people’s motives for engaging in online dating. Some of these studies focused on people who identified as sexual minorities or with other groups that are underrepresented in the quantitative literature. We used thematic analysis to synthesize the qualitative findings reported across the 21 studies. Results illustrated that people’s motives for engaging in online dating can be characterized by eight overarching themes. These motives replicate and broaden the pool of motives that have been documented in the quantitative literature. Findings also revealed sociodemographic variation in the motives participants reported. For example, sexual minority participants were more likely than heterosexual participants to report that they use online dating to access specific populations of prospective partners. We draw from these findings to make several conceptual and methodological recommendations for future research focusing on online dating motives.",

          "authors": "Antonio Amuza, Bianca Fox, Valentina Marinescu",
          "abstract": "This article investigates the strategic use of Facebook in the 2019 European Parliament elections, challenging the traditional view of these elections as “second-order” national elections. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset, the research analyzes campaign materials from all EU member states, focusing on the thematic and visual strategies employed by political parties on Facebook. The findings reveal that digital visibility, measured by the volume of posts, is a stronger predictor of electoral success than thematic coherence or ideological messaging. The study integrates theories of hybrid media systems, symbolic politics, and cultural performance to argue that Facebook functions not merely as a communication tool but as a symbolic arena where legitimacy is performed and contested. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of how social media platforms are reshaping the dynamics of European electoral politics.",

          "authors": "Aya Yadlin, Gal Yavetz, Jenny Bronstein",
          "abstract": "This study examines how social media users emotionally respond to Israeli politicians’ messages during crises based on political alignment and crisis type. With Israel’s frequent civic and military crises, the case study in this article aims to offer unique insights to scholars, practitioners, and the public invested in the intersection of online media, emotions, and crisis. To this end, we built a dataset of Facebook posts (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 25,000) published by all active right, left, and center members of the Israeli parliament and government over a period of one year (November 2022–November 2023). We ensured that the dataset includes both routine and crisis periods, particularly the judicial reform unrest (civic crisis) and the Hamas–Israel war following the October 7 attack (military crisis). Our statistical analysis indicated two major trends in the dataset: (a) during the military crisis, emotional markers that were previously considered to correlate and cluster (sad and angry) are not merely different, as they stand in opposition to one another; (b) crisis periods, especially military, invite use of “edge” reactions, and see a significant increase in negative emotions, whereas routine times prompt more neutral or positive reactions. Reading the findings through the combination of affordances theory, mediatization theory, and the “template for emotions” concept, we suggest that social media may amplify negative reactions beyond politicians’ influence, as the limited emotional spectrum offered on platforms might steer users to certain emotive responses, affecting risk management in crises. These insights call for decision-makers to consider the implications of emotional appeals and incentives on social media, especially during crises, to foster safer democratic public discourse.",

          "authors": "Mariek M. P. Vanden Abeele, Trine Syvertsen",
          "abstract": "Mobile connectivity fosters a 24/7 lifestyle that both benefits and burdens individuals. Digital well-being has emerged as a concept describing how persons balance these benefits and burdens. The concept of digital disconnection describes how people set limits to connectivity. Both concepts are currently studied in two fields of research, each dominated by different strands of theories. One strand is developing in mobile media studies: It uses the media-centric lens of affordances theory to explain how mobile media enable and constrain human action. The other is developing into its own field of “disconnection studies,” and draws on studies of media resistance to explain how the phenomenon of disconnection is inherently tied to the morality of what it means to lead a good (media) life in an increasingly digitized—yet unequal—society. This article offers a theoretical contribution at the intersection of both fields: Following an exploration of what “lack of theory” means in mobile communication and media studies, we argue that theoretical development fruitfully takes place through explorations of overlapping and complementary theoretical notions from adjacent fields. Mobile media and digital disconnection scholars thus benefit from extending a mutual invitation. To illustrate our argument, we formulate five axioms that compromise mobile media affordances with morality, to prepare mobile media studies for a future beyond mobile media.",

          "abstract": "Using the 2022 Twitter to Mastodon migration as a case study, this article contributes a new understanding of social media migration (SMM). It begins with a review of existing studies of SMM, showing how migration is often understood as a combination of ‘push and pull factors’. We suggest a need to widen the conceptual scope for how we approach SMM in ways that more directly tie such movements to specific questions of power, agency and events that ripple through digital cultures. Drawing on social media account analysis, a survey of recently migrated Mastodon users, content from high-profile Twitter users and other media commentaries, we re-present the migration in order to detail our ‘eventful’ theory of migration. Eventful social media migration is comprised of five elements: an initial X factor; the emergence of a critical voice; a collective platform consciousness; an observable migration; and a wider terrain transformation.",

          "authors": "Elena Pilipets, Jason Chao",
          "abstract": "This article contends that the attention economy of social media reflects a shift toward soundscapes where networked sound objects – whether popular music or ambient sound, remixed speech or glitched audio – play a central role in amplifying user engagement. The analysis centers on audiovisual communities that operate as contra points to common TikTok trends, with particular attention to the Alt genre and niche phenomenon of Deep TikTok or DeepTok. Sound-linking and hashtagging practices within DeepTok reveal a dual dynamic: To survive the algorithmic visibility contest, DeepTokers creatively repurpose TikToknative sharing features, playing by the platform’s communicative rules. Meanwhile, glitch techniques deployed in the service of attention capture constitute engaging spaces that simultaneously incorporate and reject mainstream content. We inquire into these relations by exploring video and platform metadata attached to a curated collection of 497 #deeptiktok posts, arguing for a contextual understanding of memetic soundscapes that reenact noise.",

          "authors": "Ryan McGrady, Kevin Zheng, Ethan Zuckerman",
          "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of language-specific random samples of YouTube videos, focusing on English, Spanish, Hindi, and Russian. We produce a large random sample, retrieve metadata, calibrate and deploy language-detection software, and extract four high-confidence language samples. Through an analysis of upload dates, popularity, duration, and category metadata, we highlight patterns and anomalies among our samples. For example, English YouTube has the smallest proportion of videos categorized as “News &amp; Politics,” and Spanish videos have a longer median duration. The most salient contrast, however, is between Hindi YouTube and the other three languages. Hindi videos are much shorter and much newer, with sharp growth since 2020 and more than half of the sample uploaded in 2023 alone. The Hindi sample also exhibits a different pattern of liking, with the lowest percentage of videos with just zero or one like even while it has the highest percentage of videos with just zero or one view. These findings may help to quantify the migration of India’s short-form video culture, based around TikTok, to YouTube when TikTok was banned in the country in 2020. This study underscores the necessity of multilingual and culturally specific approaches to platform research by drawing attention to the heterogeneity of YouTube. We propose this method as a starting point to understand linguistic communities on YouTube, surfacing trends and exceptions while providing cues for more content-focused study.",

          "authors": "Ziye Zang",
          "abstract": "This study conducts visual content and framing analysis to compare the images of Chinese and US leaders in China Pictorial ( N = 153). Drawing from the images that juxtaposed US and Chinese leaders, the author aims to examine how the ‘fantasy’ of US–China power dynamics is visually crafted by Chinese party-controlled media across three Chinese political eras, spanning from 1950 to 2021. In Mao’s era, China was visualized as resisting US dominance; China appeared to be making advances in global politics in Deng’s era; and under Xi, China was depicted as a courteous great power distinct from the US. These shifting fantasy themes coalesce to craft a rhetorical vision of China as a humble great power challenging and potentially eclipsing US hegemony. This article advances visual political communication by illustrating China’s constructed state power through media, challenging US-centric narratives and tracing the historical shifts in perceived Sino–US power dynamics.",
