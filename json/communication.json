          "title": "A social cognitive approach for using racially diverse entertainment media to improve children’s intergroup socialization",
          "authors": "Sovannie Len",
          "abstract": "Ethnic-racial socialization plays a crucial role in shaping children’s attitudes and behaviors regarding race and intergroup interactions. However, socialization practices greatly vary across families, potentially leading to prejudice and intergroup anxiety. Utilizing Social Cognitive Theory and Anti-Bias Education as frameworks, I present the Model of Parental Media Strategies for Intergroup Socialization and argue that racially diverse entertainment media offers multiple benefits for families seeking to improve their intergroup ERS practices if utilized with key media strategies. This paper additionally addresses the unique challenges faced by White, interracial, and minoritized families in providing adequate intergroup ERS to their children and offers tailored strategies based on the presented model for each family type to leverage entertainment media effectively.",

          "authors": "Xuewei Zhang, Timothy D Stephen",
          "abstract": "The field of self-relevant communication lacks clearly defined boundaries, largely due to its fragmented nature. This study addresses this gap by proposing a definition of the field, offering a preliminary overview of its current state, and tracing its evolution through a historical review. We conducted a computational content analysis of over 1,700 self-related articles from 137 communication journals listed in the ComAbstracts database from 1951 to 2020. Guided by Thomas Kuhn’s theory of scientific evolution and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory, our findings reveal that self-relevant communication research has progressed through 7 distinct cycles across 4 evolutionary periods: the initial period (1951–1972), the initial growth period (1973–1982), the transitional period (1983–2003), and the rapid growth period (2004–2020). While interpersonal communication was initially a focal point, it has become increasingly implicit in self-relevant research. The advent of social media has significantly accelerated the expansion of self-relevant research and it would seem likely to continue impacting its growth.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a state-of-the-art review on health and risk information acquisition, focusing on current approaches to conceptualizing, theorizing, and measuring information acquisition. We argue the current focus on seeking and scanning limits our understanding of the complex phenomenon of information acquisition and that scholars should consider examining a broader range of behaviors. In addition to reviewing current theorizing on information seeking, we argue for more macro theories of information acquisition behavior that better consider the current information environment and situations under which individuals acquire information, as well as theories that better delineate the process and effects of seeking. We also discuss new methods for capturing and measuring information acquisition behavior and present a roadmap for future research.",

          "authors": "Yeorang Bak",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the Mediation–Extension Schema (MES) as a theoretical framework for analyzing the ontological status of artificial intelligence as media. Drawing on philosophical media theory, it argues that AI should not be understood merely as a tool but as a system that actively shapes the conditions under which meaning, communication, and subjectivity emerge. MES integrates two conceptual lineages: mediation, from Aristotle’s metaxu , and extension, from Heidegger’s techne . Mediation refers to AI’s role in connecting otherwise isolated entities, while extension captures its capacity to reconfigure experiential and social structures. Through a concrete case of AI deployment, the paper demonstrates that such media operate as techno-social assemblages that transform human existence by mediating relations and extending the field of action. MES thereby offers a unified conceptual model for understanding how AI intervenes in the formation of being, knowledge, and power, contributing to ongoing debates in media philosophy, digital ontology, and the ethics of technology.",

          "authors": "Yu Shan",
          "abstract": "The recent re-emergence of virtual reality (VR) and metaverse has captivated global mainstream media, emerging as a significant cultural phenomenon. However, empirical research focusing specifically on the practices within China’s VR industry, a global leader in the VR market, is noticeably scarce. This paper aims to bridge this gap, exploring how VR, initially a technological innovation from the United States, has been integral to shaping the digital landscape in China, particularly following its conceptual localization by Qian Xuesen under the term “ lingjing .” This study examines VR-related history in China and the perceptions of Chinese VR practitioners on the development of VR in both the US and China via the framework of techno-cultural imaginaries. Drawing on interviews with virtual reality practitioners ( n = 48), this study observes that Chinese VR practitioners see that VR’s early evolution in the US was tied to a western techno-utopianism, advocating a decentralized, interconnected digital society. In contrast, China’s engagement with VR signifies a divergent path, one that embodies a strategy relying on an ambivalent latecomer advantage to bridge the technological gap with global leaders. Within this context, this paper unpacks the complex nature of technological innovation in modern China indicating that the technological innovation in China is not only a tool for progress but also a flag serving to revive traditional Chinese culture and, more importantly, to bolster specific political ideologies. This contrast illustrates the alternative trajectory of China’s VR industry, which, while initially inspired by the US, is progressively carving out its distinct future.",

          "abstract": "Users and regulators alike recognise the need for public consultation around new developments in artificial intelligence (AI). However, most consultations reflect economic or political concerns and tend to focus on Generative AI (GenAI) impacts on the traditional workforce, excluding gig economy workers in general and content creators in particular. In this two-stage study, we firstly report qualitative findings from a survey of 100 content creators, using these to design a quantitative survey issued to 307 content creators. In our thematic analysis of the qualitative data, we report a nuanced response to GenAI tools. Participants recognised that they might help to reduce an unmanageable workload, but that they might also render them redundant in certain contexts. Our content creators spoke meaningfully about different forms of loss, not just of jobs or of creativity, but also of the passion and the dedication to learning that provided much of the intrinsic motivation for creation. Quantitative survey findings showed that those who’d had greater experience of AI felt less threatened by the technology, but that concerns remained about fairness, data privacy and a rise in targeted advertising. Overall, we found that more diverse experiences need to be represented and considered in the public consultations informing the development and regulation of GenAI.",

Its methodology engages with PRISMA workflow, incorporating computational and qualitative analytic methods. Our findings reveal that while most digital tools share common placemaking goals, each (semi-)immersive technology excels in specific areas. AR Location-Based tools work best in encouraging active explorations of the urban spaces, while VR aces in facilitating real-time interactive co-design simulations and MR can bring virtual and on-site participants together in one platform. We also highlight the growing popularity of (semi-)immersive games, serious games and gamification in digital placemaking and explore their varying capacities. These findings contribute to an interdisciplinary approach that advances understanding of (semi-)immersive digital tool developments and informs better placemaking strategies and policies.",

          "authors": "Anqi Peng",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the formation and suppression of a digital feminist counterpublic through the case of Wang Huiling, a rare and outspoken content creator whose critiques of patriarchal marriage norms foreground the experiences of rural and working-class women in China. While digital feminist activism has gained increased visibility in recent years, it continues to prioritize urban, educated, and middle-class perspectives – leaving women from marginalized socio-economic backgrounds largely excluded from feminist discourses and representations. Focusing on Bilibili.com , this study analyzes how Wang challenges the dominant ‘leftover women’ discourse from a subaltern perspective, and how the platform’s distinctive bullet comment (弹幕) feature facilitates networked engagement that amplifies this counterpublic’s voice. Yet, the same technological infrastructure that enables feminist expression also facilitates a distributed network of control , where platform governance, state censorship, and participatory surveillance converge. Wang’s intersectional feminist critique experiences intensified scrutiny and precarity under Billibili’s logic of bidirectional governance, culminating in the total erasure of this counterpublic.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the interplay between political trust and affective polarization during the 2023 Dutch parliamentary elections and how this interplay is moderated by (social) media use. We hypothesize a reciprocal relationship, where trust influences affective polarization and vice versa. This interaction may intensify in election campaigns. Using a cross-lagged panel model on a panel wave survey conducted during the 2023 Dutch parliamentary election campaign, we analyze trust and polarization dynamics across five distinct media user types, including quality media users, social media users, and news minimalists. Findings indicate that higher political trust leads to lower affective polarization; however, polarization does not significantly impact trust. Importantly, quality media users show no connection between trust and polarization. In contrast, social media users exhibit less stable levels of political trust, highlighting the potential volatility of trust among this group during campaigns. Our findings emphasize media's moderating role in shaping political attitudes.",

We examine platformisation at the Flemish broadcaster VRT through the lens of its digital audio strategy. The study combines document analysis and expert interviews. Results show a strategic shift towards more focus on user needs and habits; a branding strategy revolving around the VRT parent brand; a necessary yet precarious presence on third-party platforms; a legacy-driven content offering complemented by online-only commissioning; and a firm editorial grip on content curation. VRT's take on these strategic innovations highlights a series of key dilemmas for PSM to reconcile public remit delivery and competitiveness in a platformised media landscape.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the evolution of immersive spatial design in Dungeons &amp; Dragons through phenomenological analysis of interiors in Tomb of Horrors , the only module recurrent for all the game's major editions. Drawing on game studies, phenomenology, and historiography, I compare the module's textual and visual assets to assess how spatial immersion is constructed, disrupted, and reimagined. The analysis shows that the first edition's visual–textual dissonance produces interpretive ambiguity that might enhance embodied player engagement. Later editions increasingly removed visual assets, but the rise of mixed-media platforming via virtual tabletops (VTTs) brings the visuality of spatial immersion back into focus. By reading the dissonance of visual and textual assets through Heideggerian and Merleau-Pontian models of space, I argue that VTT designers can benefit from intentional ambiguities to enrich experiential depth. Tomb of Horrors thus becomes a key site for understanding how tabletop and digital design practices shape ludic interiority.",

Building on mood management theory’s propositions about semantic affinity of content, we test how adversity in specific life domains is reflected in choice of entertaining media content surrounding the same life domain. In combining diary data from n = 122 Netflix users and data donations of their viewing histories with n = 2,122 titles, our study provides a novel methodological approach. Our findings show no effects of daily adversity on selecting content with more or less semantic affinity, but exploratory analyses reveal that daily media coping strategies differentially relate to the selection of different entertainment genres. These results emphasize (a) a lack of conceptual clarity surrounding semantic affinity in real-life media use and (b) the importance of situational approaches in media coping research.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Peer information can serve as an effective intervention to enhance individual fitness behaviors, offering potential benefits for health promotion and disease prevention. Extending prior literature on the influence of peer information on individual behaviors from the viewpoint of peer outcome information, this study aims to investigate the effect of peer progress information on targeted fitness and non-targeted sharing behaviors of users, as well as the moderating roles of users’ past performance and perceived peer pressure. Design/methodology/approach The authors develop hypotheses based on the theories of social comparison and social identity. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment on a popular online fitness platform, this study conducts several difference-in-differences models to test the causal effect of peer progress information. Findings The results reveal several robust and interesting findings. First, peer progress information significantly increases both exercise engagement and information sharing. Second, users with poor past performance or strong peer pressure exhibit greater responsiveness to peer progress information. Furthermore, the positive effects on fitness behavior are driven by upward social comparison rather than downward comparison, suggesting upward comparison may serve as an underlying mechanism. Practical implications This study provides actionable guidance for platform designers aiming to foster sustainable engagement through progress-based mechanisms.

          "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to better understand why consumers and firms use emojis in text messaging, including the contexts in which emojis are most frequently used and potential adverse consumer reactions. Design/methodology/approach The critical incident technique was used to develop the questionnaire for this qualitative study. Python was utilized for content analysis, and interrater reliability was assessed using machine coding and manual coding. Findings The content analysis revealed that consumers and firms consistently used emojis to express emotions and facilitate communication. However, inconsistencies were found in the emoji use by the two parties. These inconsistencies led to consumer confusion, where consumers perceived firms’ emoji use as unprofessional or inappropriate. Research limitations/implications This study adds to the existing research on emoji use in online communication by examining how firms’ inconsistent or ambiguous use can lead to negative consumer responses. However, the study used a small sample size and did not consider the role of artificial intelligence. Practical implications The study emphasizes the need to understand the target market and use emojis appropriately to prevent consumer confusion and negative attitudes toward firms. Originality/value The study results have practical and societal implications for businesses in creating effective messages in digital content marketing and online communication that minimize consumer confusion and online misinformation.",

          "authors": "Apoorva Singh, Abhijeet Biswas",
          "abstract": "Purpose Mobile games have become the third most popular category of mobile applications, just behind social media and online shopping apps. Although most mobile games are free to download and play, developers often utilize a freemium model, incorporating in-app purchases (IAPs) to enhance user engagement. Our study examines the intricate patterns of impulsive IAPs by identifying the factors that drive their popularity. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a mixed-methods approach to evaluate impulsive IAP behavior among mobile gamers. The in-depth interviews with 12 mobile gamers provided valuable contextual insights into the psychological and behavioral underpinnings of IAPs. The study also examined the impulsive IAP preferences among 575 mobile gamers using structural equation modeling. Findings The results indicate that in-app promotional offers, perceived time urgency, mobile game interactivity, and gaming community significantly influence users' imprudence and self-indulgence. These factors collectively enhance impulsiveness, magnifying the likelihood of mobile gamers' impulsive IAPs. Furthermore, cognitive fatigue among gamers strengthens the link between imprudence and self-indulgence on one side and impulsive IAPs on the other. Research limitations/implications Our findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders in the gaming industry, including mobile gaming companies, gamers, and regulatory authorities. Originality/value Previous studies on mobile gaming have not adequately examined the dimensions of impulsiveness influencing players' decisions to make impulsive IAPs. Therefore, the study investigates these dimensions by integrating the consumption impulse formation and enactment model with the stimulus-organism-response framework to understand the dynamics of the mobile gaming industry.",

          "abstract": "Purpose Anthropomorphism presents a promising strategy for improving information presentation in online health communication. Although showing significant potential, its underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions remain underexplored and warrant further research. This study, therefore, aims to investigate how anthropomorphic cues in online health risk information influence information persuasiveness, specifically examining the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments (Experiment 1: N = 198; Experiment 2: N = 118; Experiment 3: N = 146) were conducted to examine the impact of anthropomorphism on information persuasiveness, explore pertinent psychological mechanisms and investigate the moderating role of narrative perspective. Findings Anthropomorphic cues were found to enhance the persuasiveness of online health risk information by increasing perceived severity and vulnerability, and by reducing psychological reactance. Furthermore, narrative perspective was shown to moderate the relationships between anthropomorphic cues and both perceived severity and vulnerability. Practical implications Guidance is provided to health information providers on the effective application of anthropomorphic strategies in disseminating online health risk information. In addition, the study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate narrative perspectives that align with the specific characteristics of different diseases in health persuasion. Originality/value This study advances the understanding of anthropomorphic health risk information in online settings by demonstrating its efficacy in mitigating psychological reactance. The findings show that narrative perspectives of injurants versus victims moderate the influence of anthropomorphic health risk information on individuals’ perceived severity and vulnerability.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms form information ecosystems distinct from the Web and reconfigure power relationships, especially the distribution of visibilities, among news media. We developed a theoretical framework based on structuration theory to explain the differences between the Web and social media, and investigated four prominent factors: institutional legacy, information reliability, ideological differences, and news inequalities. This study collected social media data from three platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube; N = 8.4 million posts), web traffic data, and an information reliability index for 766 media outlets in the USA. We investigated how four factors explained differences between the platforms and the Web: media outlets that were digital-born (compared to newspapers), partisan, and mass-oriented gained greater visibilities on platforms relative to their web traffic. Meanwhile, the three platforms displayed differences. For example, only Twitter showed significantly increased visibilities of unreliable sources. Our multiplatform research design demonstrates the impact of platformization on journalism.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Social media content is often dominated by minority views espousing opinionated and politicized content, leading to a skewed representation of public discourse. This raises concerns about its impact on public engagement, as individuals may be discouraged from expressing their own beliefs in such an environment. We investigate this issue by exploring how Republican supporters of childhood vaccines (i.e., those who are in the majority) react when exposed to an online environment dominated by anti-vaccine Republicans (i.e., those who are in the minority). In a survey experiment ( N = 355), we find causal evidence that the majority view holders anticipate social conflict when exposed to a minority view-dominant information environment. Anticipated social conflict is then associated with reduced participation in online discussions. Notably, we find that anticipated social conflict, rather than one’s perception of public opinion, is a primary driver of self-silencing behavior, providing a roadmap for future research on interventions aimed at building people’s resilience to hostile information environments.",

Specifically, the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm, anthropomorphism, and solipsistic introjection are employed to examine the effects of the degree of AI involvement in information delivery when seeking clarification on a politicized issue – ranging from none (e.g., news article), to partial (e.g., AI-generated summaries in Google search results), to full reliance on AI (e.g., responses from ChatGPT). Findings from our online experiment with N = 551 US adults indicate that moderate and highly AI-powered sources are deemed more credible than non-AI human-authored sources, however, this effect is weakened by diminished perceptions of anthropomorphizing of AI. Further, solipsistic introjection is negatively related to message acceptance, indicating this intrapsychic processing may decrease the persuasiveness of messages that combat mis/disinformation.

This research examines the role of brokers, the key network actors straddling between misleading and true/regular information groups. Content-wise, morality expressions are examined, which signal social media users’ expressions toward what is right and wrong. This research provides insights into the understudied relationship between network brokerage and moral expressions and identifies connections between moral foundation and network brokerage theories. Findings suggest that binding morality (i.e., authority and loyalty) is dominant among network brokers. Practical strategies are suggested toward potentially harnessing the power of brokers and moral framing to help combat the spread of misleading information.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Given the importance of the credibility and effectiveness of health messaging during politicized public health events, this study explores both message source and message recipient factors in predicting perceived credibility and intent to comply with a COVID-19 mitigation message. Born out of disease avoidance, greater individual disgust sensitivity should lead to greater perceived risk and uptake of mitigation efforts. Meanwhile, conservative partisanship in the US has been associated with less perceived risk and behavioral compliance related to COVID-19. However, greater disgust, sensitivity, and political conservatism enjoy a positive relationship. To test this paradox, we explore both partisanship and disgust sensitivity, along with authoritarianism, to see which ultimately better predicts perceived credibility and intent to comply with government-issued COVID-19 guidance. We further explore partisanship by exploring how messages from the same (or different) political party influence message processing and effects. An online experiment with a US-based sample ( N = 424) found no influence of individuals’ political partisanship, but did find small (yet significant) effects such that messages from Democratic governors elicited greater intent to comply than Republican ones. Results about disgust sensitivity were mixed: greater pathogen disgust sensitivity was associated with greater perceived credibility of messages, whereas greater socio-moral disgust sensitivity was associated with greater intent to comply. Implications are discussed.",

As conspiracy theories proliferate online, traditional fact-checking and debunking strategies often prove ineffective due to the self-reinforcing nature of conspiracy theories. This research investigates whether a priori self-affirmation interventions can reduce individuals’ propensity to engage with conspiracy theories by preemptively fulfilling the ego-protective function these theories often serve. Using a randomized experiment ( N = 451), this study finds that participants who completed a self-affirmation task were less likely to read politicized conspiracy theories, and those who chose to read a conspiracy theory reported greater feelings of affirmation than those who did not. Thus, bolstering individuals’ self-integrity may offer an opportunity to mitigate the appeal of politicized conspiracy theories.",

This research provides a first look at such perceptions across a wide array of legacy and novel fact-check sources available today. An online survey of 993 participants and an experiment involving 1,002 participants were conducted to examine differences in credibility perceptions, usage, and sharing of fact-checks from professional fact-check organizations, mainstream news outlets, social media platforms, automated fact-check services, and crowdsourcing. Results show that legacy sources are considered most credible, fact-check receiver characteristics (political ideology, analytical thinking, and information literacy) influence perceptions of fact-checker credibility, and perceived credibility of fact-checkers is key to fact-check usage. Results also reveal that fact-checker source type and perceived credibility of fact-checkers are essential to fact-check sharing intention. Our findings advance the nascent concept of fact-checker credibility and contribute to theory, specifically the MAIN model and the stage framework model. They also offer novel data about new sources of fact-checking, including how AI and crowdsource-based fact-checkers are perceived by the public.",

          "abstract": "Despite its negative reputation, gossip is a common conversational behavior that can benefit relationships. However, its potential advantages have not been explored in romantic partnerships. Using a naturalistic observation method (the Electronically Activated Recorder; EAR) we assessed how frequently 76 same- and different-gender couples gossiped with each other, and whether this frequency was associated with self-reported happiness and relationship quality. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models revealed preliminary evidence that romantic partner gossip was positively associated with both happiness and relationship quality. This association held for both same- and different-gender couples. Given that romantic partners are primary sources of conversation and emotional exchanges for many adults, gossip may play a particularly important role in strengthening these bonds. Future research should replicate this finding and explore potential causal mechanisms and specific gossip characteristics that drive these associations, as gossip may be a fruitful avenue to test as a communication strategy for improving well-being in romantic partnerships.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decades, singlehood has become prevalent globally. In India, the same trend has been observed in recent years. Many singles are delaying marriage or choosing never to get married even though marriage is considered important in Indian society. This article explores how singlehood is experienced among Indian singles aged 30 years and older ( N = 153) and their quality of life. Using a mixed-method approach, it was found that a difference exists in the quality of life of the participants based on their gender and living arrangements. Thematic analysis revealed that our participants opt to remain unmarried due to a range of personal and cultural factors. The advantages of staying single include a sense of freedom to explore one’s interests and reduced emotional and financial responsibilities. However, there are notable disadvantages of remaining single for our participants, such as a Lack of intimacy, Apprehension related to health and financial security, Safety issues, and Perceived discrimination in the workplace. We suggest that the findings of this study can be used as a foundation for designing psychological interventions that address the needs of single adults in traditional social contexts.",

Some heterosexual men experience discordance between their sexual identities and behaviors and may have unique practices of sexual communication, but this has not been studied. Knowledge of their sexual communication practices is an important step toward understanding and improving their sexual experiences. Therefore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 heterosexual-identified men who have sex with men to learn more about their sexual communication strategies. Three themes were identified through interpretative phenomenological analysis: meeting sex partners, clear communication with men, and poor communication with women. Findings suggest that sexual communication is gendered. Participants reported utilizing short and explicit verbal and written communication strategies with other men via the internet and in various sexualized venues. Yet, participants more frequently used implicit sexual cues as the primary source of sexual communication when with women. Implications related to boosting sexual satisfaction and preventing nonconsensual sexual encounters are discussed.",

The results were presented in two themes: expectations and evaluations of relationships in adolescents. This for each of the domains: family and friends. Moreover, while adolescents value their relationships with caregivers, the COVID-19 pandemic increased physical proximity but diminished the quality of these bonds. With respect to peer relationships, the pandemic limited interactions to a virtual, superficial, and infrequent level. The return to in-person interactions was positively perceived, particularly in relation to friends relationships, emphasizing the importance of interaction quality. These findings highlight the complexity of relationships in times of crisis and underscore the need to differentiate between the quantity and quality of interactions to promote healthy development and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Men and women perceive marital burnout differently, and what triggers marital burnout may further differ with national context. This cross-national study examined how individuals’ conflict negotiation styles may mediate the relationship between gender and marital burnout. We analyzed survey data from 793 participants (Germans, N = 221; Indians, N = 175; Nigerians, N = 192; and South Africans, N = 205) using parallel mediation analyses via four negotiation styles ( yielding, avoiding, compromising, and problem-solving ). Our findings show that women experienced more marital burnout compared to men in the two African countries (Nigeria and South Africa) but not in Germany or India. Further, in Germany, India, and South Africa, men used avoiding more than women, and German and South African men also used yielding more than women. Results further showed that problem-solving was negatively related to marital burnout in all countries. In Germany, yielding was negatively related to marital burnout, while avoiding (in Germany, India, and Nigeria) and compromising (only in Nigeria) were positively related to marital burnout. Three conflict negotiation styles, yielding, problem-solving , and avoiding , mediated the association between gender and marital burnout in Germany, but only avoiding was a significant mediator in India. No mediation of conflict negotiation styles was significant in either African country. We discuss the findings in context of social roles, financial, and cultural expectations in marital relationships across countries.",

Results of a pre-registered two-wave online experiment ( N 1 = 1,785, N 2 = 1,568) suggest that debunking consistently reduces misperceptions and behavioral intentions for at least 1 week, while prebunking was less effective. Expert corrections only outperform non-expert corrections in reducing misperceptions in wave 1. In general, AI cues do not significantly influence the effectiveness of a correction, offering both opportunities and challenges for organizations hoping to automate corrections.",

          "abstract": "Technology has reshaped political communication, allowing fake engagement to drive real influence in the democratic process. Hyperactive social media users, who are over-proportionally active in relation to the mean, are the new political activists, spreading partisan content at scale on social media platforms. Using The Authenticity Matrix tool, this study revealed Facebook accounts of hyperactive users exhibiting inauthentic behaviour that were used during the electoral campaign (May 10, 2024, to June 8, 2024) for the 2024 election of Romanian members of the European Parliament. The results indicate that, for some posts, up to 45% of shares were made by hyperactive users (four or more shares per post by the same account) and 33.9% by super-active users (10 or more times). This type of online behavior is considered by Meta as manipulation of “public opinion,” “political discussion,” and “public debate,” and Meta’s Community Standards is committed to preventing such behavior in the context of elections. Another key contribution of this research is the identification of dominant characteristics of hyperactive user accounts, using information publicly available on their social media profile, which provides insights into their specific features and helps users better identify them on social media. The article highlights that online social network platforms condemn these manipulative practices in theory, but they don’t take sufficient measures to effectively reduce them in order to limit their impact on our societies.",

          "authors": "Mariia Aleksevych, Tales Tomaz",
          "abstract": "Far from being a concern of the past, media ownership concentration is a feature of hybrid media systems. This raises the issue of how to measure the concentration and allow for informed decisions to be made, especially for policymaking. Some of the most popular metrics are the concentration ratio (CR&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). However, the new hybrid context increasingly renders the usual economic concentration metrics obsolete to understand the power of communication players. This article provides a theoretical overview and methodological considerations on ways to interrogate ownership relations, advancing network analysis and visualization as useful tools to better grasp power relations alongside traditional economic metrics. We illustrate our proposal with an analysis of media ownership data from Denmark and Greece, as provided by the Euromedia Ownership Monitor in 2022. Our article goes beyond the approach of the monitor, as we incorporate additional components, such as the power of beneficial owners over the audience. This approach provides a broader analysis of media ownership concentration and can inspire scholarly work to explore more aspects of this topic.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, most EU countries have seen the unstoppable growth of populist parties, especially on the right, but also on the left. Their Euro-critical discourse, sometimes openly Eurosceptic, is helping to erode the legitimacy of the EU. This research aims to analyze the presence of populist discourse among major Spanish political parties during the 2024 European elections on platform X. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we collected tweets from the official accounts of parties represented in the Spanish parliament, focusing on Unidas Podemos, Sumar, Parido Socialista Obrero Español, Partido Popular, and VOX from May 24 to June 10, 2024. A quantitative analysis with large language models, specifically the Text-Zero-Shot model, BART-Large-MNLI, and a socio-hermeneutic qualitative interpretation facilitated the identification of key populist indicators, including anti-elitism, appeals to the people, the expression of popular will, and the delineation of enemies. Our findings reveal that VOX is the only political party that, in this specific communicative (social network X) and political (European Parliament elections) context, employs a populist discourse characterized by a marked opposition between the people and political elites, both national and European, as well as critical and/or exclusionary rhetoric toward certain immigrant groups, especially from Arab countries. The results underscore the need for further research on how national contexts shape the articulation of populism in political communication strategies through social media.",

          "abstract": "The societal anxiety over children's smartphone addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted parents of left-behind children in China to adopt various strategies for remotely domesticating smartphones. This paper advances domestication theory and presents findings from a year-long study of 19 left-behind families from two rural schools in China. The study reveals how smartphone governance has reshaped the spatial order of the household, redefined family roles, and transformed family structures. By using webcams to monitor children's bodies and domestic spaces, assigning stricter and more responsible moral identities to grandparents, and building peer-based family support networks, these families have integrated smartphones as tools of productivity into their everyday life. The research further illustrates how the pandemic has brought modern state governance into the home, profoundly altering traditional models of child-rearing in Chinese families.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary carceral systems function through the restriction of physical movement and the regulation of information flows, so how do prisoners’ smuggled mobile technologies renegotiate mobilities in carceral spaces? Grounded in the new mobilities paradigm and drawing on the concept of carceral mobilities, this study proposes the framework of digital carceral mobilities to analyze new possibilities of embodied and digital mobilities enabled using illicit mobile technologies in prisons. Using Lebanon's carceral institutions as a case study and based on digital ethnography of three Facebook pages, an analysis of recordings circulated by prisoners via social media and news outlets from 2020 to 2023, and a contextual interview with a former prisoner, the paper categorizes four key modalities of digital carceral mobilities: embodied mobility, mediated mobility, spatiotemporal mobility, and material mobility. This paper argues that prisoners renegotiate mobile technologies – both material and network – allowing them to relay their lived experiences and harsh conditions behind bars and explore new possibilities of movement within the carceral space. The framework of digital carceral mobilities demonstrates that mobility within carceral spaces is inherently paradoxical, functioning simultaneously as a pathway to potential agency, through enabling new possibilities of embodied and virtual movements, and as an extension of confinement under the guise of connectivity, by reinforcing the oppressive and socioeconomic inequalities of the carceral, political, and digital systems.",

          "abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of smartphones has led to their prominence as a dominant source of news for a vast majority of people. In this context, the impact of mobile technology’s affordances, including access, applications, and mobile alerts, on news engagement has been the subject of numerous studies. At the same time, recent research has found an increase in those who either have very low news usage or intentionally or unintentionally avoid news. Within a deliberative public sphere perspective, habitual news avoidance presents many problems, including lack of civic engagement and lack of critical information for partaking in public life. Drawing on framing theory and results from two experimental studies, this research sought to examine the intersection of the promise of mobile news alerts for enhancing news engagement intentions and curiosity among high-level news avoiders. Study 1 shows that positive frames in mobile alerts are associated with higher engagement intentions in high news avoiders, and this effect is mediated by curiosity. In study 2, the results show that positive framing with three facts is associated with higher levels of engagement intentions, and this is mediated by curiosity. Further, the results show that for moderate news avoiders, two facts, which are negatively framed, should be used.",

          "abstract": "From slavery to police brutality, the Black struggle in the United States can be traced in the visual field. The online dissemination of disparate acts of violence against Black men first widely publicized when a witness recorded the beating of Rodney King on a cellphone in 1991, has evolved into a U.S. cultural phenomenon, culminating with the video of the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Insufficient attention has been paid to how audiences with lived experiences of systemic injustice bear witness to such videos. This paper seeks to understand how Black audiences engage with these sites of violence captured on cell phones and disseminated on social media platforms. The paper argues that instead of serving as a tool for accountability, the widespread dissemination of mediated Black suffering has engendered a ceaseless state of anxiety and somber acceptance of the precarity of the Black body in the United States.",

Yet this work has tended to focus on the effects of mis/disinformation for individual misperceptions rather than interpersonal relationships. In turn, this study looks to explore the relational impact of online mis/disinformation on romantic relationships. Through in-depth interviews (N = 28) with individuals who have terminated romantic relationships due to political difference(s) in the United States, I find that mis/disinformation plays a key role in the termination of romantic relationships, encouraging informational, and relational isolation and disrupting shared reality between partners. These findings advance our understanding of media effects and the growing complication of online mis/disinformation in a polarized society.",

Employing a dual methodology of digital ethnography and auto-ethnography, we argue that this migration functions as performative resistance against state territorialization while evoking the tension of visibility on the destination platform. These dynamics generates a range of discourses and practices related to place representations and negotiation, shaped by linguistic, cultural, and political boundaries between self and other. We discovered algorithmic governance, depoliticized solidarity, cultural ownership, and neoliberal precarity as important themes in this digital place-making. By focusing on privileged and metaphorical refugees, their reception on the host platform, and the responses from state and corporate actors, our findings advance understanding of digital places as both contested sites of power struggle and as containers for cultural fusion.",

This study investigates how misinformation circulates in these groups, focusing on social distance, group status, and interpersonal dynamics. Drawing on Social Distance Theory of Power and Social Exchange Theory, we employed a mixed-methods approach, including non-participant observation, sociometric analysis, and semi-structured interviews across 12 Chinese online groups. Findings indicate that misinformation is often disseminated by socially distant yet structurally central members, while correction efforts come from more socially embedded but less influential participants. Group discussions reinforced trust in misinformation through interpersonal validation and repeated exposure. Correction was constrained by relational risks, making it a socially sensitive act. These insights highlight how group dynamics shape misinformation engagement and suggest the need for socially aware intervention strategies in these digital spaces.",

By recreating the sequence of events over the course of eleven days, I map and analyse the hybrid media scandal that triggered a Swedish Liberal Party leader’s sudden resignation following statements made in a party YouTube video. The analysis adds insights into temporal complexities of contemporary scandal in hybrid media and displays the power of opinion leaders and the continued significance of legacy media in ensuring tangible political consequences for scandal narratives. The analysis further illustrates the importance of going beyond news end-products when attempting to gain a comprehensive understanding of how and why scandals unfold and highlights the relevance of social, cultural, and political contexts to grasp hybrid media scandals.",

          "abstract": "A so-called green transition is ongoing in the Swedish North, primarily driven by investments in making basic industries fossil-free. The societal impact in the region is widespread and complex, and the ecological gain is sometimes disputed. In this study, we identify topics, themes, and evolving discourses about the “green” transition in a dataset (N = 9,755 texts) comprising published texts in Swedish news media between 2015 and 2023. Discourse analysis and topic modelling are combined, and the analysis shows two intersecting dominant discourses. The Green Growth discourse included articulations of beneficial, although challenging, green growth and energy transitions. The Swedish North discourse revealed continued tensions in the understanding of the region as a centre and a periphery. Even if marginal, contestations were identified, for example, questioning the “greenness” in green growth. Taken together, the dominance of industrial and political perspectives in the news media coverage and debate limits possibilities for alternatives.",

          "abstract": "Substantial minorities of the population report a low degree of trust in science, or endorse conspiracy theories that violate basic scientific knowledge. This might indicate a wholesale rejection of science. In four studies, we asked 782 US participants questions about trust in science, conspiracy beliefs, and basic science (e.g. the relative size of electrons and atoms). Participants were provided with the scientifically consensual answer to the basic science questions, and asked whether they accept it. Acceptance of the scientific consensus was very high in the sample as a whole (95.1%), but also in every sub-sample (e.g. no trust in science: 87.3%; complete endorsement of flat Earth theory: 87.2%). This quasi-universal acceptance of basic science suggests that people are motivated to reject specific scientific beliefs, and not science as a whole. This could be leveraged in science communication.",

          "abstract": "Science communication plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust in science amid complex societal challenges. This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors. It introduces the CASSCO (Complex Adaptive Systems in Science Communication) model, which integrates complex adaptive systems theory with game theory to analyze strategic interactions in science communication. The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between altruistic and self-interested roles across three communication modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios—citizen science and generative AI—the study demonstrates its potential for predicting nonlinear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications, model limitations, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "Prefactual thinking, a form of prospective mental simulation, significantly impacts individuals’ decision-making. To understand the influence of media consumption on public opinion regarding emerging technologies, this study, in the context of generative artificial intelligence (AI), examined prefactual thinking as a cognitive process of media consumption, extending the cognitive mediation model. Using quota sampling, we conducted an online survey of 1,129 Hong Kong adult residents. The findings revealed that elaborative processing was positively associated with prefactual thinking, which, in turn, influenced emotional responses. Prefactual thinking and emotional responses shaped benefit-risk perceptions, which influenced individuals’ generative AI opinion. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.",

          "abstract": "Digital citizen science is expected to achieve equal dialogue between scientists and the public, and further the democratization of science. However, through critical technocultural discourse analysis of three Chinese citizen science digital platforms and interviews with their users, it was found that the interfaces of these platforms are embedded with scientific ideological styles and “boundary work” features. Those platforms tend to frame the public as ignorant data collection tools waiting to be guided by scientists, while scientists are framed as educators worthy of admiration. Therefore, the role of digital citizen science in democratization of science should not be overestimated.",

          "abstract": "Social media has redefined traditional mourning spaces, enabling new forms of digital mourning that challenge established emotional norms. While existing studies often focus on digital mourning within public social media platforms, less attention has been given to the semi-public platforms. This study takes China’s WeChat Moments as a case study to explore how individuals narrate and reflect on their digital mourning practices, specifically how they interpret platform affordances, navigate emotional tensions, and develop media strategies in response. It conceptualizes the imagination and appropriation of social media and the emotional restraint practiced to avoid conflicts as “mediated emotional repertoire.” This concept reflects individuals’ management of private emotions in the digital sphere, highlighting the complex interplay between social media platforms, cultural norms, and interpersonal interactions.",

          "abstract": "Weibo, one of China’s most influential social media platforms, has emerged as a key battleground for gender controversies, with digital feminism growing increasingly assertive and visible. Official media, representing the party-state, frequently intervening in these online debates, act as both opinion leaders and mediators. This study examines how Weibo netizens perceive the party-state’s involvement in gender controversies and how these perceptions shape discussions around gender politics in China, shedding light on the evolving landscape of Chinese feminism. Drawing on the Scenario Approach to Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) and Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis, complemented by thematic analysis, this study analysed 3199 Weibo posts under two hashtags initiated by the party-state media. The findings reveal that netizens perceive the party-state as a betrayer of its original commitment to women, and an enforcer of double standards, favouring men while marginalising and instrumentalising women for political gain. The findings also reveal growing recognition of Chinese feminism among netizens, with particular attention to ‘pink feminists’ and their critical reflection on their dual identities. By examining the interplay between the party-state intervention and feminist discourse through the lens of netizen reactions, this study offers a unique perspective on the entanglement of party-state power, gender politics and digital activism in contemporary China.",
