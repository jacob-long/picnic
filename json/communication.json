          "authors": "Anna Schjøtt, Mette Bengtsson",
          "abstract": "With the recent development of debunking on social media as a dominant agenda, fact checkers have increasingly used machine learning (ML) to identify, verify and correct factual claims, as ML promises the scaling of fact checking practices. However, it also places a new actor in between the fact checkers and the fact checked users. In this paper, we conducted a contrasted analysis of how fact checkers and fact checked users understand, evaluate and act towards the algorithmic system and the data flows in Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program: We did ethnographic fieldwork in the fact checking newsroom and interviewed and did protocol analysis with the fact checked. For both professional users and end users, the algorithmic system is experienced as a black box in which they have limited insight, and their sense-making practices happen based on the data and metrics that are made visible to them. In the paper, we draw on and expanded theory on decoding algorithms by not only exploring how the two user groups engage in decoding the algorithmic system, but also actively engage in forms of recoding by attempting to adapt or modify the algorithmic system to better fit within their cultural and social context, which is characterised by both varying epistemic cultures and societal positions. While the fact checkers from their hegemonic (sometimes negotiated) position understand the program as a (sometimes stupid) tool and primarily engage in passive acts of recoding, fact checked users, from their oppositional position, understand the program as an unpredictable censoring machine and engage primarily in more active acts of recoding. Based on the analysis, we end the paper with a discussion in which we argued for understanding data reflexivity as highly relational and processual.",

          "abstract": "This study explores  Fursan al-Aqsa: The Knights of the Al-Aqsa Mosque (developed by Nidal Nijm Games in 2022) highlighting its role in the portrayal of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a paradigm between propaganda and entertainment. By examining the game’s discourse, and its impact on player perceptions, this research sheds light on how video games can shape understanding and engagement with geopolitical issues. The research utilises Albert Bandura’s concept of moral disengagement to analyse the game’s content and its reception on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. By assessing how the game frames moral considerations through its narrative and gameplay, this study reveals the potential of digital games to affect player perceptions and contribute to the broader media landscape surrounding political issues. The analysis also explores the reception and re-interpretation of the game by players and content creators, thus offering insights into the complex interplay between video game content, ideological influence, and audience engagement.",

          "authors": "Raluca Petre",
          "abstract": "The right to public life has been one of the most important achievements of modernity. It was a result of long and painful civil struggles for dignity in a democratic public sphere. While de jure we are all welcome in the public sphere, de facto rapid processes of fragmentation and numerous contexts of misinformation insulate the actual chances of meaningful contribution to public life. Platform users are aggressively approached as consumers of goods and services and continuously stimulated to produce large quantities of any content, just to feed the voracious platforms. The sobering truth is that many people on the private high-tech platforms do not act like true democrats, but like private individuals who pursue very personal aims. At the same time, a private person does not have a mandate to act in the public interest of the rest of the citizens. For these reasons, we turn to information as a public good and public responsibility in this special issue. It is about media as a public service that allows democracy to keep centre stage within a polity. When citizens interact with relevant public information, they build the capacity to control their political environment, to form informed opinions and act upon them. When this basic desideratum is not structurally at the core of society, one cannot even start to consider democracy as the first course of action for the generations to come. Information as a public good is not a thing of nature, but a purposeful action. We take this stance when we approach information as a public good, rather than some residual category of market failure. The scope of this special issue is to analyse and explore the resources and institutional settings that allow information to thrive as a public good in the European contemporary informational ecosystem.",

          "authors": "Marius Dragomir, Miguel Túñez López",
          "abstract": "Despite enjoying a series of advantages and privileges, including access to public funding and technical infrastructure, as well as a special regulatory framework allowing them to reach almost the entire population, public service media (PSM) have historically faced a number of challenges. These include opposition from privately held media and various political parties, mounting criticism from audiences, and incessant pressures from state authorities. Some have been more successful than others in defending themselves against these attacks. Some PSM institutions have gained a high level of trust as a result of their ability to maintain a balanced approach to political coverage. Some are recognised for the quality of their news content. However, some other organisations have lost credibility and audience share as a result of various pressures. The platformisation trend has had a particularly disruptive impact on public service media (PSM) organisations. The challenge of adapting to the new digital landscape has been significant, requiring careful navigation to maintain the core values that guide their operations, as defined by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU): universality, independence, excellence, diversity, accountability and innovation. This article employs a recently developed framework for examining PSM and draws upon field research to analyse the transformation of PSM in response to platformisation-related pressures in four European countries: Austria, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom.",

          "abstract": "This article addresses the question of whether a withdrawal from social media platforms represents a viable strategy in the ongoing relational power negotiations between public service media and platforms, and if so, under what conditions. Recent diverging strategic efforts from public service broadcasters in two European countries – Germany and Norway – serve as illustrations of how existing organizations attempt to manoeuvre the current online realm dominated by platforms. I discuss findings from qualitative studies of news use in Norway and draw on comparative survey data on news use. I propose that high levels of trust in public service media, and widespread use of the public service broadcaster's own sites and offers, are key prerequisites to consider when assessing the viability of a withdrawal from third-party platforms in different countries. By zooming in on one type of media organization (public service broadcasters), and looking at different such organizations’ characteristics and context, and the dynamics of their relations to online platforms, the paper contributes to our understanding of platform power.",

          "title": "Unlocking public infrastructures? State aid and the common European data space",
          "authors": "Toni Prug, Paško Bilić",
          "abstract": "EU state aid rules are part of the EU’s competition policy, a form of soft law developed to nudge states away from public investments in many areas. Rules were used to impose that market competition holds a privileged position, and that enacting social, political, or economic benefits that might stifle competition requires a complicated legal and political negotiation process between the European Commission, Member States, and private companies. Nonetheless, many strategic projects or situations in recent years led to significant state aid. The Commission utilised a variety of means to encourage both private and public investments in EU based digital infrastructure that is critical for public media services and for unified European data space. Despite EU’s balancing act between the private and public interests, business interests are dangerously capturing the development in the media data space. To grasp the social and economic contribution of publicly financed productive activities, we approach public broadcasting systems as producers of public wealth of a peculiar kind whose activities and goals are defined by their public purpose, rather than the imperatives of capital and profitmaking. Unifying data spaces with too many design decisions conceded to capitalist production runs the risk of further neglecting social foundations of member states. We argue that the desired digital transformation would be more successful if it moved towards affirmative approaches to public services and public infrastructures, recognising the historical and contemporary contribution of the production of public wealth and public media in member states.",

          "authors": "Xiang Gong, Yi Yang, Wei Wu",
          "abstract": "Purpose Social group system and social tagging system, which leverage the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence and social tags to drive consumer behaviors, have been prevalent in the social commerce platform. However, limited studies have examined how the affordances of social group system and social tagging system influence consumers’ social shopping behavior. The purpose of this study is to examine the formation of social shopping behavior in the social commerce platform. Design/methodology/approach Combining affordance theory with dual-congruity theory, we develop a model to examine how the affordances of social group system and social tagging system influence consumers’ social shopping behavior through the underlying self-congruity and functional-congruity processes. We empirically validate the research model using a multimethod approach, including an instrument development study and a field survey study. Findings Our empirical findings show that social support positively influences relational identity, while it has a nonsignificant effect on social identity. Social interactivity positively influences relational identity and social identity. Furthermore, social tagging quality and social endorser credibility positively affect perceived diagnosticity and perceived serendipity. Finally, relational identity, social identity, perceived diagnosticity and perceived serendipity collectively determine consumers’ social shopping intention. Originality/value This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of social shopping in social commerce and offers practical implications for designing an effective social group system and social tagging system to boost product sales.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The current study explores two distinct augmented reality (AR) experiences (hedonic and utilitarian) to determine the drivers of satisfaction and word-of-mouth (WOM). Specifically, this research investigates how different AR characteristics (person–virtual environment (VE) interaction, novelty) impact reality congruence and immersion, which ultimately lead to satisfaction and WOM. Design/methodology/approach We tested the proposed model using a US consumer sample ( N  = 401) by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to reveal differences across the AR experiences regarding the mediating effects of immersion and reality congruence. Furthermore, we administered PLS-SEM multigroup analysis to identify differences for hedonic and utilitarian AR experiences. Findings This study provides important insights into the use of AR to create value-driven consumer experiences and outcome behaviors. Interacting with the virtual environment (VE) enhances immersion for hedonic AR experiences while it leads to higher levels of reality congruence for utilitarian AR experiences. While established relationships such as novelty to immersion continue to be significant, new constructs such as person–VE interaction and reality congruence immerge as stronger influences. Originality/value To date, most studies have implemented apps such as IKEA Place and have considered value as one comprehensive construct. However, limited research has examined differences in hedonic and utilitarian AR experiences. The current findings enhance the understanding of utilizing value-driven consumer experiences within the AR context to achieve desirable outcome behaviors.",

Although many isolated tasks have been proposed, a roadmap on how to best approach a new task from the perspective of text formality or the leverage of existing resources has not been explored yet. Design/methodology/approach We present a comprehensive study using several datasets on textual propaganda and different techniques to tackle it. We explore diverse collections with varied characteristics and analyze methodologies, from classic machine learning algorithms, to multi-task learning to utilize the available data in such models. Findings Our results show that transformer-based approaches are the best option with high-quality collections, and emotionally enriched inputs improve the results for Twitter content. Additionally, MTL achieves the best results in two of the five scenarios we analyzed. Notably, in one of the scenarios, the model achieves an F1 score of 0.78, significantly surpassing the transformer baseline model’s F1 score of 0.68. Research limitations/implications After finding a positive impact when leveraging propaganda’s emotional content, we propose further research into exploiting other complex dimensions, such as moral issues or logical reasoning. Originality/value Based on our findings, we provide a roadmap for tackling propaganda-related tasks, depending on the types of training data available and the task to solve. This includes the application of MTL, which has yet to be fully exploited in propaganda detection.",

          "abstract": "Purpose This investigation delves into the elements influencing social networking sites (SNS) use reduction behavior through the lens of the cognitive-affective (CA) model to understand the driving forces behind the decline in SNS use. Design/methodology/approach Following the CA model, this research introduces a theoretical framework that integrates the emotions of regret and guilt along with the principles of cognitive dissonance theory. The proposed theoretical framework was subjected to empirical validation, utilizing 453 responses gathered from Instagram users. Findings The results suggest that the emotions of regret and guilt have a favorable impact on users’ intention to decrease their SNS usage, with cognitive dissonance exerting an indirect positive influence through these emotions. Additionally, further examination unveils that fear moderates the connection between users’ SNS addiction and the CA components. Research limitations/implications Additional cognitive and affective responses may influence the intricate relation between SNS addiction and SNS use reduction intention. Originality/value This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge on the information system use lifecycle by examining shifts in user behavior, notably the transition from excessive use to the adoption of use reduction strategies. Furthermore, it sheds light on the intricate role of cognitive dissonance in elucidating the intention to reduce SNS use from the perspective of the CA model. Additionally, this study advances our current understanding of how the fear of negative consequences arising from excessive usage plays a role as a moderating factor in elucidating the underlying internal factors related to reducing SNS usage.",

          "abstract": "We compare interpretations of two kinds of statements that are important for stereotype transmission: generics (e.g., “women are helpful”) and comparatives (e.g., “women are more helpful than men”). Participants ( N = 338) read and interpreted generic or comparative statements about positive and negative features of gender (Experiment A) and age groups (Experiment B). We found similarities and differences. Participants interpreted both generics and comparatives as conveying information not only about the target (women in the example) but also about the referent (men in the example), whether the statement explicitly mentioned the referent (in comparatives) or not (in generics). When statements said something positive (negative) about the target, they also communicated a rather negative (positive) view of the referent. Remarkably, although comparatives explicitly contrast groups while generics do not, generics implied bigger differences between the groups and provoked more extreme assumptions about the groups. We discuss implications for stereotype transmission.",

It is a stressful job, associated with reduced mental health and well-being. In this study, an anonymous survey was used to demonstrate most CMs cope by seeking support from colleagues and this is associated with lower psychological distress and secondary trauma and higher well-being whereas increased smoking and alcohol consumption is associated with increased symptomology. Well-being services were not related to a reduction in psychological distress or trauma. We argue these results fit within a framework of trauma-informed working and provide evidence for its utility in the trust and safety sector.

Whereas there is a robust literature on the mechanics and the importance of constructive communication, little is known about how these findings generalize to text-based forms of communication. Using a sample of 71 Black women between the ages of 18–29, the present study examined how the content of text messages changed in response to a short mindfulness-based intervention delivered via a smartphone application. Findings revealed that these women used the intervention to modify maladaptive communication to be more constructive, as well as to enhance neutral communication. They were also less likely to send maladaptive messages after composing them and going through the intervention. In addition to emphasizing the relevance of existing communication theories to text-based communication, this study highlights the potential for the phone to be used as a vehicle for mindful communication amongst a variety of relationship types despite its potential for misuse.",

This article contributes by presenting a theoretically grounded experimental study addressing hypotheses of news framing effects on authoritarian attitudes. Two panel experiments, on news about disturbance in school and public libraries, provide evidence of main effects of amplified framings of social disturbance, as well as an activation mechanism.",

          "authors": "Selina Noetzel, Alice Binder, Jörg Matthes",
          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Political microtargeting (PMT) is a popular campaign tool in elections worldwide. However, it is associated with democratic risks. Foremost, scholars and policymakers are concerned that citizens cannot cope with PMT and, thus, stand vulnerable to persuasion. To assess this risk, an in-depth understanding of how citizens make sense of and cope with PMT is required. However, empirical studies are scarce, partially inconclusive, and provide global rather than nuanced insights. This study contributes to this research by employing an innovative, qualitative gaze-cued retrospective think-aloud design to distinguish types of citizens who differ in their coping and, based on that, assess their vulnerability to persuasion via PMT (&lt;em&gt;N &lt;/em&gt;= 25). The results reveal similarities regarding conceptual persuasion knowledge activation (i.e., advertising and targeting awareness) but differences in attitudinal and behavioral coping, illustrated along five coping types. Only “the neutral observer” seems vulnerable to PMT. For “the partisan”, PMT might strengthen existing ties but backlash when employed by a non-preferred party. Other types seem less receptive to PMT (“the political nerd”, “the ad connoisseur”) and/or political advertising (“the avoider”). This study informs educators and policymakers about citizens’ coping mechanisms with PMT and their potential vulnerability, which may guide intervention and regulation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;",

By educating and empowering individuals, these organisations and their educational branches are identified as emerging components within MIL ecosystems, particularly focusing on engaging youth. Using qualitative research methods, our study analyses the activities of seven prominent fact-checking organisations and two university-affiliated projects across Spain, Catalonia, Poland, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Argentina, and Brazil. Thus, our study aims to understand why fact-checking organisations have become involved in MIL education and training for youth and what types of MIL, approaches, and subjects fact-checking organisations employ in their MIL education and training initiatives for this audience. Our findings reveal a shift in these organisations toward actively promoting MIL education through dedicated divisions and teams driven by mission-oriented action and peer collaboration. Various institutions and political and educational policies support or hinder this transformation. A significant issue observed is the limited availability of open-access materials and general opacity regarding their pedagogical approaches. Although these organisations have integrated educational components into their models, achieving financial sustainability remains challenging.",

While many studies focus on the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites (SNS) during elections, parties’ use of Google Ads remains widely opaque (exception Medina Serrano et al., 2020). This is surprising given the fact that parties do spend substantial amounts of their budget on Google Ads and Google reports on these spending and other details of the ads in its Transparency report (Fitzpatrick 2023). Based on the equalisation vs. normalisation thesis we identify party factors (size, age, government/opposition statutes and electoral strongholds) affecting parties use of this instrument to a different degree in their campaigns (Garcia Lupato &amp;amp; Meloni, 2023). This contribution intends to shed light on parties’ use of Google ads during the campaigns for the German Bundestag election 2021 relying on the official data provided via Googles Ad Library. It discusses both empirical work on the factors determine use of and conceptual work on the merit and perils of Google Ads in democratic elections and present exploratory findings of our deep dive into the archive of Google Ads.&lt;/p&gt;",

However, the advent of public ad libraries from Meta and Google provides an opportunity to measure the scope and variation in DDC practice in advertising across different types of sponsors and within sponsors across platforms. Using textual and audiovisual processing, we create a database of ads from the 2022 U.S. elections.  These data allow us to create an index that quantifies the extent of DDC at the level of the sponsor and platform.  This index takes into account both the number of unique creatives placed and the similarity across those creatives.  In addition, we explore the impact of sponsor resources, the office being sought, the competitiveness of the race, and the goal of the ad on the measure of DDC sophistication. Ultimately, our research establishes a measurement strategy for DDC that can be applied across ad sponsors, campaigns, parties and event countries.  Understanding the extent of DDC is vital for policy discussions surrounding the regulation of microtargeting and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;",

Many researchers consider factors such as attitude, cultural environment, or institutional setting in their frameworks when researching digital literacy. Yet, their significance often gets lost in a catalog of required skills and knowledge. Here we develop a model outlining factors influencing university personnel’s digital performance across diverse tasks, and we discuss associated challenges. The model derives from literature and insights from 20 qualitative interviews with academic staff in teaching, research, or consulting roles. Results show that institutional settings and employee empowerment are pivotal in shaping openness to digital tools. Intentions fail due to resource constraints and lack of recognition, leading to limited experience with digital opportunities. Well-being significantly influences willingness to embrace digital resources amidst the balancing act of anticipating future efficiency against investing time and resources. Maintaining a team atmosphere often results in alignment with the least digitally competent. With appropriate conditions, time resources, and support, staff could efficiently utilize digital resources, even with only basic skills, which fosters the integration of all workforces. We argue for comprehensive assessments of university employees’ digital performances, considering context and holistic aspects beyond personal skills and knowledge. Our model encompasses digital literacy, openness to digital developments, digital culture, primary conditions, services/empowerment offerings, and mindfulness.",

          "abstract": "&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;This article explores the potential of new, immersive realities to convey the complex experiences of gender dysphoria and body dissatisfaction, using the innovative and multi-award-winning experience &lt;em&gt;Body of Mine&lt;/em&gt; as a case study. Recognizing a gap in understanding and empathy towards gender-queer communities, &lt;em&gt;Body of Mine&lt;/em&gt; employs an innovative full-body tracking solution to place users into the body of someone else, combined with first-person documentary interviews and interactive elements aimed at fostering a deeper connection and insight into the transgender experience. Initial feedback from users indicates a heightened awareness and emotional connection to the challenges faced by individuals with gender dysphoria, as well as an increase in self-body positivity, based on a study conducted in collaboration with the University of Tübingen’s Department of Psychology. This project underscores the power of immersive storytelling in fostering embodied understanding, while also acknowledging the ethical complexities and voyeuristic risks when sharing narratives from vulnerable communities, and explores innovative methods for tackling social issues through emerging technology. It concludes by contemplating the implications of immersive technologies for the concept of identity in a world that increasingly transcends the physical body, suggesting a future where the notion of self is not confined to physical form but is fluid, multifaceted, and continually redefined within boundless digital horizons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Research on data-driven campaigning has mostly focused on the strategies of central campaign teams. However, there is a lack of evidence explaining how parties and supporters use data-driven campaigning techniques to organise their social media campaigning. Do user engagement metrics influence the choice of campaign themes by encouraging political parties to concentrate their communication on issues that are most liked, commented on, and shared? Our study focuses on the use of Facebook by French political parties and their supporters during the 2022 presidential election campaign. We conducted a supervised content analysis based on machine learning to examine their Facebook posts (n = 17,060). We also conducted interviews with 26 page managers. Our results show that political parties did not address the political issues that generated the most user engagement, in particular because the engagement of followers is more likely to be stimulated by divisive issues. The parties' electoral communication is always organised at the intersection between their traditional issues, those that most distinguish them in the political landscape, and some divisive issues that emerged during the campaign. Finally, we argue that campaign strategies are not fundamentally changed by social media metrics. Rather, they differ significantly according to the status of the parties (governing VS opposition parties), which influences the way they manage their Facebook pages during the presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Much of the research on political microtargeting has focused on growing public concerns about its use in elections, fuelling calls for greater regulation or even an outright ban of the practice. We contend that a more nuanced understanding of public attitudes toward microtargeting is required before further regulatory measures are considered. Drawing on advertising psychology research, we argue that concern, and by corollary, acceptance of microtargeting will vary based on the type of personal data used. Specifically, we hypothesise that microtargeting that relies on observable or publicly accessible personal information will be more accepted by voters than that which uses unobserved and inferred traits. We test our expectations using comparative survey data from three countries - the US, Germany and Netherlands. Our hypotheses are broadly confirmed in each case, indicating that not all microtargeting is considered equally problematic, and what is of concern differs to a degree across countries. Our findings also challenge whether certain forms of ‘sensitive’ data should automatically be excluded from political microtargeting. We conclude by calling for a more contextualised debate about the benefits as well as costs of microtargeting prior to the expansion of current regulation.&lt;/p&gt;",

The objective is to understand how, in this hostile environment, fact-checkers in these two countries manage to carry out their activities. Our findings reveal that fact-checkers are often victims of online bullying and harassment and fear reprisal from governments. This pushes them to self-censor, avoiding working on sensitive topics, such as military issues in Mali. In addition, fact-checking organizations in both countries highlight the difficulty of accessing reliable sources. Consequently, they focus more on debunking viral social media content, thus effectively becoming content moderators who have turned away from the mission of holding leaders accountable, one of the primary functions of fact-checking. Regarding their role conception, fact-checkers in Ethiopia and Mali see themselves more as guides helping navigate the information disorder than “guardians of truth” or “truth keepers.”",

          "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Political campaigning in the US is unique in the global context for its lack of attention to the role of the party, largely due to the centrality and power campaigns, and that is particularly true of the US-dominated work on data-driven campaigning (DDC). This research dives into that invisible work of data maintenance—largely done by parties in the US–to explore the tension between what sorts of DDC tools and activities earn news coverage while others fly under the radar. To do so, it relies upon interviews with party data staffers and textual analysis of news coverage to highlight the importance of the overlooked practices of data maintenance to answer questions about how the data-driven practices of parties versus campaigns differ, how parties are (and are not) covered, and what, in staffers views' contributes to such coverage. Ultimately, this research finds that parties are very under-covered in discussions of data-driven campaigning, and that the coverage that does exist conflates party and campaign actions and ignores key practices of maintenance work, which this work illuminates.  &lt;/p&gt;",

We are interested in understanding if and why political parties in Sweden adopt (or not) data-driven campaign methods, and the differences between them. Since this is a comparison of domestic parties, we test the importance of four party-level factors: resources, structure, attitudes toward data use and ideology using extensive interviews with key campaign managers in Sweden during the 2022 election year. Our results show that the differences among the eight parties studied are rather small, and that systemic factors are more important than party variables to explain the adoption of data-driven approaches. Zooming in on these finer differences we distinguish between top DDC adopters (Social Democrats, Center and Conservatives) and a lower tier with lower levels of DDC implementation. To explain the differences between the two tiers, we find that resources and attitudes to data are important, but only when taken together. Party structure and ideology do not affect the likelihood of a Swedish party using data analytics. Instead, we suggest party type (catch-all vs niche) as a potentially more useful party-level factor in explaining variation in DDC adoption.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "authors": "Anamarija Šiša",
          "abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of ghosting on the mobile dating app Tinder among Slovenia’s dating app users. Ghosting is defined as the unexpected unilateral termination of communication in interpersonal relationships exerted through digital platforms. Drawing upon data from the walkthrough of the mobile dating app Tinder and 26 semi-structured interviews with users living in Ljubljana (Slovenia), ghosting is conceptualized as an undesirable but normalized disconnection strategy on Tinder. We argue that choosing ghosting as a communication strategy emerges predominantly from two different contexts. Firstly, from the need to protect oneself from harassment and vulnerability, and secondly, as a reaction to the information overload in an environment that demands perpetual activity, availability, and interaction. Therefore, it manifests as a disconnection strategy on an interaction level or as a consequence of disconnecting from the platform itself. According to users, the desire to disconnect from others and exit the app is as high and ambiguous as the desire to connect and experience an ego boost or the excitement of interactions. Ghosting on Tinder, therefore, emerges as a response to general hyperconnectivity to navigate the increasing information overload and to a feeling of loss of the possibilities for safe and authentic connections in digital spaces.",

This paper tests debunking’s effectiveness against an understudied but prominent form of online misinformation: misleading organizational claims of corporate social responsibility, or CSR-washing. British participants ( N = 657) took part in a preregistered experiment with a 2 (debunk: present, absent) x 3 (CSR-washing: greenwashing, bluewashing, purplewashing) between-subjects design. They saw an Instagram ad from a fictional clothing company that showcased its dedication to environmental sustainability, gender equality in the workplace, or the elimination of child labor. Half of the participants then received a debunk. Unlike most previous research which showed continued influence of misinformation after debunking, we found that the debunks were very effective: they reversed the persuasive effects of CSR-washing, resulting in negative brand attitudes and low purchase intentions. Several explanations for this finding are discussed, highlighting CSR-washing’s distinctiveness from many other forms of misinformation.",

However, its effectiveness on social media has not been fully verified. In this study, drawing on construal level theory, we use temporal distance—the time interval between a rumor-combating post being released and receiving responses from social media users—to measure the effectiveness of rumor-combating. We also adopt elaboration likelihood model to explore the factors that could enhance this effectiveness. The empirical results show that perceptible (central route) factors, including the author’s authoritative combating methods, media richness, and positive emotions, are negatively related to temporal distance and are more effective for enhancing rumor-combating effectiveness than imperceptible (peripheral route) factors, such as the author’s influence and activeness. In addition, media richness exerts positive moderating effects on the relationship between perceptible route factors and rumor-combating effectiveness, implying that with the help of images or videos, rumor-combating effectiveness improves. This study addresses the need to enhance the effectiveness of rumor-combating and has practical implications for combating rumors in the social media.",

Privacy concerns tend to impede online political expression, but this relationship is still poorly understood. Based on the theory of reasoned action, this study focuses on the role of social influence and institutional privacy concerns in political expression on Facebook. We draw on research on the privacy calculus to examine how observing the behavior of Facebook friends moderates the relationship between privacy concerns and online political expression. We use survey data gathered in 2023 from Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States ( n = 5,936). Across all five countries, we find that observing Facebook friends posting political content bolsters political expression on Facebook, as per our preregistered analysis. In all countries except Germany, privacy concerns impede political expression on Facebook. Also, the importance of institutional privacy concerns for political expression depends on the observed posting behavior of Facebook friends. This moderated effect is only observed in three of the five examined countries, however. Our findings offer new insights into the factors that encourage and discourse political expression, particularly on Facebook which is a platform that has been widely criticized for failing to protect its users’ privacy.",

To gain insights into the scope and characteristics of conversation-related advertising and e-eavesdropping beliefs, we conducted a survey in the United States ( n = 300), the Netherlands ( n = 293), and Poland ( n = 293). These countries were chosen based on their differences in privacy regulations and history with state surveillance. We find that belief in conversation-related advertising is a widespread cross-country phenomenon, which is higher in the United States compared with European countries. In addition, between half and two-thirds of respondents believe e-eavesdropping is a likely explanation for it. We find that social media is a main contributing factor through which people hear about and most often see conversation-related advertising. Moreover, in response to such advertising, respondents experience more negative than positive affect. The results show that this is a prevalent and timely phenomenon that warrants more research. This carries implications for the (social) media industry and regulators, as it highlights the importance of transparency and (insufficient) individual understanding of data collection and processing.",

Previous research suggests that privacy perceptions and practices vary across sociocultural contexts. This study examines public and institutional discourses on conversational AI privacy in the United States and China. Semantic network and discourse analyses of privacy-related discussions on Twitter and Weibo reveal divergent patterns. On Twitter, public discourse emphasizes privacy risks and concerns and advocates for systemic changes, while institutional discourse promotes individualistic approaches to privacy protection. Conversely, on Weibo, public discourse is less focused on privacy risks and more on the positive impacts of AI, aligning closely with institutional narratives. These variations are intertwined with the cultural, political, economic, and regulatory contexts of the two countries.

However, how news media and their audiences make sense of terrorism on social media is subject to bias, for example, given their differential treatment of terrorism by right-wing versus Islamist extremist perpetrators. In this study, we analyze how incident- and perpetrator-related characteristics of terrorist attacks are associated with bias in public debates about terrorism on YouTube. We focus on selectiveness in which attacks are covered (gatekeeping bias), how attacks are covered (presentation bias), and how audiences react to coverage (audience bias). Methodologically, we employ a manual and an automated content analysis of terrorism coverage by five international broadcasters on YouTube ( N = 643, 2018–2020) and related user comments ( N = 193,721). Our findings illustrate how sociocultural contexts shape news bias in terrorism coverage, both in the form of gatekeeping bias and presentation bias—but we conclude with less evidence for audience bias in public reactions to terrorism, at least on social media. Consequently, journalists should critically question working routines in covering crises to avoid reinforcing power imbalances, especially those from Western contexts.",

Injustice frames featuring Sanger were deployed to portray abortion as a method for Black genocide; vilify feminism as racist, anti-woman, and anti-motherhood; and depict the Black Lives Matter social justice movement and cancel culture as hypocritical. This analysis also captured a moment in time when Sanger’s legacy was being reconsidered by Planned Parenthood, the organization she founded, indicating that a long-sought-after reckoning with the racist roots of the early birth control movement in the United States may be underway—with both predictable and unpredictable rippling effects in disinformative spaces.",
