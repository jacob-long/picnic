          "abstract": "The emerging field of human–machine communication (HMC) research represents one of the most sustained efforts to bring communication research to bear on the social uses and consequences of artificial intelligence (AI), and yet HMC theory development is still in its early stages. Building on Stuart Hall’s seminal work about the encoding and decoding of television, this article presents a model that conceptualizes and operationalizes human–machine interactions in terms of their distinctive forms of encoding and decoding. Humans and machines take turns encoding and decoding each other, at a proliferating variety of interfaces, and through infrastructures extending across space and time. In the process, they also metacommunicate, about the discursive codes they each rely on, and about the social roles they occupy in shifting configurations. The encoding-decoding model provides a framework for further theory development about the co-creation of meaning and the exercise of agency by humans and machines.",

          "abstract": "What happens when process philosophy meets communication theory? This article takes up that question through a dialogic inquiry that unfolds in three movements. First, it examines the premises of process philosophy, engaging philosophers such as Whitehead, Simondon, and Deleuze, who conceptualize reality as a dynamic, multifaceted becoming. Next, it develops a process philosophical view of communication and delves into its role in constituting social collectives as relational formations. Finally, the conversation turns to the relation between communication, constitution, and reality, asking how communication might be understood as in-forming the real’s becoming and recursively being in-formed by this becoming. Rather than presenting a linear argument, this article invites the reader into an exploratory movement of thought where meaning emerges in the unfolding of dialogue itself. By embracing this form, the article opens space for reimagining communication theory.",

          "authors": "Michael Hameleers",
          "abstract": "The alarm on misinformation’s scope and alleged unprecedented democratic consequences is ringing louder than ever. At the same time, empirical research on the prevalence and effects of misinformation does not offer univocal support for a salient threat. News users, however, are very concerned about misinformation and their ability to detect it. In this paper, we forward four potential reasons for the discrepancy between concerns about misinformation and empirical evidence on its scope and effects: (1) the weaponization and amplification of threats related to misinformation; (2) non-aligning conceptualizations of misinformation between news users, media practitioners, and academics; (3) a lack of attention to low- versus high-resilient contexts of mis- and disinformation; and (4) a conflation between prevalence and impact. By mapping these potential causes of prevailing discrepancies, this paper aims to contribute to a better theoretical understanding of the nature of misinformation’s threats that should form the empirical basis for effective interventions.",

          "authors": "Semra Demirdiş",
          "abstract": "This study examines the visual representation of women activists in the Akbelen protests in Türkiye, focussing on images and videos shared on X (formerly Twitter) under the hashtag #AkbelenDokunma. Using qualitative content analysis, it explores how digital media constructs narratives about women’s roles in activism, particularly in challenging traditional gender norms. Drawing on Stuart Hall’s theory of representation, the study analyses how these visual portrayals encode meanings that influence public perceptions of women’s agency in environmental movements. The findings reveal a dual narrative in the representation of women activists. While many images depict women as leaders in environmental resistance, actively advocating for conservation and social justice, others portray them as passive victims, emphasising their emotional vulnerability, distress, and powerlessness. This contradiction reflects broader gendered media biases, where women’s activism is acknowledged but often framed through narratives of suffering rather than empowerment. These representations shape public perceptions of gender roles in activism, influencing how women’s resistance is understood and valued. This research contributes to the growing literature on digital activism, gender, and environmental movements, emphasising the role of social media in contesting and reinforcing dominant narratives. Additionally, it addresses gaps in existing research on the representation of women activists in digital media, offering new insights into how visual media both empowers and constrains women’s activism, particularly in the context of environmental justice and gender equality.",

          "abstract": "Short videos on TikTok provided an entertaining pastime for 1.5 billion users worldwide in 2023. The increasing popularity of TikTok has generated considerable research interest in the psychological and social predictors of problematic use. However, recent empirical studies on Internet-based activities have found evidence that extensive time spent on TikTok is not necessarily problematic. This study explores convergent and divergent predictors of extensive and problematic TikTok use including demographics, psychological distress, and TikTok activities. A total of 618 Hungarian TikTok users (80.1% women, 18.8% men; Mage = 22.1 years, SD = 4.2) completed an online questionnaire. The unidimensional, six-item Problematic TikTok Use Questionnaire was developed, demonstrating good psychometric properties in terms of factor structure, reliability, and validity. Based on latent profile analysis, 3.07% of TikTok users were found to be at risk of problematic TikTok use. Using a structural equation model, it was found that symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress had stronger associations with problematic use than with extensive time spent on TikTok. Exploring the Discover page and viewing content creators’ videos predicted only problematic use severity. Exploring the For You page and reading comments posted to others’ videos were the strongest predictors of both extensive use time and problematic use. These factors collectively explained a notable proportion of the variance of problematic use severity (45%). The findings provide a detailed picture of risky use patterns and extend knowledge of the differences between extensive use time and problematic TikTok use.",

          "abstract": "Social networking sites (SNSs) allow people to choose how they want to engage with others. Some behaviours are more associated with aspects of well-being (i.e., meaning in life) than others. Online environments also afford people the opportunity to interact with other people at varying levels of anonymity and identifiability, which could further impact well-being. However, whether people use SNSs differently when they are anonymous versus identifiable – and how this relates to their meaning in life – has not been investigated. To test this, we sampled 192 participants (Mage = 19.72) to investigate differences in how people use and post on SNSs while anonymous and identifiable. Furthermore, we assessed how these behaviours were associated with meaning in life. We found that: (1) People were most likely to use SNSs passively across anonymous and identifiable environments. (2) People were most likely to post about life updates/social activities in identifiable environments, and intellectual or negative topics in anonymous environments. (3) Passive usage was negatively associated with meaning in life in identifiable environments. (4) Active-targeted usage (behaviours that are directed towards a specific person or a small group) and posting about life updates/social activities were positively associated with meaning in life, but only in identifiable environments. We demonstrate that meaning in life is related to how people use SNSs, but also the specific online environments they seek out.",

          "abstract": "Bystanders are present in most bullying and cyberbullying incidents, and when they intervene in favor of the victim, they can effectively stop it. Evidence suggests that intergroup factors, such as social identification, increase bystanders’ helping intentions in bullying episodes. However, relatively little is known about the potential positive effects of intergroup factors on bystanders’ attitudes and behaviors when witnessing bias-based cyberbullying (i.e., cyberbullying based on identity). Two studies examined bystanders’ responses to cyberbullying toward two minority groups (i.e., LGBTQI+ and Black youth); and what can influence their helping intentions when they witness bias-based cyberbullying episodes. Study 1 (N = 2,253) showed that bystanders' responses vary depending on the target of cyberbullying, helping an LGBTQI+ youth target less than a Black target, and showing less empathy, less positive group norms, less inclusive identities, less positive attitudes, and more intergroup anxiety. Study 2 (N = 2,254) revealed that high quality offline contact is associated with more helping behaviors via increased empathy, outgroup attitudes, dual-identity representations and decreased intergroup anxiety (for the LGBTQI+ target), and via empathy, one-group identity, and group norms (for the Black target). Implications for efforts to promote more helping behaviors and positive intergroup attitudes in the online context are discussed.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the profiles of social network (SN) users and contrast their differences across variables linked to PSNU in the literature. A sample of 726 participants aged 16 and above (77.0% female) residing in Spain was analysed using Latent Class Analysis (LCA). ANOVA and chi-square test were employed to investigate differences in sociodemographic variables, digital preferences, impulsivity, emotional intelligence, empathy and aggression among the latent classes. The three-class model, which proved the most parsimonious, identified functional, risky, and problematic users. Notably, greater differences were observed between functional and risky users regarding impulsivity and emotional regulation, whereas differences in empathy and aggression were more pronounced between problematic users and the other two groups. The study provides relevant information about the characteristics of different groups of SN users. This information may be useful for the early detection of inappropriate online behaviours that may lead to PSNU, as well as for identifying users who may have already developed it.",

Through an online survey, participants (N = 395) were randomly assigned to reflect on conversations with either a close contact (strong tie) or an acquaintance (weak tie) and reported their use of graphic icons. We found that the use of graphic icons can be viewed as part of routine relational maintenance practices. More frequent use of memes, GIFs, and emojis was associated with greater self-disclosure breadth and depth, stronger intimacy, and better relationship maintenance. Social anxiety and tie strength moderated these relationships. The effects were stronger for less socially anxious individuals and in weak tie relationships, suggesting that graphic icons may serve different social functions depending on individual characteristics and relational contexts. These findings provide evidence that memes, GIFs, and emojis can serve as useful tools to improve social connection and relationship management in digital communication.",

          "authors": "Daniel B. Le Roux, Douglas A. Parry, Jennifer Feldman",
          "abstract": "The regulation of smartphone use in high schools is a contentious issue. Among others, a key question is whether the location of learners’ phones affects their cognitive performance in the classroom. While some studies have found that a smartphone’s mere presence can impair cognition, others suggest that the evidence is weak, or that when separated from their phones, adolescents may experience anxiety which can also harm cognitive performance. We conducted two experimental studies at different high schools to test the effects of smartphone location on performance in a fluid intelligence task. Study 1 (n = 195; learner’s desk: n = 96; schoolbag: n = 99) was conducted at a boys-only high school, while Study 2 (n = 115; learner’s desk: n = 41; schoolbag: n = 49; teacher’s desk: n = 25) was conducted a girls-only high school. Both studies were conducted in normal class settings and administered by teachers to enhance ecological validity. Across both studies, we found no clear evidence that having the phone on the desk impaired performance. In some comparisons, learners performed slightly worse when phones were in schoolbags and slightly better when phones were placed on the teacher’s desk, but these effects were small and not robust. Learners did not report elevated anxiety when separated from their phones. Overall, our findings highlight the need for further research to clarify whether and how phone location influences cognitive performance in school settings, and to better understand the psychological and attentional mechanisms involved.",

          "authors": "Yu Takizawa",
          "abstract": "The rise of social media has sparked extensive research on its relationship with well-being, yet drawing definitive conclusions remains challenging due to the multifaceted nature and diversification of these platforms. To gain a clearer understanding of this relationship, it is essential to explore how various social media platforms both cross-sectionally and longitudinally relate to well-being as well as to explore direct and indirect relationships mediated by other factors. Such investigation is lacking especially in Non-Western context. To address this gap, the author examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships of X (formerly Twitter) and LINE use with life satisfaction—a key indicator of well-being—both directly and indirectly through the quality of online relationships, within a 4-year cohort of 1,674 Japanese adults. Multivariate latent growth curve modeling revealed a mixed relationship between X use and life satisfaction. Direct relationships with life satisfaction were negative, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In contrast, an indirect relationship—mediated by online relationships—was positive both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In contrast, LINE use consistently showed positive relationships with life satisfaction, with both direct and indirect positive cross-sectional associations through online relationships. These findings underscore the growing diversity of social media platforms and the need to recognize that the relationship between social media use and life satisfaction varies depending on the platform in both Western and non-Western contexts. To support well-being, public education and digital literacy efforts should address the risks of excessive use of open-network platforms like X, while avoiding overgeneralizations to closed-network platforms like LINE, which may enhance well-being through supportive relationships.",

          "authors": "Sara Pabian",
          "abstract": "On social media, users are exposed to online hate speech (OHS), which is a type of speech that attacks a person or a group based on a group characteristic, e.g., gender identity or sexual orientation. Not every bystander evaluates OHS as offensive and/or feels the need to intervene, which can lead to the continuation of OHS and damaging consequences for victims. The goal of the present study was to understand attitudinal and behavioral components of bystanders’ perceptions on OHS by investigating content-related, contextual, and personal characteristics. More precisely, the effects of the presence or absence of online moral disengagement strategies or moral excuses in OHS messages (e.g., “I’m posting this because it doesn't hurt if I share my opinion online”) and the bystander’s role (pure bystander or vicarious victim) on bystanders’ attitudes and behaviors were tested, while controlling for previous experience with OHS and connectedness with the target group. To this aim, a repeated measures experiment (5x2x2 mixed design) was conducted among 633 adults aged 18–25. The results indicated no difference in bystanders’ perceived offensiveness of OHS and intention to intervene when exposed to OHS containing a moral excuse compared to OHS without. When bystanders were vicarious victims (being exposed to OHS targeting an individual with whom the bystander shares the targeted group characteristic), OHS was perceived as more offensive and bystanders had a higher intention to intervene with prosocial bystander behavior, compared to when bystanders did not share the group characteristic. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of social media and communication apps among early adolescents, little is known about which psychological variables affect their comprehension of emojis, i.e., pictograms delivering emotional cues in digital messages. To fill this gap, the present study explores the role of Theory of Mind (ToM) in emoji comprehension at the boundary condition of low vs high Social Media Use (SMU), in a sample of 303 Italian early adolescents (134 females) aged between 10 and 14 years old. Participants completed an SMU scale, two ToM measures, namely the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test and Real/apparent Emotions task, and an emoji comprehension task. Results showed that both ToM measures positively predicted emoji comprehension. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the Real/apparent Emotions task and SMU, with stronger relationships between ToM and emoji comprehension for low SMU. Separate analyses with easy- and difficult-to-classify emojis as dependent variables showed the same interaction effect only on easy emojis, while we found no significant interaction effect on difficult emojis. Taken together, these results suggest that youngsters less familiar with social media rely on ToM to encode and decode emojis and interpret digital messages. Conversely, the more they use social media, the more automated this task becomes.

          "abstract": "Online prosocial and antisocial behaviors are increasingly prevalent on social media, highlighting the need to explore the factors that shape these online social behaviors. Understanding the influencing factors, including social media use, is crucial for fostering healthy online interactions and mitigating potential risks in digital environments. In this study, we examine whether and how online prosocial and antisocial behaviors are associated with social media affordances, specifically the notions of bandwidth, social presence, anonymity, and ephemerality. Based on the collected sample of Chinese Generation Z (N = 782), the online survey study finds that bandwidth and social presence are positively associated with online prosocial behavior through online social support. On the other hand, anonymity is negatively related to online prosocial behavior through online social support and positively related to online antisocial behavior through online disinhibition. Also, ephemerality is positively associated with online antisocial behavior through the indirect effect of online disinhibition. Interestingly, while online social support positively predicts online prosocial behavior and online disinhibition positively predicts online antisocial behavior, the relationship between online social support and online antisocial behavior is not as simple. The relation is found to be positive for females and emerging adults, negative for adolescents, and insignificant for males. Theoretical implications for social media use and online social behaviors, as well as practical implications for online prosocial and antisocial behavior interventions, are discussed.",

          "authors": "Nisha Yao, Caleb Hallauer, Elyse Hutcheson, Jon Elhai",
          "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of smartphones, not all users develop problematic use. Understanding the pathways that lead from healthy to Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU) is essential for uncovering underlying mechanisms and informing effective prevention strategies. Building on theoretical models of PSU, this study explores a maladaptive regulatory-focused pathway linking Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) to PSU through Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) as a mediator. Although previous research has linked IU, FoMO, and PSU in pairs, few studies have examined these constructs simultaneously within a unified explanatory framework. By integrating them into a theoretically grounded mediation model, this study offers a more comprehensive understanding of psychological mechanisms that may underlie PSU. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with 343 U.S. undergraduate students, recruited through a university research pool in exchange for course credit. Participants completed self-report measures of IU, FoMO, and PSU. Using structural equation modeling, we examined a mediation model incorporating latent variables for IU, FoMO, and PSU, assessing both direct and indirect effects of IU on PSU through FoMO. Results indicated that IU showed a positive association with FoMO, which was further associated with elevated PSU levels. The direct association between IU and PSU was non-significant. These findings support theoretical models positing that personal predispositions, such as IU, contribute to PSU through Internet-related cognitive biases like FoMO. Preventive initiatives should focus on raising awareness about the adverse effects of IU and FoMO on PSU and promoting strategies to effectively manage IU and FoMO, potentially reducing the risk of PSU.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The presence of unverifiable, inaccurate, and irrelevant information during disasters can encourage people to withdraw from virtual communities. One way to combat this problem is to cultivate a sense of community. However, little is known about how a sense of community can be fostered quickly in virtual communities during a disaster. Our study addresses this limitation of prior research work. Design/methodology/approach We conducted an in-depth qualitative case study of a Reddit community during Hurricane Harvey. The main sources were archival data, including community threads and associated comments. Data from newspapers, magazine reports and government websites were also collected to capture contextual information about the disaster. Findings Our findings indicate that socialisation and formal control can foster a sense of community. This is made possible through the strategic use of social media, which involves (1) endorsing emergent norms and (2) enforcing those norms through a disciplining process. Practical implications We offer practical suggestions for virtual community moderators and members on strategically using social media features to create, enforce and institutionalise emergent norms. We recommend that system designers develop adaptable social media features that can be reconfigured according to the context. Originality/value We show how socialisation and formal control must coexist in virtual communities to foster a sense of community, rather than prioritising one over the other. We also unpack how the strategic use of social media can inform this process. We argue that social media features should be adaptable, rather than pre-set, to meet emergent needs.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The pervasive spread of commercial misinformation on social media poses significant risks to businesses and brands, with potentially devastating consequences for their reputation and financial stability. Given its unique nature and far-reaching impact, it is imperative to investigate and develop effective strategies to counteract this growing threat. Based on inoculation theory, this study aims to investigate the mechanisms and long-term effects of different inoculation strategies in the context of commercial misinformation. Design/methodology/approach A randomized controlled trial and follow-up experiment were conducted with 569 valid participants over 2 waves in a 6-week longitudinal study. Hypotheses were tested using one-way ANOVA, post-hoc analysis and regression analysis. Findings Data analysis indicates that inoculation can effectively enhance individuals' resistance to misinformation. Affective inoculation, compared to cognitive inoculation, more significantly strengthens individuals' threat perceptions of misinformation, subsequently reducing the perceived credibility of misinformation upon exposure. In this process, individuals' self-efficacy in identifying misinformation plays a moderating role, reinforcing the negative impact of perceived threat on the credibility of misinformation. The resistance effect of inoculation against misinformation persists for more than six weeks. However, there is no significant difference between the long-term effects of affective and cognitive inoculation, nor is there a significant relationship between the frequency of inoculation and its long-term effectiveness. Research limitations/implications The study offers practical insights for governments, platforms, organizations and individuals in the preemptive intervention against misinformation. Originality/value This research significantly advances the field of misinformation governance by extending its application scenarios, expanding the theoretical landscape of inoculation studies and providing valuable insights into both immediate and enduring effects of psychological inoculation strategies.",

The moderating roles of self-regulation and need-fulfillment focus are examined. Design/methodology/approach A total of 497 valid responses from Indonesian consumers (Study 1) and 273 from US consumers (Study 2) were analyzed using structural equation modeling to empirically evaluate the proposed research model. Findings The results showed that stronger human brand attachment contributed to problematic human brand engagement on social media, which subsequently led to social media-induced sleep problems (i.e. poor social media sleep hygiene, problematic sleep and exhaustion). These effects were intensified by higher self-regulation, especially when consumer need-fulfillment was more promotion-focused (vs prevention-focused). Originality/value This research is among the few studies to highlight the dark side of consumer–human brand relationships in the digital realm. It advances research on social media-induced sleep problems from the perspective of consumer–human brand relationships, offering insights to consumers, parents and governments to inform preventive measures.",

          "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate gender, racial, and religious biases among four popular Generative AI (GAI) chatbots, namely ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, Gemini, and Bing Chat. Design/methodology/approach Based on existing literature, this paper develops the Bias Assessment Test Set (BATS) comprising 900 closed-ended prompts and 12 pairs of open-ended prompts related to gender, race, and religion. A total of 34,227 numerical responses collected were analyzed using consistency analysis, Welch’s ANOVA, and the Scheirer-Ray-Hare test. The themes of a total of 94,821 narratives freely generated by the GAI chatbots were also analyzed using the topic modeling method and sentiment analysis. Findings Findings suggested that ChatGPT4 and Gemini were generally less biased and provided more consistent responses compared to ChatGPT3.5 and Bing Chat. Additionally, all chatbots covered various themes in stereotypical and anti-stereotypical contexts, typically manifesting in an unequal representation of target groups within each theme, as well as different emphases and negative tendencies across the themes. Research limitations/implications This paper broadens the concept of algorithmic bias by highlighting its granularity and bi-directionality. It also offers a novel perspective on algorithmic justice by revealing thematic prejudices in generative AI chatbot narratives. Nonetheless, a few limitations must be acknowledged. This paper does not capture AI’s evolving biases. It neither addresses intersectionality among different social types of discrimination nor considers user perceptions.

          "abstract": "Purpose This research investigates how influencer streamers' strategies, which combine their responses to backward-looking and forward-looking responsibility, repair consumers' cognitive trust (CT) and affective trust (AT) damaged by product failures in live streaming commerce. It also examines the mediating role of consumer forgiveness and the moderating role of consumers' perceived parasocial interaction with influencer streamers. Design/methodology/approach Two scenario-based experimental studies were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Data were analyzed using the analysis of covariance and bootstrap methods. Findings The influencer streamers' strategy of taking both backward-looking and forward-looking responsibility is as effective in repairing consumers' CT and AT as the strategy of taking only forward-looking responsibility. When consumers perceive higher levels of parasocial interaction with influencer streamers, these responsibility-taking strategies are more effective in enhancing their forgiveness, which in turn improves their trust in influencer streamers. Practical implications To effectively repair consumer trust after live-streamed product failures, influencer streamers should prioritize taking responsibility for resolving these failures rather than clarifying their responsibility for causing them. Efforts to strengthen parasocial interaction with consumers can allow influencer streamers to improve the effectiveness of their responsibility-taking strategies. Originality/value This research is among the first to extend the scope of trust repair research to the context of live streaming commerce and to tailor responsibility-taking strategies for influencer streamers who are trustees with collateral responsibility for transgressions. It also provides novel insights into the critical role of parasocial interaction in facilitating the effective repair of consumer trust in influencer streamers.",

          "abstract": "Purpose With esports debuting as a medal event in international multi-sport competitions, the personal branding strategies of esports athletes remain underexamined despite the industry’s rapid expansion. This study addresses this gap by exploring how esports athlete brands evolve when they are perceived as national symbols on the global stage. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts an interpretivist and constructivist paradigm, employing a multi-method approach that integrates netnographic observation, semiotic analysis of social media posts and 22 semi-structured interviews. This combination of methods enables a comprehensive examination of how athletes’ social media posts, media narratives and fan-generated content collectively shape their brand images of esports athletes. Findings The findings reveal that national identity shapes esports athletes’ branding in international events, extending beyond national representation to broader cultural and social dynamics shaped by hyperconnectivity. Fans align with state-regulated agenda-setting for player opportunities while fearing esports’ mainstreaming, which diminishes personal expression and erodes subcultural distinctiveness. Research limitations/implications Esports athletes can elevate their marketability by integrating national identity, fan culture and cross-sport collaborations, but their brand narratives are often shaped by state regulations and cultural expectations. Maintaining authenticity under such constraints requires institutional support, strategic content planning and a nuanced understanding of how to balance individual identity with broader expectations of national representation. Originality/value This study is one of the first to explore the personal branding process of esports athletes and fans’ behaviour in international multi-sport events. It informs esports athletes, state governments and agencies on strategies for enhancing the marketability of esports athletes.",

A model based on dual-process theory is proposed to investigate the mechanisms through which online review cues (framing style and consumption context) influence technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach The study employs a 2 × 2 between-subject, full-factorial, scenario-based experiment based on online review framing style and consumption context, using two independent studies. Study 1 (n = 120) examines the influence of review framing style and consumption context on adoption intention, and Study 2 (n = 328) investigates the mediating roles of herding behaviour and mindfulness. Findings The results suggest that online review framing style, with respect to the consumption context, improves review effectiveness in influencing consumers’ technology adoption decisions. Additionally, the effect of online reviews on adoption intentions is significantly mediated by herding behaviour and mindfulness. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the literature by examining how framing styles in online reviews influence technology adoption.

This study explores complex causal pathways by examining digital transformation management capacity, strategic digital vision, organizational mindfulness, organizational change capacity, market turbulence and firm type as potential predictors of firm performance. Design/methodology/approach The study integrates fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). fsQCA identifies equifinal configurations from a sample of employees directly involved in digital transformation initiatives. The ANN analysis assesses the predictive power of these configurations to reveal the relative importance of each predictor. Findings The results identify three equifinal configurations that lead to high firm performance, highlighting how different combinations of organizational (i.e. digital transformation management capacity, strategic digital vision, organizational mindfulness and organizational change capacity) and environmental (i.e. market turbulence and firm type) conditions can generate similar outcomes. These findings underscore the interplay of multiple factors in preventing the paradox of digitalization. Meanwhile, the ANN analysis indicates that organizational change capacity is the most critical predictor of firm performance. Practical implications The findings provide strategies for leveraging digital transformation to enhance firm performance. Firms can achieve this by fostering adaptability, implementing ongoing digital initiatives or developing strategic digital programs using tools like real-time analytics, cross-functional teams and AI-driven platforms. Originality/value The study advances a non-linear perspective on digital transformation and firm performance by using fsQCA to capture equifinality (multiple distinct pathways yielding similar outcomes) and ANN to identify the relative importance of each causal condition.",

          "authors": "Jeongwon Yang, Ploypin Chuenterawong",
          "abstract": "Purpose The study investigated the potential role of social media influencers (SMIs) in engaging users with low motivation to participate in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities by examining how the interplay among endorser type, argument quality and audiences’ cause involvement affects consumers’ information processing and authenticity judgments of CSR messages. Design/methodology/approach The current study employed an online experiment (n = 386) with a 2 (CSR argument quality: Strong vs. Weak) by 2 (Endorser Type: SMI vs. Brand) between-subjects design. Findings Individuals with low involvement with climate change relied more heavily on source credibility cues, while those with high involvement scrutinized the argument quality of the CSR message by dedicating more cognitive efforts. Although the authenticity of a SMI-promoted CSR message with strong argument quality was boosted, that of a weak message promoted by the SMI significantly decreased. Practical implications The findings regarding differential processing of CSR information by different key audiences based on their motivational factors provide guidance for companies on how to inform and engage different types of the public about social causes. The study recommends organizations to segment the audiences according to social media engagement levels and tailor their strategies. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to explore how users’ cause involvement on social media can shape their processing routes in evaluating the authenticity of CSR messages. By drawing on the elaboration likelihood model to the realm of strategic communication, the study uncovered the importance of tailoring source and message strategies to users with a varying degree of motivation.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the critical, yet undertheorized role of context in verbal communication when computers are used to analyze language data. Drawing on multiple disciplines and prior work from communication and social psychology, an interactionist perspective is reviewed and applied to computational settings to demonstrate how individual, interpersonal, social, and situational factors afford or constrain verbal behavior. Using examples of language complexity and processing fluency research, this paper demonstrates how contextual factors like instrumental goal activation can reverse seemingly established relationships between simple language features and behavioral outcomes. The paper concludes by advocating for methodological approaches that systematically integrate contextual variables into natural language processing research, enabling scholars to resolve contradictory findings, enhance replicability, and develop a more nuanced understanding of how language reveals psychological processes.",

          "abstract": "Social media is transforming how political power is exercised through communication, functioning both as a critical resource and as a catalyst for institutional adaptation in executive government. This article examines how social media is integrated into government communication, distinguishing between two dimensions: structure and process. Drawing on a literature review and a case study of Sweden—based on interviews with government press secretaries/media advisers and analysis of official documents—we develop a theoretical logic in which resources act as a causal mechanism driving the normalization of social media. We conceptualize this process as operating through two pathways: adaptation to new communicative requirements and the combination of different media, here termed strategic complementarity. The findings show that social media has become an embedded element of government communication, steadily reshaping routines, professional roles, and the balance between traditional and digital channels. This study contributes to understanding how governments manage hybrid media environments and highlights the underexplored role of social media as a potential driver of power redistribution.",

          "abstract": "The erosion of public trust in health information and government communication, particularly during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic, highlights a critical challenge in how health policies are transmitted and received. This study examines the dramatic shift in public sentiment toward Covid-19 vaccination in South Africa during 2021, a period that saw a decline from initial high acceptance to significant hesitancy. We argue that a process of social media selection allowed extreme views to proliferate as official sources retreated. Our findings suggest that sustained or increased mainstream media engagement, particularly from official sources like government and health authorities, could have mitigated the dominance of anti-vaccine narratives and have crucial implications for government communication and public health policies in the digital age. We collected and classified 482,450 original tweets about vaccination. We show that, by the end of 2021, Twitter activity was characterized by a progressive surge in anti-vaccination tweets and a decline in pro-vaccination and factual information, particularly from mainstream media. This shift mirrors the decrease in actual vaccination rates. Employing agent-based modeling, we simulated counterfactual scenarios to assess the impact of media presence on vaccine discourse. The results indicate that sustained or increased media engagement could have mitigated the dominance of anti-vaccine narratives. Conversely, a simulated media downturn led to a steeper decline in pro-vaccination content. The findings suggest that mainstream news media play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of and support for health policies and that their disengagement creates an informational void exploited by misinformation.",

          "abstract": "Criticism of the EU has become a common feature of political communication in Central and Eastern Europe and it is often tied to broader concerns about democratic erosion and distrust in institutions. This study investigates how anti-EU rhetoric was employed on Facebook by political actors in the Visegrád countries (Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) during the 2024 European Parliament elections and how it relates to the populist style of communication. Drawing on a comparative content analysis of more than 6,000 posts, the study examines how messages that negatively target the EU incorporate elements of populist rhetoric and emotional tools, such as fear speech and patriotic symbols. The findings show that populist actors were the most frequent users of anti-EU messaging, with anti-elitist framing as the strongest and most consistent rhetorical strategy, often accompanied by other emotional tools. Despite political differences, anti-EU campaigning showed consistent regional patterns. This article contributes to research on political communication by offering a regional comparison, incorporating visual analysis, and challenging the idea that negative messaging is a reliable strategy for mobilising audiences online.",

          "abstract": "Advancements in communication technologies have enabled individuals to transcend the physical environment, and there is sizable research exploring how users interact with the mediated environments, particularly with respect to perceived shifts in spatial and social presence. However, despite the ability of new communication technologies to facilitate a change in perceived time via virtual time travel, there is scant empirical work testing the predictors and psychological and persuasive outcomes of temporal presence. To fill this gap, this study employed a single-factor experiment using an augmented reality (AR) filter with two conditions (virtual time travel with AR [ n = 63] vs without AR [ n = 77]) in the context of anti-aging sunscreen advertising. Results showed that temporal presence can be evoked by virtual time travel using AR through perceived interactivity and vividness. Temporal presence subsequently increased positive attitude toward the ad and brand, as well as purchase intentions through different psychological factors.",

          "abstract": "Two cross‐sectional studies with individuals who are single in the United States and Portugal explored how singlehood expectations and sexual health and well‐being motives determined latent profiles, and whether profiles differed in personal beliefs and experiences. Participants with a relationship‐oriented pleasure‐ambivalent singlehood profile were fearful of singlehood, endorsed more relationship pedestal beliefs, and reported more negative reasons for being single and more reasons for enacting condomless casual sex. Despite focusing on pleasure promotion in sex, they also reported lower sexual quality of life and well‐being. Participants with a pleasure‐driven voluntary singlehood profile were comfortable with singlehood while maintaining some relationship desire. They focused on personal enjoyment and pleasure promotion in sex, and reported higher sexual quality of life and well‐being. Participants with a cautious voluntary singlehood profile were focused on disease prevention in sex. They were the most committed to singlehood and endorsed more positive reasons for being single, but also reported lower sexual satisfaction and well‐being. These profiles were consistent across countries. Taken together, our findings illustrate the dynamic ways in which some individuals are more successful at navigating through singlehood, whereas others have worse experiences due in part to internalized and socialized norms and expectations attached to relationship status.",

Married adults, particularly Americans, reported higher family support, which was indirectly related to higher well‐being. Both single Americans and Japanese reported greater familial strain; however, strain was significantly associated with lower well‐being only among Americans.

          "abstract": "This qualitative study aims to investigate digital dating violence among university students. This research was conducted using a purposive sampling approach to obtain a study group of university students who were victims of digital dating violence. Data were collected through individual interviews with 13 participants. Content analysis was conducted using an inductive approach. Six main themes emerged, including the characteristics of the victim, the characteristics of the relationship, forms of digital dating violence, reasons for continuing in abusive relationships, ways of coping, and the effects of digital dating violence. The findings show how digital tools can facilitate and escalate violence in dating relationships among university students. Some participants exhibited behaviors such as recognizing signs of digital violence and setting clearer boundaries in subsequent dating relationships. Others preferred to avoid romantic relationships because they could not overcome the fear of digitally violent dating relationships. This research demonstrates that digital dating violence affects many areas of participants' lives. The results provide important insights into the complex dynamics of digital dating violence among college students and highlight the need for comprehensive prevention and intervention efforts to address this problem and reduce its long‐term impacts effectively.",

          "abstract": "For decades, research on journalism’s role in society has examined an array of role orientations, spanning from neutral disseminator to advocate. Regarding reporting on climate change mitigation, however, the question takes on new relevance. In that context, is balanced reporting still appropriate or being replaced due to a greater demand for evidence-based reporting? Is journalism responsible for taking a stance, politically mobilizing its audiences, and reporting activist? Can neutral dissemination and activist journalism even be expected to occur simultaneously? To answer those questions, we surveyed 2,577 German citizens and 391 political journalists regarding their expectations/role orientations and evaluations of balance, weight of evidence (WoE), and activist journalism in reporting on climate change mitigation. The results show that citizens expect balanced, evidence-based reporting on climate change mitigation. Journalists also see it as their role to report balanced and evidence-based in this context, even despite the risk of false balance. Meanwhile, though citizens tend to expect activist journalism, journalists reject it as part of their role. Moreover, our results show that WoE and activist journalism are not mutually exclusive but are expected to occur simultaneously. Last, citizens and journalists who favor stricter climate measures generally expect activist journalism in reporting on climate change mitigation.",

          "authors": "Kim Andersen, Adam Shehata",
          "abstract": "Prior research suggests that individuals not only prefer negative news over positive (negativity bias in news selection) but also favor information that aligns with their existing beliefs (confirmation bias). A likely consequence of these tendencies is that people will, on average, form beliefs that are biased toward perceiving reality as more negative, and that these dynamics will be mutually reinforcing over time. This study presents a preregistered longitudinal choice experiment designed to examine these dynamics in relation to negative and positive emphasis framing of news stories about Swedish schools. Contrary to the hypothesis of a general negativity bias in news selection, the results indicate a higher preference for positive news. However, the results support the expectation of a confirmation bias, as people with more negative (positive) beliefs were more like to choose negative (positive) news. Moreover, exposure to both positive and negative news led to more positive beliefs over time, suggesting that information effects were more influential than framing effects. Together, these findings challenge central claims within the literature on biases in news selection and their subsequent influence on societal beliefs.",

          "title": "A three-step manual for creating a political villain: the case of Jeremy Corbyn",
          "authors": "Maximillian Guarini",
          "abstract": "This manual guides the reader through the process of creating a political villain with three easy-to-follow steps. Readers may wish to create their own political villains (there is no shortage of politicians on which to practise), or simply use it to better understand how political villains are created and more critically engage with this type of multimodal construction. The case of Jeremy Corbyn in the UK is utilized to make this process as evident and clear as possible. Corbyn’s case reveals how power operates in the everyday through multimodal constructions. Overall, this is a manual which exposes how images and words work together to persuade us of particular messages. In an age that sees us constantly exposed to many multimodal messages, this visual essay sheds some light on important points for us all to consider as both willing and unwilling consumers of media. Its focus is on the how of multimodal construction rather than on the why.",

          "title": "Visual compositing: engagement, interpretation and visualization of Holocaust memory in digital culture",
          "authors": "Lital Henig",
          "abstract": "Archival images of the Holocaust have been and continue to be an essential component of Holocaust memory and representation. In recent years, Holocaust memory projects have begun using these images in fragmented forms – copied, cut and pasted into new configurations. This article will explore this visual trend and examine it through the concept of visual compositing: layering images to create a new understanding of their collective symbolism. Through visual analysis of recent digital and non-digital Holocaust memory works, the article analyses the practice of visual compositing and its influence on recent Holocaust memory. By exploring recent works through diachronic and synchronic axes, the author argues that visual compositing influences both the visual representation of Holocaust memory and the memory work involved in this kind of representation. While engaging in visual compositing, creators generate or invite others to create new representations of the Holocaust. This act offers opportunities to explore the past from new perspectives, but also risks diminishing the singularity and specificity of the represented experiences. The article concludes by showing how visual compositing calls for adopting a new visual literacy for Holocaust representation and memory, working in and evolving with digital culture.",
