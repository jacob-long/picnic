          "abstract": "This paper models how increasingly capable, low-cost AI research systems interact with metric-driven universities.\nWe formalize a simple production economy in which labs allocate human and AI effort to maximize publications, citations, and grant dollars. \nAI ``effective IQ'' (research capability) doubles every 16 months and can be rented as a service.\nWith a constant-elasticity-of-substitution technology, the relative demand for human research labor decays exponentially when AI and human work are gross substitutes.\nA grant tournament with prestige multipliers amplifies concentration toward already advantaged principal investigators (PIs).\nWe derive role-specific theorems for tenured and tenure-track faculty, graduate students, and professional research support staff.\nThe model highlights one central comparative static, the elasticity of substitution, and shows how policy levers that reduce substitutability or raise human-oversight floors materially change the trajectory.",

          "abstract": "Background: In today’s social media–driven world, adolescents and young adults face constant exposure to peer feedback which affects their self-image. This study investigates how social feedback influences self-esteem in adolescents and emerging adults with elevated borderline personality (BPD) symptoms, a vulnerable group characterized by low self-esteem and a negative, unstable self-image.\nMethods: We employed a social evaluation task simulating a social media context. Participants were asked to make social predictions (whether they expected Likes or Dislikes from peers), received social feedback (Likes or Dislikes from peers) and repeatedly reported their momentary self-esteem. The sample included 55 adolescents and emerging adults with BPD symptoms and 67 matched non-clinical controls (NCC, ages 13-25). Computational reinforcement learning modeling was used to analyze their behavior. \nResults: Compared to NCC, BPD showed strongly biased negative expectations of not being liked by others. Besides, computational modeling revealed significant group differences in social learning: individuals with BPD symptoms failed to learn from frequent positive social feedback (Likes) but overweighted rare negative social feedback (Dislikes) received from generally benevolent peers. Moreover, their self-esteem was disproportionately reactive to positive feedback from critical raters, a pattern partly explained by individual differences in self-reported adverse family experiences.\nConclusions: These findings highlight fundamental disruptions in how young people with BPD symptoms learn from social feedback and how they use it to inform their self-esteem.",

          "authors": "Yi-Chen Hsieh; Elizabeth Berry; Todd A Vogel; Patricia Lockwood",
          "abstract": "Conduct disorder (CD) and psychopathy are characterised by antisocial behaviour and sometimes limited prosocial emotions. Understanding violence and aggression in these disorders depends on unravelling the mechanisms behind how and when these individuals make decisions that help or harm others. New advances in computational modelling of behaviour and computational psychiatry promise to provide such mechanistic insights into how, when, and why people choose antisocial and prosocial actions. However, studies employing such computational approaches to understand antisocial disorders have only recently begun to emerge, particularly compared to studies on internalising disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this systematic review, we followed PRISMA guidelines to identify and synthesise 19 studies that applied computational approaches to investigate social decision-making in CD, psychopathy, and subclinical psychopathic traits. Across these studies, we identified models based on reinforcement learning, drift–diffusion, and social valuation that showed that antisocial behaviours are linked to altered learning about others’ outcomes, reduced sensitivity to guilt and inequity, and atypical value integration when prosocial actions involve personal cost. Converging evidence across adolescent and adult samples highlights how computational models can uncover distinct cognitive and affective mechanisms that traditional behavioural analyses overlook. This synthesis therefore underscores the potential of computational psychiatry to reveal the mechanisms underlying antisocial behaviour and to inform an integrated computational framework of social decision-making in antisocial disorders.",

          "authors": "Anirudh Doppalapudi; Andrew Goldman",
          "abstract": "The number of students who listen to background music while studying has been increasing rapidly. The effect music has on memory has been studied quite thoroughly for a couple of decades, and yet still the effect it has on long-term memory performance remains ambiguous. Numerous studies have concluded—in contradiction with each other—that music can improve, hinder, or have no effect on memory performance. Despite these ambiguous results on memory, music has been shown to improve and enhance other cognitive functions like concentration and focus.\nSeparating the encoding and retrieval processes of long-term memory can help interpret the past mixed results in this particular research area. To this end, we compared the effects of background music on the encoding and retrieval processes of memory, something previous studies have not investigated. Four groups of college students under varying listening conditions were instructed to memorize a fifteen word list and were then asked to recall that very same list to the best of their ability two days later. We found that music, as opposed to noise, had a negative effect on performance when listened to at both the encoding and retrieval stages. No significance was found during the mixed music and noise conditions during encoding and retrieval. We discuss possible reasons such as individual musical preference, selection of music, working memory performance, and more for these unclear findings.",

          "authors": "Krista Byers-Heinlein; CONNECT partnership",
          "abstract": "Over the past decade, grass-roots Big Team Science (BTS) organizations – self-organized groups of researchers working together towards a common goal – have transformed research in the social sciences by enabling unprecedented collaboration, sample diversity, and methodological rigor. Yet as individual networks have multiplied, BTS faces a fundamental challenge: the rapid scaling of large-scale collaborative research has outpaced systematic understanding of what makes it effective. This knowledge gap results in networks reinventing approaches rather than building systematically on collective experience. Here, we introduce the concept of a network-of-networks: a coordinated ecosystem approach that connects existing BTS initiatives and community partners to develop and share knowledge, infrastructure, and inclusive practices. We use the CONNECT (Coordinated Network of Networks for Enhancing Collaborative Teams) partnership as an exemplar of this next phase of collaborative science, which integrates metascientific inquiry with participatory action research to improve workflows, co-develop scalable tools, and promote inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). By applying systematic, evidence-based approaches to collaborative practices themselves, this meta-collaborative approach moves BTS from trial-and-error toward systematic understanding of effective collaboration, laying the groundwork for a more reproducible, inclusive, and sustainable global research ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "Background\nThe culturally specific nature of grief highlights potential cultural-bounded symptom dynamics. This study first aimed to explore the temporal dynamics of PG symptoms and to identify central nodes in longitudinal symptom networks to inform targeted clinical interventions. A second aim was to examine cross-cultural similarities and differences in these networks over time, providing empirical foundations for culturally tailored grief interventions.\nMethods\nThe present study applied contemporaneous and cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) analyses to one-year longitudinal data from Chinese (N = 286) and U.S. (N = 267) community samples to examine the dynamic associations of Prolonged Grief (PG) symptoms. \nResults\nContemporaneous network analyses revealed that disbelief about the death demonstrated high centrality across both cultural groups and time points. No significant differences were found in the network structure and global strength between the two time points in either sample. Results from CLPNs showed that emotional pain exhibited strong and consistent influence (i.e., high out-prediction) across cultures. In the Chinese sample, identity disruption emerged as a culturally specific driving symptom, while in the U.S. sample, reintegration-related symptoms (i.e., difficulty reintegrating new life and preoccupation) demonstrated greater predictive influence. Additionally, loneliness showed high cross-cultural predictability over time (i.e., high in-prediction). \nConclusions\nThese findings provide important insights into the temporal dynamics of PG symptoms and suggest a two-step, culturally responsive care pathway, with early emotion regulation strategies plus culturally tuned identity  or reintegration focused approaches. Integrating such care into primary bereavement services has the potential to enhance grief-informed clinical practice.",

          "authors": "Sarah M Haigh; Isabella Durda",
          "abstract": "Uncomfortable visual environments that contain bright colors and striped patterns can induce illusions, headaches, and seizures. However, there is debate surrounding the effects of these environments on visual processing and the individual differences in these effects. We used chromatic grating patterns that differed in their color difference (e.g., red/blue compared to pink/purple) to examine their effects on reading speed – a visually demanding task. 112 participants took part, including 25 migraine and 37 headache-free individuals. Reading speed was slower when reading stripy compared to less-stripy text and there was a small non-linear effect of color on reading speed. Individuals with migraine tended to read slower compared to headache-free individuals. We conclude that stripy text negatively affects processing, but color presented in the periphery may not be noxious enough to disrupt processing. The slower reading in migraine highlights the visual demands involved in reading, supporting the need for visually comfortable text.",

          "abstract": "Polarized democracies reveal how collective emotion and cognitive resistance shape human judgment of truth. Using authentic political posts from Taiwan’s two major parties, we manipulated prebunking, information type, and consensus valence. A brief inoculation increased skepticism toward misinformation without reducing trust in accurate content. Negative emotional consensus sharply undermined the credibility of true information, while positive consensus showed little corrective power. Cognitive and affective evaluations were tightly coupled, forming a compact internal signal that reliably distinguished truth from falsehood. These findings uncover a fundamental mechanism linking shared emotion to truth evaluation, illuminating how targeted cognitive resistance can sustain trust under polarization.",

          "authors": "Margot Georgette Abel Van Cauwenberge; Louise Emsell; Mathieu Vandenbulcke; Sebastian Walther; Gordon Parker; Filip Bouckaert",
          "abstract": "Motor signs have been central to descriptions of melancholia since antiquity, yet their significance and presumed causes have varied considerably across history. Until today and despite their robust link with worse outcomes, the origin of motor signs in mood disorders is not well understood. This may be due to a lack of clinical awareness, heterogenous terminology and divergent assessment of motor signs in psychiatric and neurological research. In this paper, we revisit historical accounts of motor signs in melancholia, tracing their evolution from classical antiquity to the mid-20th century. Using a semi-systematic review of historical and clinical literature in four languages, we uncover ancient descriptions of motor retardation and agitation, initially framed within humoral and religious paradigms. From the 16th century onward, motor signs were increasingly interpreted as manifestations of problems in volition, affect and cognition caused by a nervous system dysfunction. By the 19th century, motor disturbance had become a defining feature of melancholia, giving rise to subtypes classifications that shaped early psychiatric nosology. Post–World War II developments introduced objective motor assessments and rating scales, yet conceptual disagreements persist regarding their definition, neuroanatomical correlates and attribution to affective, cognitive and motivational processes. We argue that historical perspectives offer valuable context for interpreting motor signs in contemporary neurobiological research. To advance the field, we propose a unified, non-interpretive motor vocabulary and advocate for the combined use of observer-rated and instrumented assessments.",

          "abstract": "In psychological assessment, vocabulary tests are commonly used as reliable and efficient indicators of crystallized intelligence, as retrospective proxies for premorbid intelligence, and as measures of language proficiency. However, many of the widely used German vocabulary tests are outdated, proprietary, and lack a clear rationale for item selection. To address these limitations, we developed a new, openly available vocabulary test: the Next-Generation Open Vocabulary Assessment (NOVA). Therefore, we first constructed 110 multiple-choice vocabulary items with support from ChatGPT and administered them to 1,052 German-speaking adults using a multiple-matrix design, along with a declarative knowledge test for validation purposes. In a second step, we used Ant Colony Optimization to compile two parallel 30-item short forms, optimized for reliability and item difficulty and discrimination. The resulting tests assessed vocabulary unidimensionally and reliably, covered a large ability range, and correlated strongly with declarative knowledge. We provide a Shiny app for the calculation of standard values based on individual test results. Additional analyses revealed that 57% of the variance in item difficulties could be explained by word frequency and word length, which may be particularly useful for streamlining the future development of vocabulary tests.",

          "authors": "Tobias R. Rebholz",
          "abstract": "Research on augmented judgment and decision-making has largely contrasted human and algorithmic sources of judgment. Accordingly, Logg’s (2022) “Theory of Machine” is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Indeed, people often treat humans and algorithms as different kinds, that is, functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, I propose to complement the predominant human-centric lens on algorithmic judgment with an explicit algorithm-centric one, focusing on people’s lay theories about how different algorithms differ. Put differently, the core psychological claim of Theory of Machine 2.0 is that lay perceivers also differentiate among various AI systems. The first main contribution is the synthesis of capability contrasts across AI systems. People’s perceptions of these contrasts may be formed and shaped by personal experience and media exposure. Most importantly, their expectations and beliefs are supposed to consequentially guide their downstream user behavior—such as system trust, algorithmic advice weighting, and accountability attribution. The second main contribution is the proposal of testable research questions and designs for more algorithm-centric future research on people’s augmented judgment and decision-making. The theoretical perspective proposed in this article clarifies how people form and use lay theories about different AI systems and offers practical levers for the design, deployment, and evaluation of algorithmic decision-support systems.",

          "abstract": "Collectivism-individualism shapes cognition, emotion, and behavior, yet within-country differences in the U.S. remain understudied and often rely on a collectivism index developed over 25 years ago. In this study, we developed an updated Collectivism Index to assess variation across states. Building on prior frameworks, we integrated diverse behavioral and demographic indicators, including family structure, marriage stability, religiosity, transportation practices, and self-employment. While overall patterns broadly aligned with historical findings, notable shifts emerged, suggesting sociocultural changes over the past two decades reshaped the relative expression of collectivism across states. At the state level, higher collectivism scores were associated with lower rates of marijuana use, binge drinking, and depression, and with greater cultural tightness, consistent with country-level findings in existing literature. These findings underscore the persistence, evolution, and psychological correlates of cultural patterns within the U.S. and provide a contemporary spatial tool for examining how regional cultural differences relate to psychological outcomes.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in social life, understanding its interpersonal and psychological implications is urgent yet under-theorized. This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "authors": "Caroline Poppa; Désirée Nießen; Jessica Daikeler; Henning Silber; Bernd Weiß; David Richter",
          "abstract": "Publication bias is the prioritized and selective reporting of scientifically significant results and often stems from the assumption that statistically significant research findings are rated as more important, credible, valuable, and publishable than nonsignificant or null findings. Previous work shows that this assumption makes researchers less likely to publish nonsignificant or null findings, a phenomenon termed file drawer bias. While prior research investigated the file drawer bias primarily at the study level (e.g., what share of studies has been published and which has not), we examine the prevalence of unpublished research on both the study and the hypothesis level (e.g. which hypotheses are published and which remain unpublished). We did so by comparing the submissions of 178 studies conducted in two probability-based German panel infrastructures (SOEP-IS and GESIS Panel) with their subsequent publications. We found substantial evidence for publication bias: after an average of more than six years of data availability, 43.8% of studies remained unpublished, 44.4% published at least one peer-reviewed article, and 11.8% published gray literature exclusively. Less than one third of submitted hypotheses were published, while the vast majority of published studies with hypotheses (&gt;95%) included newly added (ad-hoc) hypotheses, and more than half of these studies published exclusively ad-hoc hypotheses. Taken together, over 80% of all published hypotheses were ad-hoc, and over 70% of hypotheses were supported. These findings highlight persistent incentives toward selective reporting and ad-hoc hypothesis formulation (potential HARKing). Our results raise concerns about ongoing publication bias in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.",

          "abstract": "We investigated whether gender-based societal beliefs shape the way individuals gather information and draw conclusions—an effect that may support the persistence of gender stereotypes. Three pre-registered experiments (N = 210) used a dynamic sampling paradigm, in which participants estimated the gender distribution of the workforce of fictitious companies representing highly gendered professions (e.g., mechanic, hairdresser). Participants could learn about the workforce of each company by viewing up to ten pictures of its employees, in which the gender of the first two faces either confirmed, disconfirmed, or remained neutral with regard to societal expectations about the profession. When initial evidence matched (vs. mismatched) expectations, participants sampled fewer faces. And when participants did view additional faces in belief-confirming sequences, these additional faces also skewed towards the gendered expectations, suggesting that participants actively employed strategies leading to selective exposure. Furthermore, both gender-based beliefs and newly sampled information influenced estimates of the workforce gender distributions, with larger effects of newly sampled evidence as the participant viewed more faces. Thus, pre-existing gendered beliefs shaped information sampling and social judgements. Furthermore, early exposure to belief-disconfirming information elicited more extensive and less biased information search. More extensive information search, in return, led to less biased social judgements. This research shows that when social expectations are quickly confirmed, people tend to not look any further, whereas initial belief-challenging information elicits more extensive exploration and less biased conclusions.",

Participants were classified as non-gamers (N = 60,540; 82.53%), occasional gamers (N = 10,961; 14.94%), and frequent gamers (N = 1,858; 2.53%), according to their computer gaming patterns reported in 2006-2010. \n\nResults \nGroup comparison results suggested mostly negligible differences between gamers and non-gamers in the domains of demographics (e.g., age, sex), active/passive lifestyle (e.g., physical activity), social engagement (e.g., friends/family visits), sleep patterns (e.g., chronotype, insomnia), physical health (e.g., vision, cardiovascular health), and psychological well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life, depressed mood). Small effects of group differences were found in moderate exercise, TV watching, body mass index, body fat percentage and self-reported health. \n\nConclusion \nThese findings will help unveil the unique profile (or lack thereof) of older gamers versus non-gamers and provide insights for gerontologists and practitioners in the gaming industry.",

A total of 232 caregivers (79 males, 153 females) completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, Prosocial Tendencies Measure, Social Support Rating Scale, and Event-Related Rumination Inventory. Regression and mediation analyses showed that prosocial behavior was positively related to PTG. Both social support and deliberate rumination significantly mediated this relationship in parallel. These findings suggest that prosocial behaviors have a positive effect on PTG among caregivers for seriously ill patients. This direct effect, as well as the mediating effect of social support and deliberate rumination, suggests both social context and cognitive pathways to facilitate PTG among caregivers.",

          "abstract": "Reading enjoyment is typically studied as a stable trait, yet enjoyment fluctuates within individuals. We examined how both trait- and state-level reading enjoyment shape engagement and eye movements during naturalistic reading. Seventy-six adults read 40 book synopses, rated their enjoyment, answered comprehension questions, and decided whether to wait to view the book cover, while their eye movements were recorded. Mixed-effects models disaggregated between-participant (trait) from within-participant (state) enjoyment. Both levels predicted greater willingness to wait and higher comprehension. Trait enjoyment was associated with longer passage and word reading times. State enjoyment was linked to longer passage times, increased word skipping, faster early word processing, and increased regressions, suggesting more efficient first-pass reading accompanied by increased rereading. These findings suggest that momentary fluctuations in intrinsic motivation dynamically shape reading strategies, revealing a close link between perceived value and the allocation of cognitive resources during text processing.",

          "abstract": "Climate change increasingly affects mental health and wellbeing. Although recent research has begun to examine climate anxiety, little is known about the situations where it is experienced or situational factors that predict it. To help understand how climate anxiety is experienced in UK residents, we developed and evaluated a situated psychometric instrument for assessing climate anxiety in 31 relevant situations (e.g., hearing about climate catastrophes on the news). Of interest was how climate anxiety is experienced in the UK as largely the anticipation of climate disaster and environmental pollution, rather than as actually experienced climate disaster, as in it is experienced by populations in more vulnerable countries where significant climate disaster has occurred. In an online study (N = 303 UK residents), we investigated how much climate anxiety individuals experienced in each situation, along with how much they experienced 13 factors that potentially influence climate anxiety (e.g., expectation violation, threat, coping). An individual measure of climate anxiety averaged across situations exhibited high reliability, construct validity, and content validity. Large differences in climate anxiety were observed between situations, along with a large individual by situation interaction. In linear regressions for individual participants, the 13 factors tended to correlate with climate anxiety as predicted, explaining a median 75% of climate anxiety variance. By identifying factors that predict climate anxiety for individuals, our approach provides detailed understanding of climate anxiety in each individual across situations. These predictive profiles could support screening for climate anxiety, identifying situations where it occurs, and designing individualised support.",

          "abstract": "Affective inertia – the degree to which affect persists over time – has, for example, been linked with neuroticism, depressive symptoms, and increased distress. The typical statistical approaches modelling affective inertia as autoregression largely ignore that assessment periods covering several days also include overnight intervals which may bias affective inertia. In this study, we thus aimed to test (1) whether affective inertia differs within-day and overnight and (2) whether within-day and overnight inertia are differentially associated with psychological functioning (e.g., personality, perseverative thoughts, stress). We operationalized within-day inertia as the autoregression of affect from one timepoint to the next during the same day and overnight inertia as the autoregression of affect from the previous night to the next morning. We used data from the ESCAPE project including 254 ethnically and economically diverse participants (25–65 years) who participated in up to three 14-day measurement bursts with five daily beeps. We found significant within-day and overnight affective inertia in positive and negative affect. Overnight inertia substantially exceeded within-day inertia that would be expected for the longer overnight interval, indicating affective inertia differs within-day and overnight. This research highlights the importance to disentangle within-day and overnight intervals when studying affective inertia.",

          "abstract": "The non-human primate (NHP) brain, particularly that of the macaque monkey, provides a powerful model for investigating the neural basis of conscious perception due to its close homology with the human cortex. Research using paradigms such as binocular rivalry and binocular flash suppression has revealed that neuronal populations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) explicitly encode consciously perceived visual information—including direction of motion, faces, and complex patterns—even in the absence of behavioral reports. Using no-report and rapid serial visual presentation paradigms, these studies demonstrate that prefrontal representations persist when post-perceptual processing and motor reports are absent or minimized, suggesting that PFC activity reflects genuine correlates of conscious experience. Moreover, the PFC encodes both concrete sensory details and abstract, hierarchical information about visual sequences, such as global regularities and prediction errors, indicating an integrative representational architecture. These findings support theoretical models, including the Global Neuronal Workspace and Higher-Order Thought theories, which propose an active role of the PFC in broadcasting or representing conscious contents, while challenging accounts that view it as merely post-perceptual or epiphenomenal. Overall, convergent electrophysiological evidence highlights the PFC as a central node in the cortical network supporting subjective awareness, capable of representing both the content and structure of conscious experience.",

          "abstract": "The original Morris water maze (Morris, 1981) has been coined the “gold standard” task for examining spatial navigation in animals. The general procedure of the maze involves a circular pool filled approximately half-way with water. An animal is then tasked with locating and recalling the position of a hidden “platform”, which is submerged below the water surface in a fixed location. The platform has minimal visual presence in the pool, meaning the location of the platform must be found, learned and recalled from memory. Recently, the task has been translated using virtual reality for use with humans (virtual water task), to investigate similar cognitive mechanisms examined using the animal version of the task. However, there are multiple different variations of the virtual water task scattered across the human literature. These versions vary in both environmental design (e.g., different shaped arenas or platform sizes) and testing procedures (e.g., 1 minute trial times or no inter-trial intervals), which all influence a person’s ability to perform the task. Whilst the virtual version of this task possesses the same potential to become the “gold standard” for examining spatial cognition in humans, comparing and replicating results across research labs has shown to be incredibly difficult due the lack of standardised procedures and protocols. In this paper we present protocols to help with the standardisation of this task. We recommend practices and procedures for researching specific cognitive processes in humans, as well as reporting guidelines, recommended analyses and expected results.",

We addressed a prevailing psychological motivator of youth non-voting: a perception of political powerlessness. We experimentally evaluated an empathetic refutation approach that explained how electoral non-participation perpetuates political powerlessness while affirming young people’s psychological reasons for not voting.\nMethod: We conducted two experiments with British 18-29-year-old participants who had not voted in the 2024 UK General Election (total n = 935) to test whether reading a conversation that explained the vicious cycle of non-participation using an empathetic refutation (both experiments) or an assertive structure (Experiment 2) increased participants’ voting intentions relative to a control condition featuring an unrelated conversation.\nResults: Both types of explanations significantly increased participants’ voting intention compared to the control. Participants found the empathetic refutation approach to be most acknowledging of the non-voter’s perspective, but reported no significant differences in how compelling they found the explanations or their levels of trust and openness to the information presented.\nConclusions: Explaining the vicious cycle of non-participation could help to improve young people’s willingness to participate in the electoral process.\nKeywords: democracy; voting; trust; empathy; attitude roots; affirmation; youth vote",

          "abstract": "Children experience large differences in language learning opportunities during the early years. These differences include their mothers’ vocabulary sophistication, which may serve as a pathway for the transmission of educational attainment across generations. However, associations between vocabulary sophistication and education may be confounded by genetic factors that mothers and children share. In the E-Risk study—a longitudinal, nationally representative cohort of 1,116 British families, mothers’ naturalistic speech was recorded when their children when they were 5 years old. From the transcripts of these recordings, we derived mothers’ vocabulary sophistication. Mothers’ educational attainment at children’s age 5 years significantly predicted children’s educational attainment at age 18 years (β = .33, 95% CI [.280, .371]), and 16% of this association could be attributed to mothers’ vocabulary sophistication. Using path models with polygenic scores, we discerned genetic transmission effects (i.e., shared genetics) from environmentally mediated influences. We found that mothers’ vocabulary sophistication accounted for approximately 2% of the environmentally mediated influence on children’s educational attainment. The findings support that the ‘word gap’—differences in children’s language learning opportunities—likely plays a small causal role in the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. Our results highlight the importance of early language environments and may inform strategies aimed at reducing the impact of family background on educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "From books of secrets to secret societies, it appears that groups have found success in publicizing the existence of secrets while concealing their content, possibly in an attempt to increase the perceived importance of the secret information and trigger curiosity in their audience. This paper explores why secrets, despite being often associated with shameful personal stories, are so often publicly advertised, in three pre-registered experiments (US participants, N = 1970). In study 1, participants judged that publicly acknowledged secrets were less likely to harm the secret-keeper’s reputation than privately kept ones, suggesting that publicly advertising secrets might reduce the harm made to one’s reputation. In studies 2 and 3, we directly tested whether secrecy might impact curiosity. We could not find significant evidence that our secrecy manipulations increased curiosity between conditions, both in interpersonal settings or when evaluating books. Instead, exploratory mediation analyses suggest that secrecy might have a direct negative effect on curiosity in interpersonal contexts, even though we found robust positive relationships between the costs secret-keepers invested in keeping their secrets, the perceived importance of the concealed information, and participants’ curiosity. These findings suggest that advertising secrets might not have consistent effects on an audience’s curiosity.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous pupil fluctuations (SPFs) during rest provide a non-invasive, low-cost index of central arousal dynamics, independent of cognitive task demands. These features position SPFs as promising markers for baseline neurophysiological activity in both basic and translational research.\nThis review synthesizes current evidence on the resting-state pupil-brain system, focusing on its core components: central neuromodulatory circuits and large-scale cortical networks. We first examine the relationship between SPFs and distributed elements of the ascending arousal system, including noradrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic nuclei. We then detail SPF coupling with intrinsic functional networks - default mode, salience, and sensorimotor systems - highlighting their role in mediating transitions between internally and externally oriented brain states. Finally, we discuss the spectral and directional properties of pupil-brain interactions, emphasizing analytical approaches suited for assessing causality and outlining implications for clinical and translational applications.\nConverging evidence from animal and human neuroimaging studies reveals robust spatiotemporal and spectral coupling between SPFs and neural activity across micro- and macro-scales. These findings support a systems-level framework in which SPFs serve as integrative markers linking subcortical neuromodulation with large-scale cortical dynamics.\nWe conclude that SPFs offer a sensitive window into arousal regulation and body-brain integration, with potential utility as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric conditions and altered states of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Digital disconnection is defined as setting deliberate limits to connectivity to enhance (digital) well-being. Yet, for some people, disconnecting from their devices may prove more difficult than for others. One important but understudied factor that may help explain such differences is how habitually people use their smartphones. Drawing on cross-sectional survey data from 944 Belgian adults (50.40% female, Mage = 42.28, SDage = 13.63), we therefore investigated how individual differences in habitual smartphone use are associated with perceived difficulty with disconnection and disconnection frequency, as well as how these variables (partly) explain how habitual smartphone use relates to well-being. Structural equation modeling revealed that habitual smartphone use was indeed positively associated with perceived difficulty with disconnection (β = 0.40, p &lt; .001), which, in turn, was negatively associated with disconnection frequency (β = -0.16, p &lt; .001). Moreover, perceived difficulty with disconnection showed a negative association with well-being (β = -0.24, p = &lt; .001), while disconnection frequency showed a positive association with well-being (β = 0.10, p = .001). The analyses also revealed a significant indirect effect from habitual smartphone use to well-being, with the strongest pathway via perceived difficulty with disconnection (β = -0.10, p &lt; .001). These findings highlight the need to further investigate the role of habitual smartphone use in shaping how people experience and manage digital disconnection, as well as its implications for well-being.",

Previous studies focused on the linguistically expressible aspects of text comprehension. In this study, we propose a new hypothesis, the purification comprehension hypothesis, that seeks to explain how a reader constructs indescribable and coherent comprehension using quantum probability theory. This hypothesis regards the reading process as purification, in which the reader's initial interpretation state is mixed, and the reader incorporates external systems, such as the interpretation of other parts of the text or prior knowledge, to purify their state. Therefore, the dimensionality of the state increases and von Neumann entropy decreases through purification. We also highlight two types of reading based on this hypothesis: purification and deterministic. Our model contributes to studies on reading by bridging humanities and scientific studies, provides implications for cognition models that aim to minimize Shannon entropy, and has the potential to apply cognition related to other modalities and media, such as music and art.",

Generative learning helps construct meaningful mental representations, while retrieval practice supports consolidation and long-term retention. Combining both strategies may foster learning; however, research remains scarce.\nAims: We investigated how combining generative activities and retrieval practice affects students’ conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy in authentic school settings for immediate and lasting learning. Additionally, we explored associations between generation, retrieval, and explanation quality (i.e., completeness, elaboration, correctness).\nSample: The classroom experiment was conducted in authentic physics lessons with N = 344 secondary students.\nMethods: Students participated in a physics teaching unit about converging lenses and were randomly assigned within each class to one of four combinations of sequential learning activities crossing two factors (non-generation vs. generation; non-retrieval vs. retrieval). Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy were measured immediately and after eight weeks.\nResults: Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy did not significantly differ between generation, retrieval, or their sequential combination at either test. However, exploratory analyses revealed that retrieval practice supported lasting learning only when prior generative processing was of low quality—that is, when students’ explanations were incomplete, less elaborated, or inaccurate.\nConclusions: Combining generation and retrieval does not universally enhance learning. Its effectiveness appears to depend on the quality of prior generative processing. In this sense, retrieval practice may serve a happy role—compensating fragile knowledge—or a redundant one, offering no added benefit when prior understanding is already strong.",

A prominent theme was that of control: Participants want to maintain some sense of autonomy. This factor has not (yet) been included in current technology acceptance models but may be an influential factor in the adoption and acceptance of technology by the elderly. Additionally, participants weighed the impact on their community (rather than themselves) heavily, accepting that adoption of assistive technology will greatly support their family, caregivers and/or the healthcare sector.

Gaze behaviour plays a critical role during this transition, as effective information processing is essential for safely resuming manual control. Directional Takeover Requests (TORs) have been proposed to guide drivers’ attention towards safety-critical areas, thereby reducing takeover time and improving takeover quality. However, existing research on the effects of directional TORs on gaze behaviour has found inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify effects of directional TORs on drivers’ gaze behaviour compared to non-directional TORs during transitions of control. Meta-analyses revealed that incorporating directionality into the visual interface increased both the number and duration of fixations on the TOR display. Directional TORs effectively guided drivers’ visual attention towards hazards and reduced cognitive demands, although their effects on mirror-checking and road fixations varied with interface modality and location.",

          "abstract": "Effective instruction should not only enhance immediate performance but also prepare learners to succeed when learning independently in novel situations (new learning). This study examined which timing and frequency strategies of instruction most effectively foster new learning. We compared six strategies, inspired by theories of motivation (e.g., self-determination theory) and cognition (e.g., testing effect), with two control conditions (no-instruction and full-instruction). Across three experiments (total N = 1,522), participants performed a category learning task. They first received instruction through feature highlighting, whose timing and frequency varied across conditions. Subsequently, their performance was assessed in an independent session where they learned new categories without instruction. An adaptive strategy that tailored instruction to learner performance significantly outperformed the control conditions in initial experiments (Experiments 1 and 2). However, this effect was not observed in a comprehensive experiment (Experiment 3), suggesting that adaptivity itself may not have been the beneficial factor. Instead, an overall examination suggested that the beneficial effects were attributable to two underlying instructional patterns shared by the conditions that outperformed the control conditions: (1) providing instruction in successive sequences, and (2) interspersing tests without instruction by restricting the frequency of instruction. Instructional strategies with these two patterns yielded a significant advantage over the control conditions for independently discovering correct knowledge in novel situations, although they did not reliably improve generalization of that knowledge to other items. This integration of instructional patterns appears to foster new learning by balancing the useful information from instruction with the desirable difficulty of testing.",

          "authors": "Saeid Sadeghi; Marziyeh Rahimi; Robyn L. Young",
          "abstract": "Deficits in joint attention are well documented as hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many different measures have been used to study autistic individuals within a wide range of age groups, meaning that we do not have a clear picture of how joint attention was assessed in past studies. In this systematic review, we aim to provide a clearer picture of joint attention assessment methods used with autistic individuals, identify gaps in measurement, and make recommendations for future research.\nWe searched PubMed, EBSCO (APA PsycINFO, APA PsycARTICLES), Scopus, Ovid, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. A total of 129 studies involving 5536 autistic individuals were retrieved for the period 1989-2024. \nOut of 129 studies reviewed, 57 compared the joint attention of autistic (N=1727) and non-autistic (N=2094) individuals. In 51 of these studies, autistic individuals performed significantly lower on the joint attention assessments, highlighting significant challenges in maintaining joint attention. Measures of joint attention included eye-tracking (18 studies), standardized scales and questionnaires (57 studies), and play- or activities-based measures (63 studies). \nEye-tracking has been used mainly in comparison studies with autistic children over five years old, whereas intervention studies have primarily assessed younger autistic children under five years old using standardized tools and play- or activity-based measures. These studies also differed considerably in the tasks employed, the operational definitions of joint attention, and the ways in which joint attention skills were measured. The wide variation in methods makes it difficult to compare outcomes across studies. Our review therefore highlights the need for the development of comprehensive standardized measures that are sensitive to developmental variations in joint attention, enabling more reliable cross-study comparisons and ultimately supporting more accurate diagnosis and tailored interventions for autistic individuals. Moreover, we recommend the establishment of clear guidelines for designing eye-tracking tasks and play- or activity-based procedures for assessing the joint attention of autistic individuals, as well as the development of specific joint attention scales for consistent use in both research and clinical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Humans are highly susceptible to framing manipulations in intertemporal decision\nmaking—choices that involve tradeoffs between immediate and delayed rewards.\nWell-known decision-making biases such as the magnitude effect, in which larger\nreward amounts increase patience, have been attributed to self-control, reward\nsystem activation, and other cognitive mechanisms. Here, we show that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) exhibit similar sensitivities to framing manipulations,\nincluding the magnitude, sign, and hidden-zero effects. Unlike humans, LLMs\ndiscount delayed rewards exponentially rather than hyperbolically and do not\nexhibit a decimal effect, suggesting their behavior does not simply reflect\nknowledge of published decision-making phenomena learned during training.\nAnalysis of LLM embedding spaces, which encode semantic knowledge,\nrevealed that large monetary amounts are represented more closely to words\nrelated to delay and the future. This suggests that framing manipulations bias\nLLM choices through semantic proximity to words linked to the present or future.\nTogether, these results introduce a conceptual framework whereby linguistic\nstructure shapes decisions, suggesting that human decision-making biases may\nemerge, in part, from the organization of choice options in semantic space.",

Recent research suggests that personality disorders, especially OCPD, might not be as stable as once thought. The current study investigates the longitudinal stability of OCPD diagnosis and individual symptom criteria in individuals with OCD. Methods: 320 participants with a primary diagnosis of OCD were included in the study, with diagnostic assessments conducted annually for seven years. Logistic mixed-effects models were conducted to examine the relationship between time and OCPD diagnosis ratings, as well as the relationship between time and each OCPD symptom criterion over seven years. Results: In individuals with OCD, time was a significant predictor of OCPD diagnosis which indicated diagnostic instability, with the likelihood of OCPD diagnosis decreasing over time. Three individual criteria (detail-oriented, inflexible, overconscientious, and scrupulous, and miserly spending style) were shown to be stable while the other five (perfectionism, reluctance to delegate, rigidity and stubbornness, excessive work devotion, and inability to discard) were unstable. Conclusion: OCPD diagnosis ratings decreased over time in individuals with OCD and consists of a mix of enduring and episodic symptom criteria. It suggests the need for a refinement of OCPD diagnostic criteria and future research on symptom stability of OCPD across different diagnostic groups.",

          "authors": "Ellis Cain; Elizabeth Geballe; Tyler Marghetis",
          "abstract": "Many theories of cultural evolution emphasize the influence of repeated transmission. Folktales, myths, and other cultural stories offer a testbed for these theories [1, 2]. In the real world, however, the transmission of a cultural story is often confounded with large-scale changes in linguistic or cultural context, making it difficult to identify the mechanisms of cultural change and stability. Here, to unravel this theoretical tangle, we analyze an unusual natural experiment: due to a misunderstanding, a story attributed to the Russian novelist Tolstoy was translated repeatedly in a full cycle, with the first and final versions published in the same language (English), country (USA), city (Chicago), and decade (1890s) [3]. Since this cycle of cultural transmission began and ended in the same linguistic-cultural context, it offers a unique opportunity to isolate the effects of repeated transmission from the effects of changing the broader sociocultural context. We transformed each version of the story into a high-dimensional trajectory through a shared, multilingual semantic space. We find that the story’s overall shape was preserved throughout the translation cycle. Versions produced within the same linguistic-cultural context, moreover, were especially similar. Each step of the translation process, however, incrementally distorted the story; the final English version was thus more similar to the Russian and French than to the original English, despite both English versions appearing in the same language and location. These findings demonstrate how cultural transmission can preserve complex meanings while introducing incremental changes that reflect both individual-level and broader sociocultural influences. Cultural evolution is shaped both by the transmission process and the broader cultural milieu in which it occurs.",

          "authors": "Stephen Andrew Waller-DeLaRosa",
          "abstract": "While models of ADHD often focus on linear deficits in executive functions, they can fail to capture the looping, recursive nature of the lived cognitive experience. This paper introduces the Recursive Temporal Appraisal Loop (RTAL), a model that reframes ADHD cognition as operating on a feedback-first architecture. It is posited that before feedforward action is possible, the system must first complete a synthesis of relevant material, a sequence termed pre-feedforward calibration. The Temporal Double Bind (TDB) is formalized as the initiating condition for RTAL engagement—conflicting cross-timescale imperatives without an operative metarule. The RTAL is treated as a transactional process, where internal appraisals are continuously shaped by environmental feedback. The model shows how cognitive-load composition steers the loop toward either productive Repetition or pathological Recollection. RTALs become pathological when working memory saturation and a weak temporal signal create spiral amplification. Predictions are outlined that link load composition and chronotype to loop outcomes, plus operational metrics enabling direct empirical tests. This model explains why simple choices can feel overwhelming and why effective interventions must support this recursive process rather than attempting to override the architecture.",

The current study examined how causality and agency impact the temporal structure of memory for a virtual escape room game played with friends. We found that after controlling for veridical temporal distance, causally-related events were remembered as closer in time than unrelated events. This effect grew stronger after a consolidation period, with causally-connected memories showing greater temporal integration than memories that merely shared contextual overlap. Notably, within causally-related events, temporal memory was superior for events where game clues were found than when they were used to resolve ambiguity. We also demonstrated that participants who made greater in-game contributions to puzzle-solving showed better temporal memory compared to participants who contributed less. High contributors also showed increased temporal integration between contextually-related events in particular. Together, these findings highlight the role of causal connections in driving memory integration and extend prior work on agency and memory to real-world experiences.",

          "abstract": "Cross-cultural research led by Ozaki et al. (2024) has revealed that songs exhibit higher pitch, lower tempo, and more stable pitches than speech. However, this research relied on solo recordings, while most singing and speaking occurs in group contexts. The present study examined the acoustic features of speech and songs among Mandarin speakers in group settings. We addressed two questions: 1 [confirmatory]) Do singing and conversation in group contexts show similar acoustic patterns to those reported by Ozaki et al. (2024)? 2 [exploratory]) Does musicianship influence the acoustic differences between speech and song? Three groups of native Mandarin speakers (n = 20) in Auckland participated in the singing and conversation tasks (both of which involved taking turns alternating singing/speaking). We analyzed three acoustic features (pitch height, temporal rate, pitch stability) to test the confirmatory question and examined correlations between musicianship and effect sizes for the exploratory question. Our confirmatory analyses replicated and extended the findings of Ozaki et al. (2024), showing that singing exhibited significantly higher pitch (D = 1.21), slower tempo (D = 2.07), and more stable pitch (D = 0.57) than conversation among Mandarin speakers. Exploratory results suggested a trend whereby individuals with higher musicianship tended to produce greater acoustic differentiation between speech and song; additional data are needed to confirm this effect. In future work, our team will integrate data from up to 26 languages/sites included in the Stage 1 Programmatic Registered Report protocol and conduct meta-analyses to provide more comprehensive estimates of cross-cultural relationships between speech and song.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects social interaction, communication and behavioural flexibility. Recent theories grounded in the Bayesian Brain Framework propose that autistic individuals process environmental uncertainty differently, overweighting volatility when updating predictions about the world. However, the robustness of these predictive processing differences and their relevance to core symptoms remains unclear. \nMethods: \nWe attempted to replicate findings from Lawson and colleagues (1), who showed a tendency to overestimate environmental volatility in autistic adults based on belief states extracted using a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter. We extended their paradigm to a domain central to the autistic experience: rather than distinguishing houses from faces, participants detected valence in emotional facial expressions. Preregistered hypotheses were evaluated using Bayesian linear mixed models.\nResults: \nDespite using an identical computational model to extract belief states, we did not find robust differences between autistic and non-autistic adults, though autistic participants showed a non-credible trend towards increased processing of phasic volatility. Largely comparable probabilistic associative learning was also reflected in response times and pupil sizes. \nLimitations: \nWhile participants reacted faster to expected than unexpected trials in the beginning, this effect decreased over the course of the experiment; thus, possibly indicating that the individual blocks of stable cue-outcome associations were too short.\nConclusions:\nThese results challenge the robustness and symptom-specificity of previous reported volatility processing differences in autism, suggesting that altered Bayesian inference may not generalize to socially relevant prediction tasks that involve core autistic difficulties.",

          "authors": "Daisuke Akiba",
          "abstract": "This theoretical paper introduces the Verbal-Cognitive Scaffold (VCS) Model, a cognitively inclusive framework which proposes the cognitive architectures underlying computational thinking (CT). Moving beyond monolithic theories of cognition (e.g., executive-function and metacognitive control models), the VCS Model posits inner speech (InSp) as the predominant cognitive pathway supporting CT operations in neurotypical populations. Synthesizing interdisciplinary scholarship across cognitive science, computational theory, neurodiversity research, and others, the framework articulates distinct mechanisms through which InSp supports CT. The model specifies four primary pathways linking InSp to CT components: verbal working memory supporting decomposition, symbolic representation facilitating pattern recognition and abstraction, sequential processing enabling algorithmic thinking, and dialogic self-questioning enhancing debugging processes. Crucially, the model posits these verbally mediated pathways as modal rather than universal. Alt-hough non-verbal architectures are acknowledged as possible alternative routes, their precise mechanisms remain underspecified in existing literature and, therefore, are not the focus of the current theoretical exploration. Given this context, this manuscript focuses on the well-documented verbal support provided by InSp. The VCS Model's theoretical contributions include: (1) specification of nuanced cognitive support systems where distinct InSp functions selectively enable particular CT operations; (2) generation of empirically testable predictions regarding aptitude–pathway interactions in computational training and performance; and (3) compatibility with future empirical efforts to inquire into neurodivergent strategies that may diverge from verbal architectures, while acknowledging that these alternatives remain underexplored. Individual variations in InSp phenomenology are theorized to predict distinctive patterns of CT engagement. This comprehensive framework, thus, elaborates and extends existing verbal mediation theories by specifying how InSp supports and enables CT, while laying the groundwork for possible future inquiry into alternative, non-verbal cognitive pathways.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

In visual tasks, while GPT-4 matched human performance levels, GPT-4o rapidly surpassed human norms across diverse datasets [3, 4, 5]. Furthermore, these capabilities extend to complex multimodal social cognition, exemplified by Gemini 1.5 Pro, which has exceeded human benchmarks through integrated audiovisual analysis [6].\nEmulating the understanding of emotion and cognition enables AI to exploit a profound vulnerability inherent to the human brain - its constant search for communication partners and sensitivity to agents perceived as having similar thoughts and feelings. Understanding another agent’s mental states and feeling understood by them creates affinity, activating the biological systems underpinning attachment relationships [7]. Until the emergence of AI, this mechanism provided clear selective advantages, enhancing social communication, identity formation, and interpersonal bonding.

          "abstract": "Anonymity is one of the most frequently invoked explanations for online behavior, yet we still do not know what it actually means for users. Existing research often reduces it to a technical non-identifiability that overlooks how it is subjectively experienced. However, it is this perceived anonymity that is likely to drive social and behavioral outcomes. Despite its theoretical importance, perceived anonymity is rarely examined from the users’ perspective. To address this gap, we explore how users understand anonymity in digital environments and what they consider necessary to “feel anonymous”. This qualitative study draws on six focus groups with a total of 21 Czech internet users (aged 18–54; M: 43%, F: 52%, Other: 5%) to examine perceptions of online anonymity. A thematic analysis revealed that participants understood anonymity not only as the absence of names or photos, but also as the lack of characteristics tied to one’s broader physical and mental context, encompassing both how someone lives and how they think. Trust strongly shaped perceptions of anonymity with close others. Anonymity was linked to confidentiality and privacy within trusted circles but became fragile as audiences widened. It was highly context-dependent and influenced by platform design and purpose. Although traditional anonymity (e.g., namelessness or invisibility) has not disappeared, identity-based network users often seek security not through non-identifiability but through confidentiality and privacy, forming a new kind of anonymity that is grounded in the same protective feeling. These insights may inform future research on the diverse effects of anonymity in digital contexts.",

          "abstract": "Modern theories conceptualize personality as a dynamic system of interacting psychological states, a perspective that echoes early accounts. These early theorists also emphasized the continual differentiation of personality, viewing ongoing change as intrinsic to the person’s dynamic organization. Yet most empirical models treat the relations among personality components as static over time. To test this assumption, the present study applied kernel-based vector autoregressive models to estimate person-specific contemporaneous and lagged time-varying networks of Big Five facet states using intensive longitudinal data from three undergraduate samples and one community sample (N = 392; 31,564 total surveys). Across samples, 76.8% of contemporaneous and 74.5% of lagged networks exhibited non-stationary dynamics, meaning that the structural relations among facets changed over the two- to three-week sampling period. Network non-stationarity was modestly associated with variability in perceived situational valence (pOsitivity and Negativity) but not with traits, demographics, or well-being measures. Time-varying networks were more predictive than corresponding stationary networks, though only contemporaneous models demonstrated acceptable reliability. These findings support dynamic systems perspectives of personality as an evolving, temporally embedded process, suggesting that short-term differentiation in personality structure represents a meaningful and underrecognized source of psychological variability.",

Data were analyzed using a three-level mixed-effects meta-regression model, accounting for effect non-independence and key moderators such as retention intervals, warnings, overall test performance, and study characteristics. \nResults. \nAnalyzing data from 432 studies and 1,764 effect sizes across 51,845 participants, the average size of the misinformation effect was substantial, g = 0.659, 95% [0.196, 1.122], indicating a robust overall effect across studies. There was considerable variation across different conditions (total σ2 = 0.723, I2 = 91.78%). Consistent with previous findings, accuracy for the control condition was strongly positively associated with the size of the misinformation effect. Post-misinformation warnings were found to reduce the misinformation effect. Additionally, post-event testing, contrary to previous findings on retrieval-enhanced suggestibility, did not significantly moderate the misinformation effect.\nDiscussion. \nThe present analysis supports the conclusion that the misinformation effect is a reliable phenomenon, driven by a mixture of memory-related mechanisms as well as mechanism related to how participants strategize when responding to tests of different formats. Additionally, given the substantial heterogeneity we observed, we argue that the misinformation effect might be usefully conceptualized as a constellation of related phenomena, rather than a single coherent effect.",

In Experiment 1, we show that cued recall for word pairs with thematic relations was faster and more accurate, followed by pairs with taxonomic relations and finally unrelated pairs. Based on Experiment 1’s findings, we hypothesized that thematically related words are more quickly and more accurately retrieved because they are more accessible in one’s semantic memory. To test this prediction, we designed a second experiment where participants encoded word pairs of the same relations as in Experiment 1 and completed a forced-choice associative memory test with options sharing different semantic relations to the cue. In addition to corroborating the findings of Experiment 1, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants were more prone to incorrectly guessing a thematic alternative. We conclude that thematic relations outperform taxonomic relations in driving memory performance and speculate that this may result from the privileged role of thematic relations in organizing episodic memory.",

          "title": "What Happens When a Korean Woman Scholar Names the Creativity Crisis the Field Refuses to See",
          "authors": "Kyung Hee Kim",
          "abstract": "Newsweek’s 2010 cover story, “The Creativity Crisis,” documented a measurable decline in creativity based on Torrance Tests data from 272,599 participants. Its reach bypassed conventional gatekeepers; popularity arrived without permission, and they have never forgiven it. A decade later, the Journal of Creative Behavior’s editorial gatekeepers sought to erase both the crisis and the Korean woman scholar who exposed it by publishing Barbot and Said-Metwaly’s (2021) critique of Kim (2011c). Their article alleged—falsely—that Kim omitted effect sizes, age-level analyses, Form B use, and data extraction procedures. It rested on inflated claims, unfounded inferences, denial of empirical findings through distorted graphs, and 44 documented distortions across 31 citations—including fabrication, mischaracterization, and misleading attribution—that few would expect from leading scholars, yet were shielded by the editorial process, recasting the Creativity Crisis as a “myth” and societal harm. The opposite is true: evidence spurred educators and reformers to engage constructively, inspiring curricular innovation, accountability, and momentum to reverse the decline. When the critique appeared online, months before official publication, leading figures publicly celebrated its arrival, declaring the crisis fabricated by Kim and Newsweek, celebrating the silencing of a Korean woman’s voice. This rebuttal corrects the record by addressing age-specific data structures, statistical and graphical misrepresentations, p-value logic, and misuse of cross-temporal meta-analysis and TTCT scores that ignore post-2012 scoring changes. It shows how editorial gatekeeping and racialized exclusion obstruct scientific debate, underscoring the importance of ethical publishing and dissenting voices. Science does not progress by denying crises, but by confronting them.",

          "authors": "Alisha Vabba; Valerio Placidi; Matteo P. Lisi; Salvatore Maria Aglioti",
          "abstract": "Mafia-type criminal organizations depend on their ability to corrupt local communities and foster a climate of silence and indifference toward their crimes — a code of silence often referred to with the Italian word ‘omertà’. The media and entertainment industry often glorify the figure of the criminal mafia boss, potentially encouraging sympathy for criminal figures. In the present study we investigated if embodying the avatar of a real vs a fictional mafia criminal lead to changes in attitudes and behavioural intentions towards mafia-type organized crime. Eighty-three Italian participants were divided into three groups, each embodying a different character: a real-life mafia boss, Toto Riina (Mafia Group, N = 35); a fictional mafia figure, Don Vito Corleone from The Godfather (Mafia Fictional Group, N = 23); or a neutral, non-specific avatar (Control Group, N = 25). While embodying the character, participants gave a neutral thank-you speech to a group of collaborators in an office-like room. Before and after the experience participants completed various tasks measuring their explicit and implicit attitudes towards mafia-type organized crime, and their intentions to oppose this kind of criminality. Additionally, immediately after the task, while still embodying their character they took part in an interpersonal distance task in which they were approached by avatars representing criminals, mafia criminals, and innocents, while we collected comfort ratings and physiological indices (HR and GSR). Our results indicate paradoxical effects of embodying a fictional mafia character, which were not observed in the Control group or Mafia group. Specifically, after the virtual experience, participants who embodied Don Vito Corleone retained higher levels of conflict when deciding whether they would take part in anti-mafia actions, showed greater implicit aversion towards neutral stimuli preceded by mafia-related primes and indicated greater discomfort in the interpersonal distance task when approached by mafia criminals compared to non-mafia criminals. Our study contributes to research investigating the effects of embodying morally loaded virtual characters and suggests that embodying negative role models in virtual environments does not promote complicity or admiration for those figures but may actually produce paradoxical effects.",

          "abstract": "In this study we aimed to examine behavioral determinants influencing parents’ willingness to recommend digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) to their youth, guided by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation–Behavior (COM-B) model. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 parents of adolescents aged 13-19 years with mental health concerns. Interviews were thematically analyzed using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Results: Findings mapped onto COM-B domains. Capability barriers included low awareness, uncertainty about SSIs, and difficulty navigating digital tools. Opportunity facilitators involved embedding SSIs in trusted settings and receiving endorsements from credible sources, though views on peer recommendations were mixed. Motivation was shaped by alignment with parental values (e.g., safety, communication) and emotional responses such as fear or skepticism related to DMHIs and privacy. Conclusion: Results from this study highlight the need for dissemination strategies that directly address parental concerns and priorities, including culturally relevant messaging, tailored framing, and delivery through familiar and trusted community settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: The Pavlovian go/no-go task is commonly used to measure individual differences in Pavlovian biases and their interaction with instrumental learning. However, prior research has found suboptimal reliability for computational model-based performance measures for this task, limiting its usefulness in individual-differences research. These studies did not make use of several strategies previously shown to enhance task-measure reliability (e.g., task gamification, hierarchical Bayesian modeling for model estimation). Here we investigated if such approaches could improve the task’s reliability. Methods: Across two experiments, we recruited two independent samples of adult participants (N=103, N=110) to complete a novel, gamified version of the Pavlovian go/no-go task multiple times over several weeks. We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to derive reinforcement learning model-based indices of participants' task performance, and additionally to estimate the reliability of these measures. Results: In Experiment 1, we observed considerable and unexpected practice effects, with most participants reaching near-ceiling levels of performance with repeat testing. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of some model parameters was unacceptable (range: 0.379–0.973). In Experiment 2, participants completed a modified version of the task designed to lessen these practice effects. We observed greatly reduced practice effects and improved estimates of the test-retest reliability (range: 0.696–0.989). Conclusion: The results demonstrate that model-based measures of performance on the Pavlovian go/no-go task can reach levels of reliability sufficient for use in individual- differences research. However, additional investigation is necessary to validate the modified version of the task in other populations and settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: Signals from the body profoundly influence cognition. This process is known as interoception, and has been extensively studied in the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric domains; in contrast, metabolic influences remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the link between glucose control and cognition, motivated by the observation that there is substantial, unexplained comorbidity between type-2 diabetes and depression. In rodents, insulin modulates dopamine signalling in the ventral striatum. We therefore hypothesised that, in humans, differences in glucose control would be associated with altered reward learning. \nMethods: To test this hypothesis, we recruited 48 participants from the general population, who each completed a glucose tolerance test, a monetary reward learning task known to relate to dopamine function, and mental health questionnaires. We fitted an established reinforcement learning model to the task data in order to obtain computational parameters characterising participants’ learning, and then examined the associations between these parameters and their glucose control. \nResults: We discovered that poorer glucose control was associated with greater reliance on recent rewards during learning which was, in turn, associated with higher depression symptoms. There was also more modest evidence for the association between glucose control and depression symptoms. \nConclusions: Together, our results identify a specific neurocognitive process, reward learning, by which metabolic information may influence cognition, and which may explain the link between metabolic diseases like type-2 diabetes and depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: Multi-informant assessments are central to adolescent mental health screening. However, parent and teacher reports are only moderately correlated. Understanding cross-contextual reporting patterns can help identify adolescent mental health and functioning problems. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 6,366), we examined parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems; prosocial behavior) at age 11 as predictors of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and school problems at ages 11 and 14. Response surface analysis was used to model reporting congruence and discrepancies, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and baseline outcomes in prospective analyses. Results: Parent reports were more consistent predictors of outcomes than teacher reports, yet teacher reports also contributed unique variance. Convergent reporting of higher SDQ scores predicted elevated depressive symptoms and school problems concurrently for all subscales and outcomes, but was less consistent prospectively. Yet discrepancies were also important. When parent-reported hyperactivity and prosociality exceeded teacher reports, adolescents reported higher concurrent depressive symptoms. These hyperactivity reporting discrepancies also predicted depressive symptoms at age 14. Conversely, when teacher ratings exceeded parent ratings of conduct problems, this predicted school problems at age 11. Conclusions: Overall, high parent-teacher concordance appears to signal persistent difficulties, while discrepancies may indicate emotional or school-specific challenges. While overall effect sizes were modest, both informants appear to provide complementary information, supporting multi-informant assessment to guide early identification and context-sensitive interventions.",

          "abstract": "Previous behavioral research has demonstrated that when given positive and negative cues (e.g., attend to blue vs ignore red), young and older adults are able to use this information to a similar extent. However, it is possible that older adults achieve similar behavioral performance via different cognitive and neural mechanisms. The current study aimed to test this question by examining the neural underpinnings of attentional filtering with age. Young and older adults were presented with either positive (target matching), negative (distractor matching), or neutral cues, which were immediately followed by a search array in which participants had to report the orientation of a search target. We found that both age groups appropriately attended to target information when given a target-matching pre-cue, as indicated by faster response times (RTs) and a significant N2pc event-related potential (ERP) related to increased attentional selection. However, only young adults showed suppression of distractors, as indicated by a significant distractor-positivity (PD) ERP following all three cue types. Older adults did not show significant suppression of distractors in any condition and, they even showed increased attention towards distractors following negative and neutral cues. Thus, although behavioral evidence suggests young and older adults seem to use negative cues similarly, neural evidence suggests that older adults are less able to suppress distractors following these cues.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons connected to the rise of the Internet and our current political environment, societies around the world are facing an existential crisis–a lack of empathy. Today, people are increasingly struggling to be empathetic to others in their communities and in society more broadly. In the current research we (a team of academic researchers and practitioners) attempt to tackle this problem of decreasing empathy by testing and evaluating a school-based intervention program developed by Narrative 4 in American high school classrooms (N=380, 10th and 11th graders) using an experimental approach (i.e., comparing Narrative 4 programming to a control condition). This 10-session program focused on building empathy, perspective taking, and active listening skills (among other skills) through narrative storytelling exercises. Results indicated the program was successful in promoting students’ reported empathy, perspective taking, curiosity to diverse ideas, and active listening skills as compared to the control condition. Additionally, this greater empathy led participants to report more pro-sociality (e.g., greater willingness to be civically engaged, more respect for others in their classroom and community more broadly) and less affective polarization towards those who disagree with them on politics. At the end of the program, participants also reported positive experiences with the program. Taken together, this research highlights the merits of Narrative 4 programming for promoting empathy and pro-sociality among high school students, the merits of academic and practitioner partnerships, and a promising narrative-based intervention for promoting empathy in society.",

          "abstract": "Divergent thinking (DT) tests are often used to estimate creative potential. They have sound theoretical bases, good reliability, and moderate predictive validity. One previous study that sampled gifted and nongifted children tested the interactions among DT indices (fluency, originality, and flexibility) in the predictive equation and reported a respectable validity coefficient of .59. Two meta-analyses have also supported the use of DT tests as estimates of creative potential, but neither of these examined interactions among the DT indices. The present correlational, group-comparison (N = 312) investigation (a) replicated the 1986 study and examined interactions among the three DT indices and (b) extended that research by using two newer criterion measures. One was the Creative Activity and Accomplishment Checklist (CAAC) which had been updated such that it includes scales for Technological, Athletic, and Everyday creativity, in addition to scales for Art, Science &amp; Math, Writing, and Music. The updated CAAC also used a new method for assessing the quality of creative accomplishment (in addition to the quantity of creative activity). A final novel feature of the present investigation was the use of a second criterion, one that was developed specifically for research on DT. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the fluency X originality and flexibility X originality interactions were significantly related to the Quantity of creativity activity score. Giftedness, fluency, and the fluency X originality interaction were significantly related to the Quality score. Canonical correlation analyses indicated a predictive validity of .73 (p &lt;.001) for the total sample. One clear conclusion is therefore that predictions from DT tests should take interactions into account. These findings are discussed in the context of theories which recognize creativity as an important part of giftedness and theories which suggest that several facets of DT need to be taken into account when assessing creative cognition.",

We additionally test interventions analogous to individual-level education versus institutional solutions to risk management: (1) improving understanding of the optimal strategies and (2) within-group coordination through voting.

          "abstract": "Diverse methods have been developed to quantify respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), including peak-valley, spectral analytic and moving-polynomial-filtering estimations. Although these three procedures were found—some 35 years ago—to provide functionally equivalent indices of RSA (Grossman, van Beek &amp; Wientjes, 1990), Lewis et al. (2012) attempted a partial replication of the earlier study in order to compare degree of agreement of these measures, as well as to examine the levels of influence of respiration and heart-period nonstationarity upon each RSA index. This paper continues to be both influential and controversial. However, several limitations in their report call several of the study’s conclusions into question : 1) The investigators failed to apply natural logarithm (ln) transformation to two of the three measures before pursuing subordinate analyses, even though the unaltered RSA estimates violate assumptions of normality and require ln transformation in order for inter-individual parametric statistics to be meaningful. 2) Instead of first comparing their own already ln-transformed measure (RSAp-b; derived from moving-polynomial detrending) with the other ln-transformed measures (peak-valley RSA and spectral-analysis-derived RSA), they mostly performed ln transformation of the latter measures only after already detrending each of these with their moving polynomial filter method. This sequence of analysis confounded the detrending procedure with the ln transformation and did not permit meaningful comparisons between their own moving-polynomial-filtered estimate and the other two. 3) Methods and findings of previous, highly pertinent studies were either misrepresented or not reported. 4) Instead of examining the critical issue of vulnerability of the different methods to violations of stationarity, evidence was simply presented that nonstationarity occurred in baseline time series of heart period and that detrending methods, as designed to perform and as expected, indeed, served to detrend the original time series. 5) The authors overinterpreted their findings regarding the correlations with and moderation by respiratory parameters. 6) Although the senior author performed analyses reported in a much earlier study that revealed very strong respiratory moderation of RSAp-b, these findings failed to be addressed in Lewis et al. (2012).",

Alienating ‘us-vs-them’ rhetoric was a particularly dominant predictor of both violent outcomes of manifestos and of perceived manipulative intent in online comments. Such rhetoric may be identified at scale using machine-learning models trained on accessible data, permitting the proactive identification of potentially harmful speech.",

          "authors": "Meijun Yao; Jeroen Vermunt; Kim De Roover",
          "abstract": "With growing availability of large-scale international surveys, social scientists are increasingly interested in comparing relations among latent variables, such as values and attitudes, across countries using Multigroup and Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling. However, these two methods either entail numerous pairwise comparisons or overemphasize the differences between groups, neglecting shared similarities. Mixture Multigroup Structural Equation Modeling (MMG-SEM) has recently been proposed as a novel alternative to identify clusters of groups with similar structural relations while accounting for measurement invariance and non-invariance. Despite its potential, practical guide for applying MMG-SEM to cross-national survey data remains limited. This study provides a step-by-step tutorial to address this gap, using the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 8 data to analyze climate change attitudes. Our results reveal cross-national differences and similarities in how human values influence climate policy support, and how these relations are mediated by climate change beliefs across 23 countries. The clustering patterns are primarily driven by the strength of self-transcendence and conservation effects, whereas self-enhancement effects remain weak and contribute little to distinguish between countries. In addition, the clustering results organize the countries into four types: value-driven but belief-cautious skeptics, value-driven and belief-amplifying advocates, paradoxical value-pathway actors, and value-detached pragmatists.",

          "abstract": "Adults have a semantically discretised, event-based perception of reality – such that events and goals are both hierarchically structured and have a beginning, middle and end. Here, we consider how we first develop the ability to parse reality hierarchically - as we learn, to use Plato’s phrase, to ‘carve nature at its joints’. Central to this process is the ability to make predictions on hierarchical timescales. We consider two aspects of predictability: first, the child’s passive capacity to use predictability to inform how they passively observe things as they happen; and second, children’s active capacity to generate predictable sequences of behaviour. We highlight two themes that are, we argue, common across both passive observation and active behaviour. First, flat (i.e. non-hierarchical) predictability initially increases over development – as shown for example by increases in perseveration – before decreasing as hierarchical predictability (i.e. nested, multi-level goals) increase.

          "abstract": "Retrieval stopping, the intentional suppression of unwanted memories, plays a critical role in emotion regulation and cognitive control, yet little is known about its function in adolescence. Using an autobiographical Think/No-Think paradigm, we investigated whether adolescents can control the retrieval of personal emotional events. Forty-nine adolescent participants (13-17) generated positive and negative autobiographical memories for retrieval or suppression in the Think/No-Think task. Memory accuracy and vividness were assessed before and after. Adolescents showed suppression-induced forgetting: negative memories were recalled less accurately and more slowly. Vividness ratings declined for suppressed memories, but not significantly more than negative baseline memories, suggesting a spill-over effect of retrieval stopping to all negative memories, rather than an effect confined to the suppressed negative memories. \nOverall, the results provide evidence that adolescents can intentionally suppress autobiographical emotional memories. These findings extend investigations in adults by showing inhibitory control over memory retrieval is functional during adolescence, a critical period for emotion regulation. The flexibility that the autobiographical TNT task offers allows it to be extended to fears or worries, offering a promising avenue for applied research. Future research should examine its potential as a scalable, low-cost supplement to therapy, supporting emotion regulation and mental health in youth.",

Emerging evidence also suggests that children’s math skills may influence changes in the HLE, pointing to potential transactional associations across development. Using a national longitudinal sample (N = 1,364), we employed random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling to examine transactional associations between the HLE and children’s math achievement from early childhood (54 months) to middle childhood (fifth grade), and from middle childhood to adolescence (age 15). Findings revealed that a more enriching HLE at each wave predicted higher math achievement in each ensuing wave. In turn, children’s math achievement was also prospectively associated with greater enrichment in the HLE over time. These findings underscore the dynamic interplay between children’s academic skills and their home environments and suggest that the HLE may serve as a modifiable target for interventions designed to support math achievement across development.",

          "abstract": "Many Americans distrust the government, are disillusioned with the political process, and don’t view voting as an effective form of political engagement. Such disillusionment is higher among young Americans, who are disproportionately underrepresented in government. Although voting is an essential action citizens can take to influence and reshape the government, the majority of youth don’t vote regularly. Youth face substantial structural and psychological barriers that interact in particular ways during emerging adulthood to create friction that reduces youth voting and perpetuates cycles of political disempowerment. Executive Order 14248 and the SAVE Act will create new barriers to voting by requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, which is expected to disproportionately affect youth who lack access to valid identification documents at higher rates than older Americans. In the face of mounting structural barriers, it is increasingly important to design effective interventions to motivate and support youth to vote. This commentary outlines a psychologically-informed approach to designing get-out-the-vote initiatives to help youth overcome psychological barriers. It describes the developmental context of emerging adulthood and the challenges and opportunities this period poses for voting, and how developmental factors interact with structural and psychological barriers to impede voting. It then reviews theory and research from psychology, communication, and political science to provide recommendations for creating developmentally appropriate, theory-based get-out-the-vote initiatives. It also describes participatory co-design approaches that can increase intervention effectiveness while also supporting youth civic identity development and democratic skill building.",

Thirty-eight parents reviewed paired reports written by a school psychologist about fictional children and provided written comments. Consistent with decades of research, traditional reports, written at college level, used technical language and test-by-test organization. Accessible reports, written at middle school level, employed plain language and thematic integration with scores moved to appendices. Thematic analysis of 52 comments identified four themes: difficult to understand and disempowering for traditional reports, accessible language and helpful organization and content for accessible reports. Parents described traditional reports as creating barriers to comprehension and participation through inaccessible terminology and fragmented presentation. Accessible reports enabled understanding and engagement through plain language and functional integration. These findings have direct implications for school psychology training and practice: replace traditional reports with accessible reports to better serve children and families.",

Study 1 will test relationships between in-game needs, needs in general, and subsequent play behavior, to assess whether gaming contributes to flourishing or compensation. Study 2 will examine the impact of late-night gaming on sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and wellbeing exploring whether chronotype (natural inclination to be more active and alert in the morning, as opposed to evening) moderates these relationships. Study 3 will test the relation between multi-platform playtime and wellbeing, and its potential moderation by game genre. Together, these studies will inform associations between play and psychological wellbeing in rare detail by using more granular digital trace data.",

          "abstract": "Background: Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAIs) have demonstrated therapeutic benefits across diverse clinical populations and settings. However, the underlying neurological and physiological mechanisms that produce these effects remain poorly understood. While previous research has examined physiological responses to human-animal interactions, there is limited integration of central nervous system processes with peripheral biomarkers, and most studies have focused predominantly on dog-assisted interventions.\n\nObjectives: This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence on both neural and physiological mechanisms underlying AAI effects. Specifically, we will integrate findings from neuroimaging studies (fMRI, EEG, NIRS) with physiological biomarker research (cortisol, oxytocin, heart rate, blood pressure) to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework. The review will examine interactions with diverse animal species across various clinical populations.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we will systematically search ProQuest, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases using three concept groups: animal intervention terms, neurological measurement terms, and physiological measurement terms. This review reports the results of a search conducted through March 2025. Inclusion criteria require peer-reviewed empirical studies in English that measure neurological or physiological outcomes from structured AAIs involving live animals. Studies using non-live animals, unstructured exposure, or non-empirical designs will be excluded. Data extraction will document measurement techniques, animal species, population characteristics, intervention parameters, and study outcomes.\n\nExpected Contributions: This review will provide the first comprehensive integration of central and peripheral biological mechanisms in AAI research, establish a theoretical framework connecting neural changes to physiological outcomes, identify promising mechanisms warranting further investigation, and inform evidence-based practice by clarifying how and why AAIs may be effective for specific populations and conditions.\n\nKeywords: Animal-assisted interventions, neuroscience, physiological mechanisms, stress, emotion regulation, oxytocin and cortisol",

          "authors": "Arnaud Wolff; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "Deception is common, yet lies are typically small and not easily spotted. The dominant explanations for why this is the case are psychological in nature, such that small lies are thought to allow individuals to maintain their self-concept or that individuals have a general preference for truth-telling. In this paper, we suggest that lies are typically small because small lies allow individuals to retrieve benefits associated with lying while preventing punishment from interaction partners. We present two game-theoretic models in which agents are incentivized to misreport private information. In a two-player game, we show that the equilibrium size of the lie is predicted to be smaller when the reputational costs of lying are larger, and smaller when the state of the world is more observable. In a three-player game, we show that lies can remain stable in group settings provided that the equilibrium size of the lie is small enough, so that the sender retains plausible deniability about lying. A unique and central prediction of our models is that biased self-presentation will be modulated by the degree of observability of the trait. We review the empirical literature on positive illusions, and argue that the findings support this prediction. We propose that the aversion to lying observed in laboratory experiments reflects the workings of a psychology well-adapted to the incentive structure of natural environments and suggest that models of human social behavior should focus on capturing relevant parameters from such environments.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal relationships are among the most essential yet fragile aspects of human life, and recent advances in dual-brain stimulation provide a unique opportunity to causally probe and modulate their neural underpinnings. While prior work has linked interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) to relationship quality, its causal contribution to long-term relational outcomes remains unclear. Here, we present the first application of dual-brain transcranial alternating current stimulation (hyper-tACS) to social bonding, specifically targeting romantic partners, with a focus on the temporal dissociation between neural and behavioral effects. Across six consecutive days of intervention, active hyper-tACS induced clear increases in prefrontal IBS immediately after stimulation, yet these neural gains did not translate into concurrent improvements in subjective relationship satisfaction. Mediation analyses further showed that individual differences in IBS increases mediated the effect of baseline IBS on relationship improvement, suggesting that behavioral benefits rely on neural alignment consolidating over time. At a one-year follow-up, the active group exhibited a substantially lower breakup rate relative to sham controls. These findings provide causal evidence for a delayed effect of dual-brain stimulation, in which neural changes precede and gradually consolidate into durable relational benefits. Together, this work provides the first causal evidence that dual-brain stimulation can be extended from motor coordination to the social domain, advancing mechanistic accounts of intimacy and highlighting hyper-tACS as a translational tool for strengthening long-term relationship stability.",

Prospective clinical studies jointly examin-ing daily ADHD symptoms, medication use, sleep, and perceived stress across the menstrual cycle are lacking.\nAims\n(1) To test whether ADHD symptoms, functional impairment, and medication use differ between follicular and late luteal phases; (2) to examine whether sleep quality and perceived stress predict next-day symptoms and impairment, and whether these associations vary by cycle phase.\nMethod\nNaturally cycling adult females with ADHD (N = 125) completed a digital daily diary throughout their menstrual cycle. Last-night sleep quality was reported at 09:00 am, while evening entries assessed ADHD symptom clusters (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), functional impairment, perceived stress, and ADHD-specific medication use. \nResults\nAll symptom clusters – including inattention (Estimate = 0.14, 95% CI [0.08, 0.21]), hyperactivity (Estimate = 0.16, 95% CI [0.09, 0.22]), and impulsivity (Estimate = 0.19, 95% CI [0.12, 0.26]) – and functional impairment (Estimate = 0.20, 95% CI [0.13, 0.27]) increased towards the late luteal phase. Compared to the follicular phase, par-ticipants took more medication during the late luteal phase (OR = 1.89, 95% CI [1.88, 1.90]). Sleep quality was lower (Estimate = -0.17, CI [-0.30, -0.05]) and perceived stress higher (Estimate = 0.12, CI [0.03, 0.20]) during the late luteal phase. Lower average sleep quality and higher average perceived stress were associated with higher symptom severity regardless of cycle phase. However, day-to-day changes in these factors did not predict next-day symptoms.\nConclusions\nFemales with ADHD appear to exhibit late-luteal-phase vulnerability marked by in-creased symptom burden and potential cycle-phase-specific variation in perceived medication need. Findings support the need for cycle-sensitive diagnostics, consid-eration of the menstrual cycle in therapy planning and paying attention to trait-like sleep and perceived stress profiles when personalizing care.",

Children’s language skills were measured directly during the lab visit and via parent-report at 24 months. Results showed that frequency of parents’ ‘play monitoring’ – jointly looking to an object with their child and briefly looking to their object-focused child – positively predicted children’s language skills at 15- to 18- and 24 months. Referential labelling during children’s sustained attention to objects also predicted receptive language.

          "abstract": "Morality is deeply rooted in the context of relationships. Yet the influence of relational factors, such as attachment, on moral concerns remains largely unexplored. Nonetheless, recent scholarship has shed some light on the connection between attachment and moral considerations. To extend this understanding, the current study seeks to investigate whether relationship-specific attachment dimensions, specifically anxiety and avoidance, predict Haidt’s moral foundations—care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and purity/degradation. After receiving ethics approval, a convenience sample of 468 individuals was recruited via the research team's social media networks. Participants completed an online survey, comprising questionnaires covering demographics, morality, personality, and attachment. Following data cleaning, 254 participants (61% female, 38% male) ranging from 18 to 74 years of age (Mean = 33.9, SD = 13.9), were included in the final analysis. First, correlational analysis was conducted, followed by several hierarchical multiple regression analyses, yielding significant results. Specifically, higher attachment anxiety with mother predicted greater moral concerns about authority, while higher attachment anxiety with father predicted greater concerns about harm and lower concerns about fairness. In contrast, higher attachment avoidance with mother predicted lower concerns about authority, whereas higher attachment avoidance with father predicted greater concerns about fairness. Friendship and romantic attachment dimensions did not predict moral foundations. Overall, our findings suggest that parental attachment may influence moral considerations, hinting at the potential origins of moral diversity in early attachment relationships.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between early-life vaccine scheduling intensity and autism prevalence across 12 high-income countries, with implications for both public health and psychological well-being. Beyond epidemiological patterns, the analysis considers potential societal and developmental dimensions relevant to psychological sciences, such as parental risk perception, trust in health systems, and stress associated with intensive immunization schedules. Using a cross-national ecological dataset from countries with comparable healthcare systems and diagnostic standards, we applied descriptive statistics, partial correlations (controlling for overall vaccination coverage), and multivariate regression models. Countries were grouped by autism prevalence: higher-rate nations (USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore) averaged 15 vaccine types and 20 doses for infants ≤1 year, while lower-rate nations (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, UK) averaged 8 vaccines and 9 doses. Partial correlations revealed strong positive associations between autism prevalence and both vaccine types (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001) and doses (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.01). Regression analysis indicated that a 1% increase in vaccine types corresponded to a 0.47% increase in autism prevalence (p = 0.001), explaining 81% of variance. These findings are statistically significant but do not establish causality. Instead, they highlight patterns warranting further investigation into neurodevelopmental trajectories and psychosocial factors influencing parental decision-making. The results suggest that more gradual vaccine schedules, as observed in countries with lower autism prevalence, may merit consideration in future research and policy discussions to optimize developmental outcomes, reduce parental anxiety, and maintain high immunization coverage.",

We manipulate the proposal's party and the justification they provide in a 2 × 3 between subjects experiment (total N = 5,008). Our experiments replicate well-known effects of partisan bias in support for the subversion of democracy: respondents in both the US and Poland are more tolerant of subversion when it is initiated by their in-party. However, respondents are surprisingly resistant to justifications, especially in the high external validity design implemented in the US. Even in Poland where we ``forced\" respondents to pay attention to the justifications, support for subversion is increased only among in-partisans and not by much.

          "abstract": "Background: Common and distinct features of personality disorders (PDs) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have long been the focus of research. However, most studies relied on categorical rather than dimensional models, which are becoming increasingly integrated into contemporary psychiatric nosology and may offer more nuanced insights. To date, no study has examined the common structure of dimensional PD, according to the alternative DSM-5 model for PDs (personality functioning and pathological personality traits), and ADHD.\n\nMethods: In a preregistered study, a sample of adults seeking mental health support (n = 2,567) completed self-report measures assessing personality functioning, pathological personality traits (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism, and anankastia), and ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and executive functioning). Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the latent structure and shared variance among these constructs using confirmatory and exploratory factor models, including models with a general factor.\n\nResults: ADHD components showed strong correlations with personality functioning and moderate-to-strong associations with pathological personality traits, particularly disinhibition. Disinhibition remained the only trait domain substantially correlated with ADHD after control-ling for a general personality pathology factor. In exploratory models, ADHD components showed two distinct loading patterns among disinhibition facets: one factor was mainly defined by inattention and distractibility, with additional but weaker loadings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, whereas the other reflected executive functioning and irresponsibility.\n\nConclusion: The findings suggest that ADHD has substantial overlap with dimensional PD. Clinically, individuals with ADHD may benefit from integrated assessments of personality functioning and pathological personality traits, and from interventions addressing personality pathology.",

We identified and synthesized the existing literature examining the links between adolescent personality (aged 10-25 years) and any outcome in older adulthood (aged 60+). \nBased on 33 studies (Ntotal=102,650 participants), adolescent personality predicted interindividual differences across numerous late-life outcomes, including health (e.g., longevity, diabetes), cognition (e.g., dementia, memory), and socioeconomic and psychological measures (e.g., financial security, wellbeing). Notably, meta-analysis shows that adolescents higher in conscientiousness were at decreased risk of dying over the subsequent decades (HR=0.949, 95%CI[0.921, 0.978], k=5). Our review further emphasizes the influential role of midlife educational attainment on the links between adolescent personality and late-life outcomes. \nPersonality assessment is simple, time- and cost-efficient, scalable, and could be integrated into school evaluations or medical check-ups during adolescence. Personality research provides opportunities to guide lifespan health policies by identifying individuals who may benefit most from lifestyle interventions, and by scaffolding risk-stratification strategies to promote healthy aging.",

          "abstract": "Homicide peer support (PS) has seen an increase over the last 10 years in the UK and yet there has been little research into how it impacts individuals bereaved by homicide. Homicide is considered one, if not the most devastating forms of traumatic grief and is often comorbid with symptoms of PTSD and MDD. Engagement in bereavement PS has proven effective in mediating symptoms of traumatic grief, however, most research is limited to suicide bereavement. The current study aims to further the field of homicide PS by thematically analyzing secondary data in the way of five semi-structured interviews held by Victim Support (https://www.victimsupport.org.uk ) Peer Support team. Two themes and three sub themes were the result of analysis; Theme one ‘Peer support; Belonging, Empowerment and Hope’ and theme two ‘Isolation and Time; 1) `isolation felt by homicide bereavement, 2) social expectation of grief, 3) Homicides impact on sense of time and benefits of peer support. These themes were concurrent with existing research regarding traumatic grief PS as were impacts of positive wellbeing. Results differed from previous research in alleviation of isolation; however, homicide PS was seen to help individuals manage such feelings. The research highlights the need for more mixed method analysis into effects of homicide PS on traumatic grief as results indicate the occurrence of hope held mitigating factors against traumatic grief symptoms. Overall, the study was successful as it elucidated how PS impacts traumatic grief in those bereaved by homicide.",

          "abstract": "As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns have emerged about growing dependency on AI and its potential psychological and behavioral consequences. The present research develops and validates the Generative AI Dependency Scale, a multidimensional tool developed to assess individual differences in dependency on generative AI systems. Across six studies involving 1333 participants from the United States and Singapore, the Generative AI Dependency Scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including a stable three-factor structure (cognitive preoccupation, negative consequences, withdrawal), good internal consistency (α = .92–.93), and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .87). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a higher-order dependency construct, and scalar measurement invariance was established across sex and cultures. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through associations with an existing AI addiction scale and the Big Five personality traits respectively. Generative AI dependency was also significantly associated with a range of motivational (e.g., lower basic psychological need satisfaction, greater fear of missing out), behavioral (e.g., increased procrastination and cognitive failures, lower task performance and critical thinking), and psychological (e.g., reduced self-concept clarity, greater loneliness) outcomes. Framed within Goodman's behavioral dependency framework and self-determination theory, these findings suggest that generative AI dependency reflects not merely excessive technology use, but a deeper misalignment between psychological needs and the strategies employed to meet them. The Generative AI Dependency Scale offers a psychometrically robust foundation for future research into the impacts of generative AI, with implications for responsible AI design and use.",

The findings indicate that students possess the capacity to differentiate between the measured dimensions and correctly interpret the questionnaire items. However, the severity of their responses exhibits considerable variability.

Without observable consequences, the affective rewards of giving are muted, limiting their potential to reinforce the donor's generosity and encourage additional donations. Building on the theoretical advances that conceptualize moral learning as a reinforcement learning process, we tested whether and how the presentation of impact information about previous donations influences the affective experience of the previous donation and the effectiveness of the person's subsequent charitable giving. Our results showed that providing impact feedback increased subsequent donations by 14% and modestly increased warm glow. These findings suggest that making the consequences of giving more visible can help reinforce generosity in ways that sustain support for effective programs. In this context, donors' feelings of satisfaction of making an impact can both signal and reinforce shifts in future moral motivation.",

          "abstract": "The niche-picking principle has been proposed to explain stabilization in personality development and personality continuity of adult. The niche-picking principle posits that the reciprocal exchange between people and their environments -- person-environment transaction -- serve to maintain trait continuity, thereby preserving rank-order stability of trait differences. To date, however, no longitudinal twin study has directly tested whether reciprocal effects between people and their environments contribute to trait continuity in middle and older adulthood. Using a sample of twins from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA), we tested whether the niche-picking principle explained stability of longitudinal within-family differences in neuroticism, extraversion, and openness across two stages of adulthood development. Genetic simplex models that include a reciprocal effects (i.e., phenotype-environment covariance) parameter were fit to twins' longitudinal data. Results suggest that the niche-picking principle partly explains continuity of neuroticism and openness in middle adulthood whereas it partly explains continuity of neuroticism and extraversion in older adulthood. Stable genetic and unique environmental variance also explained continuity of each trait. Findings partially support lifespan developmental theories that posit that people adapt to and possibly optimize behaviors to sustain existing traits. We discuss the importance of the reciprocal exchange between people and their environments across the lifespan and how these exchanges might shift to support trait continuity.",

This study investigates the feasibility of developing a Real-Time Adaptive Procedure System that uses machine learning to understand procedural deviations and adapt procedures dynamically in high-risk industrial settings.\nData were collected from eight workers performing three tasks at a high-fidelity petrochemical facility. Using the Skip-Order-Action framework, researchers documented procedural deviations by comparing observed behavior against prescribed procedures across 507 procedural steps. A logistic regression model was developed using features from the Multi-disciplinary Interactive Behavior Triad framework, including participant characteristics, step-level attributes derived from abstraction hierarchy levels and cognitive performance modeling, and real-time indicators such as timestamps and eye-tracking data.\nThe model using step-level and participant-level features achieved relatively better performance (F1 = 0.49, AUC = 0.82), outperforming baseline models (F1 = 0.14-0.23). Adding real-time indicators reduced performance (F1 = 0.38), suggesting challenges in integrating real-time behavioral data.\nThis proof-of-concept demonstrates that procedural deviations follow patterns based on task characteristics and worker attributes. The study establishes empirical foundations for machine learning-driven procedural adaptation and proposes a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between prescribed and actual work through adaptive systems rather than compliance monitoring, representing a paradigm shift toward learning-oriented procedural systems in high-risk industries.",

          "abstract": "Background\nClinical evaluation of language abilities is central to diagnosing impairments in neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions, such as brain injuries, Parkinson’s disease, or schizophrenia. However, assessment tools predominantly target structural and semantic aspects of language, while pragmatic and communicative abilities remain underrepresented, despite consistent evidence of their vulnerability across clinical populations. This gap is largely due to the scarcity of standardized and rapid tools for pragmatic assessment and the inherent difficulty of measuring context-dependent communicative abilities\n\nAim\nThis study aimed to develop and validate the German adaptation of the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates Brief (APACS Brief-De), a 10-minute screening tool originally created in Italian, assessing discourse production and comprehension of non-literal language, to enable reliable and time-efficient evaluation of pragmatics in German-speaking contexts.\n\nMethods\nAdopting a culturally sensitive translation approach, a standard and a multiple choice APACS Brief-De were developed, each with an alternate form to allow for repeated assessments, which were administered remotely in a sample of healthy German-speaking adults.\n\nResults\nThe APACS Brief-De Multiple Choice showed good consistency, reliability, validity, and equivalence between forms. Age and global cognitive performance significantly influenced pragmatic scores. The comparisons with the Italian standard form confirmed statistical equivalence, underscoring the robustness of the tool across languages. Age- and education-adjusted normative cut-off scores are provided for clinical interpretation.\n\nConclusions\nAPACS Brief-De offers a rapid and valid tool for assessing the global pragmatic profile, well-suited for integration into routine clinical practice, and represents a significant step toward crosslinguistic standardization of pragmatic assessment.",

          "abstract": "Ruminative brooding is marked by its perseverative nature. Existing mechanistic theories attribute this to cognitive control deficits linked to elevated functional connectivity within the default mode network and abnormal prefrontal activity. Here, we conceptualize ruminative brooding as an emergent property of a neural attractor state within the default mode network. Stable attractors are mathematically defined by two key properties: 1) convergence over time (assessing attractivity), and 2) resistance to perturbation (assessing stability). We tested whether brain states associated with brooding exhibited these properties in healthy volunteers using EEG during a task-switching protocol that interleaved cued rumination, working memory, and autobiographical memory tasks. Since cued rumination and working memory are thought to engage anticorrelated networks (default mode vs. central executive), switching from cued rumination to working memory effectively “perturbs” this system. Cued rumination was associated with beta power in the posterior cingulate cortex, with rumination disengagement marked by a reduction in beta power in posterior parietal and cingulate cortices. Moreover, high trait rumination was associated with impaired disengagement of these rumination-related dynamics and reduced recruitment of the dlPFC when transitioning from cued rumination to the working memory task, consistent with the “resistance to perturbation” criterion of a stable attractor. Furthermore, trait brooding was positively associated with a reduction in variance in posterior parietal and cingulate cortices time series over the course of cued rumination trials, consistent with the “convergence” criterion. These results provide support for framing brooding-related neural dynamics as pathological attractor states, providing a mechanistic account of rumination’s perseverative quality.",

          "abstract": "Sustained attention is notoriously difficult to maintain over time, with attentional lapses emerging rapidly during prolonged tasks. Motivation has been identified as a key factor in reducing these lapses and enhancing task engagement. According to recent accounts such as the goal competition hypothesis, the perceived benefit associated with a goal helps sustain its active representation in working memory. These benefits can arise from the prospect of gaining a reward, avoiding a penalty, or both. However, it remains unclear whether avoiding a penalty—or the combination of penalty and reward— improved sustained goal maintenance to the same extent as pursuing a reward alone. To address this question, we recruited 30 participants to complete a Continuous Performance Task (CPT) in which the type of benefit associated with the goal varied every 20 trials (reward, penalty, both, or no benefit). Replicating prior findings, we observed that rewards reduced attentional lapses compared to a no-benefit baseline. Avoiding penalties and combining both incentives also improved sustained attention, though the penalty condition was less effective than the combined condition. This suggests that while any perceived benefit can support goal maintenance, the motivational mechanisms may differ depending on the type of benefit—particularly when avoiding penalties alone.",

          "abstract": "Preclinical studies suggest that fasting may attenuate spontaneous pain and pain-related behaviors, such as licking and paw withdrawal, during inflammation in animals; however, evidence of the analgesic effects of fasting in patients suffering from chronic pain remains inconclusive. In two studies, we investigated the potentially protective effects of fasting on the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in healthy human volunteers following experimentally induced sensitization of nociceptive fibers through painful cutaneous electrical stimulation. In the first experiment (N = 33), participants underwent the painful electrical stimulation protocol twice: once after a 12-hour fast and once after consuming a standard breakfast. In a follow-up experiment (N = 52), participants were randomized to receive either the painful electrical stimulation protocol after a 16-hour fast or after their usual morning meal. In both experiments, we assessed the intensity, unpleasantness, and spatial extent of secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, as well as emotional state and hunger levels. Fasting increased hunger and negative affect in both studies. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, participants in the fasted condition reported significantly less mechanical hypersensitivity compared to the breakfast condition. In both experiments, fasting did not reduce the pain intensity reported during the painful electrical stimulation. These findings provide behavioral evidence that a 16-hour fast may reduce the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. These results in humans align with preclinical evidence showing that fasting affects mechanical hypersensitivity, without necessarily affecting the perceived intensity of acute painful stimuli. Our findings suggest that metabolic state may modulate mechanical hypersensitivity in humans.",

          "abstract": "Fluid intelligence, often assessed through abstract reasoning tasks, is typically assumed to rely on deliberative, effortful problem solving. However, recent findings within the dual-process framework of reasoning suggest an alternative possibility: individuals with higher intelligence may generate correct responses intuitively, without engaging in deliberation. To test this “smart intuitor” hypothesis, we conducted two studies using a two-response paradigm. Participants solved abstract reasoning matrices, first providing an initial response under time pressure and concurrent cognitive load to minimize deliberation, followed by a final response without such constraints. Results consistently showed that although correct final responses were primarily achieved through corrective deliberation, a substantial number of correct answers were already produced during the initial intuitive stage. Notably, over 20% of sound reasoners produced consistently correct intuitive responses and qualified as “smart intuitors.” These findings suggest that while deliberation remains the dominant route to correct abstract reasoning, it is not the only one. Intuition can also support successful performance on abstract reasoning tasks, at least for a subset of individuals. Our results call for a broader conception of fluid intelligence—one that recognizes the contributions of both reflective and intuitive processes.",

Investigating individual attitudes and responses to organized crime poses ethical and methodological challenges, especially in real-world settings. In this Perspective article, we argue that immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers a promising tool to overcome these challenges and promote positive changes in civic attitudes and behaviors. We suggest that exposing participants to mafia-related scenarios in IVR environments—while recording psychophysiological and brain data—can reveal both implicit and explicit markers of cognitive and emotional responses to criminal activity. Additionally, we discuss the Proteus effect, i.e., the behavioral change an individual undergoes based on the characteristics of their avatar and illustrate how embodying virtual characters with morally salient traits may foster civic resistance. IVR can thus serve both as a means to understand the psychophysiological underpinnings of responses to organized crime and as a tool to build resilience, supporting the development of targeted, evidence-based strategies that enhance public engagement and ethical action.",

Cognitive psychologists traditionally study explicit memory in episodic and semantic forms. However, juror decision making researchers emphasize narrative models in which jurors evaluate how realistic the proposed story is compared to real world events. To assess how perceived realism and explicit recall affect juror decisions, jury-eligible subjects (N = 83) read mock criminal cases, rating the strength of each case. Participants also reported their ability to recall a similar case (autobiographical recall), their knowledge of similar cases (factual recall), and the perceived realism of the case. Perceived realism was the most influential component of mock-juror decisions. Additional analyses identified two contributions of perceived realism: a common factor combining realism with memory recall and an independent factor. These findings support the hypothesis that complex decisions rely on perceived realism based on memory retrieval.",

Data were analyzed using a three-level mixed-effects meta-regression model, accounting for effect non-independence and key moderators such as retention intervals, warnings, overall test performance, and study characteristics. \nResults. \nAnalyzing data from 432 studies and 1,764 effect sizes across 51,845 participants, the average size of the misinformation effect was substantial, g = 0.659, 95% [0.196, 1.122], indicating a robust overall effect across studies. There was considerable variation across different conditions (total σ2 = 0.723, I2 = 91.78%). Consistent with previous findings, accuracy for the control condition was strongly positively associated with the size of the misinformation effect. Post-misinformation warnings were found to reduce the misinformation effect. Additionally, post-event testing, contrary to previous findings on retrieval-enhanced suggestibility, did not significantly moderate the misinformation effect.\nDiscussion. \nThe present analysis supports the conclusion that the misinformation effect is a reliable phenomenon, driven by a mixture of memory-related mechanisms as well as mechanism related to how participants strategize when responding to tests of different formats. Additionally, given the substantial heterogeneity we observed, we argue that the misinformation effect might be usefully conceptualized as a constellation of related phenomena, rather than a single coherent effect.",

          "authors": "Lisa Peters; Anna Gawthorpe; gemma goldenberg; Sam Wass",
          "abstract": "From call-and-response sequences to daily routines, predictability is an essential but under-appreciated aspect of everyday learning environments. This article reviews the existing literature on why predictability in educational settings, marked by stability and rhythm, supports learning and development. Previous research shows that young children develop an understanding of the world through interactions with their environment; based on what they already know or believe, they then make predictions about what will happen next. This allows for allostasis, which involves proactive changes to stress-response systems to meet anticipated future demands. At a fine-grained level, brains operate by generating and testing predictions. We learn best at an intermediate level of predictability – known as the Goldilocks zone. But for younger brains, with little prior experience, even simple, structured environments can appear unpredictable. Exposure to unpredictable environments triggers a stress response within the sympathoadrenal-medullary axis. Children who experience unpredictable home environments can often have an overactive stress response. This article aims to address a gap in our current understanding of education by applying insights from neuroscience to offer practical recommendations for educators to support healthy development and improve learning outcomes.",

Vegans often experience emotional strain due to heightened exposure to the suffering of animals, a phenomenon termed \"vystopia.\" Given the rising rates of veganism in the West, this is likely to be an increasingly salient concern. However, there are no validated measures to assess vystopia. In this study, we developed and validated an 8-item Vystopia Scale in a sample of 997 vegan participants. The model fit a single factor, had high internal consistency values (α = .93, ω = .94), and converged well with several measures of negative affect and concerns about animal rights. Strict measurement invariance was established across genders (men and women), and women reported significantly higher levels of vystopia compared to men. The Vystopia Scale offers a valuable tool for further research on vystopia and its impact on the well-being of vegans.",

          "abstract": "Episodes of extreme alcohol binge-drinking can result in memory loss, transient anterograde amnesic experiences known as memory blackouts (MBO). The current study investigates whether recognition memory is impacted by frequency of blackout experiences, and if false memories are more likely for those who regularly experience blackouts (n = 29) in comparison to a control group (n = 24) who had never experienced an MBO. Participants completed a recognition memory paradigm (a modified DRM task: Roediger &amp; McDermott, (1995)), with a follow-up remember/know/guess judgement, before-alcohol and after-alcohol in the same testing session, while the MBO group (n = 23) additionally completed the task in a subsequent testing session within 20-hours of a blackout, but when sober again. Both groups displayed reduced discrimination (d’) between old and new words and a more conservative response strategy after-alcohol, which remained for MBO participants after-MBO. Critical lure words elicited more false-alarms than weakly related or unrelated words, yet the overall frequency of false-alarms dropped after-alcohol and remained depressed after blackout for the MBO group. Critically, decile analysis revealed significant shifts in d’ for early deciles (1st-6th), suggesting impairment to recognition memory after-MBO; severity of individual MBO experiences may impact these results, although it is not possible to attribute them solely to blackout events. Future work should investigate whether adults with a longer history of alcohol-induced memory blackout experiences display an impairment in recollection and familiarity, or show atypical false memory acceptance rates.",

          "abstract": "Despite the growing attention to metacognition in education, little is known about how in-service teachers monitor the reliability of their own professional knowledge. This study investigates teachers’ metacognitive sensitivity and efficiency in evaluating educational claims. Drawing on a large-scale dataset of confidence-rated responses to a questionnaire on educational misconceptions, we estimated metacognitive metrics based on Signal Detection Theory, including meta-d′ and M-ratio. At the group level, teachers showed moderate ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect items (d′ = 0.62) and some insight into the accuracy of their judgments (meta-d′ = 0.53), but their metacognitive efficiency was suboptimal (M-ratio = 0.62). Generalized linear mixed models revealed that metacognitive calibration varied systematically by gender and educational stage. These findings suggest that metacognitive monitoring is shaped by contextual and professional factors, rather than being uniformly distributed across the teaching population. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the persistence of educational misconceptions.",

          "authors": "Andrew MacAskill",
          "abstract": "Many of the most important variables guiding behaviour, such as reward contingency, spatial location or contextual state, cannot be measured directly. Animals must instead infer them from noisy, incomplete information, a process termed ‘hidden state inference’. This requires combining internally generated estimates with incoming evidence to produce accurate beliefs about the world that guide behaviour. While computational frameworks can describe this process in formal terms, its implementation in the brain remains unclear. Here, we propose that the compartmentalised dendritic architecture of CA1 pyramidal neurons provides a biophysically grounded mechanism for performing the core operations of hidden state inference. In this framework, apical dendrites encode internally generated state estimates, tuft dendrites encode evidence from sensory and contextual inputs, and their nonlinear interaction produces an updated state estimate. Structured heterogeneity in dendritic properties across neurons would naturally generate a population code capable of representing graded belief strength, uncertainty, and multiple competing hypotheses. We illustrate how this scheme can account for CA1 function in both reversal learning and spatial navigation, and suggest that similar dendritic principles may operate more widely across brain regions. This perspective links cellular physiology to high level cognitive computation, and yields concrete, testable predictions for how dendritic integration supports adaptive behaviour in dynamic environments.",

          "abstract": "Semantic cognition (use of acquired world knowledge to guide behaviour) is critical in everyday life. Semantic cognition is often assumed to be preserved in later life, compensating for functional declines in other cognitive domains. However, aging research rarely considers age-related effects on non-verbal knowledge or on semantic control processes that regulate how knowledge is activated and used. We addressed this by conducting the most detailed assessment of semantic cognition across the adult lifespan to date, involving 537 UK adults aged between 20 and 91. Verbal semantic knowledge increased linearly across adulthood while non-verbal knowledge reached a plateau at age 60. In contrast, controlled semantic processing showed age-related decline, particularly in the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant semantic knowledge. These results indicate that semantic cognition is not uniformly preserved in old age: though older people know more than young people, they are less able to use their knowledge flexibly in novel situations.",

Analyses of psychometric functions indicated that participants accepted shorter gaps and made riskier crossing decisions when the vehicle source intensity was lower compared to higher. This effect of source intensity occurred in both an auditory-only and an audio-visual condition, though it was stronger when only auditory information was available. Analyses of the trial-by-trial data showed that the vehicle sound intensity at the moment of the crossing decision was the most important predictor of the decisions in the auditory-only condition. In the audio-visual condition, sound intensity also was significantly associated with the crossing decision, but visual cues dominated. Implications for road traffic safety are discussed, specifically in relation to interactions between pedestrians and electric vehicles.",

Here, we examined whether memory palace valence influences neutral information recall. We found that participants who applied MOL using a negatively valenced palace (N=33) outperformed participants who applied MOL using a positively valenced palace (N=34) and participants in a non-MOL control group (N=31) on a free-response semantic memory recall test. Furthermore, participants who perceived the negative palace more negatively or positive palace more positively exhibited greater recall accuracy, but overall, the negative group outperformed the positive group. These findings highlight that memory palaces can be constructed to optimize loci-dependent memory accuracy, providing new evidence-based strategies to improve memorization.",

This multi-method study examines risk and protective factors linked to suicidal ideation and attempts among bi+ youth. Quantitative survey data came from Dutch bi+ youth aged 16-22 years old (M age = 18.71, SD = 1.83). We conducted logistic regression on lifetime suicidal ideation (N = 1275) and attempts (N = 1274), including risk and protective factors, as well as interaction effects between sexual orientation, gender identity and risk/protective factors. To contextualize the quantitative findings, 15 interviews with bi+ youth with a history of suicidality were conducted and thematically analyzed. Quantitatively, experienced stigmatization and binegativity-related prejudice were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Enhanced social support, support-seeking coping, and resilience were linked with a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation. Associations between erasure, binegativity, distraction-seeking, and bi+ community connectedness and suicidality varied by sexual identity. Qualitatively, experienced stigmatization and binegativity-related prejudice involved peers perceiving bi+ youth as ‘strange,’ sexualizing their identities, and assuming an incapability of having stable relationships. Findings highlight the need for inclusive mental health interventions that address the challenging experiences of bi+ youth, and improve protective factors such as social support, coping strategies, and resilience.\nKeywords: bi+ youth, LGBT, minority stress, protective factors, suicidality",

While classical economic games have provided important insights into cooperation and competition, they typically rely on discrete, turn-based decisions that fail to capture the fluid and reciprocal nature of real-world social interactions. The present study used a novel transparent Dyadic Interaction Platform and a novel Cooperation–Competition Foraging task to examine how the interpersonal personality traits agency and communion shape dynamic, real-time social behavior. In this task, pairs of participants (dyads) jointly or individually collected targets with variable payoffs, allowing cooperative and competitive strategies to emerge naturally as both partners continuously observed each other’s gaze, actions, and outcomes. Using a round-robin design, we assessed how interpersonal traits and partner-specific adaptations jointly predicted dyadic strategic outcomes. Within each session, dyads gradually converged toward stable interaction modes, with increasing cooperation across sessions. Higher mean communion within dyads predicted enhanced cooperation, indicating that shared affiliative tendencies promote jointly oriented behavior. Additionally, behavior in each session was significantly influenced by prior dyadic history, indicating experience-dependent adaptation. These findings demonstrate that continuous, transparent interaction paradigms reveal how stable personality traits and dynamic partner feedback jointly shape social strategies. By linking personality traits from the Interpersonal Circumplex to behavioral adaptations, this study contributes to bridging the gap between traditional game-theory approaches and ecologically valid models of real-world social decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Why do children sometimes include the pieces of broken things when asked to count (e.g., “Count the forks”)? In five experiments, we test two ideas: (1) that adults, but not children, exclude parts from counts by reasoning that speakers must only be interested in whole objects with functions that fulfill desired goals, and (2) that only adults exclude parts on the basis of a Gricean inference, on which it is assumed that if a speaker wanted parts to be counted, they would say so. In Experiments 1-3, we find that although children and adults are somewhat less likely to count pieces of objects when speaker goals are explicitly mentioned, large developmental differences remain unexplained. In Experiments 4-5, we provide evidence that children differ most from adults when pieces are presented in the presence of complementary parts (with which they together would form a whole), and that these pieces are significantly more likely to be conceptualized and labeled as “parts”, especially by adults. Together, these findings suggest that adults – but not children – are more likely to exclude broken parts from their counts in response to requests like “Count the forks!” when they are also able to understand that more informative requests could have been made (e.g., “Count the pieces of fork!”).",

          "abstract": "This study explores how religious and spiritual leaders across different faith factions in Nigeria (Pentecostal, Islamic, Catholic, Syncretic, and Traditional) understand, interpret, and respond to mental illness. While mental illness is increasingly recognized as a global health concern, in Nigeria it is often perceived through spiritual and moral frameworks that shape how communities explain and treat psychological distress. Using a qualitative design grounded in Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis, five spiritual leaders were interviewed to capture their beliefs about the nature, causes, and treatment of mental illness.\nFindings revealed that all participants viewed mental illness as both a spiritual and psychological condition. Although they acknowledged biological and social causes such as trauma, stress, and substance abuse, spiritual explanations including demonic attack, ancestral curses were dominant. Healing was described as a holistic process combining prayer, fasting, ritual purification, and, increasingly, medical treatment. This integration of faith and science challenges the misconception that African religious leaders reject psychiatry. However, moral interpretations often reinforce stigma, linking mental illness to sin or spiritual weakness.\nThe study concludes that religious leaders occupy a critical position in Nigeria’s mental health space, serving as both gatekeepers and potential collaborators. It recommends faith–health partnerships, interfaith education programs, and the inclusion of mental health literacy in religious and theological training. Overall, the research highlights that improving mental health outcomes in Nigeria requires a culturally grounded approach that bridges spirituality and science, recognizing faith not as an obstacle but as a vital resource in promoting psychological well-being.\nKeywords: Mental illness, religion, spirituality, culture, Nigeria, qualitative research, Braun and Clarke, faith-based healing",

We introduce a novel, online cognitive intervention—rooted in Dialectical Behavior Therapy—to reduce psychological reactivity and promote resilient cooperation. In a randomized controlled online trial (N = 318), participants played a Repeated Trust Game against an HMM-based adaptive agent trained on human data, ensuring dynamic, human-like responses under full experimental control. Compared to an active control, the cognitive intervention prevented retaliation following programmed trust violations and yielded significantly higher cooperative returns. Mixed-effects analysis revealed that while control participants became increasingly reciprocal over time (approaching tit-for-tat strategies), intervention participants maintained more stable cooperative behavior that was less contingent on partner investment levels. This change did not generalize to Prisoner's Dilemma, underscoring the intervention's specificity. These results validate HMM agents as a powerful experimental tool and suggest that targeted cognitive strategies may help support cooperative behavior; clinical efficacy and real-world deployment remain to be established.",

Besides, computational modeling revealed significant group differences in social learning: individuals with BPD symptoms failed to learn from frequent positive social feedback (Likes) but overweighted rare negative social feedback (Dislikes) received from generally benevolent peers. Moreover, their self-esteem was disproportionately reactive to positive feedback from critical raters, a pattern partly explained by individual differences in self-reported adverse family experiences.\nConclusions: These findings highlight fundamental disruptions in how young people with BPD symptoms learn from social feedback and how they use it to inform their self-esteem.",

In Italy, despite free access, vaccine coverage among adolescents remains low. Psychological factors and cognitive biases can influence vaccine decisions and contribute to vaccine hesitancy (VH). While social media offer new avenues for health communication, their effectiveness in reducing VH is uncertain. This study investigates the impact of Instagram-based communication strategies on adolescents’ HPV knowledge and VH.\n\nMethods A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 22 high school classes in Tuscany, Italy, involving 526 students. Classes were assigned to one of three Instagram accounts: a neutral control, an information-based, or a bias-aware information. After three weeks (T2), students completed a follow-up survey, followed by an in-class lesson. Surveys were administered at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and three-month follow-up (T3).\n\nResults The final analysis included 301 students (mean age 15.2, 74% female). At T1, VH and knowledge scores were low (mean VH = 40%; knowledge score = 27%), and 47.9% reported likely seeking information from sexual and reproductive services. No significant changes in VH or knowledge were found at T2 overall. However, in students with low information avoidance (IA), the info-based page reduced VH significantly compared to the control (-6.9%, p = 0.009). In contrast, among high-IA students, the same intervention increased VH (estimate: +8.9%, p = 0.002). Willingness to seek information increased in the info group among low-IA students (+1.639 vs. control, p = 0.034). At T3, we measured the impact of an in-person lecture on students’ HPV and HPV vaccination literacy. A significant increase of knowledge compared to T1 is observed despite the smaller sample collected.\n\nConclusion Social media campaigns alone may not effectively reduce VH in adolescents and can even backfire among high-IA individuals. Future strategies should incorporate personalized, bias-aware messaging and interactive tools to address VH and improve HPV vaccine uptake more effectively.",

          "abstract": "The generation effect refers to the advantage in memory for self-generated information compared to information that is received from another source (e.g., through reading). The multifactor account posits that generation improves the processing of the specific information a learner uses to complete the task, and the generation effect will be observed if the memory test depends on the recruitment of that information. Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

This study focuses on the mental health challenges faced by first-generation Iranian immigrants in Germany, specifically examining the role of depression, discrimination, and social integration.\nMethods: A cross-sectional, online survey was administered to 401 Iranian immigrants across 122 cities in Germany. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the PHQ-9, while perceived discrimination, social support, and integration were measured with custom scales. Multivariable statistical analyses were employed to identify significant predictors of depression and re-migration intent.\nResults: About 60% of participants reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Perceived discrimination (b = 1.246, p = 0.001) and unemployment (b = 2.571, p = 0.007) were positively linked to depression, while self-employment (b = −3.052, p = 0.029) had a protective effect. The strongest predictor of depression was the comparison of happiness between Germany and Iran (b = −2.457, p &lt; 0.001), with lower happiness in Germany correlating with higher depressive scores. Social support showed a trend toward buffering the effects of discrimination (b = −0.596, p = 0.085). Additionally, 63.6% of participants expressed intent to re-migrate.\nConclusions: The findings highlight the significant mental health burden experienced by Iranian immigrants in Germany, with discrimination, unemployment and lack of social support being key contributors to depressive symptoms. The high re-migration intent underscores the need for interventions addressing discrimination, enhancing social support, and improving integration pathways to reduce mental health disparities and promote social cohesion.\nKeywords: Iranian immigrants, Germany, depression, discrimination, mental health, integration",

          "authors": "Holmes Finch",
          "abstract": "The comparison of means between two or more groups for two or more dependent variables is a very common problem in psychology and other social sciences.  Most frequently, such comparisons are made using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), which rests upon assumptions about the population data distribution, including multivariate normality of the residuals and homoscedasticity of group variances on the response variables.  When these assumptions are not met, the performance of the standard MANOVA test statistics can be degraded resulting in inflated Type I error rates and/or diminished power.  Recently, authors in the biomedical sciences have described approaches for multivariate mean comparisons that are based on metrics such as the Euclidean distance, which describe how separated individuals are from one another.  The ratio of the sum of squares of these distance measures between and within groups can serve as a test of the null hypothesis of no difference in the groups’ locations on the set of response variables.  The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of these distance based approaches with standard MANOVA and an approach based on multilevel modeling for heteroscedastic and nonnormal outcome variables.  In addition, the distance based techniques were also compared with the multilevel method and a log-linear model for a scenario with binary outcomes.  The results of the simulation study revealed that the distance based methods maintained the nominal Type I error rate in nearly all conditions and exhibited comparable or higher power with the other methods included in the study.  A major implication of this work is that the distance based approaches can prove useful in comparison of group location for a wide variety of data distributions including skewed, heteroscedastic, and binary.",

          "abstract": "“List as many words as you can that start with M.” The verbal fluency (VF) task is simple, yet even a typical university student only manages to produce about 15 words within one minute, and there is substantial variability around this mean. We investigated the individual differences in linguistic and domain-general skills that support verbal fluency and lead to this variability. In particular, we focused on the role of linguistic knowledge, which was calculated through six tests capturing vocabulary, amount of reading, and knowledge of grammar rules. We compared this to the role of three key domain-general skills: working memory (WM), processing speed, and nonverbal reasoning (IQ). 571 young native Dutch speakers completed semantic (category) and phonemic (letter) VF tasks, along with an individual differences test battery. We assessed the VF trials for the total number of correct words as well as two temporal variables, the time to first response and the time by which half of the responses have been produced. Linear mixed effects models revealed that linguistic knowledge was the strongest predictor of performance across all scores, and it had a larger effect than the domain-general skills. We discuss the role of linguistic knowledge and how it shapes the mental lexicon, concluding that better language skills lead to more efficient and detailed associative links between words that share semantic or phonological/orthographic features. We also provide updated norms for VF performance in Dutch and practical suggestions for using the task.",

Whereas dyadic eye gaze synchrony has been widely studied, its operationalization remains inconsistent, and methods extending beyond dyads are scarce. This proof-of-concept study introduces a reproducible pipeline for capturing eye gaze synchrony in a triadic interaction using mobile eye tracking. Three participants each wore Tobii Pro Glasses 3 during a 7-minute naturalistic conversation. Independent recordings were synchronized via a router-based setup, and gaze points were spatially aligned within a shared coordinate system anchored by a fiducial marker. We compared two analytical frameworks: a correlation-based approach using Surrogate Synchrony methods (SUSY and its multivariate extension mv-SUSY) to quantify temporal alignment of gaze, and an event-based approach assessing occurrences of mutual gaze and joint attention. The study demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing eye gaze synchrony among multiple participants. Results indicated that correlation-based and event-based measures capture distinct but complementary aspects of triadic coordination. This work provides a foundation for reproducible quantitative analyses of gaze coordination in complex social settings.",

Here we investigated whether paranoid thoughts affect lonely individuals’ willingness to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity during trusting interactions in individuals with and without psychosis. We found that loneliness and paranoia were strongly correlated with each other and with more distrustful behavior after breaches of trust. Sensitivity to changes in partner reciprocity were higher in lonelier and more paranoid individuals. Lonelier individuals also trusted highly-reciprocating partners less. Computational modeling revealed that lonelier and more paranoid individuals were less willing to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity. Importantly, these effects were observed in both patients and controls, indicating the important impact of loneliness and paranoia on both clinical and general populations. These findings demonstrate how loneliness affects social behaviors and expectations, pointing to important downstream implications for lonely individuals’ relationships.",

          "abstract": "Time-varying coefficient modeling (TVCM), which represents regression coefficients as smooth functions of continuous time, provides a flexible framework for uncovering complex patterns of change in the levels and associations among variables measured in intensive longitudinal data. However, conventional TVCM remains limited to investigating directional effects that are aggregated across individuals. The present study broadens the applicability of TVCM  in two ways. First, we introduce a TVCM formulation of the multivariate normal distribution to explore temporal dynamics in both undirected associations (or couplings) and the variability of variables of interest. Second, we integrate TVCM with hierarchical modeling, thereby extending inference from average coefficient functions across persons to their individual-level counterparts. Specifically, we explore (a) the inclusion of person-specific intercepts in time-varying coefficient functions to investigate interindividual differences at the onset of the period of interest, and (b) modeling fully person-specific coefficient functions to capture heterogeneity across the entire period, with partial pooling stabilizing individual-level estimates. To illustrate the model extensions, we apply them to six weeks of intensive longitudinal data from 16 patients with anxiety disorders participating in an attention training intervention, examining interindividual differences in changes in both the level and volatility of nervousness and threat monitoring, as well as in the temporal dynamics of their coupling. Finally, we discuss model extensions that incorporate person-level characteristics to explain interindividual differences in temporal dynamics and use these differences to predict outcomes of interest.",

          "abstract": "Taking phenomenal consciousness as explanandum, we first circumscribe it using five hallmarks. Fundamentally, conscious experience corresponds to generating a best-guess representation of what the sensory inputs the wakeful brain receives are about. This process can be computationally approached with predictive processing (PP): the brain constantly generates inferential, predictive representations to ‘explain away’ its sensory inputs. Empirical evidence supports the use of PP by the brain, yet it is not deemed sufficient to explain consciousness. We review two theories of consciousness using PP as building block: active inference theory and neurorepresentationalism. When witnessing computer simulations of PP and other computational models, they remain strikingly unconvincing as instances that might emulate consciousness. Considered in the context of computational functionalism, we argue that computational models suffer, by definition, from the ‘Problem of Numbers’: it does lie within the purview of mathematics to study numerical operations, but not to reveal all qualitative properties characteristic of consciousness. We argue that low-level neural phenomena, e.g. spike trains, can be captured by mathematics, but we need different descriptors and tools to study their emergent correspondence to high-level, conscious phenomena. These considerations also lead us to outline Indicators of Consciousness as applicable to AIs and robots.",

          "abstract": "Background: Young autistic people experience disproportionately high rates of mental health challenges, yet little is known about factors associated with suicidality in this group. This study leveraged anonymous self-report data to identify correlates of suicidal thoughts.\nMethods: Secondary analysis was performed on data for 365 young (age 11-19+ years) users of a mental health app in the UK with an autism diagnosis or self-identifying as autistic. The presence of suicidal thoughts was assessed as a binary item. Binary logistic regression was used to explore correlates of suicidal thoughts across three domains: mental health-related symptoms, autism-related factors, and adverse life events/experiences. The final model included all significant correlates from domain models and demographic factors.\nResults: Suicidal thoughts were reported by 63% of participants, with similar rates across age groups. The final model accounted for nearly 50% of variability in the presence of suicidal thoughts (R²Nagelkerke = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Self-harm and depression showed the strongest positive associations with suicidal thoughts (odds ratio (OR) and [95% confidence interval] = 6.41 [3.62, 11.35] and 4.58 [2.51, 8.35], respectively), followed by history of physical abuse (OR = 3.01 [1.20, 7.56]) and a transgender/gender-diverse identity (OR = 2.13 [1.11, 4.10]). Use of the term “neurodiversity”—reflecting a neurodiversity-affirming identity—was associated with lower likelihood of suicidal thoughts (OR = 0.45 [0.24, 0.83]). \nConclusion: This study contributes to evidence of high rates of suicidal thoughts among young autistic people and associations with self-harm, depression, a history of abuse, and a gender minority identity. Self-identification with the term neurodiversity emerged as a potential protective factor against suicidal thoughts. These findings highlight the importance of access to autism-adapted mental health care, addressing trauma and identity-related stressors, and fostering belonging and connection through neurodiversity-affirming approaches as part of comprehensive suicide prevention strategies. Longitudinal research is needed to examine whether identity-affirming, connection-building interventions can support autistic youth experiencing suicidality.",

          "abstract": "Discovering computational models that explain human cognition and behavior remains a central goal of cognitive science, yet the reliance on hand-crafted equations limits the range of cognitive mechanisms that can be uncovered. We introduce SPICE (Sparse, Interpretable Cognitive Equations), a framework that automates the discovery of mechanistically interpretable cognitive models directly from behavioral data. SPICE fits recurrent neural networks to capture latent cognitive dynamics and then applies sparse equation discovery to extract concise mathematical expressions describing those dynamics. Theory-guided priors make the approach data- and compute-efficient, while a hierarchical design reveals individual differences in the algorithmic structure of cognitive dynamics rather than in parameters alone. In simulations, SPICE accurately recovered the structure and parameters of known reinforcement learning models. Applied to human behavior in a two-armed bandit task, it uncovered new equations that outperformed existing models and revealed structural alterations in reinforcement learning mechanisms among participants with depression, such as a loss of nonlinear exploration dynamics regulating behavioral flexibility. This approach provides systematic insights into structural individual differences in cognitive mechanisms and establishes a foundation for automated discovery of interpretable behavioral models.",

          "abstract": "Although many studies have claimed the existence of unconscious priming, a valid statistical procedure for substantiating such claims is often lacking. For instance, the absence of prime awareness is often erroneously inferred from non-significant p-values, and priming and awareness are typically tested by comparing the outcomes of two separate t-tests. In a classic study by Vorberg (2003), observers were slower to identify the direction of an arrow mask when it followed an arrow prime pointing in the opposite direction (priming effect), despite being unable to identify the direction of the arrow prime (prime awareness). Using that observation as a starting point, we address several methodological shortcomings that we identified in that study (as in many other studies in the field). To overcome these shortcomings, we implemented three critical changes. First, we employed a Bayesian methodological-statistical framework to test priming effects and prime awareness at the single-subject level over multiple experimental sessions. Second, participants underwent extensive training in the prime awareness task to ensure they understood and executed the task as intended. Third, we directly compared prime awareness and the priming effect. By using this approach, we show unconscious processing at short prime-mask stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) in three out of six participants, replicating Vorberg et al. (2003). However, we also show that – unlike in the original study – unconscious priming was not consistently present across all SOAs, and awareness increased with increasing prime-mask SOA. Notably, priming effects were highly consistent across participants, whereas awareness showed substantial variability across participants.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs) link number magnitude to spatial dimensions, typically yielding faster left-side responses to small numbers and right-side responses to large numbers, the SNARC effect. Although widely replicated, the SNARC effect varies across contexts, indicating that it is influenced by situational and embodied factors. The present study examined whether visual hand primes can modulate the SNARC effect in a magnitude classification task. Participants classified digits as smaller or larger than five after viewing schematic images of a left or right hand. The hand primes were task-irrelevant and centrally displayed before each digit, allowing assessment of whether visual cues associated with specific hands bias spatial-numerical mapping. Consistent with previous studies using Turkish samples, the present data revealed no reliable SNARC effect (a non-significant magnitude × side interaction) in the baseline pattern. However, a significant three-way interaction emerged among hand prime, numerical magnitude, and response side: right-hand responses were faster to large digits after right-hand primes, reflecting a partial prime-congruent modulation of spatial-numerical mapping. The effect was not influenced by participants’ habitual finger-counting direction, suggesting that the observed modulation arises from immediate perceptual context rather than long-term embodied routines. Overall, the findings indicate that SNAs are flexible and dynamically shaped by transient embodied cues, even in the absence of a typical SNARC pattern at baseline.",

This\npreregistered study1 employed a digital meeting format to examine how target individuals’\n(n=119) maladaptive personality traits (i.e., detachment, antagonistic traits, agentic traits) shape\ntrustworthiness and likability ratings made by perceivers (n=120).

          "abstract": "Disagreement about the rights and protections owed to different individuals underpins many important historical and current debates (e.g., on the abolishment of slavery, the feminist movement, abortion, and environmental protection). Recent work on moral concern (i.e., the subjectively felt moral obligation to consider an individual’s welfare and interests) has uncovered a seemingly robust hierarchy. For example, people extend most moral concern toward family and friends, followed by ingroup members (e.g., a co-worker), outgroup members (e.g., a foreign citizen), the environment (e.g., a coral reef), and, lastly, criminals (e.g., a murderer). However, these studies were all conducted in a few countries from the Anglosphere, raising doubt about the cross-cultural generalizability of the results. We analyzed a data set with 6,665 participants recruited from 41 cultural groups to explore cultural and individual variation in the hierarchy of moral concern. We find that (1) on average, across the 41 cultural groups, 11 of the 13 rankings in the typical hierarchy of moral concern replicated, pointing to substantial cultural similarities; (2) countries that are culturally more similar to the reference sample from the initial U.S. study showed a more similar hierarchy; (3) some rankings (e.g., prioritizing family and friends over human ingroups) replicated more often than others (e.g., prioritizing human outgroups over the environment) across countries; and (4) both cultural and individual differences were largest most pronounced examining people’s concern for non-human animals and the environment.",

          "abstract": "Economic dishonesty is a widespread behavior that has substantial implications for organizations and societies. Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty, with classical economic approaches emphasizing the use of punishment by focusing among others on the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”). However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. We conducted an experimental online study (N = 702) collecting UK-based Prolific participants playing a tax evasion game for five rounds. We manipulated (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earned money for the individual or for the group of three), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual was punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). Against our prediction, we did not observe higher dishonesty for group-based payoffs compared to individual-based payoffs for treatments without punishment but higher compliance. As predicted, we found that punishment risk decreased dishonesty and increased compliance by 14.2 percentage points (Cohen’s d = 0.32). Further, in contrast to the predictions based on utility-based models, we found that group punishment was more effective in decreasing dishonesty and increased compliance by 5.6 percentage points (d = 0.13) compared to individual punishment. This effect was similar for individual and group-based payoffs. Overall, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of punishment in curbing dishonesty across different decision-making structures.",

          "abstract": "Humans readily categorize their social environment based on visible features regarded as diagnostic for group membership (e.g., skin color, hair color, body morphology) along lines of various social dimensions, including gender, race, age, to name just a few. Despite overwhelming evidence for the notion that these dimensions can be used to bring categorical order into the world, psychologists know surprisingly little about what determines which of these lenses is active in a given moment. The present research examines whether ecological meta-contrast provides an affordance to social categorization and selective category use. Across seven studies (N = 1,234), we manipulated meta-contrast ratios by varying the dispersion of race- and gender-related facial features to examine their effects on spontaneous social categorization. Categorization was assessed using the “Who Said What?” paradigm (Taylor et al., 1978), with categorization parameters estimated via multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (Klauer &amp; Wegener, 1998), and a Speeded Categorization task (Thomas et al., 2014). Participants consistently categorized faces by race (Studies 1a, 2a) and gender (Studies 1b, 2b), regardless of meta-contrast ratio. However, when race and gender were crossed (Studies 3, 4, 5), significant interaction effects emerged: categorization along the low meta-contrast dimension decreased, while it increased along the high-meta-contrast dimension. These findings provide initial evidence that meta-contrast modulates the relative accessibility of social categorizations. The distribution of category-related features within a social information ecology thus provides affordance to some categorizations more readily than others. Study-specific patterns related to stimuli and task constraints are discussed to inform future research.",

And while state-of-the-art transformer-based computer vision models can mimic human-like scanpaths, their priority maps remain largely static across fixations and therefore fail to capture the temporal dynamics of search.

          "authors": "Junzhi Dong; Benedict C Jones; Esperanza Miyake; Victor Kenji Medeiros Shiramizu",
          "abstract": "Individuals displaying cues of higher mate value (e.g., attractive characteristics) are thought to represent a greater threat to pair bonds and, consequently, elicit greater jealousy. Previous studies reporting that more feminine potential rivals elicit greater jealousy in women used stimuli in which feminine characteristics were experimentally manipulated and assessed jealousy using forced-choice methods. However, this method for assessing perceptions has recently been criticised for lacking ecological validity. Consequently, in the current study, women rated how jealous they would feel if rivals depicted in natural (i.e., unmanipulated) face photographs were flirting with their romantic partner. Facial femininity was assessed using objective analyses of shape and via third-party ratings of facial femininity. For heterosexual participants, women reported significantly greater jealousy when imagining more feminine women flirting with their romantic partner. This pattern of results was also seen for lesbian participants, although the correlation between rival femininity and jealousy was significantly weaker for lesbian participants than it was for heterosexual participants. Collectively, these results present further evidence that facial femininity of potential rivals influences women’s reported jealousy, particularly in heterosexual women, and is further evidence for the proposal that putative markers of the mate value of rivals play a role in women’s jealousy.

          "abstract": "Template matching, the idea that attention is guided by a specific internal representation of a target, provides a powerful theoretical foundation for understanding visual search. Yet, it remains unclear how such templates operate in naturalistic contexts where target objects may be ambiguous or vary in appearance. We propose that visual search is better explained by generative templates—representations conditionally shaped by features of the current visual input rather than fixed, averaged prototypes. Using deep image synthesis, we generate input-specific target templates and compare their search guidance to conventional fixed templates. Generative templates yield more accurate target localization in naturalistic search arrays and better capture key patterns in human behavior, including search efficiency, fixation probability, and attentional guidance toward structurally similar non-targets. Our input-driven generative template approach offers a flexible alternative to classical template-matching theories, Our input-driven generative template approach offers a flexible alternative to classical template-matching theories, one that can better explain how human categorical search is affected by the variability in visual features both within and between natural object categories.",

          "abstract": "Theories of early numeracy assume that the logical concepts which enable formal definitions of numbers (e.g., cardinality, one-to-one correspondence, successor function) play key roles in ontogenesis, but empirical support is lacking. These concepts may not be suitable targets for theory because such definitions are reconstructions of numbers in formal language, but not explanatory of what numbers are. We propose that there should be a correspondence between those formal ideas that are generative for the natural numbers and those realized in children’s early learning. Building on our account of foundations of arithmetic (Grice et al., 2024, Psychological Review), we give a new explanatory construction of the natural numbers and a theory of early numeracy analogous to it. We show that numbers can be derived from linear order, monotonicity and convexity – principles of perceptual organization that are evolutionarily based. A key step in our construction is the ℕ-chain, the limit of finite linear orders, which we show is equivalent to the successor function but preferable as a target for psychological theory because it can be approximated in finite terms. In our theory, building blocks of early numeracy are linear orders - the number word sequence, object play schemas - and how they are related in the count routine by structure mapping (order embeddings). The number word sequence develops gradually, giving a representation analogous to an ℕ-chain when the child realizes that numbers can be generated without limit. Ordinality is prior to cardinality as the basis for numeracy, one-to-one correspondence results from convexity, and the natural numbers and arithmetic emerge jointly as a common structure. Our theory reconciles constructivist and nativist accounts because it shows that numeracy is both culturally mediated and biologically-based, although ‘core number systems’ do not play a role. The dawning of numeracy in a child’s mind is both a reinvention and rediscovery of mathematics itself.",

          "abstract": "Background\nMany theories of gambling harm propose that interactive design features of sports-betting platforms confer risk of harm by enabling cyclical patterns of repeated gambling engagement. This exploratory study investigated whether such features were used more frequently by people at higher risk of gambling harm relative to a demographically matched lower-risk control group.\nMethods\nThis study used a case-control design to compare a group of 85 people at higher risk of gambling harm (PGSI 5+) with an age- and gender-matched control group at lower risk of harm (n = 84, PGSI 0-4). We compared the frequency with which groups self-reported using in-play betting, instant cash-out, multi and micro bets, social betting, and viewing live-streamed events within a betting app.\nResults\nThe higher-risk group reported more frequent use of in-play betting and instant cash-out and were more likely to report streaming live sporting events within a betting app. Higher-risk participants were also more likely to make an immediate deposit to qualify for a marketing offer, and both groups reported being more likely to make risky bets when using bonus funds. We observed no group differences in the frequency of use of multis, micro-bets, or social betting.\nConclusions\nOur findings were broadly consistent with the theory that design features of modern betting platforms contribute to gambling harm by facilitating continuous engagement. A notable finding was that in-app streaming of live events was more common among people at higher risk of gambling harm, consistent with a novel prediction made by the motivating theory.",

Data on isolated word reading accuracy were collected from 1,907 children in grades 1-5 across multiple US sites. Each child read a list of words ranging from 250 to 500 items depending on reading skill (less proficient children were often unable to finish the entire list of words), with each list representing the full distribution of word difficulties oversampled for words at the child’s reading level. Each child also attempted 99 linking items representing the full distribution of word difficulties. A total of 631,322 total responses were collected with the average child providing 336. For the final sample of words, the average number of responses per word for the 9,862 non-linking items was 47.14 (range of 10-592) and for the 99 linking items the average was 1681.42 (range of 1083-1907). A Rasch model, with planned missing design, was fit to children’s responses on the word list and linking item responses. This introduction describes the motivation for this project; the methods used for data collecting; the analytic framework used to establish a continuous measure of word reading difficulty across words; descriptive statistics of the relational database and initial behavioral results; and a publicly available search engine providing searchable access to the word difficulty ratings and associated word-level statistics.",

These behaviors do not reflect a mere dismissal of scientific authority, but rather a specific reconfiguration of epistemic trust, where selective scepticism is applied, marked by exaggerated doubt towards evidence-based authority and simultaneous uncritical acceptance of pseudoscientific claims. We review key psychological drivers of these behaviors - i.e. irrational beliefs - and different ways they interact with science. We then examine communication strategies that divert trust from unreliable sources and encourage trust in reliable ones. Understanding and reshaping the way dialogue and trust is cultivated is essential in countering the rise of questionable health practices.",

          "abstract": "The divide between political liberals and conservatives is rapidly growing. Several influential theories contend that this divide hinges on orientations towards social groups, such that conservatives (versus liberals) show a greater tendency to favor their “ingroups” and discriminate against “outgroups”. However, other theories contend that liberals and conservatives do not differ in their degree of intergroup bias. Both perspectives have received empirical support, and the debate has reached a standstill. We argue that this theoretical and empirical stalemate stems from inherent limitations of examining attitudes towards real-world social groups—a strategy used by both sides of the debate. Drawing on social identity theory, we conducted a series of four studies (Total N = 4389) using “minimal groups” (i.e., experimentally constructed groups) to determine whether and why ideological differences in intergroup bias may exist. We found robust evidence of ideological differences in intergroup bias, with conservatives favoring their own social groups over others. These ideological differences were relatively small but statistically robust across most contexts we examined. Importantly, however, when groups were based on shared moral and political values, liberals showed as much intergroup bias as conservatives. These results help resolve this long-standing debate and deepen our understanding of the psychological underpinnings of political ideology.",

Generative learning helps construct meaningful mental representations, while retrieval practice supports consolidation and long-term retention. Combining both strategies may foster learning; however, research remains scarce.\nAims: We investigated how combining generative activities and retrieval practice affects students’ conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy in authentic school settings for immediate and lasting learning. Additionally, we explored associations between generation, retrieval, and explanation quality (i.e., completeness, elaboration, correctness).\nSample: The classroom experiment was conducted in authentic physics lessons with N = 344 secondary students.\nMethods: Students participated in a physics teaching unit about converging lenses and were randomly assigned within each class to one of four combinations of sequential learning activities crossing two factors (non-generation vs. generation; non-retrieval vs. retrieval). Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy were measured immediately and after eight weeks.\nResults: Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy did not significantly differ between generation, retrieval, or their sequential combination at either test. However, exploratory analyses revealed that retrieval practice supported lasting learning only when prior generative processing was of low quality—that is, when students’ explanations were incomplete, less elaborated, or inaccurate.\nConclusions: Combining generation and retrieval does not universally enhance learning. Its effectiveness appears to depend on the quality of prior generative processing. In this sense, retrieval practice may serve a happy role—compensating fragile knowledge—or a redundant one, offering no added benefit when prior understanding is already strong.",

          "authors": "Arthur Hamilton",
          "abstract": "The relationship between schizophrenia and psychedelic drug states has long attracted scholarly interest and psychedelics have sometimes been described as psychotomimetic. Sense of self can be understood as the feeling of “mineness” that normally characterizes all experiences. In both schizophrenia and psychedelic experiences, alterations to sense of self are present and correlate with clinical measures. The phenomenology of altered sense of self in schizophrenia, often conceptualized as self disorder, and psychedelic experiences, often described as ego dissolution, has been noted since early twentieth-century descriptions and more recently been measured by psychometric scales. Both self disorder in schizophrenia and psychedelic states involve subjective alteration to the ordinary boundary between self and world. At the neural level, a limited number of neuroimaging studies have directly tested the associations of altered sense of self in schizophrenia and psychedelics; they have linked altered sense of self to differences in event-related potentials, regional cortical volumes, and functional connectivity. While one potential convergence was observed in EEG findings between schizophrenia and psychedelics, most results remain difficult to compare due to methodological differences. To address these challenges, the paper suggests development of a combined psychometric instrument that incorporates items from both schizophrenia- and psychedelic-focused scales, to be administered across schizophrenia, psychedelic, and control groups. This approach, supplemented by neuroimaging comparisons, could clarify the similarities and differences between these two forms of altered sense of self and their clinical relevance.",

          "abstract": "Explicit mental imagery (i.e. voluntary and conscious) can enhance learning in declarative memory. In the present work, we assessed whether implicit imagery task also enhances memory, and whether specific imagery modalities (motor, visual) selectively benefit the learning of related material. Seventy-two young adults completed a recognition task in which they learned action and non-action verbs presented after an implicit motor imagery task (i.e., hand mental rotation) or an implicit visual imagery task (i.e., number mental rotation). Results from both frequentist and Bayesian generalized mixed-effects models revealed a significant interaction between verb type and imagery modality. Congruent imagery modality (i.e. motor for action verbs, visual for non-action verbs) enhanced subsequent recognition compared to incongruent modality (i.e. motor for non-action verbs, visual for action verbs). These findings provide novel evidence that the effectiveness of mental imagery for learning is influenced by the congruence between imagery modality and the sensorimotor features of the learned items. They also suggest that mental imagery does not need to be fully voluntary or fully conscious to improve learning.",

          "abstract": "How does lexical knowledge enter the decision process? We develop a framework that links learned lexical representations directly to the evidence accumulation process, allowing explicit tests of how lexical information shapes evidence strength (drift) in lexical decision. Words and nonwords are represented with word embeddings (FastText or BERT) and passed through a compact classifier; its outputs are mapped, via psychologically interpretable functions, to evidence strength, with an additional term capturing the independent influence of lexical frequency. Hierarchical Bayesian models were fitted to the English Lexicon Project and compared using standard information criteria; posterior predictive checks and a parameter-recovery study assessed adequacy and identifiability. Across eight integrated models, diffusion-based variants (one diffusion process per response) outperformed otherwise identical ballistic race variants, and explicitly modeling frequency reliably improved fit. The best integrated model (FastText + diffusion + frequency) made more accurate held-out predictions than the benchmark models and matched--sometimes slightly surpassed--their ability to reproduce key features of the RT distribution. These results suggest that distributional lexical information, augmented by frequency, is best captured as modulation of evidence quality within standard accumulation dynamics. The approach preserves interpretability, reproduces canonical RT/accuracy patterns, and can be extended to other recognition decisions by swapping encoders or the accumulation module without changing the estimation workflow.",

To do so, we introduce the Continual Decision Making Dynamics (CDMD) framework, which characterises decision-making as a temporally extended, history-sensitive process that is sustained by self-organising and self-regulating interactions. In particular, drawing on empirical examples, we demonstrate how CDMD can accommodate the organisation of control architectures that support more distributed and decentralised modes of decision-making, and facilitate a comparative approach to decision-making strategies across phylogenetic and organisational scales. We discuss how our model can be situated among other related approaches to decision-making, capturing a distinctive subset of decision strategies that can be modelled in the absence of explicit representational structures. By foregrounding regulatory control and organisational constraints, the CDMD framework aims to provide an integrative basis for studying how diverse biological systems sustain ongoing choice in changing environments.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is a multidimensional experience comprising social and emotional facets. While previous research shows that loneliness exhibits both stable and dynamic patterns across the life span, little is known about how these trajectories unfold at the facet-level. The present study investigates stability and change in social and emotional loneliness across the adult life span using two longitudinal, nationally representative datasets from the Netherlands (N = 16,732, Mage = 43.79 years, age range = 16-100 years) and Germany (N = 12,167, Mage = 63.05 years, age range = 40-97 years). We applied local structural equation modeling with second-order latent growth curve models to examine rank-order stability and mean-level change across adulthood. Measurement invariance tests supported the psychometric comparability of social and emotional loneliness items across age groups and time points. Overall, results indicated relatively high rank-order stability and little mean-level change of both facets, with nuanced, largely non-significant age-related patterns. Specifically, rank-order stability of both facets tended to increase in young adulthood and remained stable thereafter, while mean levels were highest in young adulthood and decreased thereafter, with a secondary rise in social loneliness during midlife. Beyond these general patterns, nuanced differences between both facets emerged: social loneliness showed higher baseline levels, greater mean-level change, and somewhat lower rank-order stability—suggesting higher intraindividual variability. These findings highlight young adulthood as a sensitive period for loneliness interventions and underscore the value of distinguishing between social and emotional loneliness to capture the nuanced developmental dynamics of loneliness across the adult life span.",

          "authors": "Hudson Golino",
          "abstract": "Language conveys meaning through structures that range from concrete description to abstract generalization. This study introduces a computational framework for measuring linguistic depth by quantifying the algorithmic complexity of semantic networks derived from large language model embeddings. Building on Piagetian and Vygotskian theories of cognitive development, this study propose that abstraction, whether in thought, measurement, or language, reflects the compression of distributed information into coherent, generative structures. We operationalize this principle using Kolmogorov complexity, K(G), estimated via the compressed length of network edge lists. Simulation studies demonstrate that networks derived from factor-structured data exhibit significantly lower K(G) than density-matched random controls, with separation accuracy reaching 94% as factor loadings strengthen. In a controlled linguistic experiment comparing 100 pairs of abstract and concrete phrases matched for syntax and length, abstract expressions produced consistently lower algorithmic complexity (M = 726) than concrete expressions (M = 784), t(194.41) = -3.28, p = .001, d = -0.46. Slot-based lexical manipulation experiments revealed that cross-category substitutions increased K(G) by 51 bytes in abstract contexts but only 27 bytes in concrete contexts, demonstrating a 1.9:1 directional asymmetry. These findings establish that semantic abstraction manifests as network compressibility, i.e., abstract language achieves conceptual depth through structural regularity rather than elaborative detail. The framework unites psychometric network theory, complexity science, and computational linguistics under a single information-theoretic principle, offering a model-agnostic measure of abstraction applicable across psychological networks, natural language, and neural representations. By formalizing the intuition that profound expression achieves economy through structure, K(G) provides both theoretical insight into how meaning is organized and practical methodology for assessing semantic depth in text, psychological data, and artificial intelligence systems.",

          "abstract": "People are lazy. According to the law of least effort, people generally prefer to exert less rather than more effort to achieve the same reward. However, this research often isolates individuals from social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour is shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we examine whether individuals conform to both high-effort and low-effort norms equally, or whether the strength of normative influence on effort choices depends on the direction of the norm. Across twelve studies (N = 2,084), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. While people generally avoid effort, results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however, did not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Even after increasing the acceptability of low effort—by enhancing the value of low effort and the psychological closeness to past participants—individuals still opposed the low effort norm, exerting no less effort than the control group. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour can inspire us to work harder, individuals show resistance to lowering their effort below what they would typically exert. While we consistently found conformity to high-effort norms, effort preferences were not influenced when hearing about others completing an unrelated task, pointing to a possible boundary condition for norm effects.",

          "authors": "Jiyoon Kim; Emily Harriott; Mercedes Spencer; Nadine Gaab; John Gabrieli; Elizabeth Norton",
          "abstract": "Purpose: Although rapid automatized naming (RAN) is typically measured by the total time to name an array of items, more precise methods may be needed to capture the full range of processes underlying RAN—including pause time, a component of total time that reflects response preparation before the articulation of each item. This study investigated whether two underexplored aspects of RAN—pause time variability (PTV) and task length—can improve or streamline the prediction of future reading difficulties. Using mixed-effects location scale models (MELSMs), which capture item-by-item variability rather than aggregating data, we were able to uncover nuanced patterns in item-level RAN responses.\n\nMethod: We utilized a longitudinal sample of 142 English-speaking kindergarteners (47.9% girls) oversampled for dyslexia risk. Item-by-item variability and change in RAN pause times were modeled using MELSMs. We then compared model fit between models with PTV and/or total time from kindergarten RAN as the predictor(s) of second grade reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension. \n\nResults: Although higher PTV significantly predicted subsequent lower reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension, PTV did not significantly improve prediction beyond total time. RAN tasks with fewer total items were worse at predicting all three reading measures compared to the longer (~40-50 item) formats.\n\nConclusions: The current practice of measuring total time instead of PTV is a robust and more parsimonious way to predict reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension in kindergarteners. RAN tasks must be sufficiently long to challenge the limits of automaticity, given the increasing cognitive demands throughout the task.",

          "abstract": "The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is central to criminal adjudication in the United States. Yet, courts continue to grapple with how best to communicate this standard to jurors. In 2022, Colorado significantly revised its model reasonable doubt jury instruction, adding language that refers to a “real possibility” the defendant is not guilty. Critics argue that this phrasing may inadvertently lower the prosecution’s burden of proof. The present study empirically examined the impact of Colorado’s 2023 model instruction on juror decision-making, comparing it to both constitutionally upheld and judicially invalidated instructions. Using a simulated mock jury paradigm and a sample of 896 U.S. participants, we examined verdicts, confidence in guilt, and perceived evidentiary burdens across five jury instruction conditions (including the Colorado 2023 model instruction). The Colorado 2023 model instruction descriptively yielded the highest proportion of guilty verdicts and significantly increased juror confidence in guilt relative to an otherwise identical instruction lacking the “real possibility” statement. Examination of hypothetical jurors’ interpretation of the “real possibility” instruction indicated that over one-third interpreted the language as assigning some burden of proof to the defense. These findings suggest that Colorado’s 2023 model instruction—particularly the inclusion of “real possibility” language—may reduce clarity of the reasonable doubt standard and potentially lower the threshold for perception of guilt and conviction. The results have immediate relevance for pending litigation before the Colorado Supreme Court and broader implications for ensuring constitutional safeguards in jury instructions nationwide.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we generalize the multidimensional discrimination (MDISC) and difficulty (MID) parameters in the Multidimensional 2-Parameter Logistic model to account for non-identity latent covariances and negatively-keyed items. We apply Reckase’s maximum discrimination point method to define them in an arbitrary algebraic basis. Then, we define that basis to be a geometrical representation of the measured construct. This results in three different versions of the parameters: The original one, based on the item parameters solely, one that incorporates the covariance structure of the latent space, and one that uses the correlation structure instead. Importantly, we find that the items should be properly represented in a test space, distinct from the latent space. We also provide a procedure for the geometrical representation of the items in the test space, and apply our results to examples from the literature to get a more accurate representation of the measurement properties of the items. We recommend using the covariance structure version for describing the properties of the parameters, and the correlation structure version for graphical representation. Finally, we discuss the implications of this generalization for other multidimensional IRT models and the parallels of our results in common factor model theory.",

While previous research has explored how interpretation bias impacts anxiety, studies specifically on FoMO are limited. The present study recruited 61 participants, including 31 participants with high FoMO and 30 with low FoMO. All participants completed a modified Sentence Word Association Paradigm (SWAP) with combined behavioral data and event-related potential (ERP) recordings. We analyzed the endorsement rate and reaction time for different interpretations, along with the N400 and P600 components. Results showed that compared to the low FoMO group, individuals with high FoMO were less likely to endorse positive interpretations. They also responded more quickly when endorsing negative interpretations and rejecting positive interpretations. Furthermore, the high FoMO group exhibited a stronger N400 amplitude when processing positive interpretations. These findings suggest that individuals with high FoMO exhibit an implicit bias toward negative interpretations and a relative deficiency in both implicit and explicit positive interpretation biases, and they may have greater expectations and acceptance of negative information. This study offers important insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying FoMO and provides a valuable foundation for future intervention research.",

However, recent findings have questioned the robustness of this effect. To address these discrepancies, the present study reports two experiments aimed at replicating this phenomenon. In Experiment 1, young adults recalled details from cartoon clips, whereas Experiment 2 replicated the procedure of Madore et al. (2015) to examine the effect of ESI on AUT performance. Across both experiments, results provided no evidence supporting the effectiveness of ESI in enhancing creative idea generation. One possible explanation for these contrasting findings concerns the role of cultural context, as the present studies were conducted with Spanish participants, in contrast to previous research carried out in the United States. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of further research to clarify the conditions under which ESI may facilitate divergent thinking.",

Core requirements for conscious states have been clarified, and new\ndiagnostic tools—most notably the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) derived from TMS–\nEEG—are moving toward clinical use. PCI indicates about a 95% probability of detecting\nconsciousness in non-communicative patients when purposeful behavior is present. Recent\nstudies in neurotypical individuals and communicative patients have adopted refined statistical\nmethods accounting for regression-to-the-mean effects, along with rigorous awareness scales\ndirectly validated by subjective reports. Contrary to mainstream beliefs, these approaches\nconsistently suggest that some degree of stimulus awareness is necessary for above-chance\nperformance. Consciousness thus emerges not as an epiphenomenon but as a prerequisite for\nmost purposeful behaviors in humans. This methodological progress opens new opportunities to\nbridge the long-standing divide between consciousness and cognitive sciences. At the same time,\nconsciousness, intelligence and cognitive abilities are not identical: they can dissociate in\nrevealing ways. Subjective experience exceeds its behavioral expression and remains accessible\nonly to the experiencer. These observations motivate Integrated Information Theory, an\nexplanatory framework that generate testable predictions about conscious states and qualitative\ncontents independently of behavior, while also predicting that energy efficiency requirements\nmay give rise to a tight link between consciousness and cognition in biological systems.

          "abstract": "Text complexity, an important factor of text-based learning, is typically operationalized through measures of readability and cohesion. However, cognitive load theory assumes that in addition to these measures the number of idea units that need to be held in working memory simultaneously to understand the text’s content substantially influences text complexity. This factor termed element interactivity can impact both intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. However, assessing element interactivity for texts is challenging and its influence is mostly investigated by comparing entirely different learning materials. In this study, we developed two versions of an expository text that differed only in terms of element interactivity, by making changes to argumentative structure, adherence to the given-new principle, inference explication and the amount of subordinate information. We controlled for readability, cohesion, and text length. In Experiment 1, participants who studied the text high in element interactivity demonstrated significantly poorer comprehension on a short-answer-test compared to those who studied the text low in element interactivity. However, there were no significant differences in participants’ cognitive load ratings. In Experiment 2, we presented both texts to raters which allowed for a more accurate comparison of the texts. Under these conditions, we found significant differences in judgments of intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. Our results indicate that element interactivity of a text can be manipulated systematically and that this manipulation impacts both text comprehension and cognitive load. This adds an important dimension to the conceptualization of text complexity, extending traditional measures like readability and cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Cloze tests have a long history and have been used to measure various abilities, including intelligence, reading comprehension, and language proficiency. To locate cloze tests within a nomological network of cognitive abilities, we conducted a multi-level random effects meta-analysis covering 110 years of research. Studies were eligible if they provided a measure of association between a cognitive fill-in-the-gap test and any cognitive ability test. We synthesized manifest correlations from 89 studies (N = 37,912, k = 634) and found an average correlation of r = .54 (95% CI [.49, .59], k = 485) with crystallized intelligence, r = .48 (95% CI [.42, .54], k = 69) with fluid intelligence and r =.61 (95% CI [.46, .77], \nk = 32) with general intelligence. While today's application of the typical cloze is to measure reading comprehension, our results revealed a similarly strong association with a broad range of crystallized abilities. None of the key moderators we investigated—text base, administration mode, deletion pattern, and response type—showed a significant effect. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings. We conclude by revisiting the origin of the cloze test and highlighting the need for systematic studies on how different cloze test designs affect construct validity. Whereas the meta-analytic database predominantly originates from language research, where cloze tests are entrenched as markers of language proficiency, we propose reframing cloze tests as a versatile intelligence test format—just like multiple-choice tests constitute a testing method—that can be tailored to assess various specific cognitive abilities.",

We compared computational models to test how social feedback, expectations, and PEs related to momentary affect. Results showed that social feedback and PEs best explained affective fluctuations. Social PEs predicted anxiety more strongly than social feedback; the opposite pattern was observed for mood. Further analyses indicated that higher social anxiety symptoms heightened affective responses to social feedback, whereas depressive symptoms increased sensitivity to negative PEs for mood and to social feedback for anxiety.

          "abstract": "Background. Prior studies suggest that loneliness during the school years may impair later academic performance, yet this association may be confounded by early-life socioenvironmental conditions. We examine (1) whether three early-life socioenvironmental factors (material hardship, neighbourhood conditions, and child maltreatment) and child’s verbal ability at age of 5 are associated with childhood loneliness and its persistence from ages 5 to 9; and (2) whether childhood loneliness is associated with three educational achievement indicators (low high school grades, out-of-school suspension, and educational attainment) at age 22 after adjusting for early-life socioenvironmental factors. Methods. We used data from a U.S. birth-cohort study, the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (original sample collected in 1998, n = 4,898; study sample n = 2,456). Loneliness was measured using the item “Child complains of loneliness,” reported by the primary caregiver. We applied binomial logistic regression to address the first research question and generalized propensity score weighting and weighted g-computation to explore the second question. Results. Among the children in our sample, 24.6% experienced transient loneliness, while 6.8% experienced persistent loneliness. Higher material hardship (OR= 1.17, 95% CI= 1.07-1.28) and child maltreatment (OR=1.19, 95% CI= 1.08-1.30) early in life were associated with higher odds of childhood loneliness. Moreover, higher material hardship was associated with higher odds of persistent loneliness (OR= 1.39, 95% CI= 1.21-1.60). Childhood loneliness was not associated with high-school grades, out-of-school suspension, or educational attainment in young adulthood. Conclusions. Early-life adversities are associated with childhood loneliness and its persistence. However, there was no evidence of an association between childhood loneliness and educational achievement in young adulthood.",

Experiment 1 tested second graders, fifth graders, and young adults using children-adapted materials (i.e. TV cartoons), while Experiment 2 tested fifth graders using non-adapted materials. Both experiments confirmed that ESI improved the recall of episodic details compared to a control condition. Additionally, developmental differences in episodic recall in Experiment 1 disappeared after controlling for total verbal production, suggesting that children’s episodic memory benefits when recalling materials that are child-friendly. Conversely, unexpected findings regarding transfer effect to divergent thinking revealed no transfer effects in Experiment 2 (non-adapted materials) and a significant increase in idea fluency and flexibility following the control condition in Experiment 1 (children-adapted materials). This result may be explained by a positive mood induction, as general questions accompanied by child-friendly videos could enhance creative performance following the control condition.

Moreover, the use of IVR for the prevention of gender-based violence offers a promising approach to addressing issues such as sexual harassment. Despite the growing interest in IVR as a preventive tool, research on its effectiveness in fostering empathy and changing attitudes toward gender-based violence through first-person perspective-taking and embodiment remains limited, distinguishing this approach from others that may merely present harassment scenarios without altering the participant’s visual perspective. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of REVISE (REalidad Virtual Inmersiva y SExualidad, in Spanish), an IVR intervention designed to promote empathy and reduce sexual harassment behaviors in heterosexual cisgender men. By experiencing sexual harassment from the victim's perspective, REVISE seeks to encourage  behavioral changes and modify attitudes related to gender roles.\nMethods: Ninety heterosexual cisgender couples will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: 1) IVR with identity exchange in a sexual harassment scenario, 2) IVR with identity exchange in a non-harassment scenario, or 3) observation of a third-person harassment scene. The intervention will consist of a single virtual reality session followed by post-intervention assessments and a three-month follow-up. Multimodal data will be collected using self-report questionnaires, physiological measures (eye-tracking and pupillometry), and semi-structured interviews. The primary outcome will be changes in empathy, while secondary outcomes will assess attitudes toward gender roles and harassment.\nDiscussion: The REVISE trial will contribute to the growing field of virtual interventions for the prevention of gender-based violence. By integrating real-time embodiment, behavioral simulation, and multimodal assessment, the study is expected to provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of perspective-taking via IVR. Findings will inform the development of future gender-transformative interventions that aim to address sexual harassment and promote prosocial behavior in men within intimate relationships.\nTrial Registration: This trial was registered under the title: “A virtual reality couples’ intervention for sexual victimization prevention: A gender-swapping transformative approach (REVISE)” which is available at ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier number NCT06839937 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06839937).

Here, we test how algorithms with and without prescribed social preferences, shape social decision-making and explore delegating further decisions. In an incentivized online experiment (n = 1290), participants provided social preferences for outcomes favoring oneself or an anonymous other, Social Value Orientation (SVO), as input to a decision-making algorithm. We manipulated whether for each SVO money division question, participants saw no default options (representing providing training data) or proself/prosocial default options (representing oversight of algorithms with prescribed selfish/prosocial preferences). Default options were either from an algorithm or not. Results showed that participants’ social preferences were not significantly impacted by providing input to an algorithm without prescribed preferences (vs no defaults) nor by an algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences (vs the same defaults without an algorithm and vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences). Only providing input for an algorithm with prescribed proself preferences resulted in more selfish social preferences (vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences and vs the algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences). Moreover, counter to this, participants perceived being less influenced by proself than prosocial defaults. Most people delegated a second social decision-making task to the algorithm they were exposed to. These findings suggest that human oversight could be insufficient to address algorithmic biases, as individuals act more selfishly when exposed to pre-existing selfish tendencies in algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Living organisms constantly balance exploration and exploitation to adapt to changing environments.\nWhile the neuromodulator noradrenaline (NA) is known to regulate arousal, attention, and information\nseeking, its precise computational function remains elusive. Here, we propose an integrative theory of\nthe noradrenergic system, suggesting that it encodes expected information gain (EIG), a measure of how\ninformative the environment is over time, and that it uses this quantity for the meta-control of adaptive\nbehavior. We illustrate this theory using a hierarchical active inference model in which the NA system\nacts as a higher-level meta-controller that dynamically adjusts a set of parameters (η) of a lower-level\nbehavioral controller, modulating exploration rate, the balance between deliberative and habitual control,\nperceptual precision, learning rate, and cognitive flexibility. Simulations demonstrate that NA-based\nEIG estimation and meta-control enhance performance in volatile environments by promoting directed\nexploration, facilitating rapid shifts away from maladaptive habits, sharpening sensory evidence, and\naccelerating learning following context changes. These results unify multiple facets of noradrenergic\nfunction under a single computational objective, providing a novel perspective to explain tonic and\nphasic NA activity in estimating EIG and meta-controlling behavior. Summing up, this framework\nprovides a principled link between neuromodulation, exploration, and adaptive behavior, suggesting\nthat the noradrenergic system implements a fundamental mechanism for inferring and exploiting the\ninformational richness of the environment.",

Reflexive thematic analysis of 6-month semi-structured interviews elaborated pathways and the perceived contribution of BiH. \n\nFindings: Across the sample, anxiety and all candidate mechanisms improved over six months. Greater improvements in coping, reductions in cognitive challenges, and reduced participation-related difficulties were each associated with greater anxiety improvement. Qualitative themes clarified these pathways: (1) reactive in-the-moment coping and developing awareness of long-term patterns; (2) planning/structuring daily life and scaffolding anxiety management (e.g., reminders, solution prompts); and (3) increased participation/reduced isolation and earlier, more effective help-seeking.\n\nPractical implications: Findings support integrating guided digital supports like BiH as scalable complements to university provision, particularly where designs reduce cognitive burden, scaffold participation, and are responsive to neurodivergent needs. \n\nOriginality/value: In a largely neurodivergent cohort, BiH use was associated with anxiety improvement, and mixed-methods integration illuminated plausible emotional, cognitive, and social mechanisms of change. The study advances a mechanism-focused, neuroinclusive evaluation of hybrid digital support in higher education.",

          "abstract": "In an ever-changing environment, synchronizing automatic and controlled behaviors is essential for successful adaptation. Yet, the relationship between these behaviors is often debated, partly due to the diverse approaches used to investigate it. The current study set out to untangle how statistical learning of environmental regularities – a process that facilitates automatic behaviors – and inhibitory control interact when both operate concurrently. Participants completed a visual four-choice reaction time paradigm that combined a statistical learning task with the Eriksen flanker task. In this novel paradigm, a central target stimulus, surrounded by flanker stimuli, was either predictable or unpredictable based on the statistical regularities induced by the sequence of target stimuli. Statistical learning was indexed by the performance difference between predictable and unpredictable trials. Inhibitory control was reflected by the flanker congruency effect, i.e., the performance difference between congruent and incongruent trials. According to our results, statistical learning and inhibitory control interacted in a cooperative way: Statistical learning was improved in the incongruent condition, and the flanker congruency effect was reduced on predictable relative to unpredictable trials. Altogether, our results suggest that reliance on environmental regularities can ease control demands, while conflict-driven control processes may, in turn, enhance the acquisition of predictive regularities.",

          "abstract": "Humans readily categorize their social environment based on visible features regarded as diagnostic for group membership (e.g., skin color, hair color, body morphology) along lines of various social dimensions, including gender, race, age, to name just a few. Despite overwhelming evidence for the notion that these dimensions can be used to bring categorical order into the world, psychologists know surprisingly little about what determines which of these lenses is active in a given moment. The present research examines whether ecological meta-contrast provides an affordance to social categorization and selective category use. Across seven studies (N = 1,234), we manipulated meta-contrast ratios by varying the dispersion of race- and gender-related facial features to examine their effects on spontaneous social categorization. Categorization was assessed using the “Who Said What?” paradigm (Taylor et al., 1978), with categorization parameters estimated via multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (Klauer &amp; Wegener, 1998), and a Speeded Categorization task (Thomas et al., 2014). Participants consistently categorized faces by race (Studies 1a, 2a) and gender (Studies 1b, 2b), regardless of meta-contrast ratio. However, when race and gender were crossed (Studies 3, 4, 5), significant interaction effects emerged: categorization along the low meta-contrast dimension decreased, while it increased along the high-meta-contrast dimension. These findings provide initial evidence that meta-contrast modulates the relative accessibility of social categorizations. The distribution of category-related features within a social information ecology thus provides affordance to some categorizations more readily than others. Study-specific patterns related to stimuli and task constraints are discussed to inform future research.",

          "abstract": "When people encode items into working memory, the time taken to complete a secondary task slows as the memory load increases but becomes faster during retention intervals. The findings are best explained by either a reconfiguration process needed only during encoding, or by a resource-depletion model in which encoding of each item drains cognitive resource that recovers during retention. We tested diverging predictions of these accounts with a running span complex span task. List-length was unpredictable, and participants had to recall only the most recently presented N memory items. According to the reconfiguration account, after N items are presented, response times for the secondary task should stabilize. This should occur because the amount of updating required at each memory item beyond N should be equivalent. According to the resource-depletion account, each new encoding event beyond N should continue to deplete a limited resource. This depletion results in a continued slowing of response times for the secondary task. Across four experiments, secondary task response times increased with each new memory item, even after the required memory load was reached. The only exception was with memory loads of 2 where secondary task response times plateaued after 2 items. These findings place limits on reconfiguration as a comprehensive explanation for short-term memory but are mostly in line with a modified resource-depletion account.",

          "abstract": "Synchronous behaviour is widespread across social species and is a common feature of human social interaction. Prior research shows that synchrony can alter self–other processing, yet findings are inconsistent, potentially due to task differences and individual variability. In this preregistered study (54 dyads), we examined whether synchronous finger tapping influences self–other cognition across three domains: episodic memory, source memory, and emotion. Synchrony increased source memory performance but did not affect item memory. In contrast, synchrony heightened emotional egocentric bias, suggesting that synchrony can sharpen self–other differentiation in memory while increasing reliance on one’s own affective state when inferring others’ emotions. Social dominance moderated these effects. Dyads with higher combined dominance synchronized more strongly, and dominant individuals showed greater egocentric responding in memory tasks and retained egocentric bias in source memory even after synchrony. These findings highlight domain-specific consequences of synchrony and the importance of interpersonal traits in shaping synchrony outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The evidence for the structure of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model relies heavily on analyses of correlations among DSM diagnoses, which entrenches some of their limitations. In this study, we deconstructed the mental disorders covered in HiTOP into individual symptoms—with personality disorders represented via item-level assessment of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders facets—and rebuilt the HiTOP model from the ground up. Participants self-selected into an online mental health study and were randomly split into primary (n = 11,762) and hold-out (n = 3,000) samples to identify a robust hierarchy of empirically derived constructs in the results, ranging from symptoms and syndromes to very broad ‘superspectra’ of psychopathology. In each sample, both hierarchical clustering and hierarchical principal components analyses were used; the final hierarchical structure was derived based on points of cross-sample and cross-method agreement. The resulting model was remarkably similar to the HiTOP model, including nearly all of the same subfactors, spectra, and superspectra—albeit with some reorganisation in the structure. The inclusion of broad hypomania/disinhibition and pathological introversion dimensions represented the most prominent differences compared to the current higher-order structure of HiTOP. The detailed lower-order constructs found here also mirrored many of the existing components and traits in HiTOP, as well as indicating some potential areas for revision. Finally, we re-mapped the disorders included in the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 onto the new model. Overall, the results suggest that the structural foundations of the HiTOP model are largely sound.",

          "abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is often praised for its ecological validity, under the assumption that change observed in EMA data reflects change in the underlying constructs, independent of study participation. However, participation itself may threaten ecological validity as participants’ involvement in an EMA study may already alter their experiences, behavior or responses. Existing research on such participation effects has primarily documented their occurrence rather than explained the mechanisms through which they arise. To advance this understanding, we developed a taxonomy of potential sources of (measurement-induced) change in EMA data. This taxonomy includes increased reflection on assessed constructs (i.e., measurement reactivity), alterations to daily routines (i.e., measurement interference), shifts in how participants interpret items or response scales (i.e., reconceptualization or recalibration), practice in gauging internal states (i.e., improved introspection), and declining participant engagement (i.e., heightened careless responding or reduced compliance). Identifying these distinct sources of change highlights the need for systematic investigation of their impact and the development of targeted mitigation strategies. We therefore outline a research agenda focusing on assessing and experimentally manipulating each source of measurement-induced change in isolation. In sum, this paper aims to initiate a collective effort among EMA researchers to clarify the mechanisms by which study participation shapes data, and to safeguard EMA’s promise of ecological validity. \n\nKeywords: experience sampling methodology, measurement reactivity, (ecological) validity, response shifts, careless or insufficient effort responding",

We administered six tasks to N = 48 individuals from four species, spanning 10 sessions over 1.5 years. Task performance was most strongly predicted by stable, individual-specific characteristics rather than transient or group-level variables. Using additional data from the same individuals in other tasks, we found substantial positive correlations between non-social tasks. In contrast, tasks measuring social cognition were neither correlated with each other nor with non-social measures. Future studies should work towards mechanistic models of great apes’ cognitive processes to build an understanding of the evolution of cognition based on process-level commonalities across species.",

          "authors": "William Meese",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Modern Constructivist Model of Motivated Self-Protection (MCM-MSP), an integrative and novel theoretical account of two distinguishable forms of self-protection motivation that are underlain by diverging patterns in psychophysiological processes: (1) defensive arousal, which opposes self-threats and their implied conceptual representations to prevent self-concept instability and related consequences and (2) intrapsychic conflict, which compels restoration of self-concept stability and self-evaluative equanimity after one accepts the personal implications of a self-threat. The MCM-MSP locates each motivational orientation within a process model that describes when, how, and to what effect it uniquely compels one to strategically prevent self-concept instability or resolve it. This new explanation of self-protection motivation provides generative avenues for future research, including new ways to synthesize research examining defensive responses, new experimental approaches to testing self-protection strategies’ total causal effect, and stronger descriptions of self-protection motivation’s psychological construction using mixed-methods research and large language models.",

          "abstract": "Background: Early adolescence (ages 10–14) is a critical developmental stage marked by rapid psychosocial changes. Understanding how depressive symptoms interact with both intrapersonal and interpersonal factors during this period is essential for effective prevention and intervention.\nMethods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 2,185 adolescents aged 10–14, assessing depressive symptoms, intrapersonal factors (academic stress and self-compassion), and interpersonal factors (attachment style, family functioning, and multidimensional perceived social support). A Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) were employed to identify: (1) bridge constructs linking symptoms with intra- and interpersonal domains; and (2) potential directional pathways among variables.\nResults: Three key bridge nodes emerged: motor retardation/restlessness, academic stress, and attachment anxiety. These nodes served as critical connectors between depressive symptoms and their associated domains. The DAG analysis indicated that perceived family support acted as an upstream ancestor node, influencing depressive symptoms indirectly through self-compassion, academic stress, and attachment anxiety. Furthermore, feedback loops revealed that affective symptoms could intensify academic stress and attachment anxiety, thereby triggering downstream symptoms.\nConclusion: Findings underscore the distinct clinical manifestation of depression in early adolescence. For the early identification of adolescent depression, efforts should take into account not only emotional indicators but also behavioral withdrawal and energy-related signs, rather than relying solely on overall symptom severity scores. Interventions for this age group are likely to be most effective when deployed across multiple levels, including intrapersonal, interpersonal, and symptom-focused domains, rather than being confined to a single area.",

          "abstract": "Hallucinations sit at the crossroads of philosophy and the empirical sciences, but are often approached with divergent aims. In philosophy, they are mainly treated stipulatively as experiences subjectively indistinguishable from veridical perception and used to probe theories of perception, justification, and consciousness. Empirical research, by contrast, investigates heterogeneous, clinically embedded hallucinatory phenomena, many of which differ phenomenologically from ordinary perception. This paper diagnoses the conceptual misalignment that follows from this divergence and offers a preliminary framework to narrow it through conceptual analysis. Rather than advancing a single unifying theory, I clarify key distinctions, including indistinguishability, insight, sense of reality, agency, and ownership, and sketch points of contact with constructs in the sciences. First, I examine leading empirical models—bottom-up, top-down, and predictive processing—highlighting what each explains and where each is limited. Second, I re-situate hallucinations within core philosophical debates on perception, mental imagery, and phenomenology, showing how empirical findings both inform and complicate current accounts. Third, I assess interdisciplinary developments that challenge unitary models and support pluralist, integrative approaches. Hallucinations are thus recast as a family of related phenomena, and the analysis provides theoretical coordinates for more productive interaction between philosophy and science",

          "abstract": "This paper leverages a variation in sensorimotor skills to explain the absorption of Neanderthals into Homo sapiens population. The paper leans on the evidence that Neanderthal DNA is implicated in Autism susceptibility and on the Neanderthal extinction theory of lack of division of labor between the sexes of the Neanderthal population. The variation in the action perception and action control meant a difference in execution capabilities between the Neanderthal and Homosapien men as well as a variation in the female evaluation skills of the male in the population for mating. Given the evidence of Neanderthal’s autism link, lack of projectile based tools, but greater stone tool innovation and ingenuity, leads me in proposing hypotheses that outline the synergy of Neanderthal innovation and early Homo sapiens superior execution during the period of coexistence. Numerical constraint on Neanderthal population is intrinsic to the evolution of an asocial innovation mind versus an execution focused mind with a bent towards socially acquired innovation requiring a greater number of individuals for transmission of information. Crucial innovations in Neanderthal era may have kickstarted the theoretical mind at the expense of fine-tuned sensorimotor skills of action perception and action control.",

          "abstract": "Bilinguals frequently code-switch during conversations, a behavior often viewed as creating processing challenges for listeners. However, code-switching may also enhance comprehension and memory by directing attention to key information. This study tested whether bilinguals recall information better in code-switched contexts compared to single-language contexts and explored whether code-switching experience amplifies this benefit. In a pre-registered study, Spanish-English bilinguals listened to short vignettes containing both single-language and code-switched segments. Participants recalled details more accurately when they had been presented within a code-switched sentence, suggesting that switches act as cues that boost attention and memory encoding. Moreover, bilinguals with greater everyday code-switching experience showed the strongest recall benefits, supporting the idea that listeners learn to associate switches with communicative importance. These findings challenge the long-standing view that code-switching primarily imposes cognitive costs in comprehension. Instead, they reveal how bilinguals leverage the communicative value of code-switches to enhance memory for linguistic content. By demonstrating that code-switches can promote learning and retention, this study highlights the potential for code-switching to serve as a communicative tool, particularly in contexts where understanding and recalling information is critical.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that language impacts cognition across various domains. Accumulating evidence suggests that multilinguals are less emotionally reactive in an acquired language (L2) than a native language (L1), and that bilinguals undergoing psychiatric assessment may present with fewer symptoms in L2 than L1. This scoping review provides an overview of studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) to compare bilinguals’ neural activity when performing the same cognitive tasks in their L1 and L2. Given the review’s broad inclusion criteria, hypotheses were posed at a broad level: 1) that ERP amplitudes would be greater in participants’ L2 than in their L1, and 2) that ERP latencies would be longer in participants’ L2 than in their L1. A systematic search of the PsycInfo database identified 69 potentially relevant records, of which eight were included, together reporting ERP data for 202 participants. Studies showed considerable heterogeneity in participant languages spoken, cognitive tasks employed, ERP components studied, and analyses performed on the ERP components. Across studies, there was no consistent pattern for amplitudes, which were variously greater in L2, greater in L1, or not significantly different. In contrast, longer ERP latencies in L2 relative to L1 were reported in all but one study, supporting the review’s second hypothesis. These findings give a snapshot of current evidence on the topic, while demonstrating the need for further research replicating and extending existing results.",

Understanding the origins of this link is important for informing policy to reduce social inequalities. Potential competing explanations have been investigated and a comprehensive review of the strength of this evidence is required to inform progress towards an integrated model of the underlying mechanisms. We systematically searched ten databases for studies published in English between 1960 and 2025. The eligibility criteria included a quantitative design, a community sample of children or adolescents, measures of SES and CP, longitudinal analyses of the association between SES and CP, and results informing on the potential mechanisms. We identified 38 papers that met the eligibility criteria, comprising 41 individual studies included in the review. Family stress pathways were the most frequently studied mechanisms; however, the results were mixed. There was some support for pathways involving warm and supportive parenting and somewhat weaker support for supervision and discipline pathways. Investment pathways involving cultural/educational resources, neighbourhood characteristics, and models incorporating family stress and investment pathways were found to have received considerable support. There was also evidence that factors such as child’s diet and associations with antisocial peers may contribute. These findings support an integrated model of the mechanisms linking SES and CP. This model can provide targets for interventions aiming to reduce CP inequalities and sets the agenda for research to elucidate the mechanisms further.",

The post-COVID-19 period has seen an increase in self-reported and diagnosed EF deficits (EFDs).  This quality improvement study evaluated the Untapped Learning (UL) program, a personalized, movement and mentorship-based EF program for students aged 11-24, who predominantly have self-reported EFDs. Method: Students were paired with trained coaches and participated in weekly one-on-one sessions for the duration of one school semester. Sessions included movement and targeted EF skills training. Students completed pre-post surveys assessing five EF skills (organization, planning, communication, task completion, and mentality) across three school semesters in total. Results: The program showed significant overall improvements across all semesters in both a younger population (age 11-18, n= 221) (p&lt;0.02 for all semesters) and post-secondary (PS) age population (18-24 years old, n= 90) (p&lt;0.02 for all semesters). When stratified by sex, males demonstrated greater overall improvements than females in both cohorts. Females showed a consistent increase in planning skills in the post-secondary cohorts, indicating potential sex-specific response patterns or survey sensitivity issues. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the program’s global effectiveness across age groups and highlight the need for greater sex-specificity in designing personalized mentorship programs.\nKeywords: Executive function, executive function disorders, movement, mentorship, adolescent",

          "authors": "Douglas Guilbeault; Spencer Caplan; Charles Yang",
          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle throughout the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' choices systematically deviate from both imitation and optimization. Instead, they follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their choices stabilize. We effectively estimate this threshold using the Tolerance Principle (TP), a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. We show that threshold-based agents produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents, while also providing a better model of how a critical mass of dissenters can overturn conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. Furthermore, in a preregistered dyadic experiment requiring people to infer non-linguistic behavioral patterns amid controlled levels of noise in observed signals, TP outperforms all other models at reproducing learning rates among human participants. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

          "abstract": "After conditional discrimination training in which stimulus A served as the sample and stimulus B as the comparison stimulus, it is sometimes observed that the reverse relation, where B is presented as the sample and A as the comparison stimulus, emerges without explicit training. This phenomenon is referred to as the emergence of symmetry. The present study investigated this phenomenon in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) using a matching-to-sample task involving both figures and objects. Tino was first trained on an arbitrary matching task in which figures served as samples and objects as comparison stimuli (F–O). Following this acquisition phase, baseline training was conducted in which object–object (O–O) and figure–figure (F–F) identity matching trials, along with F–O trials, were presented in random order and with equal frequency within each session. Tino then participated in 24 test sessions, each of which included a single symmetry test trial (object–figure, O–F), in which an object was presented as the sample and figures as the comparison stimuli. On these O–F trials, he demonstrated significantly above-chance accuracy. These results suggest that prior differential reinforcement training involving identity matching, in which all stimuli were used both as samples and as comparison stimuli, combined with the low frequency of nonreinforced test trials, may have contributed to the successful emergence of symmetry without degradation in performance.",

Formalizing theories (i.e. expressing them in the precise language of mathematics or computer code) offers many benefits to the field: it increases conceptual clarity; advances cumulative science; allows integration with other disciplines; and guides future research. Theory formalization is especially important to give substance to thinking about complex systems, where it can help evaluate the effects of candidate interventions.

Across four studies and 1,004 participants (547 U.S. adults from Prolific, 457 diverse undergraduates), antagonistic and disinhibited forms of psychopathy demonstrated stronger negative associations with positive empathy compared to negative empathy. Yet when participants completed a behavioral task that provided participants with opportunities to engage in empathic engagement with virtual strangers, participants exhibited no preference for negative versus positive empathy based on their psychopathic traits.

Building on evidence that procedural variations can hinder or accelerate therapeutic change, this study aimed to extend previous findings supporting eliminating safety behaviors and engaging in fear-antagonistic actions, and to clarify whether fear-antagonistic actions confer exposure augmentation effects beyond compulsory elimination of safety behaviors. Participants (N=109) were randomly assigned to receive standard exposure (EXP; n=32), exposure with safety behavior fading (EXP+SBF; n=31), exposure with fear-antagonistic actions (EXP+AA; n=35), or waitlist control (WLC; n=11). Regarding reductions in peak fear, EXP+AA outperformed EXP in both treatment and generalization contexts through post-treatment and 1-month follow-up, whereas EXP+SBF outperformed EXP only in the treatment context through 1-month follow-up, and all active interventions outperformed WLC.  Moreover, both EXP+AA and EXP+SBF exhibited greater reductions in acrophobia severity relative to EXP from pre-treatment to 1-month follow-up. EXP+AA and EXP+SBF also showed greater heart rate increases from pre- to post-treatment compared to EXP in the treatment context, whereas only EXP+AA exhibited greater HR increases in the generalization context. Marked reductions in height overestimation bias occurred for all active groups from pre- to post-treatment, and these effects were sustained at 1-month follow-up. Findings suggest that fear-antagonistic actions and safety behavior fading improves treatment outcomes, perhaps due to enhancing physiological arousal and attenuating height overestimation. Additionally, the findings suggest that height overestimation is correlated with fear expression, and reductions in fear occur in tandem with reductions in this perceptual bias.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive control is a suite of processes that helps individuals pursue goals despite resistance or uncertainty about what to do. Deficits of cognitive control underlie compulsive or risky behavior, as well as other clinical challenges associated with difficulties in regulating impulses, attention, thoughts, and feelings. Although cognitive control has been extensively studied as a dynamic feedback loop of perception, valuation, and action, it remains incompletely understood as a cohesive dynamic and distributed neural process. Here, we critically examine the history of and advances in the study of cognitive control, including how metaphors and cultural norms of power, morality, and rationality are intertwined with definitions of control, to consider holistically how different models explain which brain regions act as controllers. Controllers, the source of top-down signals, are typically localized in regions whose neural activations implement elementary component processes of control, including conflict monitoring and behavioral inhibition. Top-down signals from these regions guide the activation of other task-specific regions, biasing them towards task-specific activity patterns. A relatively new approach, network control theory, has roots in dynamical systems theory and systems engineering. This approach can mathematically show that controllers are regions with strongly nested and recurrent anatomical connectivity that efficiently propagate top-down signals, and precisely estimate the amount, location, and timing of signaling required to bias global activity to task-specific patterns. Importantly, the theory converges with established findings, provides new mathematical tools and intuitions for understanding control loops across levels of analysis, and naturally produces graded predictions of control across brain regions and modules of psychological function that have been unconsidered, marginalized, or indirectly linked. We describe how psychological and network control approaches converge and diverge, noting directions for future integration that could strengthen and sharpen our understanding and predictions of how the brain instantiates cognitive control.",

          "abstract": "The hippocampus is one of the first brain regions to deteriorate with age, accounting for some forms of memory loss in older adults, akin to a mild form of hippocampal amnesia. There exist several process-based accounts of the effects of hippocampal damage on memory, such as impairments in context-specific memory with spared gist-based memory, or deficits in recollection alongside intact familiarity-based retrieval. In contrast, representational accounts claim that hippocampal involvement depends on the content of the memory—high-dimensional, containing arbitrary associations (e.g., scenes) versus lower-dimensional, single-items (e.g., objects). Thus, representational theories uniquely predict that aging should differentially impair retrieval depending on the memory content (high- versus lower-dimensional) when the retrieval process is held constant. However, testing this prediction is difficult because most recall or recognition tasks draw upon arbitrary associations, which are high-dimensional, even if the memoranda are single items (e.g., Did this item appear in the study context? Which item was paired with this cue?). We tested memory in younger and older adults in a visual recall task that circumvents this problem by cueing memory with a partial “patch view” of a studied item, analogous to word-stem completion. Thus, the newly learned associations needed for good retrieval were not arbitrary but rather linked parts of a coherent image. For scenes, such cued retrieval required item-to-item associations, but for objects it involved intra-item associations. Older adults were impaired relative to younger, for patch-cued recall of scenes but not objects. Given hippocampal deterioration with age, this supports representational accounts of memory.",

          "abstract": "Mate value discrepancy (MVD)—the perceived difference in desirability between partners based on traits like appearance, personality, and status—has been linked to greater conflict and jealousy in monogamous relationships. However, no research has examined whether similar patterns occur in consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships, where partners consent to romantic or sexual relationships with others. In this study, participants in  monogamous (n = 312) and CNM (n = 200) relationships who were recruited through social media advertisements and snowball sampling, reported their own and up to two partners’ MV, how often they experience conflict, jealousy, perform mate retention with each partner, and whether they perceive same-sex relationships as competitive (i.e., intrasexual competitiveness). We also examine whether people who have more experience with CNM, or engage more often in common CNM relationship maintenance practices, report less conflict, jealousy, mate retention, and competitiveness. Across relationship types, participants who rated themselves lower in mate value (MV) reported more conflict and intrasexual competitiveness with their primary partner. For those in CNM relationships, perceiving oneself as higher in MV than a secondary partner predicted greater conflict, jealousy, and mate retention. CNM relationship maintenance practices, such as disclosure of extra-pair attractions, comfort discussing jealousy, compersion, and shared extra-pair sexual experiences were associated with reduced conflict and jealousy. In contrast, endorsement of partner hierarchy, or the tendency to prioritize certain partners over others, was associated with more conflict, jealousy, and mate retention. These findings suggest that while self-perceived MV may shape relational dynamics, relational outcomes may be buffered or intensified by individual differences in relationship experience, and engagement in relationship maintenance practices.",

          "abstract": "People’s propensity to imitate others’ actions is well documented. However, research on imitation remains mainly focused on dyadic social interactions, disregarding that we often interact with others as parts of larger groups. Extending sparse research on imitation beyond dyadic interactions, the current study investigated how anticipated imitation effects become modulated in social interactions between groups. Participants performed an anticipated imitation task in a virtual environment depicting four animated hands that were controlled by the participant, a virtual co-actor, and two virtual agents of an opposing dyad, respectively. Participants responded to symbolic stimuli by lifting their index or middle finger and performed the task either alone or together with their co-actor, while either one or both agent(s) of the opposing dyad imitated their responses. We found that participants’ task accuracy was affected by group-level congruency relations between the two dyads: Acting together with another co-actor was facilitated when both vs. one agent(s) of the opposing dyad imitated participants’ responses, while the opposite trend emerged when participants performed the task without their co-actor. A descriptively similar performance pattern in participants' response time data did not reach statistical significance. Explorative analysis showed that this performance pattern was moderated by participants’ general response speed and was obscured by participants who responded relatively fast on the task. Our findings indicate that anticipated responses of multiple interaction partners can play a causal role in controlling one’s own contributions to a social interaction and provide novel evidence that joint task representations encode actions on a group level.",

Although many investigations have explored the role of these systems in self-regulation independently, little work has examined how these systems cooperate to serve regulatory ability across contexts. This limitation has stymied the understanding of the neurophysiological substrates of self-regulation. Therefore, in a sample of 55 children (Mage = 5.85, SD = .80), the present study examined the coordination of cardiac and neural signals from rest and a mildly stressful task. Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) assessed the coupling of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) signals with heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) signals separately. HR- and RSA-dlPFC coupling was observed in both contexts. However, the timescales at which significant coupling was found were not consistent across contexts, cardiac signals, or dlPFC hemispheres. No significant associations were observed between coupling of any signal at any timescale and child positive and negative affect. Findings suggest that the coupling of cardiac and neurological systems is sensitive to timescale, context, and choice of cardiac signal. Future studies should consider other measures of behavioral regulation to better understand its potential relation with ANS-dlPFC coupling.",

          "abstract": "Movement sonification (i.e., translating kinematic measures into sound, providing auditory feedback), can enhance motor performance and (re)learning across both clinical and sports contexts. However, existing sonification systems vary widely, potentially affecting efficacy. Here, we categorize sonification systems based on the utilized sound (type) and onset (trigger) to elucidate potential differences in movement-, intuitiveness-, and motivation-related outcomes. Movement sonification systems as described in 107 included studies were classified into six sound types (specifically parameter mapping; PMs, musically informed; MIs, single tone; STs, rhythm; Rs, music-based; MBs, and environmental; Es) and four trigger types (event-, error-, trajectory-based, and continuous), and effects on outcomes were compared. Overall, positive effects on all outcomes were reported for all system types and triggers, with no clear pattern of advantages for any, except that learning retention is more consistently reported for triggers involving explicit learning strategies. In general, more subtle movement learning may benefit from more direct movement-sound coupling, implicit learning, and multi-component mappings. Additionally, systems providing rhythmic sounds (MIs, STs, Rs, and MBs) were more commonly used for periodic movements. Intuitiveness is rated highest for PMs and Rs, and motivation strongest for MIs, although all systems increase autonomous motivation, compared to no sonification. In conclusion, movement sonification systems generally improve performance but arguably work differently for different movements. Accordingly, MIs may be preferable for rehabilitation settings where motivation is crucial, while PMs that inform users about subtle kinematic aspects may especially support learning highly skilled movements. Standardizing terminology in future work will facilitate systematic cross-system comparisons.",

Research using bodily illusions shows that this sense relies on the integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive signals, but the role of multisensory predictions in body ownership remains less understood. We investigated this question using a modified rubber hand illusion paradigm. Two robotic arms delivered taps to two visible rubber hands while a third tapped the participant’s hidden real hand; one rubber hand received synchronous stimulation and the other varying temporal asynchronies. Visual feedback was manipulated across three conditions: full view of the approaching robotic touch probe and the touch event, occlusion of the approaching probe, or occlusion of the touch event itself. Participants indicated which rubber hand they felt the strongest sense of ownership over. Using a signal detection framework, we examined whether occluding predictive visual feedback affected sensitivity of body ownership judgments to visuotactile synchrony, perceptual bias in the illusion, or both. Our results show that occluding visual feedback of the approaching probe does not affect body ownership sensitivity to visuotactile signals; as long as the touch event is visible or its timing can be inferred from apparent motion, sensitivity remains unchanged. However, perceptual bias was reduced when tactile predictions were disrupted by occluding visual information about the approaching touch probe. These findings clarify how visually driven tactile predictions contribute to body ownership and demonstrate utility of signal detection analysis for dissociating sensitivity and bias in this fundamental aspect of bodily self-perception.",

For example, people extend most moral concern toward family and friends, followed by ingroup members (e.g., a co-worker), outgroup members (e.g., a foreign citizen), the environment (e.g., a coral reef), and, lastly, criminals (e.g., a murderer). However, these studies were all conducted in a few countries from the Anglosphere, raising doubt about the cross-cultural generalizability of the results. We analyzed a data set with 6,665 participants recruited from 41 cultural groups to explore cultural and individual variation in the hierarchy of moral concern. We find that (1) on average, across the 41 cultural groups, 11 of the 13 rankings in the typical hierarchy of moral concern replicated, pointing to substantial cultural similarities; (2) countries that are culturally more similar to the reference sample from the initial U.S. study showed a more similar hierarchy; (3) some rankings (e.g., prioritizing family and friends over human ingroups) replicated more often than others (e.g., prioritizing human outgroups over the environment) across countries; and (4) both cultural and individual differences were largest most pronounced examining people’s concern for non-human animals and the environment.",

          "abstract": "MLwrap is an R package designed to make the implementation of machine learning (ML) workflows accessible, efficient, and reproducible, particularly within the framework of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. The package provides a unified and minimalistic interface that covers all essential stages of predictive modeling, including data preprocessing, model construction, hyperparameter optimization, and sensitivity analysis. MLwrap supports a range of widely used algorithms, such as Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and XGBoost Decision Trees, and incorporates evidence-based default hyperparameter ranges to facilitate robust model selection. The workflow is organized into four core functions: preprocessing(), build_model(), fine_tuning(), and sensitivity_analysis(), which together streamline the entire ML pipeline and encapsulate all steps within a single, reproducible analysis object. Through two illustrative examples using the included sim_data dataset, this paper demonstrates the application of MLwrap to both regression and classification tasks, highlighting its capacity to simplify complex workflows and provide interpretable results. The package aims to empower analysts and researchers, especially in the health, social and behavioral sciences, to efficiently extract actionable insights from data while ensuring transparency and reproducibility in their analyses.

          "authors": "Clara Soberats; Roberto Zamparelli",
          "abstract": "The N400 component is widely interpreted as an index of lexical processing, whereas its role in sentence-level meaning integration remains a subject of major debate. Moreover, there is growing evidence that Late Positive Component (LPC) is also elicited by the effort to integrate local meaning within the sentence structure. Here, we present an EEG study designed to test the sensitivity of both components to higher-order syntactic structures such as dependencies. The main question we addressed was whether either the N400 or LPC would propagate to upcoming words in a sentence after encountering a lexical anomaly, and whether such a cascading effect would be modulated by constituent structure. We created 200 Italian sentences in which the object noun could be either semantically correct or anomalous. Additionally, half of the last prepositional phrases (PPs) of the sentences depended on the object determiner phrase (DP) (ext-DP), while the other half functioned as verbal complements (VP-mod), resulting in four experimental conditions: Correct VP-mod (e.g., A customer books this table for tomorrow), Correct ext-DP (e.g., The postman collects many letters of best wishes), Semantic VP-mod (e.g., A customer books this enemy for tomorrow), and Semantic ext-DP (e.g., The postman collects many cultures of best wishes). Results revealed a significant N400 at the object noun and an LPC when comparing correct to semantically anomalous sentences. LPC extended to all subsequent words in anomalous sentences, continuing until sentence end in both ext-DP and VP-mod conditions –indicating a propagation independent of PP dependency. In contrast, N400 effects at the noun of the PP were observed only in the Semantic ext-DP condition. These findings suggest that, once a lexical anomaly is introduced, semantic integration costs cascade across the sentence; however, the N400 appears more sensitive than the LPC to constituent structure and syntactic dependency.",

          "abstract": "Background:\n\nThe number of autistic students entering higher education (HE) has increased, yet many continue to face systemic barriers that can hinder their academic success. Despite their unique cognitive strengths, such as hyperfocus, attention to detail, and strong analytical skills, many autistic students report challenges with academic learning experiences. This study aimed to develop and validate the Academic Learning Experiences Questionnaire (ALEQ), a tool designed to assess specific learning experiences and inform autism-inclusive educational practices.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe co-created the ALEQ with autistic and non-autistic students to assess learning experiences across five academic contexts: small and large group teaching, self-directed study, examinations, and coursework. A total of 829 university students (formally-diagnosed autistic: n = 106; self-diagnosed autistic: n = 112; non-autistic: n = 611) completed an online survey comprising the ALEQ and an autism screening measure (SRS-2). To establish the ALEQ’s psychometric properties, we conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and tested for measurement invariance between the autistic and non-autistic groups.\n\nResults:\n\nThe ALEQ produced seven theoretically relevant factors with good local and global fit: Microtransitions’, Social Anxiety, Sensory Reactivity, Planning and Prioritising, Monotropic Focus, Group Work and Global Comprehension). Configural and metric invariance were supported for this factor solution, demonstrating equivalence of the factor loadings across groups and warranting examination of group differences in ALEQ scores. Using this final, 34-item version of the ALEQ, autistic students reported significantly more challenges than non-autistic students across all five subscales, with the greatest disparities in Sensory Reactivity and Microtransitions.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe ALEQ provides a structured way to understand the academic challenges that autistic students face in different learning contexts. By identifying key learning experiences, it offers both a practical tool for educators and a measurement instrument for researchers that can identify adjustment needs and, ultimately, enhance accessibility and inclusion in HE.",

          "abstract": "Parsing complex dynamic scenes is critical for navigating our visual world, and driving safely is a daily task that requires responding to hazardous events which unfold quickly. Theories of driver awareness suggest that drivers need to look at a hazard to detect them, particularly in anticipation of hazard onset. Indeed, scene context may guide eye movements to likely hazard locations. However, given the complexity of real road scenes, drivers may rely instead on explicit cues of an impending collision before identifying the correct location. In 2024, we recorded eye position while 30 licensed drivers localized hazards in annotated dashcam footage. On correct trials, drivers started to look at where the hazard will be 2s before onset, highlighting the importance of anticipatory processes in dynamic scene perception and safe driving. However, hazard-directed looking is not indicative of awareness, as 40% of missed hazards were foveated prior to response. Our results demonstrate early gaze guidance by scene context, which can help drivers anticipate hazards, an idea consistent with theories of driver awareness. However, looking directly at the hazard is not required to correctly detect them, and gaze alone should not be used as an index of awareness in driver monitoring systems.",

Binary Logistic Regression found that external factors did not predict the referee’s decision or VAR intervention. The high prevalence of overturn decisions may be expected as referee's are being advised to review potential errors and interestingly maintain decisions were more prevalent when related to the home team, potentially due to proximity bias of the home crowd.",

In the present preregistered study, 54\nhuman participants (10 male, 40 female) first completed risky decisions for themselves;\nwe then used their estimated risk preference to simulate choices of two other agents -\none with a similar, one with a dissimilar risk preference - whose preference participants\nlearned to then predict their decisions. Analysing the ERP data from the three types\nof decisions (self decisions; similar predictions; dissimilar predictions) revealed a late\nfronto-centro-parietal effect of decision difficulty (approx. 800 - 1000ms post-stimulus),\nwhich did not vary across decision types. In addition, we identified an earlier centroparietal component which distinguished similar predictions from self decisions (approx.\n550 - 800ms post-stimulus). Intriguingly and contrary to our hypothesis, no signal differentiating dissimilar predictions from self decisions was found. A classification analysis\nbetween the decision type pairs confirmed that similar predictions were more differentiable from self decisions than dissimilar predictions were. Altogether, our findings\nsuggest that the brain first identifies the agent of the decision early in the trial (particularly if preferences could be confused with one’s own), followed by a domain-general\nvaluation process.",

In the present work, we assessed whether implicit imagery task also enhances memory, and whether specific imagery modalities (motor, visual) selectively benefit the learning of related material. Seventy-two young adults completed a recognition task in which they learned action and non-action verbs presented after an implicit motor imagery task (i.e., hand mental rotation) or an implicit visual imagery task (i.e., number mental rotation). Results from both frequentist and Bayesian generalized mixed-effects models revealed a significant interaction between verb type and imagery modality. Congruent imagery modality (i.e. motor for action verbs, visual for non-action verbs) enhanced subsequent recognition compared to incongruent modality (i.e. motor for non-action verbs, visual for action verbs). These findings provide novel evidence that the effectiveness of mental imagery for learning is influenced by the congruence between imagery modality and the sensorimotor features of the learned items. They also suggest that mental imagery does not need to be fully voluntary or fully conscious to improve learning.",

          "abstract": "Perceiving myself as distinct from others rests upon distinguishing sensations that were generated by “me” from those that were not. Based on computational frameworks developed in the field of motor control, a common assumption is that the evaluation of predicted vs actual movement feedback by comparators is one of the first steps in establishing self-other distinction. In an attempt to uncover the brain areas implementing such comparisons, neuroimaging studies have predominantly used experimental manipulations of visual movement feedback. From these works, three candidate brain regions have emerged for visuomotor comparisons: the angular gyrus (AG), the extrastriate body area (EBA), and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, there is an ongoing debate about which of these regions, if any, implements a comparator in the sensorimotor sense; which kind of signals the visual input is compared against, and how dynamic this comparison is. In this mini review, I revisit the assumptions of classical proposals on visuomotor self-other distinction; discuss potential biases resulting from non-motoric cues in the above studies; highlight how differences in kinematic predictability result from different kinds of visual distortion—and how this could be capitalized on; and discuss the potential promises and pitfalls of recent experimental approaches including passive movement generation.",

          "abstract": "Playing online video games is a popular and highly common leisure time activity among adolescents, especially boys, raising concerns about its impact on mental health. While some research has found that higher gaming intensity is negatively associated with adolescent mental health, such negative outcomes especially seem to occur for a small subgroup of gamers exhibiting more problematic gaming behavior (e.g., Internet Gaming Disorder [IGD] symptoms). However, few studies have explicitly differentiated normal variation in gaming intensity from problematic gaming behavior. In this preregistered study, we therefore examined the relation between gaming intensity and mental health problems (i.e., life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, and loneliness) in early adolescence, controlling for IGD symptoms. Additionally, we examined the role of six gaming motives (i.e., competition, coping, fantasy, social, recreation, escape motives) in this association. Participants were 1,111 Dutch adolescents (51.5% girls, Mage = 12.8, SDage = 0.8) from the first wave of the Digital Youth and Identity (DiYo-I) project, who completed self-report questionnaires. Results indicated that gaming intensity was not significantly related to mental health problems in both boys and girls, controlling for IGD symptoms. Interestingly, gaming intensity was significantly related to mental health problems in both boys and girls without controlling for IGD symptoms. Generally, no significant moderation was observed across all six gaming motives. These results suggest that gaming intensity is not an independent risk factor for mental health in early adolescence in both boys and girls, and that this association is not moderated by gaming motives.",

          "abstract": "Episodes of extreme alcohol binge-drinking can result in memory loss, transient anterograde amnesic experiences known as memory blackouts (MBO). The current study investigates whether recognition memory is impacted by frequency of blackout experiences, and if false memories are more likely for those who regularly experience blackouts (n = 29) in comparison to a control group (n = 24) who had never experienced an MBO. Participants completed a recognition memory paradigm (a modified DRM task: Roediger &amp; McDermott, (1995)), with a follow-up remember/know/guess judgement, before-alcohol and after-alcohol in the same testing session, while the MBO group (n = 23) additionally completed the task in a subsequent testing session within 20-hours of a blackout, but when sober again. Both groups displayed reduced discrimination (d’) between old and new words and a more conservative response strategy after-alcohol, which remained for MBO participants after-MBO. Critical lure words elicited more false-alarms than weakly related or unrelated words, yet the overall frequency of false-alarms dropped after-alcohol and remained depressed after blackout for the MBO group. Critically, decile analysis revealed significant shifts in d’ for early deciles (1st-6th), suggesting impairment to recognition memory after-MBO; severity of individual MBO experiences may impact these results, although it is not possible to attribute them solely to blackout events. Future work should investigate whether adults with a longer history of alcohol-induced memory blackout experiences display an impairment in recollection and familiarity, or show atypical false memory acceptance rates.",

          "abstract": "Aims: Neurophysiological impairments in basic sensory processes are a hallmark feature in schizophrenia (SZ) and are commonly reported in individuals at-risk of developing SZ. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is linked to a higher incidence of later psychotic disorders, including SZ. However, it remains unclear whether basic sensory risk markers for SZ are equally characteristic of ASD. Methods: We performed a systematic review and subsequent meta-analyses of basic sensory risk markers for SZ in ASD. Following PRISMA guidelines, we included 44 studies, investigating prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (PPI), P50 suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN), N100, and P200 amplitudes. Meta-analyses were conducted for measures with data from ≥ five studies using comparable methodology. Results and Conclusions: Patient groups were predominantly male (~80%) with a mean age of 15.6 years. Findings were mixed, with high heterogeneity in all parameters except %PPI and startle amplitude. PPI, P50 suppression, and MMN qualified for meta-analyses, which revealed significant reductions in duration MMN and P50 amplitude to the first stimulus of paired-click paradigms. Although variability in methods precluded meta-analysis, most visual oddball studies reported significantly increased N100 amplitudes in ASD compared to controls, opposite to the decreased N100 amplitude typically observed in SZ. Coupled with preserved %PPI in ASD, these findings suggest that the N100 ERP and PPI may help differentiate between the two conditions. Simultaneously, other SZ-linked risk markers appear in ASD, and heterogeneity across samples suggests potential neurophysiological subgroups. Future research should apply standardized paradigms in sex- balanced, age-appropriate cohorts to clarify their clinical relevance.",

This preregistered study examined how spatial presentation format affects arithmetic reasoning. We conceptually replicated Experiment 3 of Landy and Goldstone's (2010) study using the Precedence and Proximity Task in a forced-choice format. Additionally, we assessed arithmetic fluency using a speeded test. A total of 201 adults solved 200 mixed addition–multiplication expressions. Spatial congruency was manipulated by varying spacing of addition and multiplication problems so that grouping cues aligned or conflicted with the order-of-operations rules. Operation Order was also manipulated. Participants were faster and more accurate in congruent spacing conditions, whereas incongruent spacing increased operation-order errors, especially when problems began with addition. A group of outliers showed very high accuracy in congruent conditions but extremely high error rates in incongruent ones, suggesting a prepotent susceptibility to perceptual grouping in some individuals. The spacing effect emerged despite differences in task format and response procedure compared to the original study, supporting its robustness. Higher arithmetic fluency was associated with higher accuracy and shorter reaction times. These findings corroborate that visuospatial layout biases symbolic computation and that individuals differ in their susceptibility to it.",

          "abstract": "The ratio between the lengths of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) has been proposed as a putative marker of prenatal androgen exposure and investigated for its potential link to sexual orientation. In a recent updated meta-analysis, Swift-Gallant et al. (2025) reported more male-typical digit ratios in same-sex-oriented women than in heterosexual women, while homosexual men showed more female-typical ratios than heterosexual men. Their analyses found no evidence of publication bias for female sexual orientation but did for male sexual orientation, with effects remaining statistically significant after adjustment. Here, we reanalyzed the dataset compiled by Swift-Gallant et al. (2025) using Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis (RoBMA), a framework that models uncertainty across multiple sources, including the presence or absence of an effect, heterogeneity, and publication bias. Our analyses showed little evidence for group differences in 2D:4D ratios by sexual orientation: RoBMA indicated moderate evidence against differences between homosexual and heterosexual women, with strong evidence of publication bias, and for men, moderate evidence against a right-hand difference but a small left-hand effect moderated by publication status. Thus, when publication bias was modeled directly using Bayesian model averaging of complementary bias adjustments, the evidence for a difference in 2D:4D ratios according to sexual orientation was substantially weakened. Overall, these findings challenge the view that the 2D:4D ratios provides a reliable marker of prenatal androgen exposure underlying variation in sexual orientation and question assertions that publication bias in this literature is negligible or reversed.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the mediating role of psychosocial factors, including behaviors and motivations, in the association between school absences and academic achievement. Using comprehensive longitudinal data from England, linking National Pupil Database (NPD) school register data with Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) survey data (N=7,204), the analysis explores the impact of absences at ages 12/13 on standardized tests at 16, and the extent to which psychosocial factors mediate these associations. The findings show that behavioral and motivational factors at age 14 partially mediate the adverse effect of school absences on achievement. Regarding behaviors, school absences negatively impact achievement through an increase in externalizing and risky behaviors, while prosocial behavior was not a significant mediator of this association.  Regarding motivation, absences negatively influence achievement by reducing students' educational motivation. Self-esteem, however, did not mediate the association. These findings were replicated using comparable data and analytic methods for Wales, indicating external validity of our results. The study emphasizes the importance of reducing school absences for both academic achievement and psychosocial development. It also calls for targeted interventions addressing externalizing behavior, risky behavior, and educational motivation to effectively mitigate the negative impact of school absences on academic achievement.",

          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "abstract": "Stronger endorsement of meritocracy often fuels opposition to gender quotas despite evidence that they actually result in meritocratic outcomes. We provided explanations of this evidence to Republicans who endorsed meritocracy and opposed gender quotas in four online experiments (total n = 1,794). We compared explanations using an Empathetic Refutational Interview (ERI) structure (which affirmed people’s beliefs in meritocracy before correcting the “unmeritocratic quota” misconception) with an unrelated control text and explanations without affirming meritocratic beliefs. Corrections significantly reduced opposition to gender quotas relative to the control. When presented in the context of a conversation, participants rated corrections delivered using the ERI as most acknowledging of their perspective. Participants who reported first-hand (bad) experiences with gender quotas were particularly receptive to correction via the ERI. Discussing the benefits of gender quotas, especially for meritocracy, can help reduce opposition to them. The ERI can help structure such conversations to avoid interpersonal conflict.",

Using up to ~6,800 participants followed across as many as 15 annual waves, we tested selection and socialization for self-esteem, life satisfaction, and depressiveness. We examined selection with logistic, linear, and Cox models, and socialization using event-centered fixed-effects models. Moderators included gender, relationship status/satisfaction, physical attractiveness (selection), and age at first intercourse (socialization). Static well-being levels showed inconsistent links to timing. However, adolescents who barely changed or increased slightly in self-esteem, life satisfaction, and depressiveness started earlier, whereas larger swings in either direction coincided with postponement. For socialization, we found a small post-event lift in life satisfaction, driven by partnered adolescents. Overall, first intercourse appears to express ongoing trajectories more than it transforms them. Findings are interpreted through a developmental-task lens, challenge risk-centric narratives, and suggest emphasizing relationship context over sexual onset per se.",

          "abstract": "Humans and other animals continuously predict potential rewards that may follow their decisions. When their predictions are erroneous, they subsequently experience reward prediction errors (RPEs), which influence both procedural and declarative memory. It remains unclear why declarative memory sometimes increases with signed RPEs (SRPE) and sometimes with unsigned RPEs (URPE), posing a central question about whether our brain prioritizes “better-than-expected” or “different-than-expected” information. However, recent studies suggest that large negative RPEs are critical for eliciting URPE-related neural signatures. Moreover, some previous studies reporting the SRPE effect had systematically larger positive than negative RPEs, an asymmetry that can make an URPE effect look like an SRPE one. Given this, we implemented two improved experimental designs incorporating negatively biased or symmetric RPE manipulations. Across five experiments with a total of 379 participants, the SRPE effect persisted in Experiments 1-4; however, after overnight consolidation in Experiment 5, a shift toward a URPE effect emerged. This finding provides strong evidence for the robust SRPE effect, while also identifying overnight consolidation as a potential boundary condition for a shift between SRPE and URPE.",

In both studies, participants who saw a congruent background perceived their donation as more impactful, which in turn increased their motivation and willingness to donate. Unlike other contexts, such as e-commerce, where incongruence can capture consumers’ attention, our findings reveal that in charitable appeals an incongruent background can backfire, reducing donors’ generosity. These results offer nonprofits a simple but powerful communication lever to strengthen the effectiveness of their visual campaigns. Finally, we created a Congruence Index, cost-effective tool non-profits can use to evaluate the perception of congruence of their visual appeals with their cause to boost donations",

          "abstract": "While experiencing individual eco-emotions, such as eco-anxiety, eco-guilt, and eco-grief, has been linked to pro-environmental behavior, no prior studies have jointly investigated these variables. Research in Dutch and German populations is particularly scarce despite being at relatively high risk for experiencing the effects of climate change, such as floods. This study examined the relationship between eco-anxiety and pro-environmental behavior, with eco-guilt and eco-grief as mediators, and age, gender, and proximity to water as moderating variables. Cross-sectional data (n = 311) were collected using an online survey that contained the Eco-Anxiety Questionnaire, Eco-Guilt Questionnaire, Ecological Grief Questionnaire, and Pro-Environmental Behavior Scale. Data analyses revealed significant positive correlations between all three eco-emotions and pro-environmental behavior. A positive relationship between eco-anxiety and pro-environmental behavior was found, which was mediated by eco-guilt, but not eco-grief. With a negative indirect effect of eco-guilt on pro-environmental behavior, eco-guilt was a confounding variable. Only age moderated the pathway from eco-anxiety to eco-guilt; no moderation effects were found for gender or proximity to water. This research provides preliminary evidence of the complex relationships between eco-anxiety, eco-guilt, eco-grief, and pro-environmental behavior. The findings highlight the importance of developing educational programs to inform individuals about eco-emotions and potential coping strategies, while promoting pro-environmental behavior. Future studies with larger, more diverse samples are recommended to replicate the results and explore which groups of individuals may be more vulnerable to experiencing higher levels of eco-emotions. Further, (generalized) causal mediation analyses should be applied to unravel the interplay of eco-emotions.",

Whereas dyadic eye gaze synchrony has been widely studied, its operationalization remains inconsistent, and methods extending beyond dyads are scarce. This proof-of-concept study introduces a reproducible pipeline for capturing eye gaze synchrony in a triadic interaction using mobile eye tracking. Three participants each wore Tobii Pro Glasses 3 during a 7-minute naturalistic conversation. Independent recordings were synchronized via a router-based setup, and gaze points were spatially aligned within a shared coordinate system anchored by a fiducial marker. We compared two analytical frameworks: a correlation-based approach using Surrogate Synchrony methods (SUSY and its multivariate extension mv-SUSY) to quantify temporal alignment of gaze, and an event-based approach assessing occurrences of mutual gaze and joint attention. The study demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing eye gaze synchrony among multiple participants. Results indicated that correlation-based and event-based measures capture distinct but complementary aspects of triadic coordination. This work provides a foundation for reproducible quantitative analyses of gaze coordination in complex social settings.",

We compared computational models to test how social feedback, expectations, and PEs related to momentary affect. Results showed that social feedback and PEs best explained affective fluctuations. Social PEs predicted anxiety more strongly than social feedback; the opposite pattern was observed for mood.

We found discrepant reinforcing, degrading, and null prospective effects depending on the analyzed model and a meta-analytic aggregation of these discrepant effects did not differ significantly from zero. Moreover, a good fit of the spurious prospective associations model (SPAM) indicated that data may have been generated without any direct effects between parental warmth and children’s moral self. Hence, conclusions of reinforcing prospective effects between parental warmth and children’s moral self appear premature.

Although some theoretical models have attempted to explain how these processes are related to reading performance in typically developing readers, there is still insufficient evidence to determine the nature of these processes in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or whether differences exist between this population group and those with poor reading comprehension.\nAims: The main aim of the present study was (1) to evaluate metacomprehension in ASD readers in comparison with that of non-autistic poor comprehenders and typically developing readers, and (2) to examine whether adolescents can adjust their metacomprehension skills appropriately to texts of different levels of difficulty.\nMethod: A total of 61 readers were divided into three groups: (1) those with ASD, (2) those without ASD but with poor reading comprehension, and (3) typically developing readers. All groups were matched for text reading speed, age, non-verbal IQ, and working memory. An experimental task based on self-paced sentence-by-sentence reading paradigm was used to measure reading performance variables and comprehension and knowledge judgment.\nResults: In general, the results indicate similar reading behavior among participants with ASD and poor comprehenders, and both groups perform worse than typically developing readers.\nConclusions: The findings do not support the idea of a specific low-performance profile typical of people with ASD for  reading metacomprehension, but do indicate potential limitations which may be common to poor comprehenders.",

We administered six tasks to N = 48 individuals from four species, spanning 10 sessions over 1.5 years. Task performance was most strongly predicted by stable, individual-specific characteristics rather than transient or group-level variables. Using additional data from the same individuals in other tasks, we found substantial positive correlations between non-social tasks. In contrast, tasks measuring social cognition were neither correlated with each other nor with non-social measures.

Previous studies with newborns have shown language-specific processing of forward versus backward speech and of intonational contours, as well as sensitivity to iambic versus trochaic patterns in non-linguistic tone stimuli. The present study investigated newborns’ processing of temporal rhythm patterns in naturalistic native-language speech. Czech-learning newborns (N = 44) listened to naturally recorded, well-formed Czech utterances with either native Czech rhythm (virtually lacking acoustic cues to word-level stress) or foreign rhythm (featuring prolonged foot-initial syllables), while their hemodynamic activity was recorded. Results revealed larger hemodynamic responses to native-language speech with foreign-rhythm speech than to native-language speech with native rhythm. This difference was most pronounced in the right hemisphere, indicating right-lateralized processing of speech rhythm. Traditional theories of language development have suggested that only broad, between-class rhythm differences among languages are processed at birth. By showing that newborns discriminate between native and foreign rhythmic patterns even when their native language falls outside traditional rhythm classifications, the present findings evidence that gradient temporal cues alone are sufficient for early language discrimination.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the controversial Frequency Attenuation Effect (FAE), examining whether masked repetition priming is sensitive to word frequency. Early findings suggesting no interaction have been recently contradicted. Across two large-scale experiments (N&gt;2,600), we show that the FAE does occur in masked conditions, but its magnitude is insensitive to prime duration. This constitutes a challenge to single-stage models of word recognition. We argue that only a two-stage decision-making framework can accommodate this pattern. We propose that masked repetition and prime duration influence an early, automatic stage, whereas frequency flexibly affects a later processing stage. Distributional analyses of reaction times support these conclusions. We tentatively suggest that the FAE is primarily a consequence of a later decision stage, driven by a mechanism that is selectively engaged for challenging stimuli, like low-frequency words. These results help strongly constrain theoretical models of lexical access.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal populations in ventral visual cortex are often classified according to the stimuli that elicit their strongest excitatory response. Using such preferred or effective stimuli, receptive fields have been mapped to better understand links between visual responses and behaviour. For example, face-selective regions in human ventral cortex, which prefer faces over objects, are thought to have small, foveally-biased receptive fields, supporting the recognition of subtle facial cues. However, little is known about how face selectivity interacts with stimulus location, or whether selective responses to peripheral faces are altered when competing visual inputs are present. Here, we used ultra-fast 7T fMRI to test whether the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) continues to prefer faces when they occur in the periphery or with competing inputs. We found that face-selective responses in the FFA were robust to competition, whereas object-selective responses in the neighbouring area of the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) were reduced. The left FFA showed a contralateral bias that encoded the spatial location of peripheral faces, consistent with a role in orienting toward socially relevant stimuli. In contrast, the right FFA exhibited a stronger category bias that was largely invariant to stimulus position and persisted under competition, suggesting a potential role in evaluating faces prior to fixation. Taken together, these findings reveal lateralised contributions of fusiform cortex to face detection: the left FFA supports the localisation of faces, while the right FFA provides robust categorical information. Together, the findings highlight how the human face-selective network is adapted to detect and prioritise faces under naturalistic viewing conditions.",

          "abstract": "Research on the neurocomputational mechanisms of moral judgment has typically focused on contrasting utilitarian preferences to impartially maximize aggregate welfare and deontological preferences that judge the morality of actions based on rules. However, there has been little work to decompose the cognitive subcomponents of deontological preferences. Here, we investigated the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying two types of deontological preferences (Rawlsian and Kantian) and their contrast with utilitarian preferences in an incentivized moral dilemma task. Participants repeatedly decided how to allocate harm between a single individual (“the one”) and a group of 3-4 individuals (“the group”). The task distinguished preferences for Rawlsian, Kantian and utilitarian strategies by quantifying trade-offs among active harm, concern for the worst-off individual, and overall utility. Behaviorally, participants favored the Rawlsian strategy, preferring to impose more harm overall rather than disproportionately harm the one individual. Computational modeling revealed two dissociable dimensions of individual variability in Rawlsian preferences: i) minimizing the maximum amount of harm delivered to a single person and ii) subjective threshold of acceptable amount of harm imposed on one person. Combination of univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses  revealed the engagement of distinct brain regions in these two dimensions of Rawlsian preferences, which respectively mapped onto activity in mentalizing and valuation networks. Our results reveal the neurocomputational mechanisms guiding tradeoffs between the welfare of one versus a larger group, and highlight distinct roles for the mentalizing and valuation networks in shaping Rawlsian moral preferences.",

Core requirements for conscious states have been clarified, and new\ndiagnostic tools—most notably the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) derived from TMS–\nEEG—are moving toward clinical use. PCI indicates about a 95% probability of detecting\nconsciousness in non-communicative patients when purposeful behavior is present. Recent\nstudies in neurotypical individuals and communicative patients have adopted refined statistical\nmethods accounting for regression-to-the-mean effects, along with rigorous awareness scales\ndirectly validated by subjective reports. Contrary to mainstream beliefs, these approaches\nconsistently suggest that some degree of stimulus awareness is necessary for above-chance\nperformance. Consciousness thus emerges not as an epiphenomenon but as a prerequisite for\nmost purposeful behaviors in humans. This methodological progress opens new opportunities to\nbridge the long-standing divide between consciousness and cognitive sciences. At the same time,\nconsciousness, intelligence and cognitive abilities are not identical: they can dissociate in\nrevealing ways. Subjective experience exceeds its behavioral expression and remains accessible\nonly to the experiencer. These observations motivate Integrated Information Theory, an\nexplanatory framework that generate testable predictions about conscious states and qualitative\ncontents independently of behavior, while also predicting that energy efficiency requirements\nmay give rise to a tight link between consciousness and cognition in biological systems.

          "abstract": "Arbitrary social hierarchies permeate our working lives in ways not always visible, introducing anti-egalitarian norms which stymie productivity. Reviewing bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We contend that the literatures converge on a single, sobering logic: because organizations are embedded in—and seek legitimacy from—broader socio-historical contexts, the same arbitrary hierarchies that stratify societies are naturally imported into organizational life. At the same time, individuals are motivated to obscure the influence of these hierarchies to reduce psychological distress. We leverage institutional theory and systems psychodynamics to map how organizations are at the crux of external pressures (from society) and upward pressure (from employees) which both perpetuate and obfuscate the replication of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in organizations. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the commonplace or subtle nature of the microaggression to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – anti-egalitarian organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in their workplace.",

          "abstract": "AI-augmented decision-making (AIADM) aims to leverage the computational power of machine learning (ML) models to assist humans in their decision-making processes. In many such systems, especially for complex tasks like medical image classification, ML models are often trained on large datasets annotated by humans. Neglecting to account for human decision-making biases when constructing these labeled datasets can lead to biased datasets, and subsequently models trained on such datasets can inherit the biases. We propose a novel approach to developing AIADM systems that aims to overcome these challenges by harnessing human uncertainty. Our approach has three elements: we collect subjective judgments from human annotators, we calibrate those subjective judgments, and we use the recalibrated subjective judgments to create probabilistic (i.e., soft) labels, which the AI decision aid is then trained on. We evaluate our methods through two studies using data from DiagnosUs, a crowdsourcing platform for medical image annotation. Across multiple training datasets, we assess how our proposed methods impact three key properties of AI decision aids: accuracy, calibration, and alignment with human uncertainty. We refer to these properties as the AIADM tri-criteria. Our results show that ML models trained on recalibrated soft labels are more accurate and better aligned with expert judgments. We also observe a tradeoff between ML calibration and alignment with human uncertainty. These findings highlight the value of capturing and correcting human uncertainty in ML training data and the need to consider the tri-criteria when developing AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Body perception disturbances are a common feature of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), and have been targeted for rehabilitation due to their association with pain and other clinical measures. Changs to perception of the affected limb vary across individuals in terms of type and severity, however treatments often take a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to alter body perception in CRPS, with mixed effectiveness. Interventions may be improved if they are tailored to an individual’s unique disturbances, however there are currently no methods for such a personalised approach. We aimed to co-develop a novel virtual tool that enables people with CRPS to create and embody virtual hands that model their distorted limb perceptions, and what they desire their limb perceptions to be. Taking a Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) approach, we worked with four partners living with upper-limb CRPS who experienced different disturbances in affected limb perception. Each partner collaborated with the researcher to create three virtual hand models: 1) their idea of a typical hand, 2) their current distorted perception and 3) their desired hand appearance. Partners provided feedback on the tool, made suggestions for further development and reflected on their experiences when embodying each model. We successfully created personalised virtual hands with dynamic, real-time changes. Partners found the tool accessible, engaging and expressed enthusiasm for its potential use as an intervention. Anecdotal evidence showed that embodiment of different hand models affected body perception, pain, cognitive-affective responses and motor control, with responses varying across individuals. Personalisation was central to the partner’s positive experiences with the tool. These insights support the potential to develop the tool as an intervention method for targeting body perception disturbances in CRPS, and the next steps for this further development are discussed. Partners’ engagement with the tool also provided wider insights into body perception in CRPS, and highlighted the potential of using the tool to communicate and measure body perception. Overall, tailoring interventions to an individual’s unique disturbed and desired limb perception holds promise.",

          "authors": "Caitlin Elisabeth Naylor; Christof Lutteroth; Gavin Buckingham; Janet Bultitude",
          "abstract": "Body illusions demonstrate how body representation flexibly updates when visual body cues are manipulated to differ from the physical state of the limb. However, implicit hand representations in healthy cognition are already distorted relative to the true physical structure of the hand, with hand width typically overestimated and finger length typically underestimated. This study examined whether changes in body perception depended on the similarity between visual hand cues and these distorted implicit representations. Healthy participants (n=61) experienced four VR hand illusions: Matched Hands (i.e. wider hand appearance relative to true hand width, matching the implicit representation), Mismatched Hands (i.e. narrower hand appearance relative to true hand width, mis-matching the implicit representation), Matched Fingers (i.e. shorter finger length relative to true finger lengths, matching the implicit representation) and Mismatched Fingers (i.e. longer finger length relative to true finger lengths, mis-matching the implicit representation). We assessed changes in conscious body perception, direct and indirect body representation measures, and motor control. We predicted larger perceptual changes when visual cues aligned with distorted implicit representations. All four illusions altered perceived hand size (but not motor control); however, the effects were stronger when visual hand cues were enlarged than shrunken. Although resizing direction accounted for most of the differences between illusions, we found some evidence for an additional influence of matching; however, contrary to predictions, the mismatched conditions elicited stronger changes. Effects also varied across measurement types and were more pronounced for the fingers than hands. Altogether, these findings suggest that body representation plasticity is shaped by how visual hand cues differ from the physical hand, how visual cues differ from the implicit distorted representation, and which part of the hand is targeted. Further research is needed to disentangle these influences and determine which measures best capture changes in different body representations.",

          "abstract": "In Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), perception of the affected limb is often disturbed, yet little is known about how these disturbances vary between individuals. Exploring how body perception disturbances manifest at an individual level would shed light on the exact nature of these disturbances. This research explores how people living with CRPS describe and make sense of their body perception disturbances and desired changes to their body perception. Using open-text questions in an online survey, 115 people described how the perceived visual appearance and feeling of their affected limb was distorted, and how they wished to alter that perception. Qualitative content analysis was used to classify these descriptions into categories, which were then organised into three higher-order interpretative themes. 1) Distortions to the limb’s features reflected two broad types, rescaling (a) and reconfiguration (b), but the specific nature of disturbed and desired body perception was highly individualised. 2) Wider cognitive disruptions were also described, conceptualising the limb as fundamentally wrong or unnatural, and reflecting the distressing nature of these disturbances. 3) The unstable and conflicting nature of body perception led to lost power and trust towards the limb, alongside a desire to regain a sense of a coherent bodily self. These findings challenge the view of body perception disturbances as a single construct, emphasising variability in both disturbances and individuals’ desires for resolving perceptual conflicts. Future approaches of measuring and treating CRPS should consider variability in disturbed and desired perception, to understand how to achieve a coherent body perception for each individual.",

          "abstract": "People with CRPS often experience body perception disturbances, where perceived features of their affected limb become distorted. However, the nature of these disturbances and the effectiveness of treatments aimed at altering body perception can vary greatly across people with CRPS. It remains unclear whether these variations represent fundamental differences in how body perception is disturbed in CRPS and whether individuals have differing preferences for how they wish to change their limb perception. We conducted an exploratory investigation to understand current and desired perceptions of the affected limb in people with CRPS. Using an online survey, 115 people medically-diagnosed with CRPS reported the severity of visual and felt disturbances to the size, shape, position and definition of their affected limb, and any changes they desire to make to this perception. We identified three distinct clusters of disturbances according to the extent to which the affected limb perception was distorted from a typical limb and the level of multimodal discrepancy, which were related to the severity of other CRPS symptoms. These findings challenge the common use of body perception disturbance as a single symptom within CRPS, illustrating the value of recognising how these disturbances manifest. We also identified three distinct groupings based on the way respondents would change their limb perception, finding that the majority did not simply want the limb to appear normal. Such patterns contradict traditional rehabilitation methods that aim to normalise the limb. This subjectivity in patient preferences suggests future work should explore tailored-rehabilitation according to differences in body perception experiences.",

While we were interested in re-formulating from a humanistic psychological perspective, after Rogers’ original conditions of worth concept (1957, 1959), the behavioral formulation of conditional regard, we also tested and provided evidence for the hypothesis that autistic people experience heightened conditions of worth relative to non-autistic people. We validated through a brief online survey (n = 162, including 109 autistic and 53 non-autistic individuals) two distinct sets of items, one retrospective for the adolescent period between ages 12 and 17 and the other for adulthood, to assess the extent to which individuals perceive conditions of worth. The items were then correlated with an array of individual difference variables. Perceived emotional safety recalled as an adolescent and felt as an adult, perceived psychological control of one’s parental figure when an adolescent, adult fear of criticism and rejection, adult masking or camouflaging of parts of oneself, adult incongruence or inauthenticity, adult acceptance of external influence, and adult self-alienation were all positively correlated in support of the measures’ convergent and predictive validity. Adult self-esteem, unconditional positive self-regard, adolescence-perceived parental autonomy support, authentic adult living, and congruence or authenticity were all, with some exceptions, negatively correlated in theoretically expected directions. Perfectionism was also variously correlated. Implications and applications are offered for academics as well as mental health practitioners.",

          "authors": "Jack C. Lennon",
          "abstract": "Human experience unfolds at multiple temporal scales, yet cognitive science typically assumes that rationality operates on a uniform timeline. This paper develops the concept of fractal cognition into a formal theoretical framework, proposing that variation in neural temporal resolution – the rate at which the brain samples sensory information – alters both the density of lived time and the structure of reasoning built upon it. Drawing an analogy to the coastline paradox, in which measured length increases with the granularity of measurement, the argument holds that perception measured with a finer temporal ruler produces a longer, more detailed subjective world. Evidence from psychophysics demonstrates large individual differences in critical-flicker thresholds, temporal-order judgments, and multisensory binding windows, while neurophysiological research reveals scale-free 1/f dynamics indicating nested timescales of brain activity. Integrating these findings, this article re-situates bounded rationality and advances the thesis of scale-bounded rationality: what appears irrational or over-interpreted at one temporal scale may be coherent at another. The model generates empirically testable predictions linking sampling rate, subjective duration, and reasoning style, and it reframes cognitive diversity as variation in temporal granularity rather than intellectual capacity or ability. Ultimately, understanding cognition as fractal in time offers a unified account of how different minds inhabit the same second differently.",

          "abstract": "Our daily visual environment is abound with motion – people walk, snowflakes fall, and trains speed by. Accurately perceiving object speed is essential when avoiding collisions or intercepting moving objects. Accurately remembering object speed is equally essential, as moving objects may become temporarily occluded. Most studies of speed perception and memory use low-level motion stimuli (e.g., dot motion) which minimize spatial cues, but do not reflect the natural spatiotemporal dynamics of objects. In contrast, high-level motion stimuli contain rich spatial cues, better capturing real-world motion. Neural mechanisms underlying low- and high-level motion processing differ across the visual hierarchy. Might memory for speed also differ between low- and high-level motion? To answer this, we tested human participants on speed recall for both low- and high-level motion stimuli across different speeds (2–32 º/s) and delays (1, 4, or 8 s). Both types of stimuli moved along a circular trajectory (4–6 s) and were recalled via method-of-adjustment. Replicating previous work, we found a strong decrease in speed recall performance with increasing speed. Importantly, we also observed that recall performance was significantly worse for low- compared to high-level motion stimuli, implying an advantage for spatiotemporally bound objects. For high-level motion, longer stimulus and delay durations led to better and worse speed recall, respectively. Furthermore, there were direction congruency and  hysteresis effects for both types of stimuli. Together, our results suggest that spatial cues facilitate speed estimation, and provide a solid psychophysical basis for understanding human short-term memory for speed.",

Starting with English we find moderate  associations of nature with importance, although this trend has increased over the last 200 years. Despite being the international standard language of environmental policy discussions, English expresses weaker nature-importance associations than 70% of other languages. In contrast, Afro-Asiatic languages, spoken in Global South nations, tend to express the strongest nature-importance associations.

          "abstract": "Young adults often grapple with questions of meaning and identity as they begin to define who they are and how their lives matter. Narrative identity theory proposes that constructing coherent life stories promotes self-continuity and meaning, yet this process has rarely been tested experimentally. We tested the Brief Meaning Boost (BMB), a single-session online narrative intervention that guided participants to write about key memories, identify life-story themes, and receive wisdom from their future self. In a preregistered randomized controlled trial (N = 532; ages 18–24; 54% women) with participants recruited through Prolific and residing in Western countries but representing over 50 countries of origin, participants were randomly assigned to the BMB or an active control. Compared with controls, intervention participants reported higher meaning/purpose and mattering immediately after the intervention and at one- and three-week follow-ups (ds = 0.52/0.34 at T2; 0.25/0.19 at T3; 0.27/0.24 at T4). The intervention also increased narrative coherence, uplifted affect, and self-continuity. Mediation analyses indicated that each process independently predicted sustained gains in meaning/purpose and mattering, and that early increases in both thematic coherence and uplifted affect predicted stronger self-continuity one week later, which in turn maintained meaning and mattering three weeks post-intervention. These findings provide the first causal evidence that strengthening narrative identity processes can enhance meaning in life, advancing theories of personality change and offering a brief, scalable approach to help emerging adults cultivate purpose and mattering during a pivotal developmental period.",

However,\nin contrast to earlier studies and reviews, a Cochrane network meta-analysis from 2021 concluded\nthat the estimated efficacy of fluoxetine was no longer clinically meaningful.\nStudy aim: To explain the discrepant findings between the recent Cochrane review and earlier\nreviews and to explore if this was acknowledged in guidelines and treatment recommendations\nappearing since then.\nMethods: Meta-analytical aggregation of trial results over time, exploring potential biases, and a\nnon-systematic search for recent treatment guidelines/recommendations from major medical\norganizations.\nResults: The estimated efficacy of fluoxetine in clinical trials declined over time into the range of\nclinical equivalence with placebo when more recent studies were included in analyses and when\nconsidering common thresholds of clinical significance. This remains unacknowledged in treatment\nguidelines and related publications, including some that continue to recommend fluoxetine as first-\nline pharmacological treatment.

          "abstract": "Background: For the last decade it has been discussed whether the complexity of learning materials (e.g., of expository texts) posits a boundary condition for the testing effect. One of few studies in favor of this assumption was published by de Jonge and colleagues (2015). They showed that the long-term benefit of testing compared to restudying occurred only for a low-complexity (incoherent, sentences in a scrambled order) but not for a high-complexity (coherent, sentences in an inferential order) version of an expository text. A fill-in-the-blank test served as practice test and dependent variable. \nAims: For a number of reasons, we assumed that the testing effect can be found with text of both high and low in complexity. Therefore, we replicated the critical conditions of their Experiments with more power (Experiment 1). In addition, we ran a conceptual replication with short-answer questions as testing procedure (Experiment 2). \nSample: In Experiment 1 participated 111 subjects, in Experiment 2 117 subjects. Most of the participants were university students. \nMethod: While de Jonge et al. (2015) manipulated text complexity across two different experiments, each containing a variation in learning condition and final test delay, we manipulated the complexity within one experiment focusing solely on a one-week delay (and also varying the learning condition). \nResults: As expected, we found a testing effect which was independent from text complexity (and independently from the test type used). \nConclusions: Based on these results, we conclude that the testing effect is not restricted to texts low in complexity.",

          "abstract": "Many cognitive models assume a set of processes operating upon a psychological representation that is derived using multidimensional scaling (MDS) of similarity judgments. While MDS-based models have been useful in exploring cognitive phenomena, the underlying representation itself should not be left unexplained. The issue of defining the appropriate cognitive representation recently came to the fore in the field of visual working memory (VWM). Most VWM models are constructed on the physical stimulus space, but Schurgin et al. (2020) influentially argued that VWM is better modeled on the psychological similarity space. To address this discrepancy, we took a Bayesian generative modeling approach, applying cognitive models to the open data of three tasks from Tomić &amp; Bays (2024): a perceptual reproduction task, and a memory reproduction task, and a similarity comparison task. We show that the underlying representation for these tasks can be recovered with this approach, and find that there is non-uniformity in the representations with respect to the physical stimuli. Our critical result is that the representation differs between the similarity comparison and stimulus reproduction tasks. This result suggests that the psychological representation derived from similarity tasks cannot be assumed to be the representation underlying VWM. We also show that by including detailed mechanisms in our cognitive models (in this case, swap errors in the memory reproduction task) improves the recovered mental representation. We conclude by arguing that mental representations should be explained by being included in cognitive process models rather than derived from independent tasks like similarity comparisons.",

Supporting evidence comes from studies on temporal decay, sleep-related consolidation, research on unrelated words, and neuropsychological findings from patients with hippocampal amnesia. Additionally, we further discuss how episodic memory may also capture extralinguistic features (e.g., speaker’s accent) during language comprehension to influence lexical processing.",

          "abstract": "Recent findings show that lexical activation is slower when words are surrounded by other words, as they always are in natural reading. Here we focus on the proposal that this is due to direct interference from adjacent words that are processed in parallel. In three experiments using a flanked masked visual word adaptation of the visual world paradigm with adult skilled readers, we probed the spatial conditions for interference. Target words were flashed at fixation for 75 ms flanked by other words before being masked; we studied gaze shifts to the image (out of four displayed) corresponding to the target. We found that interference increases with proximity and is asymmetric (stronger from the right side). In the third experiment we included an image for one of the flanker words and we obtained direct evidence for lexical activation of the right-side flanker, consistent with parallel models of word recognition. Intriguingly, the strong asymmetry of lexical activation stands in contrast to a much weaker asymmetry in overall interference, indicating that different levels of representation are differentially involved in the online interactions among adjacent words. In all, our findings constitute strong evidence for distributed attention around fixation differentially affecting diverse word processing stages, and call for a reconsideration of word recognition models that posit independent processing of individual words. They also confirm that the masked flanked visual word visual world paradigm is appropriate for studying attentional allocation during reading.",

          "abstract": "Obtaining accurate measures of changing abilities is essential for online adaptive learning systems (ALS) to provide learners with instructional material and practice items at the appropriate level. \nDespite the large data volume in ALS, focusing on a single individual at a specific moment yields limited data, reducing measurement precision. To improve quality of measurement in ALS, it has been proposed to incorporate response time (RT) data into measurement (Klinkenberg et al., 2011). Using data from an ALS for primary school mathematics Math Garden (Straatemeier, 2014), we compare different models that incorporate RTs and can be used for ability tracking with each other and with the benchmark Rasch model, in which ability is measured based only on the accuracy of the responses. We also contrast these empirical findings with simulation results that match the empirical setup but where the generating model matches the way in which RTs are incorporated into measurement, to study what can be gained under ideal circumstances. Our results show that while theoretical gains are large, in the studied empirical setting RTs at best provide a modest improvement that was not fully consistent across domains and depended on the reward system implemented in the ALS. Implications of the results for the choice of the measurement model in ALS are discussed.",

          "abstract": "We often give advice to influence others, but could our own advice also be shaped by the very individuals we aim to influence (i.e., advisees)? This reverse flow of social influence—from those typically seen as being influenced to those who provide the influence—has been largely neglected, limiting our understanding of the reciprocal nature of human interactions. Here, we conducted a series of experiments and applied computational modelling to systematically investigate how advisees’ opinions shape the advice-giving process. In an investment game, participants (n = 346, across four studies) provided advice either independently or after observing advisees’ opinions (Studies 1 &amp; 2), with feedback on their advice (acceptance or rejection) provided by advisees (Studies 3 &amp; 4). Our findings consistently reveal that advisors tend to adjust their advice to align with the advisees’ opinions (we refer to this as the alignment bias), even when this compromises advice accuracy (Study 1). This tendency, which is demonstrated to be a deliberate pursuit rather than merely a result of opinion contagion, persists when advisors have a direct incentive to provide accurate advice (Study 2). However, as feedback is introduced, advisors’ behavior shifts, adapting to advisees’ preferences (“advising as one likes”), as described by a reinforcement learning model suggesting advisors’ intention to seek acceptance from advisees underlies the alignment bias (Study 3), even when acceptance is rare (Study 4). Collectively, our findings highlight advisors’ susceptibility to seeking acceptance, which can lead to counterproductive impacts on decision-making processes and misinformation exacerbation in social encounters.",

Significant linear relationships emerged: PC schema positively correlated with Consequence Sensitivity, MN schema positively with Norm Sensitivity but negatively with Consequence Sensitivity, and PI schema negatively with Norm Sensitivity. A curvilinear pattern was found between MN schema and Consequence Sensitivity, with higher MN adoption initially predicting lower Consequence Sensitivity, but reversing among participants who heavily prioritized MN reasoning. The results underscore the distinct ways in which moral schemas shape sensitivity to moral norms and outcomes, suggesting that PC reasoning may operate more holistically and flexibly than is captured by the CNI model.

Trust, AI anxiety, as well as the monetary value attributed to AI products scaled with an AI trustworthiness label’s DSDP level. Importantly, participants’ ratings of unlabeled AI products corresponded to their perceptions of AI products labeled with an intermediate DSDP level. This apparent bias towards intermediate DSDP judgements in the absence of information on AI products underscores the relevance of explicitly communicating AI trustworthiness to (potential) users.

We analyzed 22,459 unique posts drawn from a Reddit online self-help community dedicated to disordered gaming. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified data-driven topics, then aligned them to the Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM) through reflexive thematic analysis and netnography, and validated patterns with sentiment analysis and engagement metrics.\nSeven themes consistently appeared: escapism, guilt and regret, relationship strain, identity issues, health deterioration, desire for moderation, and search for replacement activities. These themes cut across multiple TTM stages, showing that recovery is fluid and cyclical, not a straight line. Community language was moderately positive overall, acknowledging frustration and anxiety while expressing hope and mutual support, indicating the subreddit often functions as an empowering support system.\nFindings affirm TTM’s relevance for understanding disordered gaming and underscore the value of social connection and creative self-regulation in recovery. We recommend that readiness assessments and interventions reflect the shifting, story-driven nature of these journeys.

          "authors": "Tianwei Gong; Simon Valentin; Neil R Bramley; Christopher G. Lucas",
          "abstract": "Heuristics have long been viewed as simple decision rules that sacrifice optimality for cognitive efficiency. However, this perspective fails to fully account for their effectiveness in complex, real-world environments. This paper proposes a reinterpretation of heuristics as realizations of likelihood-free approximation to Bayesian inference (LFI), bridging the gap between heuristic and normative approaches to decision-making. We argue that many heuristics can be understood as implementations of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), where observed data are compared to prior predictions via summary statistics (a form of LFI). This view situates heuristics within a probabilistic framework, explaining how they can represent uncertainty and adapt to environmental structure. Our approach addresses three key challenges in the field: It relaxes strong assumptions about cue-target relationships in heuristic models, accounts for implicit uncertainty representation in heuristic decision-making, and invites a more appropriate benchmark for evaluating heuristics' performance. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we present two case studies --- a classic cue-based decision task and an ecological causal learning task. These show that an ABC model using summary statistics can well approximate the benchmark performance provided by unconstrained Bayesian inference, explain the apparent emergence of different heuristics given environmental changes, and capture human behaviors better than a rational Bayesian benchmark without introducing new mysteries. By unifying heuristics and Bayesian inference through the lens of likelihood-free methods, this work provides a more nuanced understanding of human decision-making, and provides a bridge to the literature on inference-by-sampling.",

We applied this approach to individuals with PTSD, using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data to build personalized contemporaneous and directed symptom networks. Our primary aim was to assess whether these network-derived formulations aligned with clinician-generated cognitive formulations. We also tested whether cognitive variables predicted affective variables over time, consistent with the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model of PTSD. \nMethod. Five participants completed 14-21 days of EMA (response rate=90.2+5.48%), yielding 348 observations total. Items were tailored to each patient’s lived experience and mapped to Ehlers and Clark components. Written formulations from patients and clinicians were compared to EMA-based networks generated by three network algorithms.\nResults. Network-derived formulations shared some features with patient and clinician-derived formulations but often diverged in complexity and specific predictions. Data-driven networks had good precision (0.64-0.86) but low sensitivity (0.31-0.35), showing better agreement with patient self-formulations than with clinician models. Evidence for lead-lag effects between cognitive and affective variables was limited. Trauma memory emerged as the most central component, with its association to sense of current threat and matching triggers being the most prominent. \nConclusion. Network analysis may refine clinical hypotheses but has limitations in replicating comprehensive formulations. Instead, we recommend its use for clinical hypothesis testing of specific predictions. Further studies, including randomized trials, are needed to test its clinical utility and contribution to treatment outcomes.",

First, we fielded a preregistered survey experiment in Germany (N = 1,804) that mimics a single ABM updating step. Participants reported justice-relevant traits, empathy, ambiguity tolerance, justice sensitivity, and moral indignation, then engaged with counter-attitudinal content. From these data we estimated generalized linear models linking traits to two Hegselmann–Krause parameters: the confidence bound c (openness to differing opinions) and the self-influence weight m (inverse to susceptibility to influence). Empirically, a subset of theorized links was supported: cognitive empathy widened c, moral indignation narrowed c, and victim-oriented justice sensitivity increased m. We then calibrated a bounded-confidence ABM with these mappings and evaluated it against four canonical polarization findings. The empirically informed model substantially\nimproved qualitative replication of group extremization and signed directional change under mixed evidence, matched the backfire contrast as good as the baseline, and, like the baseline, failed to reproduce a superlinear polarization slope. These results show how justice-focused traits, particularly\nempathy and moral indignation, provide a parsimonious, data-driven bridge from micro-level psychology to macro-level polarization dynamics, while also revealing limits that motivate extensions (e.g., identity cues and framing) in future work.",

The method is efficient in terms of participant time, is easy to deploy on an online platform to gather behavioral responses, and allows simultaneous measurement of brain activity without contamination from onset responses. The participant hears a continuous tone within each block, with frequency steps at predetermined intervals, and is invited to respond “up” or “down” to these steps by pressing one of two keys. The magnitude of the steps varies according to a predetermined schedule (constant-stimuli, not adaptive) from large (easy) to small (hard), and the discrimination threshold is derived from a psychometric function fitted to the responses to this sequence. Comparison with earlier published procedures shows that the new method yields comparable thresholds, albeit less variable and slightly lower, and thus presumably closer to sensory limits.",

Finally, we present results from a parameter and model recovery analyses and assess the precision in calculating probability densities, illustrating the reliability of the implemented computations.

Quantitative analyses indicate that prior AI experience, perceived transparency, and emotional comfort predict willingness to trust AI-assisted decision-making, while accountability is consistently attributed to humans. Qualitative analysis identifies seven recurring themes: emotional reasoning, meta-cognition, AI-augmented creativity and innovation, algorithms codifying injustice, radical skepticism, heuristics and cognitive biases, and algorithmic transparency. Experts emphasized that AI functions as a supportive tool rather than a substitute for professional judgment. Together, these findings highlight that trust in AI emerges through interactional, cognitive, and affective processes, underscoring the importance of explainable, ethically aligned, and human-centered AI design.",

          "authors": "Projnya Mojumdar; Purba Mojumdar",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nEvent-related potential (ERP) research exhibits a critical methodological blind spot: inter-condition correlations (ρ_XY), the parameter that mathematically determines difference wave reliability via the Lord-Novick formula, are systematically unmeasured. This creates fundamental interpretive ambiguity because Classical Test Theory demonstrates that difference wave reliability is inversely related to ρ_XY, with high correlations suppressing reliability even when constituent waveforms are psychometrically sound. Systematic examination of four foundational ERP studies in bilingual language switching (2001-2016, N_citations ≈ 1,575) confirms this pattern: none report difference wave reliability or inter-condition correlations, despite these measures being the primary dependent variables isolating language control processes. Sensitivity analysis reveals that this vulnerability extends across the entire plausible parameter space: even when inter-condition correlations are moderate (ρ_XY = .50-.60), achieving adequate difference wave reliability (ρ_DD' ≥ .70) requires constituent reliabilities approaching the ceiling of current ERP methodology (ρ = .85-.88). When experimental control produces high correlations (ρ_XY ≥ .70, a plausible inference from structural analysis and cross-domain precedent in fMRI and other ERP components, though empirically unverified in language switching), the degradation becomes catastrophic: constituent reliabilities of .85 yield difference wave reliabilities near zero. The conspicuous absence of empirical ρ_XY measurements and reliability verification means the field cannot determine whether two decades of N2 debate reflect genuine neurocognitive complexity, measurement instability, or both in unknown proportions. If inter-condition correlations prove high in tightly controlled paradigms (as rigorous experimental design would predict), inconsistent findings become expected outcomes of unreliable measurement rather than theoretical puzzles requiring reconciliation. However, problems persist even if correlations are moderate, indicating systematic vulnerability regardless of precise parameter values. Three reforms can address this gap: mandatory reporting of difference wave reliability and inter-condition correlations (ρ ≥ .70 for group comparisons, ρ ≥ .80 for individual differences research), adoption of Generalizability Theory frameworks that partition variance across multiple sources, and single-trial analytical methods that avoid categorical subtraction. These principles extend beyond bilingual research to all ERP domains using difference waves. Systematic psychometric verification should precede theoretical elaboration; the measurement revolution Parsons (2022) called for requires not novel techniques but rigorous application of established principles.",

          "abstract": "Despite the very different retinal images that result from different viewing conditions, humans have little difficulty recognising visual objects in varying circumstances. One source of variability is 2-D rotation, which results in an object having different  orientations. Here, we studied how the brain transforms rotated object images into object representations that are tolerant to rotation. We measured time-varying electroencephalography responses to object images shown in eight different orientations, presented at either 5 Hz or 20 Hz. We used multivariate classification to assess when rotation-tolerant object information emerged, and whether the rotation-tolerant processing would be limited at the faster  presentation rate. We compared this to fixed-rotation measures of object decoding, where the classifier is trained and tested on the same orientation. Our results showed that both fixed-rotation and rotation-tolerant object decoding emerged at an early stage of processing, less than 100 ms after stimulus onset. However, rotation-tolerant information peaked later than fixed-rotation information, suggesting rotation-tolerant object representations are most prominent during a late stage of processing, around 200 ms after stimulus onset. Both fixed-rotation and rotation-tolerant object information was lower for the 20 Hz compared to 5 Hz presentation rate, which suggests that object information processing is disrupted, but not eliminated, for fast presentation rates. Our results show that object information arises at similar times in the brain regardless of whether it is investigated with the fixed-rotation or rotation-tolerant object decoding method. An object representation that is tolerant to rotation and generalises across different exemplars of the same object is established in later stages of processing.",

          "abstract": "Gonzalez and Heidari propose cognitive AI—systems that emulate human cognitive processes—as essential for human–AI complementarity in dynamic decision-making. I argue this framework rests on two questionable premises. First, the distinction between cognitive AI and data-driven approaches lacks practical significance: modern AI trained on behavioral data already exhibits emergent human-like properties through implicit modeling of statistical regularities in human decision-making. Second, the framework assumes complementarity requires AI to mirror human cognition, including human limitations and constraints. Yet if noise and systematic biases fundamentally characterize human cognition, complementary AI should compensate for these limitations rather than reproduce them. I propose that effective human–AI complementarity requires design principles emphasizing appropriate role allocation, transparent uncertainty communication, adaptive personalization that improves decision quality, and mutual modeling of functionally relevant features without necessarily replicating cognitive mechanisms. These principles can be instantiated through various technical approaches and should be evaluated by team outcomes rather than adherence to cognitive theories. Complementarity requires AI that augments human capabilities, not cognitive architectures that reproduce human limitations.",

Their critique is correct but incomplete: it conflates large language models (LLMs) as surrogates that replace participants with LLMs as tools that make diverse human research more tractable. The persistent lack of generalization reflects structural barriers—historical populations are inaccessible, cross-cultural studies costly, marginalized communities resistant to conventional recruitment. As methodological tools paired with human validation, LLMs lower these barriers without creating surrogates. This distinction determines whether LLMs expand or narrow cognitive science's scope. I operationalize this distinction through a decision framework that specifies when LLMs enhance rather than threaten generalizability, providing clear standards for responsible methodological practice.",

          "title": "How Exile Escalates Revolution",
          "authors": "Isabelle DeSisto; Elizabeth R. Nugent",
          "abstract": "Although scholars initially hypothesized that exile should deescalate conflict, recent empirical studies find that exile fuels political instability. We extend this finding by investigating the conditions under which exile exacerbates domestic contention. Drawing on an original database of exile participation in revolutions, we show that revolutionary situations with an exiled challenger tend to last longer and generate more violence than those with domestically-based challengers. Additional analyses illuminate the mechanisms behind this finding. First, exiles have a greater influence on revolutionary duration and violence when they take refuge in a geographically proximate location or maintain a meaningful presence abroad throughout the revolutionary situation. Second, exiles escalate contention by providing direct leadership, securing international support, or maintaining a government-in-exile. Finally, exiles have a stronger escalatory effect on revolutions that would otherwise be relatively peaceful. Our research unpacks a widespread and highly consequential -- but hereto understudied -- feature of revolutionary contention and outlines a research agenda on exile and domestic contentious politics.",

          "authors": "Pietro Valetto; Ive Marx; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Asset tests are widely employed to ensure that welfare resources are targeted efficiently and equitably to people that do not have the resources to be self-sufficient. This paper looks at how asset testing in social welfare programs works in the European Union and the United States and reviews the evidence on the consequences of asset testing for eligibility and behavior. For that purpose, we follow the PRISMA guidelines for study selection and synthesis, systematically reviewing 22 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2024, covering the United States and European Union, to assess the impact of asset testing.\n\nOur review finds that the real-world implementation of asset tests often undermines their stated goal of poverty reduction. While asset tests can improve targeting, they frequently discourage savings, perpetuate financial insecurity, and create administrative barriers that reduce participation among the most vulnerable. Hard thresholds incentivize dissaving and trap households in precariousness and long-term dependency, while administrative complexity often offsets any efficiency gains. Recent policy reforms-including higher thresholds, inflation-indexing, and asset exemptions-offer promising alternatives, but a persistent tension remains between targeting efficiency and poverty alleviation. We conclude that graduated approaches rather than straight disqualification better align welfare eligibility with the goals of financial resilience and poverty reduction.

          "abstract": "Behavioural research can inform effective responses to global challenges, but its application across sectors remains uneven and poorly coordinated. This survey study aimed to map the current ecosystem of behavioural research across UK sectors to identify priorities for its application, capability needs, and opportunities for strategic integration to effectively address these challenges. Invitations were distributed via mailing list, website, social media channels, and snowball sampling. We received 657 responses by people who conduct or use behavioural research in public, private and voluntary sectors. Respondents reported conducting applied (93 per cent) and/or pure (27 per cent) research across the UK. Current priorities for the application of behavioural research centred on climate action, health, methodological advances, and use of artificial intelligence. Perceived capability gaps include technological abilities, and knowledge relating to intervention design, implementation and evaluation. Broader barriers to conducting behavioural research include lack of confidence, limited funding and training, access to 'experts', and lack of acceptance of behavioural research. Findings highlight a need to increase capability through addressing skills and knowledge gaps, leadership engagement, and increasing resources for collaborative translation of behavioural research into practice. Approaches to addressing findings are being explored through sector-specific workshops and will inform future survey waves.",

          "authors": "Liz Lohn; Felix M. Simon",
          "abstract": "As news organisations adopt artificial intelligence (AI), they face growing pressure to be transparent about when and how it is used – yet practical approaches remain uneven. This paper examines AI transparency through an in-depth case study of the Financial Times (FT). Drawing on 13 semi-structured interviews with 12 senior managers across editorial, product, data science, and communications, together with internal documents, we show that the FT approaches transparency as a hybrid of policy, process, and practice, framed by a desire to safeguard both internal and external trust. Transparency is calibrated to context: internally, AI use is signposted in tools and reinforced through training and personal accountability; externally, the prominence of disclosure scales with system autonomy and editorial oversight, with stronger labelling for no-human-in-the-loop features than for AI-assisted, journalist-edited outputs. We identify nine factors that shape audience-facing disclosure – legal/provider requirements, industry benchmarking, nature of the task, human oversight, system novelty, audience expectations, perceived risk, commercial sensitivities, and design constraints – and five crosscutting challenges, including site-wide consistency (especially on mobile) and potential “transparency backfire.” Conceptually, our analysis links AI transparency to isomorphic pressures and to intersecting institutional logics. We argue that AI transparency in news is best understood as a spectrum, evolving with technological advancements, commercial, professional and ethical considerations and shifting audience attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Differences, such as gaps or contrasts, are crucial to theories in the social sciences. However, modeling these differences in structural equation modeling (SEM) remains challenging. Existing approaches have limitations that prevent researchers from modeling and testing differences flexibly. This paper introduces the H–O specification for modeling differences, a flexible SEM specification that overcomes these limitations. Our specification enables differences to be modeled as both independent and dependent variables, allows for differences between latent variables, and facilitates testing of the equal importance and full transmission assumptions. Using an empirical example from marketing research, we demonstrate that the H–O specification can reproduce the results of existing approaches while offering greater modeling flexibility and more opportunities to test differences.",

          "abstract": "Accessibility measures are widely used to assess transport equity and identify groups at risk of transport-related social exclusion (TRSE). Yet little guidance exists on how to select measures that are both theoretically robust and practically usable, and many researchers and practitioners remain unaware of the implications, biases, and consequences of their methodological choices. This paper proposes an analytical framework that consolidates dispersed arguments in the literature into a single, structured reference for evaluating accessibility measures. Developed through a comprehensive review and validated by an international expert survey, the framework comprises thirteen criteria—ten theoretical and three practical. It clarifies the ideal conditions for assessing TRSE, the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, and the biases that arise from different methodological decisions. Rather than prescribing a single ideal measure, the framework makes explicit the assumptions, strengths, and limitations underlying different approaches, supporting more transparent and context-sensitive TRSE evaluations.",

          "authors": "Chris Felton",
          "abstract": "The social media hypothesis posits that the widespread adoption of social media is largely responsible for the decline in mental health among US teenagers. Critics of this view argue that it is incompatible with estimated treatment effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which tend to be small. I argue that these RCTs provide little evidence against the social media hypothesis: the causal effect identified by RCTs fundamentally differs from the causal effect invoked by the social media hypothesis in at least three ways. First, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of joining social media, whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of quitting social media. Second, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of using social media for many years, whereas RCTs typically identify the effect of quitting social media for several weeks. Third, and most overlooked, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of altering the behavior of large swaths of the population—a global intervention—whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of local interventions. In such local interventions, a person may be encouraged to quit social media, but both her immediate peers and the general public continue to use social media in large numbers. In this commentary, I discuss the local–global distinction at length and explain why the global intervention plausibly had much larger effects than experimental local interventions.",

          "authors": "Martin Lukk; Erik Schneiderhan",
          "abstract": "Big data and computational methods have generated great excitement and enthusiasm among scholars across the social sciences. In the form of government records and digital traces collected by companies, big data are abundant, constantly updated, and inexpensive to collect, giving researchers an unprecedented window into everyday behavior. For sociologists interested in solving social problems, big data likewise seem like an attractive source of evidence for developing policies and interventions. In this paper, we draw on lessons from our research on online fundraising and social welfare provision, which uses both big data analyses as well as conventional methods, to consider how big data can be used to solve unsolved social problems. We introduce the smokescreen analogy to characterize how big data can obscure rather than clarify social problems. Digital traces often serve as a veneer over longstanding issues, leading researchers into a \"description trap\" where they generate detailed accounts at the expense of identifying causes and solutions. However, behind every smokescreen is a smoke machine. We argue that analyzing the platforms generating digital traces can reveal their causal role in shaping social problems. Big data's relationship to problem-solving is ultimately ambivalent: it can both enable new solutions and distract from enduring causes.",

          "abstract": "Debates about how politicians handle information typically center on interpretation rather than selection. We focus on this earlier and often hidden step and argue that partisan perspectives shape which evidence politicians attend to in the first place. We test this claim in a real-world field setting during the 2024 Austrian parliamentary election campaign. Three weeks before election day, we emailed 1,822 candidates links to two high-quality research briefings on the same immigration policy reform: one emphasizing how benefit cuts reduce migrant inflows, the other that such cuts increase poverty among immigrants. By tracking click behavior, we measured which type of evidence each candidate selected. Our analysis shows that selection of ideologically aligned evidence is concentrated among extreme parties: candidates from the far-right Freedom Party of Austria disproportionately choose aligned evidence, while centrist candidates show more balanced patterns. A contemporaneous survey of 1,428 citizens indicates that far-right supporters approve of elites' selective attention to evidence, suggesting alignment between elite behavior and mass preferences at the political fringes. These results identify evidence selection as an important stage in policymaking and imply that rising far-right electoral strength may amplify reliance on supportive information, potentially increasing the risk of ill-informed policy decisions.",

          "abstract": "In this examination of gender differences in financial expectations in academia, we used survey data (N = 11,315 scientists and scholars, 19 academic disciplines) integrated with individual-level bibliometric and demographic data from Scopus. We studied what Polish scientists and scholars with various demographic characteristics, academic attitudes, and bibliometric profiles considered their dream salary. Top dreamers were defined as the upper 10% of scientists in terms of self-reported level of their dream salary. Gender differences are much weaker than expected: Women generally tend to have almost equal dream salaries compared to men across age groups, academic positions, and disciplines. Although men are 56% overrepresented in the group of top dreamers, their financial expectations are similar compared to women. Among top dreamers, the median dream salary for men is only 5% higher than the median dream salary for women. Across all STEM disciplines combined, men on average expect salaries 19% higher than women (in non-STEM 15%, and in MED only 11%). Strongly research-oriented men expect higher median salaries than strongly research-oriented women; male top performers (the upper 10%) expect higher salaries than female top performers; and male internationalists in research expect higher salaries than female internationalists. Finally, as logistic regression shows, men with a strong research orientation, working in STEM disciplines, and with strong international research collaborations are most likely to be top dreamers.",

          "abstract": "Outsourcing has emerged as a strategic approach that allows organizations to improve efficiency, access specialized expertise, and focus on their core business functions. However, these benefits come with significant risks, particularly the potential erosion of internal organizational knowledge and core competencies that are central to a firm's competitive advantage. This article synthesizes literature on outsourcing processes, core competence theory, dynamic capabilities, and knowledge management to propose a comprehensive integrated framework spanning the entire lifecycle of outsourcing arrangements. The framework encompasses four critical phases that are strategic preparation, vendor selection and contracting, transition and integration, and post-transition governance, with particular emphasis on protecting and reinforcing internal knowledge resources. Drawing on empirical evidence and theoretical contributions from leading scholars in the field, we demonstrate how firms can effectively balance outsourcing efficiencies with the imperative to retain essential know-how. The article concludes with theoretical contributions, managerial implications, and directions for future research, providing both scholars and practitioners with a robust model for preserving critical organizational knowledge while capitalizing on external efficiencies.",

          "authors": "Bryce Petofi Towne",
          "abstract": "This paper orthogonalizes information symmetry (who holds information) from information completeness (whether available information suffices for a target decision or inference). We formalize two dimensions of completeness: static (relative to a finite time window) and dynamic (absolute, intertemporal). Static incompleteness arises when currently admissible signals are insufficient to identify the target; dynamic incompleteness arises when further, in-scope and decision-relevant information is foreseeably forthcoming. Within a measurable \"scope\" and an information filtration, we define probabilistic relevance as primitive, relate it to decision relevance via Blackwell monotonicity, and characterize static completeness as (approximate) point identification while dynamic completeness requires the absence of any future relevant arrivals. We distinguish institutional regimes—closed versus expandable scope—and show non-confirmability results in expandable scopes: finite evidence cannot certify either the absence of omitted relevant variables (static) or the absence of future relevant information (dynamic). We provide audit-style certificates (sufficient conditions) and falsifiers (stop-tests) for both notions, and connect the framework to partial identification, robust decision-making, rational inattention, and optimal stopping. The key implication is normative and methodological: in open environments, \"best\" actions are conditional and time-indexed rather than absolutely correct, so governance and empirical practice should report identification-set diameters, treat scope as a policy lever, and prefer falsifiable, continuous disclosure over once-and-for-all attestations.",

Social media platforms may serve as modern public spheres, offering spaces for publics to engage in rational and critical discourse. The affordances of social media platforms are crucial in providing such opportunities for dialogue and exchange. In the broader context of mediatization, we examine how platform socio-technological affordances, such as anonymity, reward systems, and moderation guidelines, coupled with user practices, co-shape the way information is produced, framed, and consumed within online communities. This study employs digital ethnography as a method to observe selected subreddits and interviews with their users, focusing on their experiences and perceptions of these digital spaces. Our preliminary findings indicate that, alongside external influences, inherent tensions between social and technological mechanisms simultaneously hinder and contribute to the nature of online deliberation, highlighting fundamental ambivalence as a structural element of online deliberative spaces. Ethical implications of socio-technological affordances are also briefly discussed.",

We then examined the relationships between fluctuations in paddy field use and village-level social, economic, and human capital.\nThe results suggest that in severely affected areas, after controlling for other regional characteristics, social capital had a positive effect on agricultural resilience. \nBy contrast, in areas with relatively minor disaster damage, economic capital had a positive effect, whereas human capital exhibited a negative effect.\nThese findings imply that the effects of different forms of capital are not consistent, and that their impacts on agricultural resilience may vary depending on severity of the physical damage. \nThis study contributes new insights to the fields of social science and disaster research, while also offering methodological advances to these disciplines.",

          "title": "Rebuilding Trust in Medical Science: A Narrative Review and Structural Reform Framework",
          "authors": "Alex Tarnava",
          "abstract": "Background: Public trust in medical science has eroded substantially over the past decade, not merely because of misinformation but due to deeper structural failures embedded within the pharmaceutical, regulatory, and academic ecosystems. Profit-oriented incentives, revolving-door politics, and misaligned academic reward systems have collectively undermined transparency and accountability. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these longstanding weaknesses, exposing how institutional opacity and commercial influence can distort evidence, policy, and ultimately, public confidence.\nMain body: This narrative review synthesizes multidisciplinary evidence from peer-reviewed literature, national surveys, regulatory audits, and governmental investigations to identify systemic determinants of declining trust in medical science. Three domains were examined: (1) commercial practices within the pharmaceutical industry that prioritize shareholder value over patient outcomes; (2) regulatory frameworks compromised by lobbying, capture, and outdated oversight models; and (3) academic systems distorted by publication bias, funding pressures, and privatization of publicly financed discoveries. From this synthesis, a six-point roadmap is proposed to restore institutional credibility, grounded in the principles of transparency, ethics, and accountability. The framework includes independent oversight bodies, reformed approval pathways, enforceable conflict-of-interest standards, equitable funding distribution, open-access academic infrastructures, and a centralized public feedback architecture. Collectively, these measures aim to recalibrate the social contract between science and society, ensuring that biomedical progress is both ethically grounded and publicly accountable.\nConclusion: Restoring trust in medical science requires more than countering misinformation. It demands structural transformation. By embedding transparency into corporate, regulatory, and academic governance, and by aligning scientific enterprise with the public interest rather than private gain, medical science can reclaim its moral authority. It offers an integrated reform blueprint to guide future policy and institutional renewal, reaffirming the ethical foundations upon which scientific credibility must rest.",

          "title": "The Politics of Flag Display: How Grassroots Mobilisation Shapes Political Resistance to Nation-Building",
          "authors": "Albert Falcó-Gimeno; Isobel Kemp",
          "abstract": "How do governments in minority regions with strong self-determination demands respond to assimilation efforts from the central state? National symbols, such as mandatory flag displays, are common tools used by states to assert authority and foster integration. This paper investigates non-compliance with such obligations in Catalonia, where many municipalities do not display the Spanish flag on town hall facades despite legal requirements. Drawing on original data from nearly one thousand municipalities between 2021 and 2024, we explore the drivers of this symbolic resistance. Contrary to expectations centred on elite strategy or state enforcement capacity, neither judicial orders nor contemporary party affiliation retain explanatory power once we control for voter preferences. Instead, the most robust drivers are localised, bottom-up, and historic. Most interestingly, we find that flag absence is overwhelmingly predicted by informal local independence referendums organised a decade earlier. After eliminating alternative mechanisms -- institutionalised path dependency, voter segmentation and current activist presence -- we hypothesise that this effect captures entrenched and enduring resistance norms within the local independence communities, which shift mayors' cost-benefit calculations. Notably, these effects are present for both secessionist and non-secessionist mayors, and for the latter, appear to override legal threats and amplify their sensitivity to local pro-independence support. These findings underscore that in deeply contested regions like Catalonia, the effectiveness of symbolic assimilation policies hinges less on formal authority or short-term elite manoeuvring, but rather localised social ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Political trust is widely considered essential for democracy, but empirical evidence testing this hypothesis remains limited. Drawing on research that connects political trust to democratic legitimacy, highlights its attitudinal and behavioral consequences, and underscores its contextual character as a form of political support, we hypothesize that political trust exerts a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already reached some level of democracy. We test this hypothesis with cross-lagged models fit to political trust estimates from 62 countries over 30 years, combined with democratic quality scores from the Varieties of Democracy project. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a conditional effect: based on our results, political trust has a positive effect on democracy, but only in countries that have already achieved high quality of democracy.",

          "abstract": "Accurate subnational fertility estimates are crucial for shaping policy decisions across diverse sectors, including education, health care, and social welfare. However, these estimates are difficult to obtain in small populations, in which data on births classified by maternal and paternal ages may be lacking or inadequate. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian model tailored to estimate the Total Fertility Rates (TFR) for both men and women at a subnational level. The model relies on population counts from age-sex pyramids and jointly models mortality and fertility patterns while accounting for uncertainty and spatio-temporal dependencies. Testing the model with simulated data that mimic Australian regions, as well as with real data from US counties, demonstrates its ability to generate reasonable TFR estimates. The estimates produced have straightforward applications to the study of subregional reproductive disparities within the US, and the proposed modeling framework can be extended to investigate subnational fertility patterns across other countries with limited birth data.",

Through a pre-registered survey experiment with TikTok users in Indonesia (n=304) and Pakistan (n=303), this study examines how moderation source, procedural contestability, and outcome alignment with user preferences individually and jointly influence perceived legitimacy of content moderation for morally, emotionally, and politically charged content. Results reveal that outcome alignment with users’ moderation preferences most consistently and significantly enhances perceived legitimacy across both countries. Moderation source (algorithmic systems, human moderators, governmental agencies, or civil society organizations) and procedural contestability showed limited direct effects, with only marginal benefits observed in Indonesia. Critically, when algorithmic moderation decisions are contestable and align with user preferences, perceived legitimacy peaks; however, when contestable algorithmic decisions contradict user preferences, legitimacy perceptions drop significantly. Individual differences in support for moral restrictions on free speech also influence user perceptions of content moderation. As algorithmic content moderation systems continue expanding globally, understanding these legitimation dynamics, especially in these understudied morally conservative contexts, proves essential for designing approaches that effectively govern online speech while maintaining user trust across diverse cultural communities.",

          "abstract": "Sustained fertility decline in high-income societies increasingly reflects not just smaller family sizes but rising rates of childlessness. While economic uncertainty and institutional factors receive much attention, the role of value orientations and subjective motivations remains underexplored. This paper examines how the perceived self-fulfillment relevance of childbearing mediates the relationship between postmaterialist values and fertility intentions, and how this interplay is moderated by expectations of welfare-state childcare support. Drawing on the Rapporto Giovani 2022 survey across Italy, France, Germany, and Spain, we analyze a sample of childless adults aged 25-34. We first model the determinants of self-fulfillment valuation of parenthood by postmaterialism and welfare expectations. Next, we estimate a moderated mediation model - through generalized structural equation modelling with nonparametric bootstrap - to decompose the direct and indirect pathways linking values, perceived support, and fertility intentions. Our analysis reveals that welfare support may strengthen fertility intentions when it aligns with postmaterialist values by enhancing the meaning of parenthood, while in the absence of support the appeal of childbearing erodes. These findings underscore the importance of integrating motivational and institutional perspectives: policy effectiveness may depend not only on reducing structural constraints, but also on resonating with individuals’ value systems.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons, including a need to save time and a desire to reduce biases in outcomes, some funders of research have started to use partial randomisation in their funding decision processes. The effect that randomisation interventions have on the reliability of those processes should, it is argued, be a consideration in their use, but this key aspect of their implementation remains under-appreciated. Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations. The simple yet apparently effective specification of the simulation of reviewer scores implemented here may also provide insights into the distribution of merit across research funding proposals, and of assessment of them.",

Sure Start in Northern Ireland is a place-based early years health and education programme that offers services to some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country. Families with children under four residing in these areas are eligible to access Sure Start services. This study uses a naturally occurring experiment with a Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design and administrative data to measure the impact of Sure Start on health and social services as well as child and maternal health at birth. We find no evidence of an impact on health outcomes at birth. However, we do find that Sure Start reduces the rate of child social services referrals and assessments for a child in need as well as the number of children who become a ‘child in need’. These reductions are most substantial in the first five years of life with no evidence of a rebound after school entry. We also find some evidence these effects are higher for mothers aged 21 and younger. Due to study limitations, the magnitude of these effects are imprecisely measured and we suggest further avenues for future research.",

          "abstract": "Segregation is a pervasive social phenomenon, separating individuals of different categories or groups across social foci. Workplaces are hubs of the labor market and central to economic outcomes, but may also facilitate cross-cutting social ties. Workplace segregation might exacerbate social inequality and decrease social cohesion. Most work on segregation focuses on salient categories like race and ethnicity, and we know little about segregation by more subtle statuses. Social class background is a case in point, because it is imperfectly observed by individuals involved in social interaction, and is more difficult to measure for total populations. In this paper, we analyze workplace segregation by social class background. We document substantial segregation by social background, over and above counterfactual segregation under random allocation of employees across workplaces. Moreover, we observe segregation levels over and above what would be expected under random allocation conditional on individual and workplace characteristics, including e.g. human capital, occupation, and workplace county. Also, when accounting for our richest set of covariates, employees are somewhat overexposed to coworkers who share their own class background. The excess segregation is the smallest for groups at the bottom of the class origin distribution, and larger at the top.",

This paper introduces the H–O specification for modeling differences, a flexible SEM specification that overcomes these limitations. Our specification enables differences to be modeled as both independent and dependent variables, allows for differences between latent variables, and facilitates testing of the equal importance and full transmission assumptions. Using an empirical example from marketing research, we demonstrate that the H–O specification can reproduce the results of existing approaches while offering greater modeling flexibility and more opportunities to test differences.",

This paper uses a case study approach to examine how historical stigma intersects with present-day exclusion for communities such as the Pardhis and Ramoshis. Drawing on key policy documents, including the Renke Commission (2008), and in-depth interviews with TANDA’s (Towards Advocacy, Networking and Developmental Action) organisational staff and field workers, the study explores the practical barriers faced by DNT/NT groups, ranging from persistent illiteracy and lack of identity documentation to discriminatory policing and exclusion from basic services.\n\nFindings highlight the complexity of marginalisation: policies intended for rehabilitation often fall short at the ground level, while community-led efforts struggle against bureaucratic hurdles and societal prejudice. Through the lens of TANDA’s grassroots interventions; such as education support, vocational training, and health initiatives, the paper details both the incremental gains and the stubborn challenges that define the landscape of social inclusion. The research also reflects on TANDA’s adaptive strategies in response to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting funding environments.\n\nDespite periodic government attention and the work of commissions, the study finds that data gaps, inconsistent recognition, and the lack of sustained state engagement perpetuate structural inequalities. The conclusion calls for targeted policy reform, direct resource allocation, and formal recognition of grassroots knowledge and leadership. Ultimately, the study argues that while organisations like TANDA play a vital bridging role, meaningful change for DNT/NT communities demands a much broader, long-term commitment to redress historical and ongoing injustices.",

Second-hand clothes shopping is the setting of our investigation because multiple forms of warm glow apply. Behaviour change toward reuse is highly desirable to lower the negative environmental impact of the fashion industry. In line with prior research, we find promising evidence in survey studies that priming the warm glow effect of second-hand shopping could increase second-hand shopping by up to 16%. However, when tested in a field study involving second-hand charity shops, messages communicating the warm glows of second-hand shopping performed no better than a general attention-generating message. Our study shows that charitable and environmentally sustainable behaviour does generate warm glow, but that the perception of warm glow might not be enough to motivate purchasing behaviours.",

Applying a convolutional neural network to street-level and overhead imagery of polling places country-wide (N≈80,000), we show that building imagery is highly predictive of voter turnout. We then use explainable artificial intelligence approaches to explore what visual features correlate with turnout, identifying attributes that plausibly mitigate contextual barriers to civic participation (including heat, insecurity, and an ongoing pandemic). Finally, we leverage the quasi-random assignment of voters to polling places to test for effects of the built environment on turnout in a causal discovery framework. The findings suggest that the built environment shapes inequalities in civic participation and demonstrate a promising approach to inductive inference from image data.",

Our findings reveal that the most powerful predictor of resilience is not external support, but a student’s internal Math Disposition: a combination of self-efficacy, interest, and low anxiety. These results suggest that one-size-fits-all support systems may be ineffective or even counterproductive.

Using a regression discontinuity in time with rich individual-level data, we find the event made Americans more favorable toward other underprivileged groups—including those not defined by race or ethnicity (LGBTQ individuals). Consistent with a norm-change interpretation, effect strength depends more on the ideological orientation of respondents’ local areas than on their personal ideology.

Building on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), it explicitly tests the mechanisms that link objective and subjectively perceived relative deprivation to subjective well-being, measured as people's life satisfaction. Doing so, we find little evidence for a negative effect of objective relative deprivation. Meanwhile, subjectively perceived relative deprivation among neighbors decreases subjective well-being in a non-linear fashion, stressing the importance of perceived relative losses over relative gains. These results are then also confirmed in robustness analyses using, among others, spatial Durbin and SLX models. Overall, the results suggest that relative deprivation also works at a geographically small, well-defined level, although it does not seem to be a key determinant of subjective well-being in this context.",

          "abstract": "Background: Socioeconomic status (SES) is positively associated with health, but these benefits are not equally shared across groups. The Minorities’ Diminished Returns (MDRs) framework posits that marginalized groups derive weaker health returns from economic resources than majority populations. Extending this framework to a migration context, this study examines wealth- and debt–health gradients in Norway, comparing first-generation immigrants with native-born Norwegians, disaggregated by region of origin and reason for migration.\nMethods: Using full-population administrative data from Norway (2017) and Poisson regression models, we analyze 590,274 first-generation immigrants and 2,867,668 native-born individuals aged 27 and older. Gross wealth (real and financial assets) and debt are the main predictors, with physician-diagnosed morbidity as the outcome.\nFindings: Wealth is more strongly associated with better health among natives than immigrants, consistent with MDRs. Gradients are steepest at lower wealth levels, plateau at higher levels, and vary by subgroup. Higher debt often predicts lower morbidity, particularly among individuals with substantial debt, suggesting debt can function as a resource as well as a burden.\nConclusion: Migration background moderates the health returns to wealth and debt, underscoring the need for policies addressing economic inequality and institutional barriers limiting immigrants’ ability to convert resources into health benefits.",

While we might expect the 1960s (with ballad-driven folk singers like Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Simon &amp; Garfunkel) to be a high-water mark for narrativity, we find the opposite: narrativity has been steadily increasing over this period, largely due to the rise of the strongly narrative genres of hip hop and rap. We also find that it is a marker of prestige for country music, with Grammy-award nominated \"Best Country\" songs displaying significantly higher narrativity rates than non-nominated songs from the same album.",

The findings reveal asymmetries in the responsibility-accountability logic, showing that citizens hold public institutions accountable for private sector failures if they strongly believe that public institutions had causal responsibility and situational control over the crisis. Citizens’ normative expectations of public institutions’ obligation to govern systemic risks are strongly correlated with blame, while public institutions’ accountability performance is not associated with citizens’ blame attribution. These novel findings provide critical insights for policy makers to manage perceptions, maintain trust, and safeguard legitimacy during crises. The study advances accountability theory by highlighting the dynamic nature of blame, which is particularly relevant for crisis governance.",

          "abstract": "Editorial boards function as gatekeepers in academic publishing, yet systematic frameworks for quantifying how symbolic capital concentrates within editorial networks remain absent. This study operationalizes Bourdieu’s symbolic capital theory through network analysis of 2,135 editorial positions across 30 sustainability science journals. Eigenvector centrality measures symbolic capital as prestige derived from connections to other prestigious positions, while Gini coefficients assess distributional inequality. Among 71 interlocking editors (those holding multiple board positions), women comprise only 22.5%, and scholars from Western Europe and North America dominate both numerically and structurally: editors with the highest eigenvector centrality are concentrated almost exclusively in these regions, while Latin America and Africa contribute only two interlocking editors each. A two-dimensional typology combining median eigenvector centrality with Gini coefficients distinguishes four configurations of symbolic capital across journals: concentrated core, dispersed core, concentrated periphery, and dispersed periphery. Critically, journals’ positions in editorial interlock networks align only partially with their citation-based intellectual centrality, demonstrating that governance structures and knowledge networks represent distinct dimensions of academic power. This reproducible analytical framework enables systematic comparison of editorial governance structures across fields.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the Italian government has intensified its investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), exemplified by the development of national large language models and the utilization of the Leonardo supercomputer. Alongside these state-led initiatives, grassroots actors have mobilized to contest dominant narratives positioning AI as a driver of competitiveness and economic growth. This article examines how Italian social movements articulate alternative sociotechnical imaginaries of AI and emerging digital technologies. Drawing on participant observation, interviews, and activist documents collected between 2023 and 2024, we employ inductive thematic analysis to explore how activists critique existing AI systems and envision socially just futures. Our findings identify three co-existing imaginaries—AI Utopia, AI Dystopia, and Solarpunk AI—that both challenge prevailing governmental discourses and experiment with grassroots technological agency. By centering activist perspectives, the article contributes to scholarship on sociotechnical imaginaries and highlights how movements reimagine AI through lenses of justice, sustainability, and democratic participation.",

We measure the convenience of the U.S. dollar using covered interest parity (CIP) deviations between risk-free bank rates, such as secured overnight rates since the benchmark reform. In parallel, we measure the convenience of U.S. Treasury bonds through CIP deviations between government bond yields. We find a pronounced divergence between the two convenience measures in recent years: while the U.S. dollar exhibits strong convenience post-Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. Treasury convenience has not only declined substantially but has turned negative, most strongly so at medium- to long-term maturities. We argue that the relative supply of government bonds between the US and other developed markets is a key driver of the U.S. Treasury convenience compared to other government bonds. Finally, we present a simple framework with a constrained global financial intermediary to link dollar and Treasury convenience.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing online offender mobility. Drawing on multidisciplinary insights, we extend two established criminological models for studying offline offending—the geometry of crime and crime journeys—by adapting their core concepts to cyberspace and developing a topology in which the cyber place is defined and becomes the unit of analysis. Just as offenders travel before, during, and after committing crime offline, we argue they also undertake trips before, during, and after committing cybercrime, and that like offline journeys these cybercrime journeys comprise identifiable and measurable components. We further distinguish between human journeys (what offenders perceive) and data journeys (what happens to the information they transmit). We explicitly demonstrate how concepts from the geometry of crime and crime journeys translate from offline to online crime and mobility. The proposed approach enables the systematic formulation of research questions and the measurement of behavioral patterns, facilitating the generation and accumulation of knowledge on cybercrime offending. The paper illustrates the framework’s theoretical relevance within environmental criminology and its practical application for cybercrime analysis through concrete examples, including an empirical human journey into web hacking as a proof-of-concept.",

Conservative voters have more children than liberal voters, allegedly due to more traditional values. However, the rise of right-wing populist parties has also been linked to fertility decline due to decreased societal trust. Few studies have directly explored the role of values or trust in the partisan fertility gap. Here we test both explanations using regional indicators of traditional values and trust in Finland, where support for the right-wing populist Finns Party has increased, and fertility declined, during the 2000s. Using national register and survey data covering four national elections in 2007–2019 and spatial panel models, we examined how municipality-level support for the Finns Party was associated with regional and temporal fertility differences, and whether differences in traditional values or generalized or institutional trust contributed to this association. Higher support for the right-wing populist party was associated with higher fertility rate, and this association was related to temporal changes in support but not with the average regional differences between municipalities. The associations were explained by traditional values but not by generalized or institutional trust. Our results show that the changes in right-wing populist party support are related to changes in fertility rates across Finnish municipalities and suggest that fertility decline is driven by changes in traditional values.",

          "abstract": "Understanding who benefits most from schooling is essential both for sociological stratification theories and for informing educational policy debates about the trade-off between equity and efficiency. Using an elaborate differential exposure model, we provide more precise and nuanced insights into this by studying (1) how school exposure affects gains in reading comprehension and mathematics, and (2) whether it adapts inequalities by parental education, migration background, gender, and initial achievement. Leveraging unique administrative data from the Netherlands Cohort Study on Education on almost 300k pupils over multiple grades (Grades 2-5), we exploit the quasi-random variation in test dates and calculate the exposure to schooling by the interval length between the mid-term and end-of-term tests in school weeks. We find that while school exposure substantially boosts achievement—by 0.015 S.D. in reading and 0.31 S.D. in mathematics per school week—these gains are not equally distributed. For reading, children with higher-educated parents and those without non-western migration backgrounds benefit more from schooling, amplifying inequality. For mathematics, we find small compensatory patterns. These findings show that the effects of schooling on inequality are domain-specific, which we explain by the multiplicative nature of skill acquisition in schools and homes – an interaction that particularly boosts reading development in resourceful families.",

          "abstract": "Studies analyzing panel data have gained popularity during the last decades, especially due to the availability of long-running panel surveys and the increasing interest in estimating causal effects. While researchers have investigated the magnitude of measurement error in survey data, little is known about the consequences of measurement error in outcome variables for longitudinal analyses, such as first-difference and fixed-effects models. In this paper, we investigate this issue using the example of monthly earnings and Mincer-style regressions, which are applied to survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) linked with administrative data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). Assuming that administrative earnings information reflects true earnings, we show that individuals typically underreport short-term earnings changes in survey data, which can lead to increasing biases with shorter panel durations. We demonstrate that this problem is substantially mitigated when using fixed-effects models, particularly when longer panels are available. Our findings thus imply that measurement error in the dependent variable can bias estimates for models focusing on short-time changes, but has negligible impacts when using long-running data and adequate methods.",

Economic approaches to religion highlight the role of material conditions on people’s religious affiliation. However, studies often rely on data inconsistent with the level of analysis of their hypothesized mechanisms, or infer material motivations to join a new religion from observed material outcomes. We present an econometric study of religious conversion by focusing on the increase in non-Catholic Christianity in Chiapas, Mexico. This state has the most converts, as well as the poorest and least formally educated population in the country, suggesting education and material conditions influence conversion. We test this hypothesis by analyzing longitudinal municipality level data from the Mexican Population Census (1950-2020). To account for potential endogeneity between education or material conditions across waves, we implement a structural equation model for the analysis of longitudinal panel data. We fail to find a significant effect of material conditions (either positive or negative) on changes in religious affiliation in Chiapas. However, we find effect heterogeneity of education on religious change driven by its interaction with distance to urban centers. These findings are consistent with previous cross-national studies on religious conversion.",

          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle throughout the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' choices systematically deviate from both imitation and optimization. Instead, they follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their choices stabilize. We effectively estimate this threshold using the Tolerance Principle (TP), a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. We show that threshold-based agents produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents, while also providing a better model of how a critical mass of dissenters can overturn conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. Furthermore, in a preregistered dyadic experiment requiring people to infer non-linguistic behavioral patterns amid controlled levels of noise in observed signals, TP outperforms all other models at reproducing learning rates among human participants. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

          "abstract": "While probability-based surveys remain the standard in academic research, non-probability online panels are increasingly used due to their lower costs and faster data collection. This study compares two post-election online panel surveys conducted in Austria—one based on probability sampling (Digitize!) and the other on non-probability sampling (AUTNES)—across three dimensions: accuracy, response quality, and survey professionalism. Both surveys demonstrate a high level of accuracy relative to external benchmarks, with the non-probability sample showing some advantage in reaching non-voters. Response quality is broadly similar; although non-probability respondents exhibit slightly more satisficing behavior, differences in attention check results, item non-response, and internal consistency are minimal. As expected, non-probability respondents report more frequent survey participation and slightly greater financial motivation. However, intrinsic motivations are equally important in both groups, and digital skills and device usage are comparable. Overall, the findings suggest that non-probability surveys can yield data quality comparable to that of probability-based approaches and may be suitable for scientific research when paired with appropriate quality assessments.",

These findings reveal a paradox in China's development model: while achieving unprecedented success in scaling innovation quantity, the nation has yet to realize comparable quality gains - a critical gap as it transitions from 'made' to 'created in China'.",

I argue that these issues pose a significant threat by eroding public trust and fragmenting the essential dialogue between elected officials and the citizens they serve. I propose a novel approach: a dedicated, government-backed digital platform providing every elected official with an individual, officially verified channel for concise, primarily one-way, text-based updates, designed to be an authoritative broadcast channel supplemented by separate mechanisms for structured citizen feedback. This system aims to circumvent the pitfalls of commercial platforms, offering a transparent and authoritative source of information that is easily searchable, fosters greater accountability, and offers robust protection against impersonation and identity theft, thereby strengthening the essential connection between representatives and the represented.",

Reducing citizen support for violence against politicians is therefore crucial to safeguard democratic institutions. To examine how this can be addressed, we use two pre-registered survey experiments in France and Belgium that manipulate politician characteristics (gender, age, and party) and violence’s severity. We find that extreme violent attitudes remain rare, although support for verbal abuse online is substantial. Importantly, our results reveal that such attitudes are  largely unrelated to affective polarization. We then show that simple interventions (humanizing politicians through perspective-taking or stressing the importance of ideological pluralism for democracy) reduce support for political violence. These findings suggest that protecting institutions requires addressing underlying societal predispositions by promoting empathy and reinforcing norms of political tolerance.",

          "abstract": "We use examples from the widely-publicized Jena Six case to highlight several issues in using news accounts in process analysis. News stories offered different narratives that included and excluded different events and offered different causal connections that reflected the standpoints and interests of different actors. Media coverage itself and outreach to news reporters were significant events that were omitted from news accounts of event sequences. The media cascade was a probabilistic outcome that could not in general be repeated through the same sequence of prior event. Two seemingly irrelevant events may have affected the outcome, one that facilitated a connection between a journalist and bloggers and another that apparently competed for attention from national activists and media.

          "abstract": "Many schools across the world allow time for students to have some form of break from formal adult-led learning activities. However, there is little understanding about the nature of these times at national and international levels. This survey study sought to examine the number and total amount of time available for school breaktimes, relative to different age groups of children, in different countries across the world. Staff in schools catering for children between the ages of 0 and 18 and participating in ‘Outdoor Classroom Day’, completed questionnaires about breaktimes in their school relative to a specific class experience. Nearly 1800 responses, from over 4,000, were selected for analysis after cleaning and selection. Findings show stark differences both within and between countries with some reporting little or no breaktime, and others reporting different breaktime regimens. Some countries employed short regular breaks in the school day while others had 1-2 more extended periods. Durations are reviewed relative to the length of the school day. Variations across phases in education are considered with some countries offering the same amount of breaktime for adolescents as for children. As participants were voluntarily involved in this play focused campaign, findings were assumed to represent a ‘best-case’ scenario. Different practices are considered relative to implications for children’s learning, social development, wellbeing and skills.",

          "abstract": "Background\nPuberty is a time of profound change for all. Autistic children may find pubertal changes harder to navigate, due to sensitives surrounding sensory experiences, and difficulty with change. Our prospectively registered mixed methods systematic review (Registration: PROSPERO2023 CRD42023446750) aimed to synthesise research on Autism and puberty.\nMethods\nIncluded studies focused on puberty in Autistic people (including self-identifying) and those supporting them. Searches were limited to English language sources from 2013 - July 2023. We searched: Medline, APA PsycINFO, and CINAHL (all via EBSCOhost), and Web of Science (via Clarivate). Studies were subjected to Convergent Integrated synthesis (Joanna Briggs Institute). Quality assessments were undertaken using Joanna Briggs Institute tools.\nResults\n3,546 unique records were identified, and 61 items were included in the review. Most papers were high quality. We identified five themes. First, many studies compared Autistic and non-Autistic people, but few differences were identified, with puberty characterised as a universal experience. Second, parents felt unprepared for their child’s puberty, and uncertain of their future. Third, additional education in areas of puberty and sex were identified as needed for Autistic people, and those caring for them. Fourth, breaking norms was explored at length; with many parents worrying their child was not normal in behaviour and development. Finally described were physical changes of puberty and challenges these bring, specifically difficulties around menarche and menstruation. Limitations of studies included a lack of diversity (ethnicity; few fathers) and restricted consideration of confounding factors and author impact on research. \nDiscussion \nCo-developed interventions are required, to facilitate understanding consent, navigating pubertal changes, and learning skills. The synthesised research did not focus on comfort and wellbeing, but more so on normality, or perceived lack of, of Autistic young people. Future research should prioritise topics of importance to Autistic people, and should seek consent from Autistic participants.",

          "abstract": "Populist parties are gaining popularity among young voters in many Western democracies. Young voters increasingly obtain news online through social media websites. TikTok has quickly ascended to become one of the most popular platforms globally. We evaluate exposure disparities regarding political parties by measuring the extent to which parties enter non-partisan users’ feeds. By implementing a sock puppet audit using 78 automated users, we can hold individual user behaviour constant – the main mechanisms through which platform algorithms curate user feeds. We collect data in Germany ahead of the three regional elections in 2024 and the federal election in 2025 (N= 561.000 videos). Overall, political content constitutes 4-10% of user feeds in our sample. When non-partisan users encounter (unsolicited) political content, it is more likely to feature videos posted by or supportive of the far-right, populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party than moderate parties. Further evidence on mechanisms explaining this right-wing visibility advantage points to the importance of multiplier networks and content virality.",

          "authors": "Hendrik Meyer",
          "abstract": "This study investigates degrees of polarization in political climate protest debates on TikTok. Drawing on a dataset of automatically transcribed TikTok videos posted by German politicians between 2022 and 2025 (N ≈ 1,700), alongside associated user comments (N ≈ 53,000), this study compares discussions on general climate activism, reformist activism (Fridays for Future), and disruptive activism (Letzte Generation). Using a mixed-method approach that combines Large Language Model–based frame classification, stance detection, and network analysis, this study operationalizes Discursive Polarization across ideological, affective, and interactional dimensions. Findings reveal that while all protest debates on TikTok are polarized, disruptive protests trigger particularly intense attacks, diverting attention away from policy-oriented climate discussions. However, politicians from conservative and far-right parties consistently frame all activists as extremists, criminals, or threats to public order, with far-right accounts dominating both content production and audience support. Network analyses demonstrate that far-right politicians and their supporters form coordinated and highly connected clusters in which both emotionally positive and hostile user engagement reinforces elite-driven antagonism. Even moderate and supportive posts by centrist or left-wing politicians attract disproportionate backlash, illustrating asymmetric polarization dynamics driven by partisan user networks. Overall, the study shows that political TikTok debates around climate protest are consistently polarized along ideological lines, but that disruptiveness intensifies antagonistic engagement and weakens Connective Action among supporters. Most crucially, far-right politicians emerge as the clear beneficiaries of TikTok’s algorithmic affordances, which—coupled with connected outrage that mobilizes their supporters—enable them to dominate debates and entrench Discursive Polarization through Connective Counteraction.",

At first glance, the data suggests that immigrants experience higher mobility than native Danes, but this pattern is driven by low coverage and poor data quality of parental education information in administrative registers. Among immigrants with the most reliable data, mobility patterns closely resemble those of natives. Auxiliary analyses using representative survey data corroborate this finding. Moreover, including immigrants in population-wide mobility estimates—given their artificially high relative mobility—attenuates trends in estimated mobility, especially for cohorts born in the 1980s.",

We investigate the partisan bias of Japanese redistricting, in which a nonpartisan commission---appointed by the Prime Minister and approved by the Diet---draws districting plans. The existence of partisan bias in this setting remains a subject of debate in the literature. We estimate the partisan bias of the 2022 Japanese Lower House redistricting plans with a state-of-the-art redistricting simulation algorithm. By comparing the enacted plan with simulated nonpartisan baseline, we quantify the extent to which the enacted plan favors the ruling coalition. Our analysis shows that the Japanese redistricting process yields little partisan bias at both the prefecture and district levels.",

Using weekly Google Trends data from September 2021 to July 2025, the research identifies differences in public attention and the key drivers shaping perceptions of AUKUS. Australians emphasise costs and uncertainties; the British prioritise economic opportunities and diplomatic influence; and Americans focus on strategic considerations. China-related factors—particularly the perceived China Threat—play a central role in shaping public sentiment in Australia and the United States, whereas in the United Kingdom, a combination of China influence, employment concerns, and the Global Britain agenda drives attention. The study also considers policy implications, finding a strong alignment between public opinion and government policy across the three countries. While the core AUKUS narrative centres on the UK, the United Kingdom may also play a leading role in setting the policy agenda.

          "authors": "Mohit Singhal",
          "abstract": "Background:\nThe U.S. opioid epidemic imposes a persistent and disproportionate economic burden on payers and communities, driven by complex interactions among clinical utilization, pharmacy benefit management (PBM) policies, and social determinants of health (SDOH). Despite extensive research on overdose and prescribing risk, few studies have quantified the cost burden of opioid use or examined how policy and community-level factors jointly shape it.\n\nObjective:\nThis study develops an interpretable, machine-learning framework integrating PBM cost levers and SDOH indicators to predict and explain county-level variation in opioid-related spending from 2013–2023. The goal is to identify structural drivers of cost, simulate potential savings under policy and social interventions, and support data-driven resource allocation.\n\nMethods:\nUsing CMS Medicare Part D data linked with County Health Rankings and U.S. Census indicators, a Random Forest regression model was trained on ten years of county-level data (≈3,000 counties, 2013–2023). Key predictors included unemployment, income ratio, obesity, smoking, provider density, and PBM variables such as cost per claim and opioid prescribing rate. Model interpretability was achieved through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis and policy simulations testing both PBM and SDOH interventions.\n\nResults:\nThe model achieved high predictive accuracy (R² ≈ 0.97), explaining nearly all observed variation in opioid cost per capita. SHAP analysis revealed unemployment, mental-health-provider density, and income inequality as dominant drivers, while provider access and preventive-care variables exerted cost-mitigating effects. Simulated PBM levers (e.g., formulary tightening, utilization management) reduced predicted costs by 4–6%, while integrated SDOH improvements (e.g., +20% behavioral-health access, +10% primary care) achieved up to 17% savings—equivalent to approximately $23 billion nationally. The combined model demonstrated both statistical robustness and policy relevance.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study reframes the opioid crisis through an economic and structural lens, demonstrating that predictive modeling can translate public-health and PBM data into actionable fiscal insights. The proposed PBM–SDOH integration provides a scalable, transparent framework for targeting interventions in high-burden counties, optimizing healthcare spending, and informing evidence-based opioid policy.\n\nKeywords:\nOpioid costs, pharmacy benefit management, social determinants of health, Medicare Part D, machine learning, SHAP, predictive modeling, public health economics, health policy",

          "abstract": "Party loyalty in U.S. congressional elections has reached heights unprecedented in decades. Some theories of would predict that deviation from national partisanship is even more rare in low-information, down-ballot offices with a party label.  Yet, here I show that ticket splitting in state and local offices is often higher than in Congress.  I use cast vote records from voting machines that overcome measurement challenges, and develop a clustering algorithm to summarize such ballot data.  For example, about one in three South Carolina Trump voters are part of a bloc whose probability of ticket splitting is 5 percent for Congress, but 23 percent for county council and 48 percent for sheriff. A model with candidate valence differentials can explain these patterns. These results show that even with nationalized politics, some voters cross party lines to vote for the more experienced and higher quality candidate in state and local elections.",

          "abstract": "The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce “truthful” entries via the large language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 1,800 matched article pairs between Grokipedia and Wikipedia, drawn from the 2,000 most-edited Wikipedia pages. Using metrics across lexical richness, readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and greater structural variability. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content currently mirrors Wikipedia’s informational scope but diverges in editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.",

We make use of a new database constructed from Tongnianchilu and Mingjingtongpu records of degree holders that will be of broad interest and which we introduce in detail. It contains information for 950,927 relatives of 34,313 degree holders, including their names, degrees, and official positions held. Kin include patrilineal fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers considered in previous studies of elite mobility in China as well as mothers, wives, uncles, cousins, sons and daughters, and nephews. We present descriptives on the numbers, types, and characteristics of recorded kin for different types of degree holders. We show that many degree-holders who appeared to be 'new' in the sense that neither their father, grandfather, or great-grandfather had a degree or held office, still had other senior kin with a degree. We also show that status was highly correlated within kin networks.",

          "abstract": "Functional strategies play a pivotal role in guiding policy development and enhancing organizational effectiveness. However, public concerns have been raised regarding the timeliness, effectiveness, and achievement of set objectives in the service delivery of the Kiambu County Government in Kenya. This study sought to explore the influence of implementing functional strategies on service delivery. The specific objectives were to assess the impact of human resource, supply chain, operational, and technological strategies on service delivery. The research was grounded in Adams' Equity Theory, Systems Theory, Stakeholder Theory, and the Technology Adoption Model. A descriptive research design was utilized, with data collected via questionnaires from 120 senior, middle, and supervisory officers in Kiambu County Government, achieving a 90%response rate. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Pearson correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations between service delivery and human resource strategies(r=0.822),supply chain strategies(r=0.737),operational strategies(r=0.714)and technological strategies(r=0.811),,all statistically significant(p&lt;0.01).A multiple regression model revealed that these functional strategies collectively accounted for 52.1%of the variance in service delivery.Notably, technological strategies emerged as the most potent predictor(β=0.539), followed by human resource strategies. This indicates that while an integrated approach is essential, strategic investment in technology may currently offer the highest leverage for improving service delivery in Kiambu County. The study concludes that a concerted focus on these functional strategies is crucial for enhancing service delivery. It recommends that the county government invest in advanced technologies, enhance human resource incentives and performance evaluations, strengthen supply chain vendor accountability, and optimize operational processes for continuous improvement",

          "authors": "David Roberts",
          "abstract": "The Eligibility as Environmental Construct (EEC) framework interprets IDEA eligibility through an ecological lens, deepening the law's focus on access and participation. EEC repositions educational impact as a relational phenomenon emerging from the interaction between learner and environment. The framework draws on Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, Vygotsky's social constructivism, and neurodiversity-affirming ethics to align IDEA's guarantees of Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) and Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) with ecological reasoning. The accompanying heuristic—the context-dependent communicator/learner—shows how this perspective can inform eligibility documentation and goal writing without creating new diagnostic categories. Assessment centers on contextual access rather than categorical severity, asking whether specialized instruction is needed to enable participation in environments typical for age peers. By integrating ecological theory, jurisprudence, and inclusive ethics, EEC offers practitioners a coherent framework for interpreting eligibility as environmental access.",

          "authors": "Saswat Sundar Rath",
          "abstract": "In this paper, I introduce “The Triangle of Human Wants”, a novel theoretical model that views human desire as a dynamic and a self-balancing construct based on three interdependent foundational elements such as- Time, Resources, and Money (TRM). The model suggests that these three form the bare minimum conditions that are needed for any want, desire, or goal to emerge, be pursued, and ultimately be satisfied. It draws an analogy to the disease triangle in plant pathology, where disease only occurs when there is the presence of a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and a favourable environment, in the same sense, the TRM says that the absence of any one of the elements results in want not being fulfilled or efforts being redirected. Unlike existing motivational theories, such as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, that describes what humans want, whereas the TRM answers how can a want exist or proceed. It considers human life as if it’s an interacting field of energy, limited by availability of time, access to resources, and monetary means. Empirical data used here was collected through a survey I conducted with 80 respondents with a simple questionnaire to assess how goal achievement relates to TRM availability, revealing significant correlation between domains (r = .34 to .51), a three-factor structure presented by exploratory factor analysis (EFA; loadings&gt;|0.40|, total variance explained was 100%), and decent predictive power (R2 = .35 in regression) for an initial pilot study. Barriers like money where the major bottleneck according to the survey (28% of citations). Overall, The TRM offers a foundational idea which unities motivational, economic, and systems theories into one framework. Its implications include personal well-being, organization goal achievement, policy design and even a universal tool for diagnostics. The findings open pathways for TRM in interventions addressing wastage and misapplication in a complex, resource-limited, and time-bound universe.",

News stories offered different narratives that included and excluded different events and offered different causal connections that reflected the standpoints and interests of different actors. Media coverage itself and outreach to news reporters were significant events that were omitted from news accounts of event sequences. The media cascade was a probabilistic outcome that could not in general be repeated through the same sequence of prior event. Two seemingly irrelevant events may have affected the outcome, one that facilitated a connection between a journalist and bloggers and another that apparently competed for attention from national activists and media.

The focus of the survey is on uses of unedited machine translations. A sample of 2,520 UK professionals submitted valid responses to this survey. A total of 33% of them had used machine translation at work, most often in contexts involving direct communication with others in a shared physical space. The professionals were highly satisfied with the tools they used. They were also confident in their ability to use the tools successfully, even though it was uncommon for machine translation to be mentioned in workplace training. Google Translate was by far the tool used most often. The use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT also ranked highly. The tools were often accessed on personal devices using an openly available browser interface, practices which pose significant risks to privacy and information security.",

          "authors": "Taha Yasseri",
          "abstract": "The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce “truthful” entries via the large language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 1,800 matched article pairs between Grokipedia and Wikipedia, drawn from the 2,000 most-edited Wikipedia pages. Using metrics across lexical richness, readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and greater structural variability. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content currently mirrors Wikipedia’s informational scope but diverges in editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the effects of storytelling traditions on language evolution via two case studies analysing the oral storytelling tradition associated with Tlingit, an Indigenous Alaskan language, and written storytelling in British and American English. It suggests that Tlingit oral literature distinctly influenced both the morphology and vocabulary of the modern Tlingit language, and that changes in English storytelling style and transmission did the same throughout the history of the English language, supporting an argument that storytelling tradition has the potential to impact the evolution of associated languages. To develop its argument, the paper describes the differences between oral and written storytelling, and draws comparisons between Tlingit and other languages to demonstrate the areas in which Tlingit language structure reflects the oral format of its literary tradition. Then, it outlines Tlingit literary and cultural philosophy to demonstrate the influence of literary themes on the language’s vocabulary. The second half of the paper draws comparisons between historic shifts in English storytelling and concurrent changes in the language, suggesting a cause-and-effect relationship between literary style and evolution in English vocabulary. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a linguistic correlation between storytelling and language which merits further exploration and research. Where cited authors have both Indigenous and Western names, they are listed in order of individual preference whenever possible.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the Italian government has intensified its investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), exemplified by the development of national large language models and the utilization of the Leonardo supercomputer. Alongside these state-led initiatives, grassroots actors have mobilized to contest dominant narratives positioning AI as a driver of competitiveness and economic growth. This article examines how Italian social movements articulate alternative sociotechnical imaginaries of AI and emerging digital technologies. Drawing on participant observation, interviews, and activist documents collected between 2023 and 2024, we employ inductive thematic analysis to explore how activists critique existing AI systems and envision socially just futures. Our findings identify three co-existing imaginaries—AI Utopia, AI Dystopia, and Solarpunk AI—that both challenge prevailing governmental discourses and experiment with grassroots technological agency. By centering activist perspectives, the article contributes to scholarship on sociotechnical imaginaries and highlights how movements reimagine AI through lenses of justice, sustainability, and democratic participation.",

          "abstract": "The recent internationally driven sustainability discussions and the need to embrace circular economies have sparked off intense studies of bio-based materials as alternatives to the synthetic, petroleum-based composites. One of these, jute, a lignocellulosic bast fiber, has become a leader because it is renewable, has high specific strength and is also biodegradable. The paper will look at the expanding opportunities of the jute composite materials as covers its material properties, earlier methods of its fabrication and the newer usage that it opens in various industries. In this review, jute composites are shown to have excellent environmental benefits regarding a smaller carbon footprint and recyclability at the end of their life through a qualitative synthesis of existing literature. Nevertheless, commercial proliferation of such composites would hang on the achievement of the internal hurdles like hydrophilic vulnerability and inconsistency in the characteristics of fibers. The paper wraps up with strategic materials science research, scale-up, and cross-sectoral investigation recommendations, assuming that jute composites will play a significant part in the shift to more sustainable material systems in the automotive, construction and packaging sectors, among others.",

          "abstract": "This article re-examines Thomas Sankara’s revolution in Burkina Faso (1983–1987) to explain why postcolonial revolutions in Africa, though morally compelling, rarely generate enduring institutions. Using process-tracing of speeches, policy documents, and secondary sources, it analyses the mechanisms that transformed a project of emancipation into political isolation and collapse. The study identifies two interlocking dynamics – ideological ambiguity and confrontational state-building – that shaped both the rise and the demise of the Sankarist regime. It argues that revolutionary governments in Africa operate within structural constraints that reward moral purity but penalise institutional compromise. Comparison with Ghana under Rawlings and Uganda under Museveni shows that revolutions endure when moral authority is translated into hybrid institutions able to negotiate legitimacy across social and cultural cleavages. By conceptualising African revolutions as state-building experiments under constraint, the article bridges debates on revolutionary politics, postcolonial governance, and indigenous legitimacy, offering a new theoretical lens for understanding the fragility of moral authority in African state formation.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study proposes and quantifies a novel ‘grey zone hybrid warfare’ model: without formal declaration of war, the aggressor employs multiple, small-scale, deniable infiltration units to orchestrate infrastructure disruption incidents. Concurrently, it pre-positions short positions in global capital markets through sovereign credit default swaps (CDS), put options and similar instruments. amplifying narratives of ‘state failure’ to mislead markets into interpreting localised incidents as systemic collapse. This triggers sovereign rating downgrades, soaring spreads, and rapid market capitalisation erosion among leading enterprises, achieving ‘credit damage’. The paper proposes a ‘dual-layer coordination model’ (destruction layer/financial arbitrage layer) alongside three metrics: market overreaction coefficient β, self-financing ratio SFR (SFR&gt;1 indicates industrialisability), and credit damage index. Results indicate this model circumvents traditional collective defence mechanisms. Consequently, defence priorities must shift from ‘preventing single-point breaches’ to ‘disrupting closed-loop systems’—namely, integrated early warning through intelligence-financial regulation-public clarification. Legally, ‘infrastructure sabotage + financial arbitrage’ should be elevated as a primary threat, with ‘credit firewalls’ suppressing β and SFR to prevent this model evolving into replicable, profit-driven attack supply chains.",

Using data from Japan’s largest job-matching intermediary that tracks full recruitment processes, we find elasticities near one for upper-wage workers but insignificant elasticities for lower-wage workers, while little variation across employment types are found. Elasticities are higher in small firms and in competitive occupations. Because both sides’ outside options matter, controlling for choice sets is essential. Posted wages mainly influence the application stage, suggesting that applications\nreliably approximate matches in estimating recruitment elasticity.",
