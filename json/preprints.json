          "title": "Analyzing the Consistency of Retraction Indexing",
          "authors": "Malik Oyewale Salami; Corinne McCumber; Jodi Schneider",
          "abstract": "Post-retraction citation may be partly due to authors’ and publishers' challenges in systematically identifying retracted publications. To investigate retraction indexing quality, we investigate the agreement in indexing retracted publications between 11 database sources, restricting to their coverage, resulting in a union list of 85,392 unique items. We also discuss common errors in indexing retracted publications. Our results reveal low retraction indexing agreement scores, indicating that databases widely disagree on indexing retracted publications they cover, leading to a lack of consistency in what publications are identified as retracted. Our findings highlight the need for clear and standard practices in the curation and management of retracted publications, in order to reduce inadvertent post-retraction citation and draw sound conclusions.",

          "authors": "Abhishek Baba; Swarag. T; Ark Verma",
          "abstract": "Research suggests that individuals consistently demonstrate favorable attitudes towards members of their ingroups compared to those belonging to other social groups. Such ingroup biases are observed not only in well-established historical groups but also in minimal group settings. The current study investigates the robustness of the said ingroup bias across different contexts through four experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were merely assigned to one of the two existing minimal groups, and their ingroup bias was assessed. In the next three experiments (Exps 2a - 2c), the participants were assigned to one of the two minimal groups, and the relationship between the groups was manipulated. In Experiment 2a, both groups were described as good and in a mutually harmonious relationship; in Experiment 2b, the two groups were in a conflicted relationship, with the ingroup described as good and the outgroup as bad; and finally, in Experiment 2c, both groups were again in a conflicted relationship with the ingroup being described as bad and the outgroup as good. The degree of ingroup bias was indexed in terms of faster response times, higher accuracy, and greater sensitivity on a perceptual-matching task. Interestingly, while the preliminary analysis showed a significant moderation of bias measures across the four experiments, a more detailed examination using Bayesian regression analysis and Drift-Diffusion Modeling established a strong persistence of ingroup favoritism despite changing group characteristics and relations. Indeed, the changing relations didn’t affect the robust ingroup bias much as the general trend for favoring one’s own group persisted across all experiments. The minimal yet robust nature of ingroup favoritism is explicated.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study assesses whether transcendent accountability amplifies the positive associations between welcoming accountability to others and the performance virtues of patience and courage. Method: Using a sample of 1,884 college students, path analyses tested whether perceiving transcendent accountability moderated the association between welcoming accountability to others in goal pursuit and the virtues of patience and courage, which were assessed both in goal pursuit and at the trait-level. Results: Welcoming accountability was associated with goal- and trait-level patience and courage, but transcendent accountability was only associated with courage in goal pursuit. Transcendent accountability amplified the associations between welcoming accountability and patience and courage in pursuing goals and trait patience in daily hassles. Conclusions: In addition to expanding the nomological network of welcoming accountability to include performance virtues, the amplifying effect of transcendent accountability highlights the importance of embracing accountability to both humans and a transcendent other for cultivating virtuous goal-pursuit.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Self-compassion can help people when they make mistakes, but does it affect how people respond when falsely accused of making a mistake? In this research we tested the hypothesis that self-compassion is associated with lower levels of anger after a false accusation which, in turn, lowers the likelihood that people will attempt to challenge the accusation.\n\nMethod: In Studies 1a (N = 422) and 1b (N = 492), participants imagined that they were playing in an important tennis match and were falsely accused by an official of making an error. In Study 2 (N = 346), participants completed an online survey that, at one point, displayed a message accusing them of plagiarising one of their responses. \n\nResults: In all studies, self-compassion assessed prior to the accusation was negatively associated with levels of anger following the accusation. Anger, in turn, was positively associated with intentions to challenge the accusation (Studies 1a and 1b) and with the likelihood that participants brought the false accusation to our attention when given an opportunity to do so (Study 2). \n\nConclusion: This research shows that highly self-compassionate people are not always ferocious and may be susceptible to being taken advantage of when facing false accusations.",

          "abstract": "Effective communication depends on reasoning about what others know and believe, and failures in executive functioning can disrupt the way adults reason about mental states. No study has revealed errors traceable to mental state reasoning processes, such as failures in interpreting premises, simulating possibilities, and formulating conclusions. We developed such a theory to account for both rational and error-prone mental state reasoning; to test it, we investigated a family of specific mental state reasoning inferences concerning agents and their states of knowledge and belief. Online participants in eight preregistered studies (N = 484) considered conditional inferences couched in terms of a mental state, e.g., Alia knows that if it’s rainy then the café is closed; It’s rainy. What follows? They generated natural conclusions using a novel sentence construction interface (Experiments 1a-e, 3, 4) and by typing out responses (Experiment 2). These generative tasks permitted analyses of participants’ tendency to draw sensible epistemic conclusions as well as their systematic errors. One family of errors was an “omniscience” error: reasoners erroneously imputed knowledge of a deductive consequence to an individual. We explain these results in the context of a novel, model-based theory of epistemic reasoning.",

          "title": "Foundations of Consumer Neuroscience",
          "authors": "Crystal Reeck",
          "abstract": "Consumer neuroscience is, to some extent, defined by its methodologies. Traditional consumer research relies upon traditional behavioral techniques, such as examining choice, asking people to provide self-report ratings, and measuring response time. Consumer neuroscience utilizes many of these tools, but also employs neuroscientific methodologies, including eye-tracking, psychophysiology, neuroimaging, and circulating hormones. The present chapter examines how these tools have shed light in a range of domains. I focus here on brands, brand personalities, neuroforecasting, and purchase decisions. With respect to brands, I discuss findings from work comparing two brands (e.g., Coke and Pepsi) as well as multiple brands. For brand personalities, I discuss how brands are judged compared to people and novel neural techniques for capturing brand personality judgments. The neuroforecasting section discusses a range of types of predictions made using neural data. In investigating pricing and purchasing, I review a host of evidence from different paradigms. Across these topic areas, I review a range of types of evidence, including data from functional magnetic resonance imaging, circulating hormones, and lesion research, among others. In each case, evidence from neuroscience provides novel insight into a process that guides consumer behavior.",

          "abstract": "Research on political ideology and labor activism is limited to data from Western countries, used general operationalization of ideology, and focused predominantly on union membership as the outcome variable. In contrast, present studies examined the relationship between several dimensions of ideology (general, economic, and cultural) and various aspects of labor activism in countries representing diverse contexts. Using data from three multi-country surveys (N = 60,414), Study 1 found that ideology predicted union membership within the European context but showed no significant association in the global or U.S. context. In Studies 2a (N = 1,620) and 2b (N = 2,351) using data from the U.S., Poland and India, left economic ideology emerged as the most consistent predictor of labor activism, as well as positive attitudes toward unions in the U.S. and Poland, but not in India. These findings highlight the importance of extending research to non-WEIRD countries to better understand labor activism.",

          "authors": "Anna Potoczek; Katarzyna Jasko",
          "abstract": "While political candidates differ in how extreme vs. moderate their ideas are, it remains unclear how the extremism of a politician’s agenda impacts voters. To fill this gap, the present research investigated the mobilizing effects of extreme vs. moderate politicians on both supporters and opponents. The results of five preregistered experiments (N = 3,532) showed that, in comparison to moderates, extreme political candidates were more successful in motivating their supporters to get engaged on their behalf. However, they were also more likely to energize their opponents to act against them. We further show that the effect the candidates’ ideological extremism had on their support was positively mediated via higher perceived commitment to their goals, but negatively via lower expectancy of their success. Crucially, we show that social norms moderate the appeal of extreme politicians. Specifically, the advantage of extremists over moderates emerged when the opinions within society were polarized or skewed towards the extremes, but the advantage disappeared under a normal distribution of opinions. Taken together, these studies provide insights into why and when political candidates with extreme views win greater support than moderates.",

          "abstract": "Photojournalistic depictions of displaced persons convey ingroup and outgroup membership, which may humanize individuals or reinforce otherness. We examine whether such visual framing influences empathic responses and policy attitudes toward displaced persons through two preregistered experiments in the United States (N = 2,550). Across conditions, we vary skin tone (White/Black) and group size (small/large) in news images. In the \"refugees\" experiment, participants respond to images of refugees fleeing conflict (from Ukraine or South Sudan), while the \"flood victims\" experiment explores reactions to displaced persons affected by natural disasters within the United States. We also investigate whether individual differences in empathy and prejudice moderate the impact of media images. Findings indicate that visual framing exerts minimal influence on empathic responses or policy support for government aid to displaced persons",

          "authors": "Magdalena Kachlicka; Ashley E Symons; Yaoyao Ruan; Kazuya Saito; Frederic Dick; Adam Tierney",
          "abstract": "Learning a second language (L2) is a desirable skill, yet some learners struggle to achieve proficiency. These difficulties might arise partly from perceptual strategies inherited from learners’ first language (L1). For example, speakers of a tone language like Mandarin, in which pitch is an essential cue, tend to over-use pitch in English prosody perception and production. Here, we developed a novel training paradigm to help Mandarin learners of English adopt more native-like perceptual strategies by enhancing their ability to use duration relative to pitch cues during prosody categorization. 30 learners completed the targeted prosody training and the control group of 30 participants practiced English vocabulary. After prosody training, participants showed enhanced use of duration during categorization of phrase boundaries, where duration is the primary cue. For word focus and lexical stress, there was no clear change in perceptual strategies, suggesting that cue weighting training is most effective when it guides listeners towards using the primary cue for a given feature. Control group showed stronger reliance on pitch when categorizing lexical stress at post-test suggesting that in the absence of targeted instruction listeners tend to solidify the use of the strategy that works well for them. Our findings provide evidence of strong reliance on pitch among Mandarin learners and difficulties resisting default strategies in L2 speech perception. Nevertheless, we show that perceptual strategies that took a lifetime to develop can be adjusted with as little as three hours of training. These findings offer a new direction for designing targeted training paradigms.",

          "authors": "Benedek Kurdi; David Melnikoff; Adam Morris",
          "abstract": "Influential classic and contemporary accounts have posited that implicit attitudes reside beyond conscious awareness. This idea has been challenged by robust evidence demonstrating that participants can predict their own implicit attitudes highly accurately. However, past tests have all been conducted using well-known targets (e.g., racial groups), about which participants possess ample relevant knowledge. As such, predictions of implicit attitudes may have relied on inferential mechanisms drawing on sources of knowledge other than privileged introspective access, most prominently explicit attitudes. In this project we conducted eight experiments (five preregistered; total N = 6,794) in which implicit attitudes and their explicit counterparts were manipulated to shift in opposite directions, thus eliminating the latter as an obvious source of inference. Across experiments, mean-level implicit attitude predictions (β =  0.31) were directionally consistent with explicit (β =  0.49) rather than implicit attitudes (β = 0.20). Moreover, although predictions and implicit attitudes were associated with each other at the level of individual participants (β = 0.20), the relationship was considerably stronger among participants for whom explicit and implicit attitudes were aligned with each other (β = 0.38) than among participants for whom the two were dissociated (β = 0.11). These results generalized across two learning paradigms (impression formation and attribute conditioning), two implicit attitude measures (IAT and EPT), and two types of experimental design (between-participant and within-participant). Echoing classic and contemporary accounts, the present data suggest that implicit attitudes are largely unconscious, and successful implicit attitude predictions are subserved primarily by inference rather than introspection.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety is commonly experienced by neurodivergent individuals participating in Higher Education, related to both cognitive performance and academic achievement. Whereas certain anxieties in neurodivergence (e.g., social and general anxiety) have received much attention, scant research has considered mathematics and statistics anxiety. In this study, 1,383 university students (679 neurotypical, 704 neurodivergent individuals) – matched on age, gender, education level, and country of origin – completed measures assessing various types of anxiety (including mathematics and statistics anxiety), attitudes toward mathematics, self-efficacy, and cognitive reflection. Results showed that neurodivergent students exhibited higher anxiety levels across measures, including mathematics and statistics anxiety. However, only cognitive and somatic anxiety and social anxiety explained individual variance in neurodivergent status after taking into account the effects of other measures. Despite differing anxiety levels (which showed variability between different neurodivergences), neurodivergent and neurotypical students were equivalent in cognitive reflection scores, suggesting similar levels of analytic thinking skills (including reasoning about mathematical content). In both the neurotypical and neurodivergent groups, higher levels of cognitive reflection were associated with male gender, less fear of negative evaluation, and lower mathematics and creativity anxiety, replicating and extending previous work. Our findings have implications for instructors across sectors with respect to supporting neurodivergent individuals.",

          "authors": "Catherine M. Hicks; Ana Hevesi",
          "abstract": "Understanding how developers problem-solve within ecosystems of practice, tooling, and social contexts is a critical step in determining which factors dampen, aid or accelerate software innovation. However, industry conceptions of developer problem-solving often focus on overly simplistic measures of output, over-extrapolate from small case studies, rely on conventional definitions of “programming” and short-term definitions of performance, fail to integrate the new economic features of the open collaborative innovation that marks software progress, and fail to integrate rich bodies\nof evidence about problem-solving from the social sciences. We propose an alternative to individualistic explanations for software developer problem-solving: a Cumulative Culture theory for developer problem-solving. This paper aims to provide an interdisciplinary introduction to underappreciated elements of developers’ communal, social cognition which are required for software development creativity and problem-solving, either empowering or constraining the solutions that developers access and implement. We propose that despite a conventional emphasis on individualistic explanations, developers’ problem-solving (and hence, many of the central innovation cycles in software) is better described as a cumulative culture where collective social learning (rather than solitary and isolated genius) plays a key role in the transmission of solutions, the scaffolding of individual productivity, and the overall velocity of innovation.",

To this end, we evaluated the Self-Initiated Humour\nProtocol (SIHP), a new type of self-administrable laughter intervention that utilises spontaneous\nand self-induced laughter. Rooted in the core principles of the Self-Attachment Technique —in\nwhich an individual creates an affectional bond with their childhood self as represented by their\nchildhood photo or personalised childhood avatar —SIHP provides an algorithmic framework for\nindividuals to learn to laugh in a non-hostile manner and develop a sense of humour in all possible\nlife contexts. This allows SIHP to be self-administered by interacting with an AI agent.\n\nMethods: An 8-week intervention was conducted with N=27 adult participants. Exclusion criteria:\nsevere depression or anxiety (PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores above 15). Participants’ measurements\nwere collected in the areas of wellbeing, use of different humour styles, emotional self-regulation,\nself-compassion and psychological capital, and analysed to understand any changes over time.\nMeasurements were taken immediately before, after the intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up.\nThroughout the intervention, participants were required to practise SIHP 20 minutes a day with the\naid of an emotionally intelligent chatbot and their personalised child avatar in virtual reality (VR).\n\nResults: Analysis of results at the 3-month follow-up showed significant improvements in the\nprimary outcome of wellbeing with large effect size (r = 0.92), as well as a range of secondary\noutcomes with large effect sizes, self-compassion (r = 0.93), use of self-enhancing humour (d = 0.80),\nand emotion regulation (d = 0.87); the results also showed improvement to participant’s psychological capital with moderate effect size (d = 0.56).\n\nDiscussion: This study shows the potential for the practice of SIHP as supported by an emotionally\nintelligent chatbot and personalised child avatar to have medium term positive effects, which should\nbe validated through future randomised trials",

          "authors": "Niek Stevenson; Andrew Heathcote; Birte Forstmann; Dora Matzke",
          "abstract": "Studying individual differences in psychology often involves examining\ncorrelations across various measures. However, research involving high-\ndimensional data—such as in task batteries or neuroscience—often targets\nlatent constructs rather than individual correlations. Furthermore, the num-\nber of correlations grows quadratically with increasing dimensionality, po-\ntentially leading to overfitting and spurious inference. Therefore, researchers\ncommonly use factor analysis to study individual differences. However, con-\nventional approaches ignore the hierarchical structure of the data and over-\nlook measurement error, leading to attenuated factor loadings. In this pa-\nper, we introduce a Bayesian framework that integrates hierarchical mod-\neling to account for measurement error with factor analysis to infer latent\nstructures. We employ a post-hoc processing algorithm that removes the\nneed for conventional constraints on factor loadings, thereby avoiding po-\ntential bias in their estimation. Additionally, we utilize a shrinkage prior\nto automatically identify and exclude unsupported factors. The accompa-\nnying software enables the creation of generative models at the individual\nlevel, supporting a wide range of hypotheses—from descriptive to theory-\ndriven models—and facilitating robust group-level inferences grounded in\npsychological theory. Through simulations and empirical applications, we\ndemonstrate that our hierarchical factor analysis method flexibly and reli-\nably estimates latent structures in high-dimensional data, offering a valuable\ntool for individual-differences research in psychology and neuroscience.",

Separate analyses examined: (1) the first-implanted ear in sequential BCI listeners, matched to the same ear in SSD listeners, and (2) the lower-performing ear in BCI listeners. Models included moderators like age, time since implantation, CI usage, and etiology. An additional analysis compared first and second implants for sequential BCI listeners.\n\nResults: SSD listeners consistently showed lower CNC scores than BCI listeners after controlling for age, time since implantation, CI usage, and etiology. Sequential BCI listeners exhibited lower CNC scores on their second ear, compared to their first ear. \n\nConclusion: Speech perception with CIs is reduced in SSD listeners compared to BCI users, likely due to blocking, where the normal-hearing ear diminishes reliance on the CI. Lower performance in the second implanted ear of sequential BCI listeners also suggests greater reliance on the more experienced ear. These findings highlight the need for additional training, resources, and support to optimize CI performance in SSD listeners, despite prior evidence of positive CNC outcomes.",

          "authors": "Niclas Kaiser; Juan Camilo Avendano-Diaz",
          "abstract": "Relational neuroscience struggles to capture the complex dynamics of shared interpersonal moments, leading to gaps in understanding whether and how interdependencies between interacting persons translate into something meaningful. Current neuroscientific research often focuses on motor synchronization and cognition rather than the implicit relational qualities central to psychotherapy. We argue that this disconnect stems from an over-reliance on simplified quantitative methods, a failure to centralize experiential factors, and the lack of convergent research. Drawing on emerging frameworks such as 4E cognition (embodied, enacted, extended, and embedded) and MoBI (Mobile Brain/Body Imaging), we advocate for integrating subjective and experiential elements with neural data. We propose focusing on \"qualities\" in multi-brain neuroscience—moving beyond binary or linear scales—to better capture the subtleties of relational moments. Finally, we emphasize the importance of convergence research across disciplines to better understand what interpresence holds. If psychotherapeutic knowledge is used to guide neuroscientists in what to look for, this multi-disciplinary approach holds promise for advancing the study of psychotherapy's relational processes, offering new insights into the neurobiology of meaningful moments in therapy and elsewhere. We propose ConNECT (Convergent research including Neuroscience and Experiences, Capturing meaningful dynamics with Therapists’ knowledge) as the path forward.",

          "abstract": "Implementation intentions could be a promising metacognitive strategy for self-regulated learning. They could help students increase the likelihood of studying by planning when and where to study. In a 42-day micro-randomized trial in an authentic real-world setting, we examined the effectiveness of planning prompts to increase children’s engagement with a vocabulary learning app. Children (N = 357) received mobile prompts in the evening asking them to formulate appropriate implementation intentions for the next day, that is, if-then plans specifying when and where they would like to study vocabulary.\nResults indicated that planning prompts were not effective per se; rather, the effectiveness of planning depended crucially on the quality of the plan. Using a newly developed rubric to classify plan quality based on the specificity, saliency, and contextual aspects of the plan, we show that the higher the plan quality, the more likely children were to study the next day. These findings suggest that well-formulated if-then plans are a useful metacognitive strategy for action control, helping to increase the likelihood of studying.\nFor children to use this metacognitive strategy to plan their own studying, researchers and teachers need to ensure that they explain it carefully, provide examples of high-quality plans, and preferably scaffold the creation of plans by providing feedback.",

          "authors": "Matthew O Parker; Jude Rolfe-Tarrant; Antony Wood; Ed Redhead",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation problems are regularly reported in older adults and represent a significant challenge to quality of life. This study aimed to understand navigational strategies in older adults using a virtual honeycomb-shaped maze. We have previously shown in this maze that younger individuals, aged 18 to 40, typically adopt a strategy of alternating their turns at successive junctions, while those aged 70 and above show significantly fewer alternations. One theory explaining this behavior in older adults is diminished spatial working memory. In the current study, we tested ways to support spatial knowledge of the environment: by providing either distal cues or a map of the environment, with only the former expected to facilitate spatial working memory. We asked younger (n = 107, aged 18-40) and older (n = 77, aged ≥70) participants to navigate a virtual honeycomb-shaped maze.  Without additional cues, older adults made fewer sequential alternations compared to younger participants. However, when provided with distal cues, older adults increased their sequential alternations, whereas the map did not have the same effect. The findings suggest that spatial memory limitations in older adults affect navigational choices, but providing certain types of environmental cues, such as distal cues, can help compensate for these limitations. This could have implications for designing environments to enhance independence in older adults and in the design of cognitive tests for spatial working memory.",

This included focusing on creating a distraction-free environment for writing, holding the event across a weekend to accommodate other commitments, and offering travel bursaries for those that lived significant distances from campus. Data gathered from feedback forms showed that the timing, location and content of the retreat met the needs of attendees; enabling them to connect with other doctoral students and make good progress with their writing. The focus group highlighted benefits of the retreat in more detail, including: the importance of peer support, the opportunity for self-reflection and empowerment, and the rarity of an opportunity that met their needs. Implications for practice and challenges encountered are discussed.\n\nOriginality: The needs of part-time doctoral students are often overlooked.

          "abstract": "Parental engagement is known to positively influence children’s educational outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether teachers in England are sufficiently equipped to facilitate effective parental engagement. We therefore conducted a national online survey of 1782 qualified teachers in England, to explore their parental engagement training, knowledge, skills and factors influencing those skills. \n\nWe identified concerning training gaps, with most teachers receiving no training in which types of parental engagement are most effective or how to identify and remove barriers to parental engagement. Only a minority of teachers recognised the importance of parent-child interactions in their conceptualisation of parental engagement, with many seemingly preoccupied with less effective school involvement activities. Teachers’ parental engagement skills were associated with their self-efficacy, experience, workload, training route and other factors. \n\nThe findings suggest that teachers require better training to prepare them to facilitate effective parental engagement with learning. This study makes an important contribution to the development of future training by pinpointing specific gaps in teachers’ parental engagement knowledge and skills, and identifying predictors of those skills. As such, it has implications for teachers, teacher educators, school leaders and policymakers, aiming to optimise parental engagement practices to enhance children's educational outcomes.",

Inaccurate beliefs and excessive worrying, indicative of erroneous metacognition, are associated with negative health outcomes. This research can help identify mitigation for these harmful effects. \n\nDesign: Qualitative focus groups; thematic analysis\n\nSetting: Focus Group discussion with healthy older adults hosted at a university in central London.\n\nParticipants: Thirty-five healthy older individuals (Female = 29) without any psychiatric or neurological diagnoses, over the age of 65 (mean 75.31, SD: 6.15). Thirteen participants were identified as having a high level of worry about dementia and 22 as having low worry. Groups were matched for cognitive performance on the Telephone Mini Addenbrooke’s cognitive assessment (Tele-MACE).\n\nOutcome Measures: Participants were assigned to a focus group depending on their level of worry about dementia. During focus groups a vignette prompted discussion around lifespan changes in memory and how this affected concerns around memory. This allowed investigation of the differences in beliefs about memory. \n\nResults: Thematic Analysis revealed two key themes. First, older adults appear to base their definition of ‘normality’ of their own memory on comparisons. These comparisons were between themselves and others; and between themselves now and their own past self. Second, there was a key difference between those with high versus low worry; those with high worry consistently attributed dementia as directly relevant to themself. \n\nConclusion: Comparison is a common metacognitive strategy used in forming beliefs about memory. Targeting the use of comparison is potentially valuable in interventions aiming to alleviate older adults’ memory concerns. Addressing self-focused thinking, e.g., with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, could improve harmful levels of high worry.",

          "abstract": "Nonlinear relationships among variables play an important role in psychological modeling and understanding changes over time from intensive longitudinal data (ILD). Most methods focus on linear models, with a few exceptions developed for specific nonlinear interactions or general system dynamics. Methods considering multiple possible nonlinear relationships among all variables remain sparse, hindered by challenges like overfitting and interpretation difficulties. This article examines the feasibility of applying such a method to psychological ILD, using the Regularization Algorithm under Marginality Principle (RAMP) alongside a local linearization method for interpretation. We evaluated its performance with simulated and empirical datasets using classification metrics, information criteria, and cross-validation. Results show this method often requires long series for satisfactory performance. While information criteria favor the nonlinear method in empirical datasets, cross-validation favors simpler AR models. Nonetheless, these challenges are comparable to those in linear idiographic modeling. Clear evidence of nonlinear relationships among variables supports the value of this method for exploratory studies. We developed an R package, quadVAR, as an implementation of this method.",

          "abstract": "Background: While growing research confirms the efficacy of transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (TD-CBT) by examining group-level changes from pre to post-treatment, less is known about inter-individual differences and dynamic changes during therapy. Understanding different symptom trajectories and their associations with treatment outcome would allow early detection of non-responders and treatment adjustments.\n\nMethods: Patients with anxiety disorders reported on demographics, clinical history, treatment motivation, and expectations before randomization to TD-CBT or wait-list. We analyzed data from the treatment group who provided symptom ratings every session and post-treatment follow-up (N = 64, 71.9% female, age: M = 32.67, SD = 11.91). Using latent class growth analysis (LCGA), we identified symptom trajectory classes and tested whether these could be predicted from baseline data. We also examined associations between classes and treatment outcome, using multilevel modeling and considering reliable change indices. \n\nResults: LCGA revealed four distinct trajectory classes: low severity - improved (32.81%), high severity - improved (29.69%), high severity-stagnant (18.75%), and low severity - worsened (18.75%). Only number of comorbidities emerged as a significant predictor of class, with patients in the high severity - stagnant group having more comorbidities. They also showed higher symptom severity at baseline and follow-ups compared to other classes, despite clear improvement.\n\nConclusions: During TD-CBT, latent classes of symptom change can be distinguished and point to malleable factors already present at pre-treatment. Particularly patients with high initial burden and a higher number of comorbidities may require monitoring and adaptive treatment strategies, which should be explored in future studies.",

This semantic divergence brings along conceptual issues and prevent associative accounts of brain function or behavior from being properly articulated, understood and criticized. We propose four main, distinct concepts that allow to clarify and identify what researchers mean with ‘association’ across various disciplines: neuroscience, psychology, AI, linguistics, philosophy. By providing clear definitions of the four concepts, together with guidance in assigning term meaning, we hope to promote interdisciplinary collaboration around the central explanatory notion of association, and acceptance of its complexity and richness.",

Experiment 2 (n = 62) demonstrated that applying anodal tDCS to the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) reduced this preference. Chronic exclusion also led to a preference for immediate rewards (Experiment 3, n = 170), but multiple anodal tDCS sessions in the right vlPFC lessened this effect, suggesting long-term benefits (Experiment 4, n = 36). We discuss how self-control mediates the link between exclusion and intertemporal decision-making, and highlight tDCS as a potential therapeutic tool for socially excluded individuals.",

          "abstract": "From their observations of others’ behavior, adults quickly form character impressions. These impressions can be “sticky”, such that adults prioritize information acquired earlier over later information. Developmental psychology has provided some evidence that infants, like adults, may form impressions based on others’ prosocial and antisocial behavior. But how do infants respond to inconsistent behavior? Do infants update their impressions when people behave inconsistently? The present, preregistered experiments examined 11-month-olds’ (N = 189) ability to incorporate inconsistency in their social evaluations. We first successfully replicated the finding that when actors behave consistently, infants prefer looking to helpers over hinderers (Experiment 1). In our key experiments, infants observed an actor who behaved inconsistently (either mostly helping or mostly hindering) paired with an actor who behaved consistently (either always hindering or always helping, respectively). Would infants prefer the actor who was on average more prosocial? We found that infants preferred looking to more prosocial actors, but they did not look longer when an actor’s behavior changed, suggestive that they did not notice the change in behavior. Finally, in Experiment 3, we found that infants’ evaluations of inconsistent actors in Experiment 2 may be due to a primacy bias: a focus on what an actor did first, rather than an ability to incorporate consistency. Together, these findings raise the possibility that infants’ social evaluations are based on their first impressions of others. These findings may reflect a developmental precursor to adults’ “sticky” character impressions.",

Results reveal relatively moderate LGBQ support among religious leaders (M = 2.61, range = 1.0–6.5), with psychosocial factors (e.g., identifying as White, woman, higher education, income) and religious/spiritual struggles associated with greater support, while literal Biblical interpretation and prayer practices associated with lower support. While congregation size did not moderate the relationship between literal interpretation and LGBQ support, the racial composition of congregations did.

Specifically, symptoms relevant to diverse disorders may be expeditiously alleviated when etiology is correctly identified at outset. This study aimed to evaluate how MindMetrix, a wide-ranging statistic-driven assessment, affected the trajectory of symptom improvement in patients at a large outpatient center.\n\nMethods:\nIn this retrospective, pretest-postest non-equivalent study, all patients who initiated treatment at Rochester Center for Behavioral Medicine completed an intake appointment before being assigned to take MindMetrix (n = 97) or commencing treatment without additional assessment (n = 50). Before every visit, patients took a pre-visit survey, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale-2, and the ADHD Symptom and Side Effect Tracking Scale (ASSET). To determine whether MindMetrix adjusted symptom improvement over time, moderation analyses with time in treatment, MindMetrix assignment, and an interaction term examined the interactive effect on PHQ-9, GAD-2, or ASSET scale scores. This analysis included all patient visits after they began treatment at RCBM.\n\nResults: \nThe moderation analyses found improvements in PHQ-9, GAD-2, and ASSET scales as patients proceeded through treatment, independently of their MindMetrix assignment. On the PHQ-9 and ASSET, MindMetrix significantly adjusted the effect of time in treatment, suggesting accelerated improvement.\n\nConclusions:\nResults suggest that MindMetrix is an effective tool that can be used to guide early clinical decisions. Improvements seen in patients who took the MindMetrix assessment support its clinical benefit and potential for broad application in behavioral health and primary care centers.",

          "abstract": "Embodied cognition research suggests a functional link between numerical and spatial cognition. Accordingly, numbers are assumed to be mentally represented on a “number line”, with smaller numbers on the left and larger numbers on the right in Western culture. Supporting this, prior findings show a numerical lateralization effect, where participants generating random numbers while turning their heads sideways produce more small numbers when facing left than when facing right. Here, we aimed to replicate and extend these findings by investigating the relative contributions of visual and proprioceptive signals to the spatial-numerical association. Our novel augmented reality setup enabled us to separate visual and proprioceptive cues for horizontal head rotation. We hypothesized that participants would generate more small numbers when facing left in the ordinary visual perspective (normal condition, i.e., proprioceptive and visual cues aligned), and that this tendency would be reduced when the visual axis was inverted (inverted condition). We also used a rod and frame task to assess the individuals’ visual dependency and a newly developed side detection task for head somatomotor rotation sensitivity. We hypothesized that visual dependency would correlate with numerical lateralization, while an inverted pattern would be observed for head rotation sensitivity. Results showed moderate evidence against the effect of head direction, indicating that we were unable to replicate the previously reported effect. Additionally, the moderate evidence against the effect of condition suggests that inverting the visual field did not reduce the frequency of small numbers generated when looking left. These findings imply that the spatial bias in number generation may be less robust or may not generalize to head-mounted display setups.",

          "abstract": "Discrimination in the evaluation of others is a key cause of social inequality around the world. However, relatively little is known about psychological interventions that can be used to prevent biased evaluations. The limited evidence that exists on these strategies is spread across many methods and populations, making it difficult to generate reliable best practices that can be effective across contexts. In the present work, we held a research contest to solicit interventions with the goal of reducing discrimination based on physical attractiveness using a hypothetical admissions task. Thirty interventions were tested across four rounds of data collection (total N &gt; 20,000). Using a Signal Detection Theory approach to evaluate interventions, we identified two interventions that reduced discrimination by lessening both decision noise and decision bias, while two other interventions reduced overall discrimination by only lessening noise or bias. The most effective interventions largely provided concrete strategies that directed participants’ attention towards decision-relevant criteria and away from socially biasing information, though the fact that very similar interventions produced differing effects on discrimination suggests certain key characteristics that are needed for manipulations to reliably impact judgment. The effects of these four interventions on decision bias, noise, or both also replicated in a different discrimination domain, political affiliation, and generalized to populations with self-reported hiring experience. Results of the contest for decreasing attractiveness-based favoritism suggest that identifying effective routes for changing discriminatory behavior is a challenge, and that greater investment is needed to develop impactful, flexible, and scalable strategies for reducing discrimination.",

This article reports on a set of representative population surveys in Switzerland (N = 4, 380) that collected those risky choices people perceive to be relevant in their own lives or in the lives of a large number of fellow citizens. Based on this empirical basis we developed an inventory of 100 risky choices, which we analyzed to address several open issues of the behavioral sciences, such as regarding the structure of the current ecology of risk (e.g., life domains; stability). Moreover, we employed this inventory with an\nindependent follow-up study (N = 933) to thus address the generalizabilty of the psychological construct of risk preference to real-life choices that are relevant to various subgroups of the population. The five key insights that emerged from developing, analyzing, and employing this inventory may not only be useful for researchers studying decision making under risk and uncertainty (e.g., what criteria to use for the development of novel measurement instruments), but also for policy making and various applied settings (e.g., by mapping who will likely be confronted with which risky choices; how swiftly the\nrisks of modern life change, either spontaneously or in response to a global shock).",

          "authors": "Jeroen Olieslagers; Zahy Bnaya; Wei Ji Ma",
          "abstract": "When solving problems with a clear goal, people often rely on backward reasoning by recursively breaking down a problem into subgoals. The cognitive mechanisms of backward reasoning are poorly understood, and no computational process models have been fitted on human data to explain this problem solving technique. We propose that backward reasoning can be seen as search through a space of subgoals and actions to attain them. We show that this space can be represented by an AND-OR tree, a structure first used in early artificial intelligence research to automate problem solving. We hypothesize that, when solving problems with a clear goal,  people reason backward by searching through AND-OR trees. To test this hypothesis, we collected data from a task where participants rearranged elements within a constrained space to achieve a specific goal. We then developed a psychologically plausible, single-parameter process model which we fit to data from the task on a per-participant basis. We found that our model successfully captured key trends in the data, unlike alternative models. Our results demonstrate a deeper understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of human problem solving.",

          "abstract": "Synchrony has been proposed as a relevant phenomenon for investigating social neurophysiological and psychological processes, with inter-brain synchrony, in particular, presumed to facilitate the functional integration of multiple brains. However, the lack of an accepted definition and a cohesive theoretical corpus that allows hypothesis-based approaches, often combined with inadequate empirical methods, weakens this area of research. To address this, we propose a rigorous definition of inter-brain synchrony and link various theoretical contributions to justify the existence of meaningful temporal alignment between different brain activities. This article outlines a set of methods to provide valid evidence supporting this neural mechanism. Our approach entails extracting instantaneous phase data from Hilbert-transformed EEG time series recorded from individuals under different experimental conditions that account for confounding factors such as shared attention, cognitive, and motor dependencies. We then describe multiple data analysis approaches, including circular statistics combined with permutation testing, and mutual information. Finally, we present an example of a potential application within the context of cooperation in nuclear families. We believe that, by employing such methods consistently, the concept of inter brain synchrony is falsifiable. Whether this phenomenon is empirically supported or not, it will contribute to advancing our understanding of the social brain.",

          "abstract": "Based on the paradigm of previous waiting-time studies (Jokic et al., 2018; Witowska et al., 2020), participants in our study (n = 133) were left alone in an empty room for 7.5 minutes and subsequently asked to report on their perceptions of time and subjective experiences during the waiting period. Participants completed personality questionnaires assessing the constructs of impulsiveness (UPPS-P), time perspective (CFC-14), and mindfulness (FMI). Consistent with previous research, a faster passage of time was associated with reduced attention to time, lower arousal and boredom levels, and more relaxation and positive affect. Mediation analyses revealed that, among all subjective experiences, boredom was the only significant predictor mediating the effect of personality traits on the perceived passage of time. Specifically, individuals (a) prone to rash actions under intense positive affect and (b) who prioritize immediate outcomes over distant future consequences of their actions tended to experience more boredom while waiting, which in turn led to a subjectively slower passage of waiting time. Potential explanations and directions for further research are discussed.\nKey words: waiting, time perception, passage of time, consideration of future consequences, impulsiveness, mindfulness, boredom",

          "abstract": "A great deal of research in dual process models has been devoted to highlighting differences in the structure and function of the implicit and explicit attitude constructs. However, the two forms of attitudes can also demonstrate important shared properties, and prior work suggests that one similarity may be in factors that determine measurement reliability. To better explore this issue, Study 1 analyzed the test-retest reliability in measures of both implicit and explicit attitudes within a single study session across 75 topics (N &gt; 35,000). Explicit attitudes had greater test-retest reliability than implicit attitudes, but each showed considerable heterogeneity across topics, even when measured within a single study session. Analyses also included several candidate moderator variables, such as attitude certainty or familiarity. While results were not identical, the moderators associated with greater test-retest reliability for implicit and explicit attitudes exhibited more similarities than differences. Specifically, attitudes experienced as more distinctive, more relevant to one’s self-concept, more certain, and more accessible had higher test-retest reliability for both forms of evaluation. Variation in short-term reliability for implicit and explicit attitudes was replicated in Study 2, and Study 3 revealed that topics low in short-term reliability were also lower in a longitudinal sample that completed measures separated by several weeks. These results advance our understanding of each attitude construct, and are consistent with a more dynamic relationship between an attitude and its measure, as even attitudes measured with high levels of conscious control could show remarkable short-term instability when assessed only minutes apart.",

For this concern to be founded, the illusory truth effect must act meaningfully on statements that are initially thought to be implausible. Using a large (N=974) online experiment, we test the relationship between the illusory truth effect and prior belief in trivia statements. In contrast to previous work, we measure the prior belief that an individual assigns to a specific statement to allow for a precise estimation of this relationship. Concerningly, we find that not only does the illusory truth effect appear meaningful for statements where participants have low prior belief, the effect is also stronger for these initially implausible statements. Our findings suggest that repetition can be particularly harmful when statements are initially seen as implausible.",

          "abstract": "Drowsy driving is one of the leading contributing factors to traffic accidents. As drivers continue driving despite being aware of their drowsy states, it is necessary to adopt active countermeasures to avoid them falling asleep behind the wheel. Based on the multiple resources model, this study proposed five countermeasure types using voice assistants (no countermeasure vs. meaninglessly listening vs. meaningfully listening vs. repeating vs. answering) and investigated their effects on countering drowsiness of younger (25-35 years) and middle-aged (36-65 years) drivers. A simulated manual driving experiment with 29 participants was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on driving behaviors, physiological indicators, eye movement indicators, and subjective ratings. All results indicated that the repeating and answering conditions were the most effective in alerting drowsy drivers, suggesting that countermeasures involving more human resource stages can enhance alertness. The trend of higher alertness in the answering condition compared to the repeating condition highlighted the potential advantage of increasing cognitive load in countering drowsiness. Listening conditions showed limited effects on alerting drivers but no adverse effects on driving performance or worsening drowsiness. Regarding age, younger and middle-aged drowsy drivers did not differ on average in response to different countermeasures. However, considering individual differences in physiological activation in reacting to countermeasures, drowsiness countermeasures should be tailored to the individual needs, particularly for middle-aged drivers. Apart from facilitating the understanding of drowsiness countermeasure mechanisms, the present findings provided implications for vehicle designers and engineers in utilizing in-vehicle voice assistants as an effective drowsiness countermeasure.",

          "authors": "Neil William Kirk",
          "abstract": "Advances in AI-assisted voice technology have made it easier to clone or disguise voices, creating a wide range of synthetic voices using different accents, dialects, and languages. While these developments offer positive applications, they also pose risks for misuse. This raises the question as to whether listeners can reliably distinguish between human and AI-enhanced speech and whether prior experiences and expectations about language varieties that are traditionally less-represented by technology affect this ability. Two experiments were conducted to investigate listeners’ ability to categorise voices as human or AI-enhanced in both a standard and a regional Scottish dialect. Using a Signal Detection Theory framework, both experiments explored participants' sensitivity and categorisation biases. In Experiment 1 (N = 100), a predominantly Scottish sample showed above-chance performance in distinguishing between human and AI-enhanced voices, but there was no significant effect of dialect on sensitivity. However, listeners exhibited a bias toward categorising voices as “human”, which was concentrated within the regional Dundonian Scots dialect. In Experiment 2 (N = 100) participants from southern and eastern England, demonstrated reduced overall sensitivity and a Human Categorisation Bias that was more evenly spread across the two dialects. These findings have implications for the growing use of AI-assisted voice technology in linguistically diverse contexts, highlighting both the potential for enhanced representation of Minority, Indigenous, Non-standard and Dialect (MIND) varieties, and the risks of AI misuse.",

          "abstract": "Climate skepticism remains a significant barrier to public engagement with accurate climate information, because skeptics actively engage in information avoidance to escape exposure to climate facts. Here we show that generative AI can enhance engagement with climate science among skeptical audiences by subtly modifying headlines to align better with their existing perspectives, without compromising factual integrity. In a controlled experiment (N = 2000) using a stylized social media interface, headlines of climate science articles modified by an open-source large language model (Llama3 70B, version 3.0) led to more bookmarks and more upvotes, and these effects were strongest among the most skeptical participants. Skeptics who engaged with climate science as a result of this intervention showed a shift in beliefs toward the scientific consensus by the end of the study. These results show that generative AI can alter the information diet skeptics consume, with the promise that scalable, sustained engagement will promote better epistemic health. They highlight the potential of generative AI as a tool for truth, showing that while it can be misused by bad actors, it also holds promise for advancing public understanding of science when responsibly deployed by well-intentioned actors.",

          "authors": "Nir Shalev; Sage Boettcher; Kia Nobre",
          "abstract": "Visual search tasks are commonly used to study how people guide their attention amidst distraction. Developmental studies have used visual search to explore age-related differences in attention. Typical findings show that performance declines and sensitivity to distraction increases in older compared to younger adults. Such findings are taken as evidence of the declining abilities in goal-driven attention. However, standard visual search tasks use static displays and therefore fail to capture the challenges and opportunities in natural environments, which include predictive structures within extended contexts. To investigate how adults of different ages guide their attention in dynamic and extended contexts, we used our recently developed Dynamic Visual Search (DVS). In DVS targets and distractors compete over time and embedded spatiotemporal regularities afford prediction-led guidance of attention. Critically, we manipulated the levels of distraction to chart whether and how benefits of expectations and deficits from distraction varied with age. Younger and older adults searched for multiple visual targets as they faded in and out of the display among distractors while varying the number of distracting elements. Half the targets always appeared at the same time and approximate locations and could be predicted. While we found evidence for decrement and elevated sensitivity to distraction with increasing age, benefits from predictions occurred in all groups. Interestingly, regardless of age, effects of predictions were only significant during periods of high distraction. This work extends our understanding of attention control through ageing to dynamic settings and indicates a dissociation between goal-directed and learning-driven and attentional guidance.",

This article explores the application of RRs to the study of identity and migration, focusing on the advantages and limitations of this format across both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. While RRs have been predominantly adopted in quantitative studies to mitigate issues like p-hacking and the publication bias towards positive results, their potential for qualitative research remains underexplored. Through the lens of creating a special issue on identity and migration, this article examines the feasibility of RRs in fostering rigorous, transparent, and contextually grounded scholarship. Seven RRs are reviewed, encompassing diverse methodological approaches and sociocultural contexts, which collectively highlight the fluidity of social identities and the impact of migration on identity formation. In the current article, we reflect on both the content of these studies, as well as the process of cultivating a special issue based solely on RRs. Specifically, we advocate for tailored guidelines that respect the iterative nature of qualitative inquiry, while encouraging the broader adoption of RRs to advance global research on identity and migration.",

In a sample of 764 U.S. service workers who reported their feelings daily for up to 12 weeks, responses were provided in 1) numerical ratings, 2) short essays, and 3) descriptive words. When predicting nine self-rated affective traits, essays were slightly less accurate than the ratings (r = .49 v .55, p &lt; .001), while the word-based responses slightly outperformed the ratings (r = .53 vs .51, p &lt; .001). For external predictive validity across 24 traits, demographics, and behaviors, both language formats doubled the ratings’ accuracy, with words reaching an average of r = .18 and essays r = .24 (p &lt; .001). Beyond their greater accuracy, both language formats offered rich psychological insights, with words focusing on emotions and essays encompassing broader life domains. While both language-based formats showed advantages and disadvantages, each demonstrated greater information-richness than traditional rating scales.",

          "abstract": "How can we identify accurate forecasters? Current gold standard approaches draw from two sources of information: simple cognitive assessments of reasoning ability and past forecasting accuracy. Cognitive assessments are well-studied and normed psychometric instruments, but have lower predictive value. Real-world forecasting problems are more challenging to norm a priori: they typically require a large comparison sample of forecasters to make predictive inferences. This paper develops the Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT): a one-hour test that predicts more than 60% of the variation in out-of-sample forecasting accuracy, double the predictive utility of prior work. We highlight several key results: (1) Eliciting forecasts in a quantile format is considerably more psychometrically reliable, meaning it is more efficient at reducing measurement error about forecasters' expected accuracy with fewer items, than forecasts elicited using the standard probability format common to most judgmental forecasting tournaments. (2) Several cognitive tasks, novel to forecasting research, are highly predictive of forecasting ability. These include denominator neglect, Bayesian updating, and adherence to decision rules. (3) Although our methods do best at separating out the worst forecasters from the population, they are also remarkably effective at identifying elite talent in the upper range of the skill distribution.",

Memory (E1; n=108, age 19-41) and prediction (E2; n=108, age 20-41) improved with more intact context for both musicians and non-musicians. Listeners’ event boundaries were influenced by the amount of tonal context but also reflected nested phrase structure, and musicians were more sensitive to longer-timescale “hyper-phrase” structure (E3; n=95, age 20-42) and could better identify the amount of scrambling (E4; n=108, age 19-41). These results indicate for the first time that listeners integrate context across complex phrases to efficiently encode, predict, and segment naturalistic music and that in general, training has surprisingly little impact on this integration.",

          "abstract": "Dual process accounts of reasoning posit that the interactions between automatic Type 1 processes and reflective Type 2 processes are regulated through the mechanism of conflict detection. Conflict detection is thought to be triggered when two or more incompatible responses to a problem are produced. Conflict detection can be viewed as an aspect of metacognition, as both are concerned with monitoring the outputs from the reasoning process as assessing one's certainty in them. In this paper we apply the self-consistency model of metacognition to analyse cues that inform confidence judgements in reasoning, to investigate the potential sources of responses to a given problem. In four experiments (total N = 524), we analysed the relationship between confidence and accuracy on the base-rate task and syllogisms, and used a solution-evaluation task format to manipulate uncertainty experimentally. We found that in both tasks, confidence and accuracy were influenced by many cues, rather than belief-logic conflict exclusively. Belief-logic conflict was a significant cue to confidence in the base-rate task, but not in syllogisms. Across all experiments, items identified as eliciting the most uncertainty, based on the self-consistency model, showed greater conflict detection effects. Introducing an additional cue that was inconsistent with the most common response generally increased uncertainty and conflict detection. These findings support the uncertainty monitoring account of conflict detection and link it with the broader metacognition research.",

Here, we directly compared a novel, custom-made, line-based script derived from Braille (Line Braille) to visual Braille, a script that only includes patterns of dots and no line junctions. For four consecutive days, two groups of participants underwent online training, during which they first mapped new letters onto the Latin alphabet and then trained on full words. Each day, participants were tested by asking them to transcribe a set of stimuli (words and pseudowords) from the novel to the Latin script. Across sessions, we found no significant differences between scripts in the overall transcription accuracy nor in the time required to transcribe words. We only found a small delay in the learning trajectory of the Braille group represented through an interaction between group and session in overall accuracy, and slightly higher sensitivity for stimulus length in the Braille group. Overall, these results show that line junctions only provide a small and temporary benefit when learning a new script, contrasting with the idea that line junctions is a core visual features for learning orthography.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Difficulties in emotion regulation during adolescence—a critical period for the development of these abilities—have been linked to depression. Early identification of deficits in emotion regulation may help prevent the onset of depression. This study investigated whether emotion regulation dynamics, particularly the speed of regulation to one’s affective equilibrium (damping) inferred from the Damped Oscillator Model (DOM), could predict future depressive symptoms in adolescents. We hypothesized that the relationship between damping and long-term outcomes would depend on the position of an individual's equilibrium. Methods: Participants (N = 115) aged 12-15 completed smartphone-based EMA for 30 days, rating six emotions four times daily. The DOM was applied to each participant's time series data, yielding person-specific frequency of oscillations (η) and damping (ζ) parameters. These parameters were then used to predict depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month follow-ups controlling for baseline levels of depression. Results: Results revealed that the interaction between the damping parameter and the equilibrium position significantly predicted depressive symptoms for sadness, but not for other emotions. For individuals with higher equilibrium levels of sadness, stronger damping predicted higher follow-up depressive symptoms. Additionally, higher frequency of oscillation around the equilibrium – representing greater elasticity and less rigidity – of two emotions (interest and happiness) predicted fewer depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the adaptive value of rapid emotional recovery depends on one's baseline emotional state. Tracking emotion regulation dynamics of both positive and negative emotions may improve our ability to identify adolescents at risk for depression before symptoms emerge, thereby informing targeted intervention and prevention efforts.",

The dataset comprises in-depth interviews with 10 clinical psychologists, along with a sociodemographic survey and the application of the Techno-Stress Scale (RED/TIC) to a sample of 170 Brazilian clinical psychologists. Key findings include the following: the majority of participants are women (84%), white (64%), aged 24–35 (60%), and childless (72%). Additionally, 50% are single, 65% hold a graduate degree (either lato or stricto sensu), and 61% undergraduated from private higher education universities. Regarding professional experience, 92% have been doing online counselling for less than five years, and 48% have at least two concurrent work affiliations. While 93% work as freelancers, 27% also hold a salaried position. Regarding mental health and work challenges, 32% reported cognitive and emotional exhaustion linked to the use of technology for clinical counselling. Additionally, 54% felt pressured by the productivity demands imposed by social media platforms. Among participants, 40% exhibited moderate levels of techno-stress, and 9% showed high levels. Within the dimensions of techno-stress, 32% demonstrated high levels of fatigue, and 20% reported significant anxiety related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Among psychologists experiencing high levels of techno-stress, 93% are women, 73% felt pressured by the productivity logic of platforms, and 53% maintained two or more concurrent work affiliations. Furthermore, 40% struggled to disconnect from work, yet only 13% rated their emotional health for remote work as \"poor\" or \"very poor.\" This suggests that techno-stress often goes unrecognized by professionals in the short term. This study highlights the urgent need for a critical examination of how digitalization and platformization influence the well-being of clinical psychologists, offering valuable insights for future interventions and policy development.",

          "abstract": "Recent research documents that thinking about God encourages intergroup prosociality among believers. An open question is whether any such increases are dampened by intergroup conflict. We conducted preregistered field experiments with two ethno-religious populations in Fiji: indigenous Christian iTaukei (N = 324) and Hindu Indo-Fijians (N = 280). In each study, we manipulated (between-person) whether participants thought about intergroup conflict before completing a dictator game in which we manipulated (within-person) whether participants thought about God’s preferences when allocating real money to an outgroup member. Although participants who reflected on intergroup conflict gave less money away to outgroup members, thinking about God led to significant and comparable increases in intergroup prosociality regardless of whether participants thought about conflict. Results challenge widely held assumptions about the role of religious belief in intergroup conflict and raise questions about mechanisms that are often theorized to explain the spread of religious beliefs themselves.",

          "authors": "Reed Orchinik; Santiago Pardo Sanchez; David Gertler Rand",
          "abstract": "Implementing existing green digital technology at scale could lead to a 20% reduction in global emissions annually. However, climate change has become a central focus of the \"culture wars\" providing a significant hindrance to the adoption of this technology. Using two survey experiments (total N = 2,089), we show that there is substantial heterogeneity in purchasing intentions when the same pro-environmental product is called \"smart\" or \"green.\" Environmental concern serves as an important moderator, with participants low in environmental concern showing a substantial aversion to green branding. We consider the marketing actions available to firms in this polarized environment and suggest that ideological sorting reduces the burden of targeting. We demonstrate that political party, an easily observable or inferred characteristic, provides a clean market segmentation correlating highly with environmental concern while capturing additional variation in the efficacy of green branding. Using simulations of multiple targeting schemes corresponding to different levels of sophistication and data access, we estimate that showing consumers the branding that aligns best with their political affiliation can increase purchasing intentions by 4%, performing just as well as a causal machine learning targeting approach. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that a 4% increase in purchasing intentions for just the five products tested here would reduce carbon emissions by approximately 1.2 gigatons by 2050, the equivalent of 5.4 million flights from London to New York City.",

          "authors": "Tongwei Liu",
          "abstract": "The digital revolution heralds the advent of the “écran global” era. The transformation of media has led to the miniaturization of screens and films (or videos). The micro-videos have emerged as one of the predominant forms of contemporary audiovisual expression. The key characteristics of traditional cinema have been redefined, leading to a “relocation” of the cinematic experience—reactivated and reproposed elsewhere than the place in which it was formed, with alternate devices (such as mobile digital apparatuses) and in new environments (such as the peripersonal space). This new form of experience is characterized by two distinct features. Firstly, the micro-videos, by virtue of being presented within peripersonal space, become within-reach. Secondly, the micro-videos, displayed on touchscreens, permit a dual haptic experience. On this basis, a new metaphor regarding screens is proposed—the “skin-screen”. The trajectory of the cinematic experience traces a multi-directional “topography of post-cinema”, aiming to provide a clearer delineation of the “state of post-cinema” and to facilitate more pertinent philosophical reflection.",

          "abstract": "Of all people that develop a mental disorder, most are recognized late, and many not at all. The insufficiency of mental health infrastructure, which is driving these problems, is even more pronounced in developing countries. This underlines the pressing need for global and scalable solutions to the diagnosis and prediction of individuals’ mental health. In this perspective, we argue for a possible utility of social media (SM) derived data combined with natural language processing (NLP) for the monitoring of individual-level mental health on a global scale. Using psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSD) as an example, we demonstrate how freely expressed speech can be processed automatically to predict and classify PSD with high levels of accuracy. We further outline the current state of PSD classification from SM-derived data and discuss methodological considerations that are hampering progress in this field. Finally, we delve into potential pitfalls of such systems and provide insight into how these may be navigated.",

          "title": "Do Losses Promote More Reflection Than Gains?",
          "authors": "Carlos Rey; Tomas Lejarraga; Antoni Rubí Barceló",
          "abstract": "This study examines the varying effects of potential losses compared to gains on reflective thinking and problem-solving performance. Building on prospect theory and previous studies, we hypothesized that individuals would engage in longer reflection when faced with potential losses compared to equivalent potential gains, and that this extended reflection would enhance problem-solving performance, particularly in more challenging tasks. Two experimental studies were conducted. Study 1 established that participants reflected longer in tasks designed to avoid monetary losses than to achieve gains, confirming the hypothesis regarding prolonged reflection. However, this increased reflection did not translate into better performance across various tasks, suggesting that losses encourage persistence but do not inherently improve problem-solving efficacy. Study 2, which employed anagrams of varying difficulty, revealed that losses indeed correlated with longer reflection times but only improved performance in tasks deemed more difficult. These findings indicate that the effect of losses on reflection and performance is nuanced, highlighting the importance of task difficulty and the sensitivity of performance measures in understanding the interactions between loss aversion and cognitive processing. Overall, the results suggest that while losses prompt greater cognitive engagement, their influence on performance is contingent on task complexity, necessitating further exploration into the conditions under which losses enhance reflection and problem-solving capabilities.",

          "authors": "Ashlesha Purohit; Simantini Ghosh",
          "abstract": "Sexual harassment is highly prevalent, poses significant mental health challenges and profoundly affects professional and social functioning. Our broad goal was to study posttraumatic growth and the role of coping strategies in the context of sexual harassment experienced by Indian young adults, particularly investigating dysfunctional/avoidant coping styles and their contribution to posttraumatic growth, because of scarce extant data. We asked if dysfunctional/avoidant coping negatively mediates the positive effects of self-compassion and social support on posttraumatic growth employing a self-report online questionnaire and a cross sectional design. The sample consisted of 264 Indian young adults who completed validated measures of self-compassion, social support, coping, and posttraumatic growth. Hierarchical regression  analyses revealed that self-compassion and social support predicted posttraumatic growth and accounted for 31.2% of its variance. Coping and dysfunctional/avoidant coping accounted for an additional 16.4% of the variance in post-traumatic growth [ΔR² = 0.164, F(2, 259)= 41.0, p&lt;0.001], and combined, they accounted for 47.3% of the variance in post-traumatic growth. A mediation analysis showed that the relationship between self-compassion and posttraumatic growth was partially mediated by dysfunctional/avoidant coping [ꞵ=0.17441, z=4.293, p&lt;0.001] and the relationship between social support and posttraumatic growth was fully mediated by coping [ꞵ=0.24564, z=5.031, p&lt;0.001]. This finding expands and adds to the literature on posttraumatic growth in survivors of sexual harassment.",

          "abstract": "Fixed-effects modeling is a powerful tool for estimating within-cluster associations in cross-sectional data and within-participant associations in longitudinal data. Although commonly used by other social scientists, this tool remains largely unknown to psychologists. To address this issue, we offer a pedagogical primer tailored for this audience, complete with R, Stata, and SPSS scripts. This primer is organized into three parts. In PART 1, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to clustered cross-sectional data. We introduce the concepts of ‘cluster dummies’ and ‘demeaning,’ and provide scripts to estimate the within-school association between sports and depression in a fictional dataset. In PART 2, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to longitudinal data, and provide scripts to estimate the within-participant association between sports and depression over time in a fictional four-wave dataset. In this part, we cover three additional topics. First, we explain how to calculate effect sizes and offer simulation-based sample size guidelines to detect median-sized within-participant effects with sufficient power. Second, we show how to test two possible interactions: between a time-constant and a time-varying predictor and between two time-varying predictors. Third, we introduce three relevant extensions: first-difference modeling (estimating changes from one wave to the next); time-distributed fixed-effects modeling (estimating changes before, during, and after an individual event); and within-between multilevel modeling (estimating both within- and between-participant associations). In PART 3, we discuss two limitations of fixed-effects modeling: time-varying confounders and reverse causality. We conclude with reflections on causality in nonexperimental data.",

          "authors": "Giovanbattista Califano; Tianyi Zhang; Charles Spence",
          "abstract": "This study explores how users perceive the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various culinary scenarios. Using a hybrid model that combines Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling and a Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression Mixture Model, the research examines the influence of factors including the perceived accuracy of AI systems, general attitudes toward AI, and AI anxiety, on people’s trust in AI cooking applications—and how this trust, in turn, affects their intention to adopt such systems. Analysis of the data from 380 UK participants revealed two distinct consumer groups identified by the hybrid model: a small group of Engagers, who demonstrate openness to adopting AI-assisted cooking tools, and a much larger group of Avoiders, who refrain from using such technologies. Trust is shown to be a pivotal factor, with participants exhibiting higher trust levels (+ 1 SD) being 5.44 times more likely to be Engagers than Avoiders. However, adoption was found to be very much scenario-specific: AI is most readily accepted in cooking contexts that prioritize analytical and efficient solutions, such as using and combining leftover ingredients, but is less favoured in socially meaningful situations, such as hosting a dinner party. The results also reveal a demographic profile of those more open to AI cooking assistance, suggesting that younger, educated individuals are more likely to engage. This study contributes to understanding consumer dynamics in AI culinary applications, highlighting areas of opportunity for AI as a practical kitchen assistant and underscoring the challenges in achieving broad user trust.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has highlighted the impact of phonological factors and morphological structure on compound pronunciation, but the role of semantics in this interplay remains largely unexplored. Building on psycholinguistic findings that demonstrate semantic effects in compound processing, this study examines whether these effects extend to the production of English nominal triconstituent compounds. Using a state-of-the-art computational model to derive semantic transparency measures, we assessed the predictability of compound meanings from their constituents. Our regression model of experimental speech data revealed a notable duration difference between the first and second constituent and the third constituent for opaque compounds. For semantically transparent compounds, we find a shortening of the third constituent, diminishing the larger duration difference observed for less transparent compounds. These findings underscore the importance of semantic considerations in phonetic analyses of compound constituents, complementing prior research on morphological and phonological correlates of phonetic variation.",

Trauma-informed approaches offer one possible avenue of support for those being chronically bullied in school. The aim of this study is to examine the traumatic impact of being chronically bullied in school and evaluate the use of a pilot trauma-informed therapeutic intervention to support young people being chronically bullied in England. In this study, 18 parents whose child was receiving a new bullying-focused trauma-informed therapy completed an online questionnaire about their child's experiences of bullying and their trauma symptoms. Their children were aged between 8 and 16 years old (M=11.28, SD = 2.24), 9 (50%) young people were male, and 9 (50%) were female. The questionnaire was completed before and after the 12-week therapeutic intervention. The findings of the study highlight the negative impact being bullied has on mental health, including symptoms of trauma. The findings of the study also highlight how the trauma-informed therapeutic intervention reduced symptoms of trauma and supported children and young people to cope with their experiences of bullying. While a pilot study, the findings offer a potential avenue for supporting young people being chronically bullied in school.",

          "authors": "Kateryna Kryoniuk; Cleo Hopkin-King; Seán G. Roberts",
          "abstract": "Social media presents both opportunities and risks to society. One risk includes the potential for the spread of disinformation, but methods for automatic detecting possible disinformation still mostly rely on low-level lexical cues. We present a new approach to the automatic detection of disinformation based on measuring discourse ‘derailment’ – messages that try to force the topic of discourse away from one topic and onto another. While this may include both malicious and benign derailment, it could serve as an important signal for early-warning systems. In this study, we implement a system for automatic detection of discourse derailment which uses a Large Language Model to generate expected replies and compares them to the real replies. We test this system on a set of human annotated data to show that the system outperforms various baselines and approaches the agreement between human annotators. This suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be sensitive to discourse-level information. However, we also identify evidence of several limitations, including that the automatic system relies on different cues compared to human annotators, which leads to some amount of bias. Nevertheless, our project represents a considerable step towards understanding how to use LLMs to analyse discourse and a new angle on tackling disinformation.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Research suggests that ADHD and ASD are similar in sensory processing impairments, however this has not been previously assessed psychophysically. Previous work further suggests that comorbid conditions, especially anxiety, play a role in the relationship between ADHD, ASD and sensory processing. Here, we formally test if orientation discrimination performance is differentially related to the levels of ADHD/ASD traits in a sub-clinical sample and whether anxiety plays a role in that relationship.\nMethods: We evaluate visual discrimination thresholds in participants exhibiting sub-clinical levels of ADHD or ASD traits through an orientation discrimination task. This is achieved using a method of constant stimuli within a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm, employing an adaptive, randomly interleaved staircase procedure with a one-up-three-down design. We then compare these pre-consciously inferred results to self reported traits of anxiety, ADHD and ASD traits via correlational analysis and further seek to investigate the possible mediating role of anxiety between the traits and the thresholds through a mediation analysis.\nResults: We find that ADHD and ASD-like traits present with similar levels of sensory processing impairments. However,  panic and generalised anxiety are critically involved in and mediate fully or partially only the relationship between ADHD-hyperactive traits and the discrimination thresholds. Such patterns did not present for any of the ASD traits.  \nConclusions: These findings suggest that ADHD and ASD are separate from each other and that their seemingly similar sensory expressions are only connected via intermediary conditions",

          "abstract": "Repeated assessments in everyday life allow for ecologically valid data on dynamic, within-person stress processes. However, typical designs offer little information the immediate shape of affective responses following daily stressors, including the influence of situational and person-level variables. In a combined clinical and community sample (N=248; recruited between 2016 and 2018), we employed a high-density intensive-longitudinal protocol (observations N=1442) to capture the temporal dynamics of affect in response to daily stressful events using a microburst design. Specifically, we implemented an adaptive signal-contingent schedule, where an initial stressor report triggered an intense burst of prompts in 15-minute increments over the course of one hour inquiring about momentary affect. To model affective microtrajectories, we used multilevel structural equation modeling. A piecewise linear model consistently showed the best fit across all indices for both negative and positive affect. Affective responses to momentarily experienced stressors were best captured by a model that allowed for changes in affect trajectories over time (an initial steep decline/increase followed by gradual change), with more stressful situations amplifying these trajectories. Moreover, Extraversion significantly influenced the initial rise in positive affect, leading to more pronounced early changes in those with higher levels of Extraversion. In contrast, Neuroticism had an opposite effect on positive affect, dampening these early changes. Results offer a detailed understanding of daily stress dynamics by providing insights into the immediate and evolving nature of affective responses to stress, with implications for personalized stress management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Mastering prosody is a different task for adults learning a second language and infants acquiring their first. While prosody crucially aids the process of L1 acquisition, for adult L2 learners it is often considerably challenging. Is it because of an age-related decline of the language-learning ability or because of unfavourable learning conditions? We investigated whether adults can auditorily sensitise to the prosody of a novel language, and whether such sensitisation is affected by orthographic input. After 5 minutes of exposure to Māori, Czech listeners could reliably recognize this language in a post-test using low-pass filtered clips of Māori and Malay. Recognition accuracy was lower for participants exposed to the novel-language speech along with deep-orthography transcriptions or orthography with unfamiliar characters. Adults can thus attune to novel-language prosody, but orthography hampers this ability. Language-learning theories and applications may need to reconsider the consequences of providing orthographic input to beginning second-language learners.",

          "abstract": "How face perceptions unfold during ontogeny shapes how humans navigate adult social life. A vast literature implicates variation in sexually dimorphic facial characteristics in guiding judgments relating to suites of key life choices, ranging from partner choices to preferences for leaders. Although growing evidence supports that facial morphology underpins children’s first impressions from faces, whether these impressions influence children’s predictions about others’ behaviour remains unclear. We contrasted the influence of men’s facial hair, a highly sexually dimorphic masculine trait, on children’s explicit (Who looks strong/trustworthy) vs. implicit first impressions (Who do you want to tell your secret to/fight dragons?). While reading a storybook, children (N = 80; 4.5-12.0 years) and adults (N = 134), selected one of two twins (two images of the same identity, one bearded and one clean-shaven) to help them face a challenge requiring either a trustworthy or a dominant social partner. In control tasks, participants selected the strongest and most trustworthy member of each pair and then pointed to which face regions informed their decision. In the implicit task, both the probability of selecting a bearded partner and differential selection of bearded partners as a function of relevant trait increased with age. Selections in the explicit task were more adult-like and age-related changes in which facial cues participants used was surprisingly small. Thus, adult-like patterns in predicting other’s behaviour based on facial cues to trustworthiness and dominance lag behind adult-like patterns in inferring traits based on facial cues, potentially because first impressions are of unreliable.",

Pre-registered four-, two-, and one-factor confirmatory analyses models were conducted, none of which met pre-registered fit criteria. Exploratory factor analyses revealed that items reliant on metacognition loaded poorly, and items that mixed emotional and cognitive/behavioral content cross-loaded. Dropping these items resulted in a three-factor model that fit the data adequately. Identified factors included impairment, experience with climate change, and behavioral engagement. The modified CCAS positively correlated with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and heightened negative emotions about climate change. Findings suggest adolescents’ climate change anxiety differs from adults', and the CCAS may provide a foundation that could be adapted to create a developmental extension of the adult measure.",

          "abstract": "Suicide is a pressing global health issue, with alarming prevalence rates that have led\nthe World Health Organization to prioritize its prevention. Traditionally, suicidality is framed\nwithin medicine as a delusional symptom of mental illness. Contrastingly, another perspective\nviews suicide as an expression of free will, emphasizing the legitimacy of its motivations.\nThis paper seeks to reconcile these viewpoints by proposing that suicidality reflects a\nprofound rejection of life in its current form. Rather than endorsing the irreversible act of\nbiological suicide, this perspective suggests the true target of rejection is the individual's\nsocio-cultural existence and self-concept. Suicide, therefore, is a practical mistake, rooted in\nthe error of overly identifying with one's historical and socio-cultural circumstances.\nRecognizing this, health professionals might better support individuals by taking their desire\nfor transformation seriously—helping them redefine and rebuild their lives rather than merely\nattempting to treat suicidality as a delusional symptom. If it is actually only this socio-\ncultural life that an individual wishes to end, then the focus should be on addressing that\nwish.",

          "abstract": "Some scholars have treated overconfidence as an individual difference—that is, assuming the tendency to be overconfident is stable within an individual person and differs meaningfully from person to person. We question this assumption. We investigate consistency within individuals between its three forms—overestimation, overplacement, and overprecision— in multiple domains (Study 1a and 1b), at multiple times (Study 1b and 2), and with multiple measures (Study 3a and 3b). We find mixed evidence that does little to bolster claims that overconfidence qualifies as a trait. On the one hand, we do find some evidence of within-individual stability across domains and time points; on the other hand, we find little consistency across different measures of the same form of overconfidence. Instead, we find more consistent evidence that overconfidence varies situationally and contextually.",

But does endorsement of IB in principle translate to more uniform concern for others irrespective of relationship type? Three pre-registered studies (total N=1,716) found IB endorsement predicts greater and more uniform concern for others across social relationships varying in social distance: in care prescriptions (Study 1), as well as blame judgments (Study 2) and guilt expressions (Study 3) in response to care- violations. Heightened concern for others in socially distant relationships was not “offset” by less concern for close ones; nor was IB associated with a motive to be generally admired but was instead linked to “communal striving.” Across different types of moral judgments, a commitment to IB thus entails caring much more than average about the well-being of socially distant others, while maintaining a high level of concern for socially close ones.",

          "abstract": "Temporal binding, the perceived shortening of the interval between a voluntary action and its outcome, is often cited as an indicator of agency. This study investigates temporal binding within the context of preventive actions, where outcomes are avoided rather than produced. The experimental design was an adjusted form of intentional-binding paradigm, involved participants who were required to perform specific actions to prevent an aversive outcome cued by a neutral stimulus earlier. Results demonstrated that participants experienced a specific kind of temporal binding, “cue-binding”, as we named it. This suggests that temporal binding can occur not only in generative actions, but also in preventive actions aimed at avoiding undesirable effects. These findings expand our understanding of agency, highlighting that the sense of agency encompasses both actions that generate outcomes and those that prevent them.",

          "authors": "Alexander A Sulfaro",
          "abstract": "Subjective ratings of a mental image’s vividness are frequently used to index the similarity between mental and real image phenomenology. However, what it means for a mental image to change in vividness, or to even be perceived at all, is not commonly understood in any concrete terms. Here, the impact of this uncertainty on the validity of vividness comparisons is assessed. Arguments are presented suggesting that vividness ratings cannot distinguish differences in mental image experience from differences in an individual’s self-defined criteria for what constitutes vivid mental imagery, undermining their validity as a tool for comparing the mental image experiences of different individuals. Further, this confound can similarly affect self-identified judgements about whether one experiences a mental image at all (i.e., aphantasia/phantasia). While confounds may affect between-individual comparisons, within-individual comparisons may still have some valid use cases, although they may be largely superseded by other metrics given their limited interpretability. Arguments are also discussed which suggest that vividness ratings and judgements cannot gain construct validity by being correlated with physiological processes until the quasi-sensory nature of mental images is defined. Overall, commonly used vividness ratings seem to be affected by foundational logical flaws which diminish their utility, sometimes entirely. Validly indexing a change in the quasi-visibility of a mental image may require a concerted effort to first define what it means to see a mental image at all, with self-report in general still playing an essential role in mental imagery research, provided it is cautiously interpreted.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Holt; David Barner",
          "abstract": "When children learn to count, they are exposed to a finite list of words, as well as rules for combining them - e.g., that any decade label, like “seventy” can be combined with the unit labels “one” through “nine”. Additive, multiplicative, and other rules allow the creation of indefinitely large numbers, beyond those that children experience directly in their input. However, while children begin to use number words by the age of 2, they generally don’t acquire rules for combining them until much later. One possible reason for this late learning of rules is that it exceeds the cognitive capacities of younger children, or depends on information acquired at earlier stages of learning. Another possibility, however, is that these rules are hard to learn because they’re not readily available in children’s input, and that other forms of input might lead to earlier learning. Here, we simulated the problem of number word learning in adult participants by training them on a series of artificial number “languages”. We find that (1) training adults on rote counting facilitates memory for number words, but (2) may actually inhibit the acquisition of rules that govern them. We also find that whereas additive rules are relatively easy to learn (e.g., the number after “twenty” is “twenty-one”), adults struggle to acquire new multiplicative rules (e.g., “seventy” is seven tens). Finally, we find that the size of a base - e.g., base 2 vs. base 5 - has little effect on learning when learned via a rote counting procedure, despite the fact that larger bases require more memorization of words, and provide less exposure to rules.",

          "abstract": "A recent trend in computational cognitive science is to use large-scale naturalistic data to evaluate cognitive theories (Griffiths, 2015; Jones, 2017). This article extends this work by examining the connection between social feedback and language usage. Social feedback, operationalized here as the difference between the number of upvotes and downvotes on comments on the social media forum Reddit, provides a unique opportunity to investigate how social approval interacts with linguistic behavior. To accomplish this, social feedback ratings from over 400 billion words of comments from the social media forum Reddit were mined. Two types of corpora were formed: 1) large (approximately 1.7 billion words) combined corpora of positive, negative, and neutral comments, and 2) individual corpora from over 1,500 high-level commenters on Reddit (following recent work by Johns, 2021a, 2023, 2024a,b using individualized language models). Both were used to examine social feedback and language usage across multiple sets of lexical organization and lexical semantic data with distributional modeling techniques. It was found that comments that receive positive social feedback tended to align more closely with normative language usage, suggesting that the acceptability of a communicative message may lie in the form of that utterance and not just the content of it. Additionally, this trend was replicated at the individual level, where commenters who had more normative usage of language generally received more positive ratings on their comments.",

          "abstract": "The mechanisms by which humans select or arbitrate between different reinforcement-learning (RL) and decision making strategies remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the very nature of the strategies being utilized has come under recent debate. To address these questions we developed a novel variant of the standard two-step decision task and deployed it through multiple large-sample studies. We found that humans rely on at least three forms of uncertainty to drive the arbitration process: transition uncertainty, model-free reward prediction uncertainty and model-based reward-prediction uncertainty. However, these distinct arbitration mechanisms were heterogeneously deployed across individuals depending on which core strategies individuals relied on. Some individuals behaved in a manner consistent with model-free control, others were predominantly model-based, while others exhibited a mixture of the two strategies. These individuals exhibiting RL behavior can be further distinguished from another group that do not exhibit RL-like behavior at all. Each of these distinct strategy repertoires were related to behavioral trait phenotypes that are dissociable with respect to compulsivity and impulsivity, suggesting they are indexing meaningful individual differences.  Individuals differed fundamentally in the nature of the strategies that they arbitrated over depending on their core strategy repertoire: while some relied only on model-based control and arbitrated between different task models, others actively switched between model-based and model-free control. Our findings thus suggest that human reinforcement-learning varies considerably across individuals both in terms of the variables used to drive arbitration and the strategies being arbitrated over. While this complexity entails methodological challenges, it heralds new opportunities for attaining a deeper understanding of the nature of individual differences in human reinforcement-learning in both health and disease.",

Here we explore if children also consider knowledge of one’s options when judging actions. That is, are children equally lenient if someone makes a bad choice because they didn’t know another option was available? We tested children in China (N = 133), India (N = 133) and the USA (N = 146) aged between 5 and 10. We told children stories about three characters who either 1) had a choice and caused a bad outcome; 2) had no choice but to cause a bad outcome and 3) do not know they had a choice, and caused a bad outcome. Broadly, we find that children across all countries are more lenient of bad actions when characters in the story did not know they had another choice available.

Research indicates that when AI provides confidence ratings, human users often correspondingly increase their trust in such judgments, but these increases in trust can occur even when AI fails to provide accurate information on a given task. In this piece, we argue that measures of metacognitive sensitivity provided by AI systems will likely play a critical role in (1) helping individuals to calibrate their level of trust in these systems, and (2) optimally incorporate advice from AI into human-AI hybrid decision- making. We draw upon a seminal finding in the perceptual decision-making literature which demonstrates the importance of metacognitive ratings for optimal joint decisions and outline a framework to test how different types of information provided by AI systems can guide decision- making.",

Previous research has focused on TCTSY offered in group settings. The present study examined experiences of individuals practicing TCTSY one-to-one (i.e., one client, one TCTSY facilitator). Study aims were to: (1) learn about participants’ experiences with and reasons for attending one-to-one TCTSY; (2) describe and compare participants’ experiences between group and one-to-one yoga settings; (3) explore participants’ perceptions of the impacts of TCTSY on their trauma healing; and (4) document participants’ intentions for continued one-to-one TCTSY use. Semistructured interviews were offered to participants at completion of a longitudinal observational study of one-to-one TCTSY; 4 of the 10 participants agreed to be interviewed. Interviewees were located in the United States and self-reported experiencing childhood trauma and a current PTSD diagnosis. Following the consensual qualitative research method, domains were initially created deductively by the team. Adjustments, as well as categories and core ideas, were created inductively. Results indicated that participants: (1) preferred one-to-one over groups because of perceived safety and comfort; (2) had positive experiences with TCTSY; (3) perceived biopsychosocial benefits from the practice and described using TCTSY principles outside of sessions; and (4) intended to practice indefinitely. This study provided insight to the lived experiences of participants who use TCTSY as complementary care. Yoga facilitators and clinical trauma care providers are recommended to collaborate to offer one-to-one somatic-based approaches to create more access options for trauma healing.",

          "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is crucial for temporarily holding and manipulating visual information but is limited in capacity, necessitating effective distractor filtering. Previous studies indicate differential effects of distractors appearing during encoding and delay stages, but how stimulus presentation duration influences these effects remains unclear. We conducted two experiments to investigate the role of stimulus presentation duration on VWM performance under different distraction conditions. In Experiment 1, participants performed continuous recall and change detection tasks for memorizing three target orientations under four conditions: no-distraction, encoding-distraction, full-distraction, and delay-distraction, with short (200 ms) and long (1000 ms) presentation durations. Experiment 2 extended these findings by examining the role of distractor-target similarity, introducing both same-category (orientation) and different-category (face) distractors. In Experiment 1, high-precision tasks showed impairment from both encoding- and delay-stage distractors during short durations, while only delay-stage distractors persisted with longer durations. For low-precision tasks, delay-stage distractors consistently impaired VWM performance, whereas encoding-stage distractions had a lesser effect. Experiment 2 revealed that short-duration delay-stage distractors impaired VWM regardless of type, while long-duration same-category distractors impaired performance during delay stages, and different-category distractors had a lesser effect. The results demonstrate that stimulus presentation duration critically modulates distractor impact. Longer durations enable more stable VWM consolidation, aiding in resisting delay-stage distractions, while homogeneous distractors remain more challenging to filter compared to heterogeneous distractors. This differential effect suggests that VWM filtering mechanisms are sensitive to both presentation duration and distractor-target similarity. Our findings highlight the importance of stimulus presentation duration in VWM distractor filtering and suggest that effective resistance to distractors depends on both consolidation time and distractor similarity. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the temporal dynamics and mechanisms underlying distractor processing in VWM.",

Of cognitive factors, pseudoscientific beliefs, lower scores on the actively open-minded thinking scale, and higher preference for anecdotal information were related to increased tendency to believe in epistemically suspect claims related to COVID-19. Of social factors, lower trust in governmental institutions and science and scientists, and the use of alternative media were associated with the endorsement of epistemically suspect claims about COVID-19. Men were more likely to endorse epistemically suspect claims than women, and the support decreased with age. The present results suggest that epistemically suspect beliefs about COVID-19 are not generally common among the Finnish population. The results suggest that battling the spread of health-related misinformation, like COVID-19 conspiracy theories, may require actions that target different cognitive and social factors, such as the thinking style of individuals; trust felt towards governmental institutions, science, and mainstream media; and the content circulating in social and alternative media.",

Here, we employ a novel task-driven resting-state electroencephalography design including an implicit Lindenmayer grammar learning task, which tracks aperiodic and hierarchical dependencies, to determine task-related functional connectivity changes in bilinguals. Quantified bilingual experience was used as a predictor of directional effects, using Generalised Additive Models to account for non-linear patterns. Our results revealed whole-brain post-task alterations to connectivity, including increased involvement of bilateral temporal and posterior regions and reduced involvement of frontal regions.

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis: Primal world beliefs (‘primals’) are newly conceptualised schemas individuals form about the world’s overarching qualities. Primals fit to a hierarchical structure, e.g. the primary primal belief that the world is Good (vs. bad), and secondary primals; the beliefs the world is Safe (vs. dangerous), Enticing (vs. dull) and Alive (vs. mechanistic). Primals can be assessed empirically with self-report measures, appear stable over time, and are associated with wellbeing. There is currently no research investigating primals in psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSD). We aimed to investigate possible differences in primary and secondary primals between PSD and non-psychotic controls, and understand associations between primals and PSD-related experiences.\nStudy Design: This online, self-report, observational study included 99 participants (47 PSD, 53 non-PSD). Participants were screened for psychosis using the Prodromal Questionnaire-16 (PQ-16). PSD experiences were assessed with the Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ) and Peters’ Delusion Inventory-21 (PDI). Primals were measured using the Primals Inventory (PI-18).\nStudy Results: Individuals with PSD reported more negative primals than controls. Beliefs the world is less Safe were associated with more psychotic symptoms, subjective distress about symptoms, and preoccupation with delusions. Context of delusions also mattered, whereby inflated-self and magical thinking were associated with more positive primals. Presence and frequency of hallucinations and delusional ideation were not associated with primals. \nConclusions: The role of primals at different stages of PSD is not clear; future research would benefit from longitudinal investigations to understand the potential role of primals in psychological interventions to reduce symptom-related distress.",

          "abstract": "The gradual emergence of cultivated meat (CM) products on the market framed as sustainable alternatives to conventional animal-source foods makes it essential to examine the psychological barriers and predisposing factors that influence consumer acceptance. Familiarity is frequently suggested as a facilitating factor, based on the premise that increased familiarity with CM enhances acceptance. However, the evidence is contradictory and poorly integrated. This review aims to examine and organize the existing literature on the role of familiarity in consumer acceptance of CM. \nA scoping review of current peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted, on June 7, 2024, following PRISMA-ScR and Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed across Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycInfo, with no restrictions on participant type, geographic location, social and cultural contexts, language, or publication time, enhancing the review's inclusivity and sensitivity. The 63 articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed to examine (i) definitions of familiarity, (ii) methodologies used to measure familiarity with CM, and (iii) evidence obtained regarding its role in the context of consumer acceptance of CM. Results indicated that current research on familiarity with CM shares limitations with the broader literature on CM acceptance, particularly concerning the non-representativeness of evidence and inconsistent approaches to constructs' operationalization. Furthermore, familiarity is often used synonymously with related yet distinct constructs of awareness and knowledge, highlighting a lack of clarity in literature. The review also identified various approaches to assess familiarity, all lacking psychometric rigor, which hinder the replicability and comparability of findings. By unfolding the methodologies and evidence surrounding familiarity with CM, this review suggests further research to better specify the theoretical and operational definition of the familiarity construct and its relation with consumer acceptance of CM.",

          "abstract": "Distinguishing facts from fiction in social media is increasingly challenging. How social factors causally shape the perception of truth of such online content remains unknown. We conducted two preregistered experimental studies, examining how endorsements (likes) from individuals with similar or opposing political views affected truth judgments and the willingness to like and share neutral and partisan content. For politically neutral content (Study 1), the perceived truthfulness increased with a higher proportion of likes. However, for partisan content (Study 2), the perceived truthfulness remained unchanged by the proportion of likes but was higher for content aligning with the participants' political views. Strikingly, across both studies, the tendency to like and share content – whether neutral or partisan – increased with the proportion of likes and the political alignment of the endorsers. Our findings reveal how social factors can both enhance and limit the influence of social endorsements on truth judgments and online behavior.",

          "authors": "Iraklis Pantazis; Marc Wittmann",
          "abstract": "The term “afterglow“ was first used to describe the heightened mood, relaxation, and overall sense of tranquility reported by individuals hours or even days after the use of psychedelics, after their most immediate effects had dissipated. The use of the word “afterglow” was then extended to similar states achieved after other altered-state experiences. Even though the afterglow effect is widely reported anecdotally, not much quantitative research has been undertaken on it and none at all explicitly related to Floatation-REST (Reduced Environmental Stimulation Technique). In Floatation-REST an individual floats almost weightlessly on the surface of thermoneutral, supersaturated salt water in a quiet, dark tank. Using a within-subject crossover design, 34 healthy subjects were randomized to 60 min of Floatation-REST or 60 min of Bed-REST, a control condition where one lies supine on a waterbed in a dark, quiet room. We assessed the experience during the REST conditions as well as regarding the alleged afterglow effect following a 10-minute period of silence after exposure to the conditions. Floatation-REST led to weaker body boundaries, stronger time distortion, and more relaxation, as experienced during the conditions. After Floatation-REST exposure, individuals reported a stronger feeling of afterglow as measured with an afterglow inventory, more state mindfulness, and more interoceptive awareness. A mediation analysis revealed that the relaxation experienced during Floatation-REST completely mediates the afterglow effect: The feeling of afterglow follows from a specific increase in relaxation during floating. Our findings support prior research on psychedelics by showing that Floatation-REST produces qualitatively similar effects. This very first study sets the ground for future studies on the afterglow effect for longer time increments after altered-state experiences.",

This rich database allowed us to examine not just the effects of various country level characteristics, including linguistic distances, but also their dynamic effects over this time range. We performed this analysis by applying a general additive mixed regression model (GAMM) to reveal intricate, non-linear interaction effects, especially those of the three linguistic distance measures we applied, and, more in particular, to map the changing role of morphological distance in relation to lexical and phonological distance. All three distances contributed in explaining L2 English country scores: the larger the distance is the lower L2 English proficiency. Morphological distance delivers its own, distinctive contribution, next to and in competition with the lexical and phonological distances. All three distances interact with year of testing. These changes seem to reflect the increasing presence and dominance of L2 English worldwide, but it shows at the same time that the impact of distance is dynamic. Morphological and phonological properties become more important the higher the L2 proficiency is, while the importance of lexical distance gradually decreases.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Buttlar; Anna Lambrich; Linda McCaughey; Iris K. Schneider",
          "abstract": "People regularly have to navigate decisions in which they feel ambivalent, for instance, regarding unhealthy food, recycling, or financial investments. It is assumed that people cope with such felt ambivalence by seeking information that sway their ambivalent attitudes about these topics. However, empirical evidence for this proposition is scarce because most study measure information seeking intentions instead of behavior. As such, it remains doubtful whether information seeking indeed helps people to reduce felt ambivalence while making decisions. To test this proposition, we adapted a sample-based information seeking paradigm that enabled us to measure actual information seeking behavior in financial decisions. In three pre-registered studies (total N = 365 participants; k = 10.519 decisions), we demonstrated that when people feel ambivalent about an initial set of information about a stock, they seek more information about its development to decide whether it develops positively or negatively; this information seeking, in turn, helps them to reduce felt ambivalence when making the decision. This supports a central proposition in ambivalence research, indicating that people can indeed solve their felt ambivalence through information seeking. However, our data also showed that the effect of information seeking on felt ambivalence did not depend on whether the sought information was actually able to resolve the attitudinal basis of the conflict. Future research should, therefore, examine whether and how information seeking as a problem-focused coping strategy may also impact attitude strength more generally, and whether information seeking can serve as an emotion-focused coping strategy to reduce conflict-induced discomfort.",

Using context-driven picture naming, we examined whether (a) speakers preplan lexical-semantic and phonological information at the word level in constraining sentential contexts, and (b) phonological preplanning encompasses the whole word. Analysis of naming response times (RTs) showed that constraining contexts enable preplanning of both lexical-semantic and phonological representations (Experiment 1). Using a picture-word interference version of the same task (Experiment 2), we found that speakers preplan the phonological form of the whole word, however, only the subset of constraining trials with the shortest RTs indicated preplanning. The results confirm previous findings from turn-taking, which suggested that speakers can complete later stages of lexical access in advance, but also highlight that the presence of preplanning varies from trial to trial.",

          "abstract": "Response Surface Analysis (RSA) allows researchers to study whether the degree of congruence between two predictor variables is related to a potential psychological outcome. Here, we adapt RSA to the case in which the two predictor variables whose  congruence is of interest refer to individual differences in within-person associations (WPAs) between variables that fluctuate over time. For example, a WPA-congruence hypothesis in research on romantic relationships could posit that partners are happier when they have similar social reactivities – that is, when they have similarly strong WPAs between the quantity of their social interactions and their momentary well-being. One method for testing a WPA-congruence hypothesis is a 2-step approach in which the individuals' WPAs are first estimated as random slopes in respective multilevel models, and then these estimates are used as predictors in a regular RSA. As an alternative, we suggest combining RSA with multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) by specifying the WPAs as random slopes in the structural equation and using their latent second-order terms to predict the outcome on Level 2. We introduce both approaches and provide and explain their corresponding computer code templates. We also compared the two approaches with a simulation study and found that the MSEM model – despite its complexities (e.g., nonlinear functions of latent slopes) – has advantages over the 2-step approach. We conclude that the MSEM approach should be used in practice. We demonstrate its application using data from a daily diary study and offer guidance for important decisions (e.g., about standardization).",

          "abstract": "We employed a modified battery of cognitive and social tests from psychological sciences intended to reflect key components of teamwork. These tests were given to five instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) to examine the capabilities of LLMs to contribute to teamwork. Our results revealed concrete strengths and shortcomings of LLMs to engage in teaming behaviours. Language models performed well on action phases of teamwork, where a team engages in specific work tasks such as monitoring and coordination to meet team goals. In contrast, LLMs lacked the abstract reasoning and planning required to meet transition phases of teamwork. These moments are critical for self-reflection of past performance and planning for upcoming tasks in teams. Finally, LLMs had unique behaviours for interpersonal aspects of teamwork, predominately applying an integrating motivational style but failing to acknowledge negative emotional states of teammates. These findings reveal how ‘off-the-shelf’ LLMs may contribute to contemporary human-AI teams and highlight the utility of experimental psychology in elucidating behaviours of non-embodied agents.",

Across three pre-registered online studies (Ns=1,000), participants who read information about conspiracies involving agribiotechnology companies or biobank scientists were more likely to endorse conspiracies. Other effects of exposure to conspiracy information were mixed. In Study 1, reading about an agricultural biotechnology conspiracy had a small significant effect on reducing intentions to eat Genetically Modified food. In Study 2, exposure to a conspiracy involving biobank scientists decreased support for biobanks, mediated by decreased trust in biobank scientists. In Study 3, this conspiracy had no effect on wider beliefs of the role of science in society (science populism), nor support of Genetically Modified food-promoting policies. Overall, we found that exposure to conspiracies involving scientific claims increased conspiracy belief endorsement and can further negative effects. However, the effects of conspiracies on science populism appears limited.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sensory changes are commonly observed in individuals with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) but remain under-researched.\nObjectives: This study examined the prevalence of sensory changes after msTBI and their relationships with emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction.\nMethods: In a cross-sectional survey of 387 participants with msTBI (M=12.76 years post-injury; range=0.40–35.02) and 60 controls, we examined self-reported sensory symptoms across visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and vestibular modalities, using a purpose-designed checklist and the Somatic Symptom Scale – 8. Emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction were measured through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 12-Item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, and Satisfaction With Life Scale, respectively. We compared the frequency of sensory symptoms between the TBI group and control group and examined associations with demographics, injury factors, and clinical outcomes within the msTBI sample.\nResults: 75% of participants with msTBI reported experiencing at least one sensory change due to their brain injury, averaging 2.21 symptoms (SD=2.01)—significantly higher than the 43% of controls reporting sensory symptoms. Within the msTBI sample, sensory changes were more common in younger participants (light hypersensitivity), females (light and noise hypersensitivity), those with more severe TBI (overall sensory changes, affected vision, reduced smell), and individuals who were fewer years post-injury (overall sensory changes, noise hypersensitivity, reduced smell, altered taste, dizziness). Sensory changes were consistently associated with worse clinical outcomes, with medium-large effect sizes for emotional distress and functional disability and smaller effects for life satisfaction. Outcomes worsened with the number of reported sensory changes.\nConclusions: Sensory changes are a clinically significant yet often overlooked issue after msTBI, even among individuals more than a decade post-injury on average, underscoring the need for routine assessment. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind these sensory changes and develop effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "The visual system can encode multiple objects in the form of ensemble representations. Such representations can be accessed with either explicit or implicit reports, but depending on the type of report, the observed properties of the ensemble representation can differ in detail. Previous studies have suggested that the saliency of individual items biases the perceived mean of ensembles. It is unclear, however, whether saliency affects implicit representations of the whole feature distribution (beyond mean and variance). Our observers were presented with sets of lines varying in orientation and size where size was a task-irrelevant salient feature. To estimate explicit representations, observers adjusted the mean orientation and their accuracy was measured. To access the implicit representation of the feature distribution we used a visual search task for an oddly-oriented line among heterogeneous distractors and measured the search times. The results revealed a strong saliency-induced bias in the explicit report, with mean orientation estimates biased toward the more salient items. However, no such effect was observed in the implicit report, as search times were unaffected by the saliency of the items. Our results support the hypothesis that distinct mechanisms underlie the more detailed implicit representations of full distributions and explicit ensemble representations that are based on summary statistics.",

Then, this paper discusses the essence of consciousness and animal explicit consciousness, and analyzes how consciousness is interrelated with the main structure, neural network structure, and objective world. Then, this paper analyzes the world model of consciousness, and puts forward the idea of combining six phased models to form a whole model. Finally, this paper discusses the principle of consciousness intelligence, and points out that consciousness intelligence is a multi-cell collaborative overall feedback to record natural change data and form a data structure model. Therefore, the model of predicting changes in advance can be infered from the data structure model, and the model of operating mechanism of consciousness feedback is proposed.\nKey words: consciousness; Subject angle theory; The structure of consciousness; The essence of intelligence; Feedback mechanism of consciousness",

          "abstract": "Assets, income, socioeconomic status, and other measures of financial position are consistent predictors of depression. Although financial stress has been proposed as a mediator of this relationship, no study has explored this hypothesis using a rigorous longitudinal design or outside of high-income countries. We address this gap using longitudinal cohort data collected from 2021 to 2023 across four timepoints. The sample comprised 831 women (M = 35.9 years old) living in Nawalpur, a rural district in the Gandaki province of Nepal; the majority of which were married (88%) and of Janajati caste/ethnicity (61%). Financial position was determined using household assets, depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and financial stress with a single bespoke item. Direct and indirect effects were estimated using a cross-lagged panel mediation model (CLPM); we also conduct cross-sectional mediation models – of the sort typically employed in mediation analyses – for comparison and bias estimation. In the CLPM, financial stress significantly mediated the financial position-depressive symptom relationship between timepoints one and three, but not between timepoints two and four. After accounting for financial stress as a mediator, the direct effects of financial position on depressive symptoms were not statistically significant. The cross-sectional models overestimated the relationship between financial stress and depressive symptoms; otherwise, results between the CLPM and cross-sectional models were generally comparable. Our findings suggest that interventions components that address financial stress may help improve depressive symptoms. Methodologically, we argue that more researchers should employ longitudinal designs when investigating mediation processes.",

Then, participants performed a knee extensors endurance task until exhaustion at 20% of their maximal voluntary peak force, to measure muscle endurance performance. \nParticipants perceived the VGSS as more demanding than the documentary condition. However, only a slight increase in perceived mental fatigue was highlighted and no difference between conditions in cognitive performance was observed. Muscle endurance performance did not differ after VGSS or documentary and physical activity intention decreased regardless of the condition.\nEngaging in VGSS did not induce a specific state of mental fatigue, thus explaining the absence of impaired muscle endurance performance, compared to watching a documentary.

          "abstract": "Background: Ageism, defined as stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination based on a person’s age is prevalent and negatively impacts individuals and society. In 2016 WHO received a mandate from its Member States to lead the global campaign to combat ageism. However, success in combating ageism is critically dependent on the availability of valid and reliable measures of people’s experiences of ageism that can capture its multidimensional nature and as directed against multiple age groups across diverse country settings. The goal of current study is to present a preliminary psychometric validation of a measure specifically designed to meet this need: the 15-item WHO experiences of ageism scale. The scale includes items measuring self-directed, interpersonal, and institutional ageism and spans stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination. \nMethod: We collected data from a UK mixed-age adult sample (N = 402), and several psychometric properties were tested, including internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity. \nResults: Results suggested that the 15-item WHO experiences of ageism scale has good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor model for self-directed ageism items. This scale also proved to have adequate convergent validity. \nDiscussion: The results provide sufficient supports for the adoption of the scale in this population and underscore the need for its translation and validation in other settings, as well as the evaluation of a more extended set of psychometric properties in future studies.",

          "abstract": "The expansion and gyrification of the human cerebral cortex, are crucial for the emergence of higher cognition and emotion, as they increase the available space for the dense and topologically complex configuration of the connectome. These phenomena emerge during a developmental trajectory that spans from the early stages of life to early adulthood and are shaped by genetic, biochemical, mechanical and environmental factors.  \nBeyond the expansion and folding observed during development, transient or permanent changes in the cortical surface area and folding patterns have also been observed during certain learning tasks in adulthood. In this essay, we propose a multi-staged qualitative model, for the expansion and potential convolution of cortical surface during learning in adults.  The model integrates existing knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for developmental cortical surface area expansion and folding, with recent advancements in the understanding of learning-induced microstructural changes and growth. \n\nThe primary driver of cortical surface area expansion in hypothesized to be learning-induced growth of transcolumnar dendrites and their supportive structures in the neuropil. This growth serves as a critical link between functional dynamics and structural organization across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Thus, the model incorporates feedback loops between the different stages of surface expansion and network growth. It connects information flow, adaptive network reconfiguration and growth, mechanical phenomena during network growth (increased local mechanical stiffness and tension in the neuropil), cortical surface expansion (including a contribution of cortical thickness) and their impact on the preceding stages of the model. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this model for research on the neurobiology of knowledge acquisition, the rate of learning new tasks and explore potential research directions.",

The involvement of chefs in studies devoted to multisensory food perception made this topic even more interesting and interactive since many chefs who work in fine-dining restaurants are trying the optimize the customers' dining experiences (Spence, 2015). This topic is mainly studied by analyzing the cross-modal perception among different senses such as vision, taste and auditory. So far, it has been found that color-taste interaction may alter our perception of taste such as the sweets that are served on the white-round shaped plates are perceived 15 percent sweeter than the sweets that are served on black-rectangular shaped plates or stale potato chips are perceived even crispier than freshly made potato chips when the high-pitched crunch biting sound is involved (Zampini and Spence 2004). These findings support the importance of multisensory food experiences in our food decisions and this study will examine how we can nudge people into healthier food choices by using multisensory food perception and also by analyzing if different textures of the same ingredients and their cross-modal interactions with the congruent sounds may alter the consumers' liking of the sustainable foods.\n\nMultisensory food perception is quite a new topic that emerged in the last 20 years in relation with the 'neurogastronomy' (Shepherd, 2011). This field is closely related to cross-modal perception and synaesthesia. Even though these two topics have been researched for more than 150 years, there are no fundamental studies focused on the cross-modal perception of different senses in relation of different food products. Previous studies have investigated individual differences in multisensory food perception and suggest that individuals' multisensory food perception significantly differ genetically and culturally (Spence,2015). Several studies have also suggested that taste-sound or taste-color congruency may lead to cut down on sugar and salt consumption since the increased intensity of the taste match among different senses may provide less need of sugar or salt for any food product (Spence,2015 ; Piqueras-Fiszman et al., 2012). Considering these previous results, it is possible to hypothesize that the multisensory approach to food perception can be used to help nudging consumers towards healthier food decisions (Spence and Piqueras-Fiszman, 2014; Marteau et al., 2012). \n\nWe plan to investigate the cross-modal perception between texture, taste and sound by conducting a behavioural experiment where the participants’ texture, taste and sound congruency will be measured to analyse if the multisensory food congruency may influence consumers’ food decisions and food perceptions. We expect that this study will be able to nudge consumers towards healthier food choices by manipulating food perception in different sensory modalities.",

          "abstract": "Context: The ecological validity of observations derived from clinical and experimental studies has become a central parameter in cognitive neuroscience research. However, this concept rooted in the ecological psychology theories, finds its contemporary definition and use reduced to the external validity criterion of laboratory experimentation. This misapplication of the concept of ecological validity, in which ecological conditions are assumed to be replicated, leads to theoretical ambiguity in all disciplines involved in the study of cognition and behavior.\nObjective: We propose to explore the concept of ecological validity for cognitive and clinical neuroscience in its original formulation derived from functionalist theories and further developed by theories of direct perception and theories of enaction. This highlights the limitations of experimental and clinical studies in achieving this quality in their observations and results. In the first part, we will describe the origins of contemporary problems of ecological validity in behavioral and cognitive sciences, stemming from the adaptation of Fisher's experimental design for experimental psychology. Then we will address the fundamental importance of the concept of ecological validity in neuroscience and mental health research.\nDiscussion: Finally, we will discuss possible solutions in cognitive and clinical neuroscience to improve ecological validity and enable better transferability of experimental results to various everyday situations.",

Characterized by a large symptom heterogeneity and comorbidity, it remains elusive how individual internalizing symptoms relate to DN, FP, and SA connectivity. Leveraging a large population-based sample of adolescents (N = 2426; mean age = 14.1 years) and an integrated network modelling approach, we identified symptom-specific associations between internalizing problems and functional connectivity and explored sex and timing-specific differences in these links. Our findings revealed small negative associations between self-reported feelings of worthlessness and guilt and DN within-network connectivity and positive associations between fearfulness and FP within-network connectivity. Moreover, sadness and fearfulness were positively associated with DN-SA between-network connectivity. Exploratory analyses revealed no significant sex differences but indicated that DN within-network connectivity around age 10 was negatively associated with self-reported worthlessness at age 14. Our findings show symptom-specific associations between internalizing problems and brain functional circuitry in youth and highlight the complex interplay of symptoms and brain networks.",

However, previous research syntheses addressing the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on RNT are limited to specific diagnoses, treatments, or RNT constructs (transdiagnostic RNT, worry, rumination). In the present meta-analysis, we integrate findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT on RNT across diagnoses, intervention types, and RNT constructs. We investigate the following questions: What is the overall transdiagnostic efficacy of CBT interventions on all post-treatment RNT outcomes? Which RNT construct is addressed most effectively? Are RNT-specific treatments superior in reducing RNT than less specific approaches? Inclusion criteria were met by 55 studies with a total of 4,970 participants. The overall post-treatment effect of CBT interventions on RNT compared to respective control groups was moderate in favor of CBT (g = -0.67). Treatment efficacy did not differ significantly by RNT construct. RNT-specific interventions (g = -0.99) were significantly more efficacious in reducing RNT than less specific approaches (g = -0.56). Treatment efficacy was not significantly enhanced by individual or in-person settings. Our results advocate a dissemination of RNT-specific treatments in research and practice and a general improvement of CBT treatments by concentrating on relevant transdiagnostic processes such as RNT.",

Organizing concepts into categories allows the brain to generalize learned stimulus-reward contingencies to new stimuli within  the same category. However, when category membership does not fully predict associated rewards, the brain needs to balance generalizing values within categories and discriminating value differences among individual items. How do generalization and discrimination in reward learning develop throughout lifespan as semantic knowledge is gradually acquired? Using a probabilistic reward learning task with a hierarchical value structure organized by semantic categories, we found children can generalize values of stimuli based on semantic categories at least as early as three to four years old. Furthermore, age-related performance improvement is explained by a combination of increased decision certainty, decreased initial exploration, change in memory retention, and a reduced categorical learning rate.",

          "abstract": "The study of aperiodic neural activity – reflecting patterns of non-frequency specific activity that are observed in electrical neural recordings such as M/EEG and intracranial LFP recordings – has recently rapidly expanded as a topic of study. While the extent of this work reflects a newfound interest in the study of aperiodic activity, the study of aperiodic activity itself is not new. There is a rich, though arguably underappreciated, history of work developing and demonstrating key findings and ideas regarding aperiodic neural activity, dating back many decades. In addition, studies of behavior, physiology, and physics have contributed many ideas, methods, and theoretical frameworks that have informed the study of neural activity. This perspective explores the history of the study of aperiodic neural activity and related topics, covering early discussions of separating oscillatory and aperiodic activity that started in the late 1940s, the emergence of frequency-domain measures of non-frequency specific activity by the mid 1970s, and findings from across the subsequent half-century of work investigating how aperiodic neural activity relates to development, cognition, disease, and more. Collectively, this history set the foundation for key ideas regarding aperiodic activity prior to the recent (re-)emergence of these topics in contemporary work. In summarizing this historical study of aperiodic neural activity, this perspective seeks both to establish the historical context of such work as well as to emphasize the wealth of knowledge available in the historical record to contextualize and contribute to current and future work.",

Historically, theorizing in these two areas has progressed separately, despite well-documented empirical evidence for a range of shared underlying developmental processes subserving these learning domains. The purpose of this paper is to describe the links between the Triple Code Model, an influential model of numerical cognition, and the Triangle Framework, a dominant model of learning to read. We describe several parallels between the theoretical models and discuss how the cognitive mechanisms posited by the Triangle Framework might be used to understand the commonalities in learning processes across these learning domains In particular, we discuss how the cognitive mechanisms implemented in the Triangle Framework can be used to understand linguistic aspects of numerical cognition, specifically, learning the connections among numerals (e.g., 24) and words (e.g., twenty-four), and linking those to semantic representations of magnitude. Following from these commonalities between the two models, we discuss several ways that interdisciplinary work integrating both models can benefit math cognition research.",

For validity with respect to other constructs, the SD-R constructs were correlated with the purity/sanctity subconstruct of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. For reliability, the ordinal alpha and the omega coefficient were used. Acceptable fit indices were obtained for the two and three oblique factor models, acceptable reliability indices for the core disgust and animal reminder scales was obtained, and small and significant positive correlations were obtained between the contamination and animal reminder factors with the purity/sanctity scale of the MFQ. The DS-R is an instrument with acceptable psychometric properties, although some adjustments must be made related to the reliability of the contamination scale, added to the exploration of other variables that correlate to each of its constructs to obtain greater validity in relation to other variables.",

Here we discuss how this paradox of skill learning during dreams despite subsequent dream amnesia can be dissolved with reference to different memory systems. On the one hand, dream amnesia affects explicit declarative memories of dream episodes to avoid dream-reality confusion. The acquisition and training of threat coping and social skills during dreaming, on the other hand, are not affected, as these non-declarative learning experiences rely on implicit memory systems. We quickly forget the potentially confusing explicit content of our nocturnal training lessons; however, we retain their implicit practical insights to shape our daytime skills in recognizing and coping with threatening or social situations.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes the experimental psychometrics framework, an approach that integrates causal inference and experimental design, representational measurement theory, and data theory to enhance psychological measurement. The framework addresses limitations of traditional psychometric methods by emphasizing the need for experimental control to account for sources of systematic error and to test the assumptions underlying psychometric models. It is argued that past propositions found in the literature have demonstrated how experimental manipulation can improve the validity of measures and provide better tests of theoretical expectations. However, the application of experimental manipulation and causal modeling as tool for assessing the abstract structure of the data, that can be tested from a representational measurement theory perspective are not well developed. Two empirical examples are presented to illustrate how the experimental psychometrics framework offers a structured approach for deriving more robust and replicable measurements. This work contributes to the growing discourse on improving the rigor of psychological measurement and theory, advocating for a more experimentally-driven and theory-informed approach. The potential for this framework to reshape psychometric practices is significant, promising to enhance the accuracy, validity, and reliability of psychological assessments.",

          "abstract": "There are growing calls for a comprehensive, evidence-based national eating disorder strategy. This is due to the rising prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) in England, the lack of national guidance in relation to different ED presentations (and potentially varying treatment needs), ad hoc data collection, and inconsistencies in both care and evaluation of quality-of-service provision. Furthermore, the shift towards the remote delivery of care during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for government strategy to include specific guidance on remote delivery of ED services. The increased use of remote healthcare presents an opportunity to mitigate regional disparities in the provision of care. However, there are distinct challenges when delivering ED services remotely. In this position paper, we firstly highlight the growing need for a comprehensive national ED strategy for England to combat the rising prevalence and harm of EDs. Secondly, we specify the importance of ensuring that future governmental strategy incorporates evidence-based guidelines specific to remote delivery of ED services. This is crucial for promoting consistent provision of ED care. We set out the lack of comprehensive national data, and the need for further research into remote delivery of care. Finally, we provide recent research findings from the RHED-C project (Remote Healthcare for Eating Disorders throughout COVID-19) that present recommendations aimed at enhancing future service delivery for remote treatment and support.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that older adults perform worse than do younger individuals in spatial navigation tasks, though the reasons for these age differences remain unclear. One hypothesis is that aging leads to a specific deficit in allocentric navigation, which is often assessed by examining how well participants can remember the spatial location of objects in relation to external landmarks within the environment. To test this hypothesis, we had young and older adults navigate a virtual environment under two conditions: a desktop setup using a keyboard and mouse to navigate, and an immersive virtual reality setup that allowed unrestricted ambulation. Both age groups performed worse when recalling locations from novel compared to familiar start locations - often taken as a hallmark of allocentric navigation - though the costs of switching from familiar to novel locations did not significantly differ between the two age groups. Older adults also employed distal landmarks to a comparable extent as did young adults in all conditions. Older adults were more likely to replicate previously taken paths, possibly indicating a preference for egocentric or route-based strategies. This effect was significantly attenuated in the immersive VR condition, particularly in the presence of geometric boundary cues. Age differences in spatial navigation may therefore be driven in part by a selective bias for navigating familiar routes, though these differences appear to be mitigated in the presence of multimodal visual and sensorimotor cues. By contrast, we did not identify any evidence to suggest that spatial errors in older age stem from a failure to attend to stable landmarks within the environment. These results suggest that age differences in navigation are influenced by multiple factors that cannot be reduced to a simple allocentric-egocentric dichotomy.",

Using four large-scale datasets (total n=23,251; Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study: n=11,040, 9-11y; Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort: n=9,416, 8-22y; Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes: n=342, 7y; Oregon ADHD-1000: n=843, 7-21y), we model time-of-year using generalized additive models with cyclic cubic splines. In school-age children but not young adults, we found cognitive performance minima following school vacation (July-September in the U.S.; November-January in Singapore) across cognitive domains. These results demonstrate a generalizable small-magnitude decrease in children’s cognitive performance aligning seasonally with school vacation.",

          "abstract": "Reinforcement-driven learning involves processing feedback signals to optimize future actions and decision making. This feedback can be discrete, occurring as a separate event from action or anticipation, or continuous, occurring constantly and concurrently with ongoing decision-making. Despite the real-world relevance of continuous feedback, most research paradigms investigate feedback processing as a discrete process. To address this, we analyzed fMRI data from four neurofeedback studies in which participants engaged in continuous feedback learning. Neural responses to the most positive, most negative, and the weakest feedback signals were compared. Our results show that nucleus accumbens activity tracked with feedback valence, and specifically, was greater in response to success than to failure during neurofeedback. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), hippocampus, supplementary motor area (SMA) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) were more activated in response to weak feedback than to strong feedback. Our findings suggest that during continuous feedback learning, weak feedback (more than strong feedback) increases activity in brain regions previously implicated in self referential thinking, decision-making under uncertainty, and referencing past experiences. These data suggest the ambiguity inherent in weak feedback may result in engagement of these processes to support context-dependent interpretations of the feedback signals.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge organizes our understanding of the world, determining what we expect given what we have already seen. Our predictive representations have two key properties: they are productive, and they are graded. Productive generalization is possible because our knowledge decomposes into concepts -- elements of knowledge that are combined and recombined to describe particular situations. Gradedness is the observable effect of accounting for uncertainty -- our knowledge encodes degrees of belief that lead to graded probabilistic predictions. To put this a different way, concepts form a combinatorial system that enables description of many different situations; each such situation specifies a distribution over what we expect to see in the world, given what we have seen. We may think of this system as a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT), in which representations are built from language-like composition of concepts, and the content of those representations is a probability distribution on world states. The purpose of this chapter is to formalize these ideas in computational terms, to illustrate key properties of the PLoT approach with a concrete example, and to draw connections with other views of conceptual structure.",

          "abstract": "Forecasting tournaments are a well established method for assessing human forecasting skills. Most forecasting tournaments are based on a format where participants estimate the probabilities of discrete events. For predictions of continuous values, the possible range of outcome values is divided into mutually exclusive bins covering the entire outcome distribution so that probabilities for each bin can be elicited. An alternative approach involves directly eliciting forecasts about quantiles of the continuous quantity. Using both simulated data and data from 1,147 participants who completed five surveys focused on forecasting tasks in a longitudinal study, we compared the psychometric properties of quantile and probability elicitation methods. In the simulation, we demonstrated that items in the quantile format recovered parameters that defined forecasters’ latent forecasting skill in fewer items than the probability format, and identified several idiosyncrasies in accuracy scores for the probability format that drive these differences. In the empirical analyses, we elicited forecasts about a set of 36 forecasting questions in both formats: quantile forecasts at five fixed probability values (5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%) and probability forecasts for five pre-determined item-specific bins. Consistent with the simulated results, our findings revealed that forecasts in the quantile format showed considerably stronger internal consistency, achieving a suitable reliability level with fewer items. When cross-validating how well individual forecasters’ accuracy on in-sample questions predicted their performance in out-of-sample questions, the variability in the accuracy of quantile forecasts was more statistically explainable. Despite its desirable properties, errors and signs of comprehension difficulties were more frequently observed in the quantile format. Further research is needed to refine elicitations that optimize the effectiveness of quantile-based forecasting judgments.",

We estimated a tri-factor model of “c” in N=9,494 children and young adults from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort using the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery and the GOASSESS clinical interview. We tested the validity of factor scores resulting from this model by relating them to external criteria, including global functioning, parent education, socioeconomic status, intracranial volume, and longitudinal clinical outcome. Fit of the structural model was acceptable (CFI = 0.98; SRMR = 0.030), and scores correlated with external criteria as expected (functioning = 0.27; parent education = 0.43; socioeconomic status = 0.47; intracranial volume = 0.39; clinical outcome Cohen d = 0.30 and 0.57). For most criteria, the effect for the “c” factor was larger than either the “p” or “g” factors alone. These results provide evidence for the feasibility and potential utility of modeling the “c” factor when cognitive and clinical data are both available.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Cannabis is the most popular illicit recreational drug among youth globally. Evidence suggests that long-term heavy use of cannabis is negatively associated with important cognitive functions related to executive functioning, attention, and working memory, learning, and memory. Previous findings link the early onset of cannabis use to more extensive cognitive alterations. However, significant inconsistencies exist across studies. \nMethod: In this cross-sectional study, we examined associations between cannabis use and cognitive performance across a broad range of cognitive tests (including a new test of visuo-spatial abilities, The Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test) in a sample of 109 Danes aged 15-26 with varying risk of developing harmful cannabis use and varying levels of current use. Cannabis use was evaluated using the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test-Revised (CUDIT-R) and questions on recent use (past 30 days) and age of onset. Cognitive performance was assessed using subtests from WAIS-IV, WMS-III, and the Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test. \nResults: Findings show a negative association between recent cannabis use and specific cognitive functions of working memory and visual memory, while the CUDIT-R was not associated with cognitive functions. \nConclusion: Our findings nuance previous findings by suggesting differences in vulnerability across cognitive domains, while providing the first evidence of a negative association between recent cannabis use and visual memory based on visuo-spatial functions without requiring visuo-constructive abilities (Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test). Furthermore, findings suggest that past-month use may be a more relevant measure than CUDIT-R when evaluating cognitive correlates of cannabis use in youth. This has implications for treatment and preventive interventions in this age group.",

Methods: Using a large UK-based longitudinal study, the Millennium Cohort Study (n=9551; 129 treated and 129 matched controls), and leveraging a wide range of matching variables we used counterfactual analyses to examine the effects of school exclusion at age 11 on emotional problems, conduct problems, ADHD symptoms, peer problems and prosociality at age 14, accounting for confounding. Results: We found that young people who experienced school exclusion had significantly worse scores at age 14 on all of these outcomes. The use of propensity score matching (including matching on prior behavioural problems) strengthens confidence in the idea that the effects are causal. Conclusions: Results point to the need for policies oriented towards reducing school exclusions and ensuring mitigating measures are in place to minimise its impact on those who experience it.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance declines across the lifespan, partly due to greater vulnerability to environmental distraction. WM requires resistance to distractors, which may enter WM due to ineffective filtering during simultaneous presentation with targets, as in a spatial array during WM encoding. Alternatively, distractors may enter WM due to insufficient ability to ignore them when they are presented during WM maintenance. Current research disagrees about whether a deficit in distractor suppression accounts for older adults’ impaired WM performance, or not. Beyond these differing perspectives, it is unclear whether WM performance is vulnerable to different types of distractors, including those that are novel versus familiar, or high versus low saliency. Across three behavioral experiments we found that participants were more vulnerable to distractors presented during encoding than those presented during maintenance, with stronger effects in older adults. Distractor familiarity and saliency had minimal impact on WM performance, and patterns of results did not change across trials. Rather than providing converging evidence these data expand the pattern of distractor-related WM deficits observed in older adults.",

In this study, we employ two versions of the Japanese remote associates test (RAT) (n= 349 and 105 participants, respectively), alongside a simulation model, allowing us to quantitatively manipulate the constraints imposed on the problem and to track the search process within the semantic space. Our findings indicate that the insight and the accompanying Aha moment are characterized by exploration that spans greater distances within the solution space, thereby increases the number of potential solutions available for evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Everyday decision-making often involves choosing between multiple alternatives, and establishing unified theories for this process would benefit broad disciplines of behavioral science. A key challenge lies in explaining behavioral irrationalities that specifically arise in multi-alternative decisions. This study, based on pre-registered procedures, investigated such non-normative behaviors in a three-choice dot numerosity discrimination task. We systematically manipulated the value of the lowest-numerosity alternative (the dud stimulus) and quantified its non-normative effects on choice, response time, and confidence. We then explained observed irrational behaviors with a sequential evidence accumulation model featuring a “max vs. next” decision algorithm. This pseudo-optimal decision-making rule naturally captured a well-known non-normative choice pattern: the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Our model also explained a multi-choice metacognitive bias, known as the dud-alternative confidence boost, by considering evidence accumulation dynamics right after stimulus presentation. By uncovering the computational processes behind these non-normative multi-choice behaviors, this study represents a significant advancement in understanding the core principles of decision-making.",

Experimental findings are often precise and simple but may lack breadth, while concepts that are broad and simple frequently sacrifice precision. Developing a theory that is both precise and broad requires added complexity, a challenge intensified by a human preference for simplicity and certainty. To address this, a theory-oriented, data-driven comprehensive exploration approach is proposed. This approach involves conducting a large-scale experiment with tens of millions of observations, followed by the development of a moderately complex computational model that aims to integrate all relevant factors for the research question. A similar strategy has driven breakthroughs in artificial intelligence over the past two decades, suggesting it could yield similar advancements in psychology.

Multivariate machine learning techniques, such as sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression, offer potential solutions by identifying combinations of variables that best explain variance in outcomes.\n\nIn the current study (N = 55), we used sPLS to identify linear combinations of brain networks (“brain signatures”) at age 6 years that maximally covaried with internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) measured at age 7.5 years, before identifying microbe abundances (“microbial profiles”) at age 2 years that maximally covaried with those brain signatures. Finally, we tested whether any microbiome features  (microbial profiles or alpha diversity)  were indirectly associated with internalizing symptoms via the brain signatures. We found that microbes in the Clostridiales order and Lachnospiraceae family were associated with internalizing symptoms in middle childhood through alterations in connectivity within emotion-related brain networks.",

Our objective in this research was to rely on the MEP to further our understanding of athlete perfectionism on two key points. First, we focussed on a scale designed to measure dispositional perfectionism and excellencism – the Scale of Perfectionism and Excellencism (SCOPE) – and tested the factor structure of an adapted version of the SCOPE for athletes (SCOPE-A). Second, we addressed the substantive question of whether perfectionism, beyond excellencism, is beneficial, unneeded, or harmful for athletes’ thriving (i.e., experiencing high levels of well-being and performance satisfaction). We analyzed data collected across four samples of athletes (total N = 1,549). The results of confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses provided evidence to support the factor structure of scores from the SCOPE-A, and the conclusion that, when it comes to athlete thriving, perfectionism is almost always unneeded and excellencism is almost always good enough. These results shed new light on the connection between excellencism, perfectionism, and athlete thriving, and contribute to future research examining the effects of excellencism and perfectionism in athletes using the SCOPE-A.",

In this registered report, we applied computational modeling to human behavior on a novel version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to predict behavior on a spatial navigation task in which the navigator must either exploit a learned, familiar route or explore a new shortcut. If the hypothesis that risk tolerance is a domain general trait is correct, we predicted that explore-exploit patterns would correlate across these tasks. We also examine the predictive power of computational models for the IGT on behavioral uncertainty and the role of confidence in spatial navigation strategy.  Our findings suggest that, while there is some overlap in risk tolerance between spatial navigation and gambling, the influence of exploration and exploitation on navigational decision-making is weaker than initially predicted.",

Both latter conditions are usually not mentioned in the literature among consequences of physical abuse. Furthermore, the maltreatment can modify manifestations of affective disorders. Prolonged maltreatment can induce psychiatric abnormalities also in initially healthy individuals, in particular, paranoid ideations. Children and adolescents regularly punished for hyperactivity or other behaviors, regarded by perpetrators to be undesirable, would discontinue these behaviors but start adaptive or maladaptive conduct that may be more or less compatible with autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Repetitive binge drinking can be compulsive. Besides, loitering with drinking companies is a way of escape from domestic violence. It is known that autistic persons tend to avoid socialization. However, in conditions of collectivism and a pressure to be “normal” like everyone, individuals with communication abnormalities would have strong motives to contact with peers to avoid stigmatization. Alcohol consumption and, in particular, binge drinking is a method to overcome communication barriers. In doing so, the individuals often forget that excessive alcohol consumption may cause health problems.",

Our study explored the potential association between cognitive impairments and early subsyndromal psychiatric symptoms in at-risk youths from a transdiagnostic perspective. We analyzed 970 at-risk youth (aged nine to ten) with 970 matched controls from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and found they performed worse in some cognitive domains and exhibited more psychiatric symptoms than controls. Our multivariate analyses revealed a pattern most strongly linking emotional dysfunction symptoms and cognitive language abilities in at-risk youth, suggesting a link between cognitive impairment in at-risk youth and a higher prevalence of early psychiatric symptoms. Such association could potentially guide prediction, prevention and early intervention for children who are more at risk of developing mental illness later in life.",

However, a mechanistic cognitive science framework for understanding how it transforms mental processing is still needed. The act of practicing meditation involves trying to be deliberately conscious of a target content. This requires monitoring the contents of one’s consciousness and regulating them in favor of the target. I propose, this involves a metacognitive template of the target being present in consciousness, which when compared to the actual conscious content generates a “metacognitive prediction error” (MPE). MPE leads to efficient regulation of conscious content by helping fine-tune the frequency of monitoring, downstream unconscious processing, and the metacognitive template itself.

Experiment 2 suggested that these two senses of badassness reflect outer toughness (e.g., physical strength and a formidable presence) versus inner toughness (e.g., moral resilience and courage). Experiments 3-4 explored the qualities that make a person tough “on the inside,” revealing effects of overcoming social pressure, doing the morally right thing, taking on difficult challenges, and succeeding in one’s efforts. Overall, in addition to clarifying this particular concept, our findings contribute to more general, theoretical work on dual-character concepts and offer insight into the use of dual-character concepts in social cognition.",

          "abstract": "The human visual system can recognise familiar forms, most notably faces, in other objects or patterns, a phenomenon known as pareidolia. The patterns that elicit pareidolia range from meaningful to ambiguous and random images, making it hard to generalise across the featural or configurational properties that trigger different types of pareidolia. Here, we aim to characterise the minimal stimuli associated with different types of pareidolia and investigate the extent to which pareidolia is tuned to variations in natural scene statistics and symmetry.  Participants in the current study viewed a range of synthetic noise patterns varying in their spatiotemporal spectral and symmetry characteristics and reported any shapes or structure perceived in these patterns. The patterns with spatiotemporal properties typical of natural scenes generated the highest number of responses with more animate, rather than inanimate, forms overall. While faces were the most reported animacy-related percept, responses covered a wide range of animate agents including animals and mythical creatures. The greatest number and the highest proportion of animacy-related percepts were observed in vertically symmetrical patterns compared to other types of pattern symmetry. Together, the current study establishes that pareidolia is tuned to natural scene statistics and biased towards animate forms, especially in patterns with vertical symmetry. It also demonstrates the usefulness of synthetic noise stimuli for pareidolia research.",

          "abstract": "Although factor models have been pivotal in understanding the relations among variables, they are difficult to apply to data from experimental designs. In experiments, data are from trials which are nested in conditions, tasks, and individuals. Data at the trial level is quite noisy, so much so that even averages on critical contrasts are subject to excessive measurement error. In this paper, we develop hierarchical factor models where the first level are linear models that account for trial noise and are parameterized with separate, latent individual-by-task scores. The second level consists of factor models on latent individual-by-task scores. Because the model is hierarchical, Bayesian analysis is convenient and conceptually straightforward. We provide development with good computational properties. The advatages of the model are that (a) correlations across tasks may be both disattenuated and localized fairly precisely; (b) uncertainty from both variability in individuals and across trials may be accurately assessed; and (c) factor structures may be recovered even in high-measurement-error contexts. Applications to visual illusions and to cognitive control are included.",

          "abstract": "Dissociation, an altered state of consciousness in which individuals feel detached from their body, environment, and sense of self, is a common feature of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Despite its significance, the neurocognitive processes underlying dissociation remain poorly understood, potentially limiting the effectiveness of PTSD diagnostics and treatment. To address this gap, we apply network control theory to examine neural dynamics corresponding to dissociative states in two contexts: intravenous ketamine administration, an anesthetic known to induce dissociative states (n=30, healthy volunteers), and therapeutic interventions in PTSD patients expected to alleviate dissociative symptoms (n=78). Ketamine administration led to brain dynamics resembling those observed in PTSD patients pre-treatment, with increased dominance of a default mode network meta-state and decreased dominance of a somatomotor meta-state. While ketamine did not significantly alter the brain's energetic landscape, transition energies increased post-treatment in PTSD patients, potentially indicating more organized and less entropic brain dynamics.",

          "abstract": "In the last two decades, individual differences have been widely examined from a person-oriented approach which tends to classify individuals into personality types based on their unique configurations of personality traits. Previous typological studies have explored the consistency of personality profiles by varying different methodological factors (e.g., sample characteristics, personality theoretical frameworks, personality assessment methods, and data analysis methods). The aim of the study was to explore the replicability of personality profiles based on three major personality models (Big Five, HEXACO, and Tellegen’s model) across two large SAPA (Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment) datasets. Data analysis included the following steps: model-based clustering, profile similarity assessment, evaluation of class replicability, and comparison of merged classes’ profiles in both samples. Four robust personality types re-emerged within the Big Five domain, three from Tellegen’s model and three from the HEXACO model. However, in the case of the Big Five and Tellegen’s models, the results demonstrated congruence with previous findings, whereas HEXACO results showed little evidence of class/profile robustness. This exploratory study highlights the importance of personality profiles in personality assessment which could be further investigated with new data sources such as SAPA and advanced statistical tools.",

          "abstract": "Western tonal music uses harmonic cadences as structural and syntactic markers. This study examines cadence perception regarding the role of pre-cadential and cadential mode congruence. Major-to-minor and minor-to-major mode shifts that occur in Parallel-Mode Tonic (PMT) and Deceptive cadences were of interest, with the former including a key change. 61 adults with varied musical training rated arousal, valence, and degree of completion (DOC) for four cadence types (Authentic, PMT, Deceptive, and Neapolitan) in two pre-cadential modes (major or minor). Arousal ratings did not vary much across all cadence types and mode variations. In contrast, valence perception was predominantly influenced by the pre-cadential mode with major mode receiving higher ratings, and DOC perception further correlated with the final chord’s within-context tonal stability. Importantly, the perception of PMT cadences was unique in that the mode of the final tonic chord became far more important in both valence and DOC ratings, pointing to privileged and distinct perceptual processing when mode shifts resolve on a tonic chord, especially of major mode (i.e., Picardy Third). Musical training manifested as significantly enhanced rating tendencies which were most apparent for DOC. The results substantially extend our understanding of the interactive nature of modes, tonality, and expertise in music perception.",

          "abstract": "Human decision-making favors approach behavior to gain rewards and avoidance behavior to prevent punishment. While adaptive in some cases, this Pavlovian bias can also interfere with instrumental motivation, leading to suboptimal decisions. As maladaptive avoidance is a known maintenance factor in anxiety and depression, this could be especially relevant to individuals with these disorders. To assess whether Pavlovian bias is altered in this population, we examined 106 healthy comparisons (HCs), 88 individuals with depression (Dep), and 184 with comorbid anxiety and depression (AnxDep) using an Orthogonalized Go/No-Go Task. Participants’ choices and reaction times were modeled using a reinforcement learning and drift diffusion model (RL-DDM). As expected, results showed that accuracy was highest when Pavlovian and instrumental biases aligned and lowest when they conflicted. Linear models revealed no group differences in accuracy, reaction times, or any of the computational parameters. However, within the AnxDep group, Pavlovian bias was positively associated with depression severity and other affective symptoms, such as rumination and anxiety sensitivity. Consistent with this, levels of depression, rumination, and anxiety sensitivity in this group were each also negatively associated with accuracy on the task when approach actions were required to avoid punishment. These results suggest that Pavlovian bias may contribute to symptom severity within affective disorders by suppressing approach behaviors when they would be adaptive – potentially amplifying the avoidance behaviors known to maintain these disorders.",

However, established cortisol stress response indicators such as area under the curve (AUC) are inherently affected by sampling timing and duration, although to what extent remains unknown. Here, we leveraged a large, combined dataset (STRESS-EU; n=1,295) to develop novel model-based indicators that can accommodate variability in sampling schedules. These were based on modelled individual response curves that achieve full data inter- and extrapolation. We validated this method with simulated and independent data. Crucially, combined data simulations particularly showed higher accuracy for model-based versus conventional ‘observation-based’ AUC indicators with variability in sampling duration. In conclusion, our novel method harmonizes cortisol response indicator estimates for combined data, yielding opportunities for IPD meta-analyses of acute stress test studies that could greatly advance the field.",

          "authors": "Noel Danford Maturlu",
          "abstract": "Bliss, akin to flourishing, represents a holistic state of optimal well-being that transcends fleeting happiness, encompassing physical, emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions. It goes beyond mere survival, integrating physical, economic, social, mental, and spiritual well-being, extending into eternity. At its core is a divine essence rooted in a secure, personal relationship with a benevolent God. This connection forms the foundation for four core virtues: Linkedness, Opulence, Valory, and Equanimity—acronymised as LOVE.\nLinkedness emphasizes secure relationships founded on acceptance and belonging, fostering connections with God, others, and the cosmatos—the universal interdependent world. Opulence highlights a secure sense of provision and achievement, ensuring access to essential resources and affirming one’s capacity to achieve personal and collective goals. Valory focuses on meaning and engagement, encouraging participation in purposeful activities that benefit oneself and others. Equanimity embodies tranquillity and resilience, promoting contentment through gratitude and growth through adversity, sustained by faith and hope.\nThe LOVE Model is the first relational psychological framework of bliss, integrating the transformative roles of attachment, spirituality (attachment to the divine), and adversity. It underscores agape—selfless, unconditional divine love—as the primary source of the LOVE virtues and the essential foundation for bliss (Thayer &amp; Smith, 2016). Unlike models that rely on ethical principles or human effort, the LOVE Model highlights the transformative power of a secure spiritual attachment to God, fostering virtues that enable holistic well-being.\nInnovatively, the model introduces Differential Bliss Receptibility (DBR), which suggests that adversity heightens spiritual sensitivity, enabling individuals to transform adversity into growth, ultimately, bliss. By framing adversity as a catalyst for flourishing and emphasising secure divine attachment, the LOVE Model bridges psychology and spirituality, offering a transcendent, adaptable framework for well-being across diverse contexts.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the moderating effects of positive and negative religious coping on the relationship between spirituality and flourishing in individuals facing high adversity. The research addresses a gap in existing literature predominantly focused on WEIRD populations. The study employed multiple regression analyses and bootstrapping techniques to evaluate these relationships. The findings reveal that positive coping significantly enhances the positive relationship between spirituality and flourishing, particularly under high-stress conditions, whereas negative coping exacerbates stress, diminishing well-being. Specifically, high spirituality combined with positive coping strategies resulted in greater flourishing despite high-stress levels. Conversely, negative coping undermined these benefits. The implications underscore the importance of fostering positive coping mechanisms alongside spiritual practices to promote resilience and well-being. This study supports the existential positive psychology framework, emphasising the role of suffering in authentic well-being and aligning with the concept of complementarity in second-wave positive psychology.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the role of adversity and suffering, specifically operationalised as stress, in the relationship between spirituality and flourishing. The investigation focuses on both the mediating and moderating effects of stress in this context. The sample comprises 468 participants aged 17 to 34 years (mean age = 21.55, SD = 1.99), predominantly Christian (n = 314) and Muslim (n = 152). Gender distribution includes 213 females and 271 males. Most participants (n = 409) reported similarity to their religious group, with varied educational backgrounds for their parents and themselves. Descriptive statistics provided an overview of central tendencies and dispersions of the key variables. A correlation matrix assessed the relationships between spirituality, stress, and flourishing, revealing a weak but significant negative correlation between spirituality and stress, a weak but significant positive correlation between spirituality and flourishing, and a moderate, highly significant negative correlation between stress and flourishing.\nThe mediation analysis demonstrated that stress partially mediates the relationship between spirituality and flourishing. Higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower stress, which in turn was linked to higher flourishing. Moderation analysis indicated that stress does not significantly moderate the overall relationship between spirituality and flourishing. However, subgroup analysis showed a significant and positive interaction between spirituality and stress on flourishing in the high-spirituality, high-stress subgroup. This finding implies that for individuals with high spirituality, increased stress levels may enhance their sense of flourishing. These nuanced effects were further substantiated by 3D visualisation and robust bootstrapping estimates.\nThe results suggest that while spirituality generally reduces suffering and promotes flourishing, highly spiritual individuals might derive additional flourishing benefits under intense suffering. These insights have practical implications for integrating spiritual practices into stress management and therapeutic interventions, and they underscore the need for future research to explore these dynamics in diverse populations and longitudinal studies.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to systematically examine the positive effects of adversity on the relationship between religiosity, spirituality, and depression. The search for studies involved 7 databases (via EBSCOhost), involving studies of the past 23 years from the year 2000 to 2022. The general search included keywords such as religion, religiosity, spirituality, adversity, stressful life experiences, and depression. Data was synthesised using a narrative synthesis approach. The extracted data were coded and grouped into themes, revealing relationships between adversity, religiosity, spirituality, and depression. The themes concerning contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes were then synthesised to identify emerging contexts and outcomes. The review found that, despite posing the risk of psychological distress in the short term, adversity could provide differential spiritual receptivity: a long-term morphological advantage for spiritual receptivity, growth and mental resilience. The protective effects of spirituality against depression (by significantly reducing the onset of depression and diminishing the probability of episode relapses) appear more significant in people who experience severe adversity. In contrast, religiosity appears more potent in individuals who experience less severe adversity. The research and clinical practice implications of these findings are also discussed.\n\n\nKeywords: religiosity, spirituality, depression, adversity, suffering, differential spiritual receptivity",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how artists integrate artificial intelligence into their creative practices, using Material Engagement Theory (MET) as an analytical framework. MET provides a lens through which AI can be understood as a responsive material that actively contributes to the artistic processes. Through an analysis of 18 eminent artists’ practices in which AI is structurally used, we explore four key MET concepts: radical continuity, creative thinging, enactive discovery, and attentive unity. This approach allows us to examine AI as an active material within a co-creative process, where artists and AI discover and use each other’s affordances, thus reaching a state of unity and co-agency. AI's capacity for unexpected outputs emerges as a central feature of the co-creative process, with artists leveraging serendipity to reveal novel artistic directions. This research contributes to understanding AI’s evolving role in art, positioning MET as a valuable framework for examining the intersection between serendipity, co-agency, and materiality within the co-creative process. By acknowledging AI as a responsive material, this study reveals new directions for exploring the co-creative processes underlying AI use in art.",

          "authors": "Thomas Mangin; Benjamin Pageaux",
          "abstract": "Fatigue is a phenomenon with implications at the individual level, causing daily perturbations for each of us. Fatigue also has societal implications, as economic costs and death have each been attributed to fatigue. To be studied accurately, it is crucial to distinguish the term fatigue from related terms such as boredom or sleepiness. The terminology “passive” fatigue is often used in the literature. However, “passive” fatigue is a broad term that is not specific to the task(s) used to induce fatigue. Indeed, the term passive fatigue is semantically incorrect as participants performing a fatiguing task are active and not passive. Moreover, the fatiguing tasks used to induce “passive” fatigue are typically monotonous, and induce boredom and sleepiness. In laboratory tasks, participants persevere in boring tasks in the presence of sleepiness, inhibiting their dominant response to disengage from the ongoing task, thus inducing cognitive fatigue or an ego-depletion effect. The boredom and sleepiness induced by the tasks used to induce “passive” fatigue likely explain the observed effects in the literature. It is therefore necessary to rely on solid theories, have accurate definitions regarding what is being studied, and have objective and subjective measures of the phenomenon of interest. In this context, we propose that researchers interested in the “passive” fatigue phenomenon systematically monitor fatigue, boredom and sleepiness; and refer to the concept of “fatigue induced by [name of task]” (e.g., fatigue induced by the Mackworth's clock) and avoid proliferating the generic and insufficiently precise term, “passive” fatigue.",

          "abstract": "During the anti-alcohol campaign in the former Soviet Union (1985-1989), consumption of inexpensive colognes and technical alcohol-containing liquids was widespread. Drinking of non-beverage alcohol decreased abruptly after the campaign, when vodka and beer became readily available and inexpensive. Alcohol consumption predictably increased after the campaign. The upsurge in alcohol consumption facilitated economical reforms of the early 1990s: workers did not oppose privatization of factories partly thanks to their drunkenness. Following abolition of the state alcohol monopoly in 1992, the country was flooded by beverages of poor quality, sold through legally operating shops and kiosks, which caused severe poisonings. Thereafter, the quality of beverages has improved while the consumption tended to decrease. Besides, several aspects of treatment including invasive procedures applied with questionable indications are discussed here. A concluding point is that the society should care of its weaker members, including those suffering of alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related dementia, because they can be maltreated, abused and expropriated. In regard to the future research, toxicity of some alcoholic beverages sold in Russia is of particular importance. Of note, the military and medical ethics are not the same. The comparatively short life expectancy in Russia is a strategic advantage as it necessitates less healthcare investments and pensions. Apparently, this has been a motive of the unethical attitude to persons supposed to have alcohol use disorder, discussed in this chapter.",

Formulas were categorized into three mutually exclusive types by their marketing labels: standard (n=31), gentle (n=27), and lactose-free (n=15). The proportion of added sugars from each type of sugar were calculated, as was the percent of naturally occurring lactose. Differences across formula types were examined using Bayesian modeling. \nResults: The median percent added sugars was high in standard (M=59.7%; IQR=22.0), gentle (M=85.0%; IQR=39.5), and lactose-free formulas (M=90.0%; IQR=54.3).

While genetic factors are important influences on mental health, few studies have used symptom-level analyses to examine how genetic liability is related to maternal mental health. A symptom-level approach can account for disorder heterogeneity and delineate key associations between genetic liabilities and mental health, improving current understanding of how genetic risk is related to the experience of specific mental health problems.\n\nObjective\nTo examine associations between genetic liabilities to depression, anxiety, neuroticism and positive affect, and maternal mental health phenotypes (i.e., symptoms of anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect) across the perinatal period and first years of motherhood using a network analysis approach. \n\nDesign, setting, and participants\nThree waves of data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) were used to assess item-level associations. Sample sizes ranged from 46,537 to 59,308 mothers. Networks were separately estimated for each polygenic score (PGS) and each wave of measurement: at 30 weeks of gestation, 6 months postpartum, and 18 months postpartum. \n\nMain outcomes and measures\nSymptoms of anxiety and depression experienced in the last two weeks from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist and items measuring positive and negative affect (i.e., components of emotional functioning) in daily life from the Differential Emotions Scale. Four PGSs, indexing genetic liability to depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and positive affect, were included in separate networks.\n\nResults\nPGSs exhibited both phenotype-specific associations (e.g., depression PGS linked with hopelessness, anxiety PGS linked with worry) and cross-phenotype (e.g., depression PGS linked with nervousness, positive affect PGS inversely related to anxiety and depressive symptoms) relationships, with partial correlations ranging between r = -0.025 and r = 0.024. Items measuring mental health were strongly interrelated at each wave, in particular within symptom clusters and among emotional functioning items. Some PGS-phenotype associations were consistent (e.g., depression PGS linked with feeling like screaming or banging on something across all waves) and others inconsistent (e.g., anxiety PGS linked with nervousness only at 6 months postpartum) across the perinatal and postpartum periods.\n\nConclusions and relevance\nOur findings highlight symptom-level associations between PGSs and maternal mental health, which may be obscured when global measures of mental health (e.g., overall scores) are used. Identifying symptom-specific PGS associations could advance current understanding of aetiological influences on maternal mental health.",

Since the amount of responses in a timeframe is limited, high measurement precision is unattainable using only accuracies, which calls for the inclusion of other data sources into the measurement. Here, we propose algorithms that can estimate the abilities on-the-fly based on both accuracy and response times (RT). These are extensions of a rating system called the Urnings algorithm. Since the Urnings algorithm uses discrete updates, building on the difference between a single observed and simulated response, we combined accuracy and RT into a continuous score using a discretised version of the Signed Residual Time (SRT) scoring rule. Through simulation studies, we showed that by augmenting the algorithm with RT, a reliable ability measure and better ability tracking can be obtained by administering fewer items. By reanalysing data from an existing ALS we showed that the algorithms can be utilised even if the SRT scoring rule is not explicitly used during measurement, providing better ability estimates and smaller prediction errors.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed disorders in psychiatric settings. Beyond the categorical diagnosis, borderline personality traits (BPT) are common in the general population and vary along a continuum from mild to severe. While prior research has reported functional connectivity alterations in the Default Mode Network (DMN), the Salience Network (SN), and the Central-Executive Network (CEN) in patients with BPD, the compromission of these networks in subclinical BPT remain underexplored. To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity alterations associated with BPT in a subclinical population. We expect to find abnormal connectivity inside the Default mode network, the Salience network and in regions ascribed to mentalization processes associated with BPT. We also expect these networks to be associated with psychological symptoms experienced by borderline patients such as impulsivity and anger issues, lack of self-control and neuroticism among others. An unsupervised machine learning method known as Group-ICA, was applied to the resting state fMRI images of 200 individuals to predict BPT from the temporal variability of independent macro networks. Results indicated abnormal dynamic functional connectivity inside the salience network including areas implicated in emotional reactivity and sensitivity, and in network that partially overlap with the DMN and that includes regions involved in social cognition and mind reading, were associated with borderline traits. Specifically, the higher BPT, the higher the temporal variability inside the SN, and the lower the temporal variability in a network that includes DMN and mentalization regions. Notably, the BOLD variability of the SN correlated with neuroticism, anger problems, lack of self-control, and distorted inner dialogue, all symptoms displayed by individuals with borderline personality. These findings indicate that abnormalities in resting state networks are visible in subclinical populations with varying degrees of borderline traits, with impaired mentalization and salience networks and may pave the way for designing interventions to prevent the development of the full disorder.",

          "abstract": "Our visual environment often overwhelms us with more information than we can process. We can, however, enhance our processing efficiency by leveraging inherent regularities in the environment, such as prioritizing likely target objects over unlikely ones. Although there is evidence that statistical learning improves visual working memory performance, it is unclear whether this improvement occurs through stimulus prevalence or task relevance. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we examined whether frequent appearance or frequent probing of stimuli (or both) contributes to improvements in visual working memory recall. Participants were asked to recall and replicate the orientation of one of two previously presented Gabors as precisely as possible. In two experiments, we manipulated (1) stimulus prevalence by presenting Gabors more frequently on one side (either left or right), and (2) task relevance by probing Gabors more frequently on one side (either left or right). We found comparable orientation recall performance for to-be-remembered stimuli appearing at probable versus improbable locations, which suggests that regularities in stimulus prevalence did not improve memory recall. Contrastingly, we found better recall for stimuli appearing at locations that were more versus less likely to be probed. Specifically, task relevance enhanced working memory recall, both by reducing the number of categorical errors (e.g., misremembering a vertical-oriented Gabor as a horizontal one) and by increasing fine-grained recall precision (i.e., reducing minor variances in recall for memorized items). These findings highlight that statistical learning of task relevance, but not of stimulus prevalence, enhances visual working memory recall performance.",

          "abstract": "Background: Imagery rescripting (ImRs) and imaginal exposure (IE) are both effective for treating distressing memories. ImRs is thought to promote mastery and positive memory revaluation, while emotion tolerance is seen as a key factor in exposure models. This study investigated emotional responses and PTSD analogue symptoms in an analogue design and explored mastery and emotion tolerance as potential mediators. \nMethods: 154 participants (46.8% male) selected a distressing autobiographical event and received a brief analogue of ImRs or IE, delivered via pre-recorded audio instructions, or a control condition. Emotional responses, distress, PTSD analogue symptoms, sense of mastery and emotion tolerance were assessed before and after memory reactivation and post-intervention. \nResults: Mixed-effects analysis indicated unique positive changes in self-conscious and positive emotions as well as sense of mastery following ImRs – but only in males, whereas females improved across all conditions. In contrast, IE led to significantly different increases in anger and memory distress. Changes in fear, distress, PTSD analogue symptoms and emotion tolerance did not differ across conditions. Multiple parallel mediation analyses yielded that mastery, but not tolerance, mediated positive emotional shifts in ImRs. There was no evidence to support emotion tolerance as a mechanism of change in IE. \nConclusion: Our results cautiously support the hypothesis that ImRs leads to positive memory revaluation but not that emotion tolerance mediates changes in IE. We discuss possible explanations for the gender differences and point out shortcomings in procedure and measurement that may explain the unexpected findings in IE.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Previous studies report cross-sectional associations between harmful gambling and suicidality, but longitudinal evidence is scarce. In a young UK adult cohort, we aimed to investigate whether harmful gambling as measured by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) would be associated with concurrent and future suicide attempts. Hierarchical models explored whether associations were robust to controls for adolescent suicidality and relevant confounders.\nDesign: A birth cohort study of the UK general population.\nSetting: Avon, UK.\nParticipants: n=2,801 (62.4% female) participants with data for suicidality at 24 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).\nMeasurements: Past-year non-fatal suicide attempt prevalence was self-reported at 24- and 25-years (in 2017-2018). PGSI was measured at 20- and 24-years. Measured confounders were sex, maternal education, economic activity (employment/education status), hyperactivity, alcohol disorder likelihood, and adolescent suicidality.\nFindings: Past-year suicide attempt prevalence was 2.57% at 24-years, and 1.86% at 25- years. Confounder-adjusted models found that PGSI predicted suicide attempts at 24-years (Odds Ratio [OR]=1.13, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05–1.21, p=.001), and predicted future suicide attempts over one-year (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.06–1.25, p=.001), and four-year timespans (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.08–1.34, p&lt;.001), but there was inconclusive evidence of this association over five-years (OR=1.14, 95% CI 0.995–1.31, p=.058). There was no clear evidence that increases in PGSI scores between 20- and 24-years predict suicide attempts at 24 years (OR=1.69, 95% CI 0.72–3.99, p=.230). \nConclusions: PGSI scores were associated with suicide attempts, however, this association may be more complex long-term, and increases in PGSI during adulthood may not be an important factor.\nKeywords: Gambling-related harm, Suicide attempts, PGSI, ALSPAC, Longitudinal",

Currently, little is known about childhood predictors for these outcomes.\n\nMethod\nPubMed, PsychInfo, and WoS were searched up until May 2024. Eligible studies investigated childhood predictors of persistent ADHD, substance use disorders (SUD), conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and/or anxiety disorders in adults diagnosed with childhood ADHD (PROSPERO #XXXX). Meta-analytic models were tested when N ≥3 for a predictor with similar effect measures, otherwise predictors were discussed narratively when N ≥2. \n\nResults\nFrom 35 studies 115 predictors were included, with 10 predictors eligible for meta-analysis.\nChildhood ADHD-related impairment (OR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.02-4.27, p = .045) and history of stimulant treatment (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35, p =.003) increased the risk of ADHD persistence in adulthood. ADHD persistence increased the risk of SUDs (OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.66-3.39, p &lt; .001) and MDD (OR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.85-5.22, p &lt; .001).

Participants completed the WSSQ, The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS 2.0), Emotional Eating and Restrained Eating subscales from The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale – 21 (DASS-21) and sociodemographic survey.\nThe Polish WSSQ showed good overlap with the original structure in the two-factor model (Self-devaluation and Fear of Enacted Stigma). Factor loadings were satisfactory and both subscales showed good internal consistency. Measurement invariance revealed gender differences in the WSSQ score. The construct validity was confirmed with strong correlations with emotional eating and food addiction. As expected, the WSSQ total score was moderately positively associated with depression and stress severity. The correlations were the weakest for retrained eating and body mass index.  \nThe Polish WSSQ is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of weight-related self-stigma among patients with overweight/obesity. Future studies should investigate the gender differences as well as the test-retest reliability and longitudinal invariance.

          "abstract": "By the end of the first year, infants use others' emotions to interpret events, integrate social cues and build expectations on how people should behave (e.g., through social referencing). Yet, little is known about the neural correlates of linking others' emotions to their following actions. This priming study investigates 10-month-olds' electrophysiological (EEG) responses to happy and disgusted emotional displays toward novel objects (prime) and subsequent actions (pushing away or pulling closer the objects; target). Event-related potentials from 30 infants showed distinct neural markers associated with emotional processing of the prime, such as heightened early attentional response (Nc) and greater cognitive processing (Pc) in response to happiness over disgust. The target action of pushing away an object, especially following happiness, elicited increased slow wave activity, revealing working memory updating. Additionally, a significant mu-rhythm desynchronization, indicating motor resonance, was observed for the action of pulling objects closer when preceded by happiness. These findings indicate that by 10 months, infants attend to emotional cues and use these cues to form predictions about subsequent actions. These neural correlates of bridging emotions and actions before 12 months of life reveal, for the first time, early neural specialization for processing social cues in complex contexts.",

          "abstract": "Humans use similar brain systems to both imagine and perceive. While the re-use of brain systems specialised for sensory perception for offline simulation is an efficient use of resources, it also leads to a potential for confusions between imagination and reality. It remains unknown how human observers classify perceptual signals as reflecting external reality, as opposed to internal simulation or imagination. Here we show that judgments of reality are underpinned by a latent variable that encodes the combined strength of sensory signals generated by either imagery or perception. We use functional magnetic resonance imagining to reveal that this latent variable is tracked by the activity of bilateral fusiform gyrus and predicts confusions between imagery and perception on a trial-by-trial basis. We further characterise interactions between fusiform gyrus and a network of prefrontal regions encoding binary judgments of reality, in line with higher-order theories of reality monitoring. Our results demonstrate that a key mechanism through which the brain distinguishes imagination from reality is by monitoring fluctuations in the activity of mid-level sensory cortex. These findings increase our understanding of failures of reality testing such as hallucinations and lay the foundations for characterising a generalised reality monitoring system in the human brain.",

          "abstract": "The work proposes a set of hypotheses organized in a working model of the nature of consciousness and its relation with neural activity. Briefly, we suggest that consciousness, as a fundamental property of matter, corresponds to the differentiation of unitary portions of matter-energy from the rest of the space-time continuum in the basic form of waves, with their energy variation and spatio-temporal borders reflecting in the quality and spatio-temporal borders of experience. We then assume that the brain represents a unique generator of oscillations with complex spatio-temporal configurations that can produce transient events of synchronized neural activity across distributed cortical sensory areas (modulated by receptor stimulation and associative areas’ activity). Each event of neuronal synchronization might generate a large-scale wave, i.e., a unitary field perturbation, which integrates and differentially amplifies elemental and independent waves (where and when they appear) into a unitary portion of matter, manifesting as a frame of conscious experience. Accordingly, for each frame of conscious experience, the quantity of consciousness might be defined by the physical dimension of the unitary large-scale wave in the environmental field, while the quality of consciousness might be defined by the physical form of such large-scale wave along with its internal composition in elemental waves. This working model might provide a novel framework, along with testable predictions, for developing a wave theory of consciousness.",

          "authors": "Margot Belguise; yuchen huang; Zhexun Mo; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Recent experimental evidence contends that meritocratic ideals are mainly a Western phenomenon. Intriguingly, the Chinese public does not appear to differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, despite China’s historical emphasis on meritocratic institutions. We propose that this phenomenon could be due to the Chinese public’s greater reluctance to make an active choice in real-stake redistribution decisions. We run an incentivized redistribution experiment with elite university students in China and France, by varying the initial split of payoffs between two real-life workers to redistribute from. We show that, compared to French respondents, Chinese respondents consistently and significantly choose more non-redistribution across both highly unequal and relatively equal status quo scenarios. Additionally, we also find that Chinese respondents do differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, and do not redistribute less than the French, excluding the individuals who engage in non-redistribution choices. Chinese respondents are also as reactive as the French towards scenarios with noisy signals of merit, such as inequalities of opportunities. Ultimately, we contend that the reluctance to make an active choice is indicative of diminished political agency to act upon redistribution decisions with real-life stakes, rather than apathy, inattention, having benefited from the status quo in Chinese society or libertarian preferences among the Chinese. Notably, our findings show that Chinese individuals’ reluctance to make a choice is particularly pronounced among those from families of working-class and farming backgrounds, while it is absent among individuals whose families have closer ties to the private sector.

          "abstract": "When conducting quantitative surveys, it is crucial to choose a research design that is tailored both to the target group and to the particular context. According to the literature, personalized salutations in survey invitations have a beneficial effect on response rate and consequently on data quality. However, in our case, the 2019/20 cohort of the DZHW Scientist Survey, it remained to be determined which personalized salutation is most suitable to the specific target group of scientists in Germany and whether there are differences according to subgroups such as academic status or gender. We argue that for many survey studies this question of specific tailoring for a target population arises. Also, because personalization necessitates a significantly increased effort for the collection and preparation of address data, it can be decisive to know whether or not there is an advantage over simple non-personalized forms of address. In the case of scientists in Germany we tested three different personalized forms of address at the beginning of the field phase with 20.000 invitees. Each of the three is associated with different social signals and requirements for address data, and compared with the benchmark of the non-personalized, but ingroup signalling salutation “Dear Colleague”. We find that, for all three status groups - professors, postdocs, and predocs - personalized salutations are associated with significantly higher response rates. However, the exact preferences for one form of personalization or another vary between these subgroups. The results from the experiment allowed us to precisely tailor salutations to subgroups for the remainder of the field phase, and to maximize the final overall response in the survey.",

          "abstract": "Economic independence from parents is increasingly delayed in the United States. This delay has implications for the timing and sequencing of other life transitions such as employment and marriage, and for inequalities in the support young adults receive. In this study, we leverage the Panel Study of Income Dynamics’ Transition to Adulthood Supplement on 1,081 young adults aged 18–28. Using sequence analysis, we examine how financial and co-residential support are embedded within the transition to adulthood. We study heterogeneity in support trajectories between and within families and disentangle the temporal order of transition to adulthood milestones. In line with existing theory on intergenerational transfers, parental economic support serves as both as an investment in young adults’ educational and economic pursuits and as a safeguard for struggling children. However, we also find evidence of more traditional, gendered pathways to economic independence linked to marriage: marriage facilitates economic independence and, for young men especially, achieving economic independence is an important precursor to marriage.",

          "abstract": "The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is now an integral part of many occupational task profiles. Therefore, like mathematics and science, ICT represent an important content domain that adolescents may consider in their early vocational choices. Drawing on Eccles’ situated expectancy value theory and related theories, we hypothesize that adolescents’ ICT interest and self-concept should influence their vocational choices with respect to the intensity of ICT use in future occupations. Using longitudinal data from 1,964 Swiss adolescents transitioning into firm-based vocational education and training, we find strongly gendered patterns. Higher ICT interest predicts selection into occupations involving greater intensity of both basic and advanced ICT use, but only for girls. A more positive ICT self-concept is a significant predictor of greater occupational ICT use in future occupations only for boys, and this association is driven mainly by boys choosing careers as ICT specialists. Girls’ lower average ICT interest and their less positive ICT self-concepts explain almost half of the gender differences in the intensity of advanced ICT use. These findings emphasize that ICT are an important content domain of adolescents’ vocational choices today and highlight how gendered interests and self-concepts towards ICT perpetuate occupational gender segregation.",

          "abstract": "This study explores ways of identifying learned societies within the Research Organization Registry (ROR), a type of organization that so far lacks its own category within the registry. Despite their significant role in the academic landscape, learned societies lack distinct recognition in global databases, which lowers their visibility and perceived impact. Using enhanced ISSN data and the existing ROR database, we present a methodology to identify learned societies based on their publishing activities and organizational names. Our approach is validated against national lists of societies from Austria, Finland, and the UK, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of our method which, however, has several limitations discussed in the paper. Our findings show that 92% of 1,471 societies identified in ROR are currently assigned to ‘Other’ and ‘Nonprofit’ categories. We also highlight the geographical distribution and field-specific categorization of learned societies, emphasizing the diversity and scope of their influence. This paper contributes to the science of science field by proposing a framework that enhances the visibility and recognition of learned societies globally. Our research argues that ROR should consider enhancing their data schema to accommodate for learned societies. This way ROR can provide an open research information resource for identifying learned societies both for research and practical purposes.",

It is unclear whether researchers’ criteria for project choice align with those articulated by policy scholars and philosophers.  Many potential criteria for project choice are commonly discussed in scholarly and popular literature, but they have been little studied on the individual level.  I review and catalog such potential criteria, then empirically explore researcher motivations for project choice through factor analysis of survey data from 409 authors of research articles in major public administration and public policy journals.  I find empirical support for personal gain, societal importance, and intellectual interest as research motivations.  These motivations do not neatly align with proposed ideal criteria for scientific choice.  Thus, such criteria must be translated to speak to researchers’ personal interests to achieve expression in individual scientific choice.",

However, trust is a multidimensional, rather than monolithic, concept, and the relative importance of different dimensions of trust in generating support for environmental management has not been fully explored. In this study, we use the trust ecology framework to examine the role of affinitive, dispositional, procedural, and rational trust in support for fisheries management among recreational anglers in the Great Lakes region of the United States. We found that all dimensions of trust positively correlate with support for management, with rational trust being the strongest predictor. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and race showed minimal impact compared to trust dimensions. Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of trust and its critical role in resource management and suggest that building and maintain multiple dimensions of trust can enhance public support for environmental management, ultimately leading to more effective and resilient environmental governance.",

          "authors": "Glenn John Rikowski",
          "abstract": "Following a brief outline of labour-power through Marx, Ciccarelli (2021) and my own work, it is argued that the fragmentation of Marxist work on labour-power undermines what is critical for its understanding in contemporary society: the notion that labour-power is a ‘unity of the diverse’ (Marx). In Marxist theory and empirical work today, labour-power as ‘unity’, as a unified social force within humans, is sacrificed to its ‘diversity’. The result is theorisations and empirical research that split the study of labour-power into seemingly competing projects; either as arguments regarding whether the key focus should be on the social production of labour-power through education and training, or the social reproduction of labour-power through the family and domestic labour. This paper argues that labour–power is better viewed through its various diversities that constitute its unity. Each of these diversities is a spectral (but real) point in analysis of labour-power, but its unity blends the pinpointing analysis of its diversities. These labour-power diversities are social forms of its social re/production that are manifested in and through various institutions in capitalist society. In this light, the following diversities of labour-power and their institutional forms can be viewed directly through the work of Marx: the social production of labour-power (e.g. in education and training); its social reproduction 1 (e.g. through the family and domestic labour); social reproduction 2 (e.g. through state pensions, unemployment benefits); maintenance of labourers 1 (e.g. through consumption, food); maintenance of labourers 2 (e.g. through health, and mental health services). These labour-power diversities constitute a web of social forms shaping labour-power in contemporary capitalism. The paper ends by exploring some recent empirical examples illustrating how moving between the spectral points of labour–power and its diversities solidifies their unity in analysis.",

          "authors": "Asad L. Asad; Livia Baer-Bositis",
          "abstract": "System avoidance refers to the tendency of individuals who are concerned about formal social control (e.g., incarceration, immigration enforcement, or the removal of children from their families) to avoid surveilling institutions that engage in recordkeeping. While this research locates concerns about formal social control in an individual’s sanctionable status, the laws, policies, and practices that generate the threat of formal social control vary across space and time. Drawing on theories of legal consciousness, this article posits that spatial and temporal variation in the threat of formal social control has differential associations with whether and to what degree individuals with a sanctionable status report involvement in surveilling institutions. Our empirical case is U.S. immigration policing, which burdens Latinos across citizenship statuses. We link individual-level data on institutional involvement from the American Time Use Survey with administrative data on immigration policing across state-years. Results from double- hurdle models show that Latinos in state-years with higher rates of immigration policing (1) are less likely to report involvement in surveilling institutions but, (2) conditional on any involvement, do not vary in the time reported involved. We evaluate variations by nativity, citizenship status, institution, and the presence of sanctuary policies that circumscribe immigration policing. We conclude that the threat of formal social control across space and time implicates the situational meanings of institutional involvement for subordinated populations.",

Given that the participation of stakeholders in the analyses is crucial for these perspectives to be realized, this requires research information analyses that are “open”. In this paper, we propose that this “openness” in research information concerns several dimensions. In the first place, research information should be open in the sense of being transparent and accessible. Second, research information should be open in the sense of being inclusive and diverse, which includes two dimensions: that stakeholders can actually use it, and that the contents include different types of knowledge. Third, the research information should be provided in forms that empower interrogation by stakeholders, so that they can retrieve and construct the descriptions of science and technology that are more appropriate for their context. This last step implies efforts to make visible many scientific contributions from the global south which are currently invisible. We call this vision “the multiversatory”: an approach to the observation of science that facilitates pluralistic analyses of the knowledge created across a variety of places and contexts, the pluriverse.",

          "abstract": "Traditionally, linguistics has focused primarily on human communication through visual and auditory modalities, while sensory modalities such as olfaction and gustation are relatively underutilized in human interaction, a trend influenced by evolutionary and societal factors. In contrast, animals employ a broad array of sensory modes in communication—olfactory, gustatory, photic, electromagnetic, and acoustic—thereby engaging in multimodal exchanges beyond the conventional realm of human language. This article reviews scientific discoveries, such as the role of pheromones in insect behavior and animals’ perception of electromagnetic fields and spectrums, to reveal the richness of multimodal and supralinguistic communication in animals, highlighting the limitations within human communication. Inspired by these sensory communication models, we explore how future technologies might expand human sensory capacity, especially in olfaction, taste, vision, and touch, enhancing the multimodal experience in human interaction. Through technological advancements, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, electronic noses, tongues, and brain-computer interfaces, humans could adopt more diverse forms of supralinguistic communication, thus surpassing the limitations of traditional language and achieving a more comprehensive understanding of the natural world. This study aims to envisage, from a linguistic perspective, the possibilities of sensory-enhanced communication through technological development, fostering a revolutionary transformation in human perception and communication and enriching the research domain of linguistics.",

          "abstract": "The present research has delved deeper into the complex relationship of customer care calls with purchasing behavior in a WM system and has developed actionable insights to optimize operations. In this regard, the following critical factors have been considered: product attributes-cost, weight, and discount-on one hand, and delivery performance in terms of timeliness and reliability on the other, with a view to understand their impacts on customer satisfaction and interactions. Key takeaways are that high volumes of customer care calls reflect operational failure; there is a delay or expectation mismatch, and hence one needs strong process optimization. Also, heavy products, since perceived to be reliable, have fewer customer enquiries; lighter, cheap products cause more frequent queries since impulsive buying and lack of information occur. It further identifies timeliness of delivery as a main determinant of customer satisfaction while delays in delivery result in heightened discontent and rising demands for support. The study underlines the strategic relevance of advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to finally resolve the recurring inefficiencies. This may also be a good basis on which recommendations could be made concerning the use of predictive analytics for demand forecasting, effective logistical frameworks, and methods of customer service that would be in line with product-specific needs. Discounts become a two-edged factor: enhancing satisfaction but threatening brand value when used too frequently. In the end, strategies with discounts should be put into balance, proactive customer engagement should be there, with crystal clear communications with them, and the products to be more correctly described. The given study also identified how a warehouse clears the expectation from customers by applying data-driven strategies for better efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The above findings provide a comprehensive road map on how to integrate technology and customer-centric strategies in modern warehouse management.",

This paper aims to explore the connection between character patterns and metasurfaces in aspects such as energy regulation, information encoding, and cultural symbolism, while further analyzing their multidimensional impact on technology, culture, ethics, and practical applications. By comparing the historical background, cultural significance of character patterns, and the physical principles of modern metasurfaces, the paper reveals commonalities between the two in energy resonance, information transmission, and geometric symmetry. Furthermore, the paper delves into the role of character patterns in psychology and socio-culture, as well as their inspirational significance for metasurface technology design.

However, the connection between quantum mechanics and the social sciences, particularly linguistics, has not been widely explored. This paper draws analogies between the discrete nature, superposition states, and entanglement phenomena in quantum mechanics, and the discreteness, ambiguity, and context-dependence in linguistics, revealing interdisciplinary similarities between the two fields. This analogy provides a new perspective for understanding the uncertainty and complexity involved in human language processing, and suggests the possible existence of macroscopic quantum states.

Based on the case of Chile, this study contributes to educational inequality research by using factorial survey experiments to assess the stratification of evaluative principles of educational quality or what is termed \"judgments of the game.\" Different teaching and school resources features were experimentally manipulated and presented to representative and probabilistic samples of parents and primary school students to measure their evaluative principles of educational quality. Findings show that socially advantaged parents and students, and from private schools, tend to evaluate educational quality more critically and attribute stronger effects to vignette features, suggesting cultural knowledge stratification. Thus, this study contributes to cultural sociology, sociology of education, and stratification research by testing one of the central theoretical propositions on the explanations of educational inequalities.",

          "authors": "Carmelo José Felice; Gabriel Alfredo Ruiz",
          "abstract": "The political stability of a modern democracy, excluding environmental or external causes, is determined by multiple factors, all influenced by human behaviour. One indicator of political stability that takes the human factor into account is the time in office of a ruler. The stability of a ruler can be directly affected, for example, if they are killed, or indirectly, if the laws issued by the ruler are not followed. Non-compliance is dependent on the level of contempt for authority among citizens. A post-hoc hypothesis from a previous publication suggests that indigenous contempt for the authority of the white conqueror and coloniser is seen as a primary causal factor of political instability in Argentina. In this work, indigenous contempt has been shown to have originated from the mistreatment of indigenous peoples by the conqueror and coloniser, and it is expressed in practice by laws and norms being violated as a covert form of resistance. This behaviour has been spread throughout Argentine society due to extensive genetic mixing between Amerindian and Eurasian peoples, initially encouraged by the Spanish Crown. It is observed that these behaviours persist in the 21st century, partly because mistreatment and discrimination against indigenous peoples continue, and partly because pigmentocracy exists, a social system where wealth and status depend on skin colour. It is therefore crucial to understand that a large part of the causes of Argentina's political instability can be traced to the non-compliance with laws and regulations, which originated as forms of indigenous resistance to the Spanish conqueror and coloniser. Public policies aimed at improving compliance should be designed to integrate indigenous cultures into Argentine identity, ensuring that all citizens wish to comply with the laws because they now see them as their own.",

However, the interplay between family life and social inequalities, and how these relate to each other in the resilience literature, has yet to be documented.\n\nObjective: This scoping review addresses this gap by analysing 250 articles published between 1998 and 2023. We compare the concept of resilience as applied in family and social resilience studies through four constitutive elements: (I) unit of analysis, (II) definitions, (III) types, and the (IV) topics of risks, outcomes, and explanatory factors empirically examined.\n\nResults: While both perspectives study individuals’ resilience, the emphasis in family resilience is on families, whereas social resilience studies focus more on communities and societies. Both perspectives emphasize the centrality of risks in defining resilience, yet family resilience scholarship seeks solutions within the family, while social resilience highlights community dynamics. Additionally, family resilience studies explore topics related to family-specific risks and resources, while social resilience studies examine external risks and resources.\n\nConclusions: The family resilience scholarship follows the clinical tradition of resilience literature, viewing families as a separate entity that is resourceful and agentic. Socioeconomic risks are recurrent themes in social resilience, but not in the family resilience literature.\n\nContribution: Understanding resilience through the lens of family inequalities in socioeconomic contexts can bridge these two perspectives. Incorporating factors such as labour market dynamics, family transitions, and educational attainment into definitions of risks, outcomes, and explanatory factors of resilience can enhance this integration.",

          "authors": "Ole Røgeberg; K. Paige Harden; Torkild Hovde Lyngstad",
          "abstract": "According to sociological modernization theory, the shift towards a more meritocratic society should reduce the impact of family background on education and increase the importance of individual abilities. Sibling correlations have been used as an omnibus indicator of the importance of families for socioeconomic outcomes. However, sibling similarities in education are influenced by both the siblings’ genetics and their shared environments, making it challenging to interpret changes over time. This study examines the changing contributions of genetic and environmental factors to educational attainment among Norwegian twins born from 1915 to 1991. Using administrative data on education for more than 13,000 twin pairs, we applied a Bayesian hierarchical liability threshold model to estimate the heritability and shared environmental influences on educational attainment across birth cohorts, while accounting for changes in the educational system and population distributions. For women, the heritability of educational attainment increased throughout the 20th century, whereas the influence of shared environmental factors decreased. This pattern corresponds with sociocultural changes that promoted gender equality and expanded educational opportunities for women. In contrast, men exhibited no significant changes in heritability or shared environmental influences over time. This study adds to the body of research on how genetic influences on educational outcomes do – and do not – differ across historical time and social context.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on correlates of the Social Progress Index in U.S. states was replicated among 100 countries where data is available. A multiple regression analysis indicates that social progress is correlated strongly to gross domestic product per capita divided by the cost of living and higher scores on a democracy index. Religious commitment, indicated by surveys of daily prayer, is correlated to less social progress. The research literature suggests that religious commitment leads to neglect of the prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries recommended by science, disdain for scientists, and acquiescence to or support of autocratic government. The trend toward autocracy in several democracies may lead to the deterioration of social progress. Increased global warming and the threat of nuclear winter depend disproportionately on the behavior of autocratic leaders in China, Russia, and the U.S. that neglect or deny the need to curb fossil use and express intent to expand their nuclear arsenals.",

          "abstract": "There is a long history of mathematical modelling of cities, providing a capability to generate computer simulations. However, this is fragmented in its application. Our objective here is to provide an integrated picture of how cities work – the physiology in some depth – and to show how this can be deployed in problem-solving and urban planning. What is new is the laying of foundations in input-output accounts for modelling, potentially from the spatially macro and global scales and integrating via the meso city scale, to the micro, neighbourhood scale, but focussing here on building  fine-scale small-zone input-output accounts. This enhances the science, and facilitates problem-solving and planning in a variety of situations along with the handling of interdependencies.",

          "abstract": "Science diaspora networks (SDNs) are integral to science diplomacy and pivotal in tackling local, regional, and global challenges. Given the increasing mobility and connectivity in today's world, these groups play a key role in building partnerships and promoting bilateral benefits through research and development. Our objectives in this study were 1) compile a comprehensive list of SDNs, detailing their goals, missions, and objectives, 2) evaluate overarching trends within these networks, specifically examining variations based on the network's age and the nature of relationships between host and origin countries, and 3) develop a flexible framework for the establishment of new SDNs across different countries, adapting to varying geopolitical and cultural landscapes.\n\nOur results suggest that most SDNs are hosted in North America, predominantly involving high-income countries with strong alliances. African countries lack active SDNs, though existing general diaspora networks could evolve into STEM-focused subgroups. Significant innovation potential exists within choosing host countries (e.g., LMICs or neutral states) and mission focus (e.g., grand challenges). To be effective at the foreign policy level, SDNs need to have a large member base or targeted goals. Our framework, complemented by a synthesized objectives list, guides SDNs in establishing clear value propositions for members and partners, enhancing their role in science diplomacy and addressing global challenges.",

          "abstract": "Lichtman's Thirteen Keys Model has, after ten elections of success, succumbed to its first failure in Donald Trump's first victory in both the popular vote and electoral college measures. For his protection of the Keys, he has cited mass misinformation (as he suggests is produced by Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter/X) and right-wing podcasters’ assumedly uncritical support of the presidential nominee. However, this hypothesis appears arbitrary, especially relative to recent elections where the Keys have been successful. This article instead postulates a Structuralist argument – functioning to describe innate administrative normativities (the structure of government as described by its electoral and legislative composition) – which hinges on the consistency that Lichtman interpreted (particularly in his introductory work with Keilis-Borok) in showing the Keys to be a consistent model; the Keys are further shown to be unswayed by projected collective social proclivities.",

          "abstract": "NVivo is a qualitative research software. This Research Note surveyed 12 years of publications from two leading environmental policy journals (Global Environmental Politics and Environmental Politics) to uncover NVivo best practices. There are several ways to unify Global Environmental Policy NVivo research, including the use of interrater reliability, as illustrated by a case study on gender and multilateral environmental agreements. One key finding is that only 20 of the 3653 of the International Environmental Agreements Database Project (IEADB) agreements refer to “women” (and only 16 mention “gender”). In contrast, for the same sample, 1431 Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) mention “men”. Furthermore, 35% of the treaties that mention women describe women as environmentally vulnerable. (Note: the inter-rater Cohen kappa score was 0.80, a substantial agreement). This Research Note fills a research need by showing how past global environmental policy research using the NVivo software has not been standardized or drawn upon common methodological sources. These findings confirm that research tools (such as software) are not substitutes for research methodologies.",

          "authors": "Tommaso Vitale",
          "abstract": "Prefazione al volume di Cristina Burini, Governare lo spazio pubblico nelle città italiane. Patti di collaborazione e imprese di comunità tra convivialità ed efficacia collettiva (FrancoAngeli 2025). I patti di collaborazione e le imprese di comunità regolano le attività e la governance di alcuni spazi pubblici. Alla ricerca di una espressione di sintesi per riprendere molti dei temi fin qui discussi, potremmo semplicemente dire che, quando governato in maniera partecipativa, lo spazio pubblico, può essere considerato un servizio pubblico. Come per tutti i servizi pubblici, la posta in gioco sta nella loro regolazione, e quindi nel modo in cui sono normate, contrattualizzate, remunerate, controllate e sanzionate le forme di gestione: in altri termini la loro governance. Cosi riconcettualizzato, lo spazio pubblico non è un luogo passivo di transito e interazione superficiale, ma un servizio pubblico che deve essere realmente accessibile: la vera sfida per le politiche urbane e la gestione degli spazi pubblici è riconoscere e valorizzare questa dimensione di servizio, dove l’accessibilità va oltre la semplice possibilità di entrare fisicamente in uno spazio e include la capacità di interagire, esprimersi e ricevere riconoscimento. Per questo manutenzione e sicurezza - elementi spesso visti solo come questioni tecniche - sono responsabilità comuni di amministrazioni pubbliche e comunità attive. Pensare lo spazio pubblico come un servizio pubblico richiede di riconoscere che la sua qualità e la sua sostenibilità dipendono dalla capacità delle politiche e delle comunità di co-creare uno spazio che sia accessibile non solo in termini fisici, ma anche sociali e culturali. In questo modo, la dimensione del riconoscimento reciproco e della reciprocità dissonante diventa centrale, rendendo lo spazio pubblico un luogo in cui le differenze possono essere accolte e integrate attraverso un processo di continua negoziazione e regolazione condivisa. In sintesi, la convivialità, la cura nella gestione e il mantenimento degli spazi pubblici non sono solo condizioni per un buon clima sociale, ma rappresentano le fondamenta per una socializzazione civica autentica. Questi spazi comuni, dove le differenze sono non solo tollerate ma accolte e integrate, diventano il perno di una cittadinanza partecipativa. Le identità collettive che emergono da questo processo, basate su un attaccamento emotivo e personale, mostrano il potenziale trasformativo degli spazi pubblici: luoghi dove l’agire quotidiano (Citroni, 2023) e le relazioni sociali contribuiscono a una coesione sociale che va oltre la semplice coabitazione, verso un’esperienza di comunità dinamica e inclusiva. Ecco la posta in gioco di una governance urbana di qualità. Indice del capitolo: 1. Lo spazio pubblico, non accessorio ma a fondamento del legame civile 2. La dimensione normativa a fondamento dello spazio pubblico e le implicazioni di governance 3. Conflitto e riconoscimento nello spazio pubblico 4. Gli spazi pubblici come servizi comuni",

          "authors": "Jose Pina-Sánchez; Melissa Hamilton; Peter WG Tennant",
          "abstract": "To minimise confounding bias and facilitate the identification of unwarranted disparities, sentencing researchers have traditionally sought to control for as many legal factors as possible. In this article we challenge such approach. Using causal graphs we show how controlling for commonly used variables in the sentencing literature can introduce bias. Instead, we propose a new modelling framework that clarifies which types of controls are necessary to identify different definitions of sentencing disparities. We apply this framework to the estimation of race disparities in the US federal courts and gender disparities in the England and Wales magistrates’ court. We find that the model uncertainty associated to the choice of controls is substantial for gender disparities and for race disparities affecting Hispanic offenders, rendering estimates of the latter inconclusive. Disparities against black offenders are more consistent, although, they are not strong enough to be seen as definitive evidence of racial discrimination.",

          "authors": "Ashley Brown; Shane Johnson; Nilufer Tuptuk",
          "abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) integrate advanced communication and autonomous driving technologies, enabling them to operate independently or with minimal human intervention. The anticipated benefits of CAVs are numerous and include making transportation accessible to all, reducing accidents due to human error, optimising traffic flow, and creating new industries and job opportunities. Autonomous driving capabilities in CAVs rely on advanced sensor technology and AI-driven analytics, which process data from multiple sensors to navigate, perceive the surrounding environment, detect obstacles, and make driving decisions in real-time. Despite the many benefits, CAVs will be highly vulnerable to a wide variety of crimes unless security measures are implemented by design. To understand the potential threats, this study introduces the enabling technology and reference architecture for CAVs and reports the findings from an extensive scoping review of the available literature. This covers reported crime incidents, academic literature on potential threats, a survey of academic survey papers on CAV security, and a review of papers concerned with cyberattacks against CAVs published in the past five years. The findings from the review are complemented by the findings from a workshop with experts about which of the identified threats should be prioritised for the purposes of crime reduction. The findings indicate that a wide range of cyber-attacks and offences are possible, and that the threat landscape is continually expanding due to insufficient attention being given to security during the development of the technology. Suggestions for policy and priorities for future work are suggested.",

          "authors": "Sezgin Uysal; Ismail Celebi",
          "abstract": "The study focuses on the temporal differences (30 years on average) between ethnic\ngroups migrating from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the U.S. between 1850 and\n1910. In our study, we argue that the main factor that led to differences in the timing\nof emigration was the differences in regional economic development of different ethnic\ngroups living in different regions of the Empire. Migration costs: before the 1864 introduction\nof steam engine technology in transatlantic maritime transport, emigration\ncosts were not affordable for Hungarians and Slovaks due to the sea and land voyage\nhigh ticket prices. Therefore, with more resources, Austrians and Czechs could afford\nto migrate earlier. However, after the introduction of steamship technology and the\ntechnological change in ship engines, travel became more affordable due to reduced\nticket prices, faster voyages, and increased capacity. This allowed Hungarians and Slovaks\nfrom poorer regions to begin migrating in larger numbers as migration became\neconomically feasible. In this study, we utilise a complete count of the U.S. Census\nrecords from 1900 and 1910 (Helgertz et al., 2023; Ruggles et al., 2021), which Integrated\nPublic Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). On the other hand, we utilise economic\nindicators, which are regional daily wage, GDP per capita income and living standard\ndata for the Austria-Hungary Empire from Cvrcek (2013) and Schulze (2000).",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the implications of high HI35 days, which increase the demand for water and energy supplies, overconsumption, and higher emissions induced by cooling demand. Socially, HI35 is associated with health morbidity and loss in labor productivity; hence, policies directed at protection of the well-being of the poor, such as improved access to health care and good working conditions, become increasingly relevant. Extreme heat, besides, accelerates resource competition that may further develop into a civil instability, which affects governance structures. The nation will be assisted in addressing the impacts brought forward by HI35 through resilient infrastructure policy, good governance practice, and sustainable resource management. This paper, therefore, concludes that integrated policy action in ESG will be urgently needed to address the risk from extreme heat and calls for adaptive strategies that move toward environmental sustainability, social equity, and effective governance. Finally, HI35 is helpful to guide policy responses against different and interwoven challenges of extreme heat on sustainable development.",
