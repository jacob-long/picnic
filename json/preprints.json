          "title": "Similarity-Based Interference in the Processing of Classifier-Noun Dependencies in Mandarin Chinese",
          "authors": "Hailin Hao; Zuzanna Fuchs; Shravan Vasishth",
          "abstract": "During the processing of linguistic dependencies, the presence of a non-dependent word—referred to as a distractor—can sometimes complicate the identification of the correct subject. This phenomenon, known as similarity-based interference, provides a valuable testing ground for competing theories of sentence processing and has garnered significant interest in the field of psycholinguistics. One prominent theory, cue-based retrieval, suggests that the parser initiates a search for the relevant linguistic dependent at the retrieval site (e.g., the verb) based on a set of retrieval cues. In this work, we explore the use of lexicon-specific cues set by classifiers in the retrieval of noun dependents in Mandarin Chinese to provide evidence for the cue-based retrieval mechanism. A further open question is whether the distractor must intervene between the co-dependents (so-called retroactive interference) or whether the distractor can appear to the left of the dependent elements (so-called proactive interference). Previous work has suggested that proactive interference is weaker than retroactive interference, i.e., that the distractor has to intervene between the co-dependents to influence the dependency completion process. Using self-paced reading and A-Maze tasks, and Bayes Factors for hypothesis testing, we found robust evidence for a predicted interference effect in retroactive configurations, but no interference in proactive configurations. We discuss the theoretical implications of the current work for theories of retrieval and sentence processing in general.",

          "authors": "Antonio Laverghetta; Simone Lucchini; Jimmy Pronchick; Roger Beaty",
          "abstract": "Participants in creativity studies sometimes produce invalid data that is unusable for analysis, such as nonsensical or incomplete responses to idea generation tasks. Identifying such responses is a time-consuming yet necessary process to ensure robust results but also remains challenging to automate. We explore the efficacy of transformer language models (TLMs) for automatically detecting invalid creativity responses, using only the text prompt and response and no other metadata about the experimental session. We train a suite of transformers to detect invalid data for two creativity assessments: the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a design problems task (DPT). We find that transformers generally outperform other baselines for both tasks. Further, we show that TLMs’ predictions are well calibrated to the quality of the participant response, ensuring that model failures will occur in a predictable way and that high-quality responses are unlikely to be labeled invalid. Finally, we conduct a fairness analysis based on language background—using an adversarial study where participants attempt to “break” the model by coming up with invalid responses that are nonetheless labeled valid. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning methods for cleaning creativity assessment data, using solely participant responses, in a reliable and unbiased way.",

          "authors": "Ashish Mehta; James Gross",
          "abstract": "Enthusiasm for personalized psychological interventions far outstrips our understanding of how to best tailor these interventions to individuals. The first step in bridging this gap is to identify individual characteristics that predict intervention outcomes. Across three studies (N = 444; between 2023 and 2024), we address this issue by examining the role of prior beliefs in reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy common to many types of psychological interventions. In Studies 1 and 2, we instructed participants to reappraise negative stimuli in a way that was consistent with different beliefs. We found that more belief-congruent (versus less belief-congruent) reappraisals were more believable and more effective for regulating emotions. In Study 3, we asked participants to rank sets of standardized reappraisals. We found substantial heterogeneity in which reappraisals were preferred, and this heterogeneity was partially explained by people’s prior beliefs. This work suggests that, in the context of US-based participants, beliefs may be leveraged to systematically personalize reappraisal interventions.",

          "title": "The structure and correlates of beliefs about mental state intensity dynamics",
          "authors": "Landry S Bulls; Mark Allen Thornton",
          "abstract": "The intensity of mental states varies over time. Within a given instance of a cognitive or emotional state, the strength of that state’s hold on the mind ebbs and flows. Although different instances of the same state will exhibit different temporal dynamics, certain states are associated with certain dynamics. For example, surprise tends to arise sharply, whereas tiredness generally accumulates gradually over time. This paper investigates the structure and correlates of people’s beliefs about these mental state dynamics. We measure these beliefs using a freeform drawing task in an online sample (Sample 1; N = 457), and preregistered replication sample (Sample 2; N = 1435). We observe that people attribute consistent, differentiable intensity dynamics to a wide range of mental states. These beliefs are optimally characterized by a replicable 3-dimensional structure. We go on to examine the correlates of these beliefs about intra-state dynamics (Study 2). We find that they are associated with variability in mental state similarity judgements, transition probability ratings, and natural language use. Together these findings show that people hold robust, structured beliefs about mental state dynamics, and that these beliefs are reflected in other facets of mental state understanding.",

          "abstract": "The value of herding dogs depends on how effectively they perform their job. Improving the rate of success for herding dogs requires understanding which dogs succeed and why. The present study determines whether dog personality and behavioral traits can be used to predict herding performance. We began by replicating Wilson and colleagues (2022), who found that personality traits predict herding ability in Australian kelpies. We asked American owners of herding dogs to complete an online survey about their dog’s (n = 335) personality traits, behavioral traits, and herding ability. We grouped related personality traits together in a principal components analysis to create dog personality profiles. Next, we determined whether any dog personality profiles predicted herding ability. We partially replicate Wilson et al.’s (2022) findings, with similar personality profiles predicting herding ability. We then expanded on the previous study by creating a new set of profiles that also included behavioral traits. We found that both personality and behavioral traits predicted herding ability. We propose that herding dog handlers and breeders should focus on key personality and behavioral traits when making decisions about herding dog career paths and training efforts.",

          "authors": "Trevor Lee Cline; Andrew Y. Sun; Guicheng “Ariel” Tan; Jaap Munneke; Aaron Seitz; Susanne Jaeggi",
          "abstract": "Cognitive aging is characterized by declining memory and reduced segregation of large-scale brain networks. While memory training and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) each show potential to support neurocognitive function in older adults, their combined effect on cognitive outcomes remains an active line of research and effects on whole-brain network modularity remain unclear. Additionally, recent studies suggest that tDCS may accelerate the cognitive benefits of memory training. We tested whether five days of training working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM), paired with anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, would enhance these memory domains and increase resting-state functional network modularity. 62 healthy older adults were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham stimulation during adaptive WM and LTM training, with resting-state fMRI collected at baseline, post-test, and follow-up 2-4 months after training. Behavioral results indicated no significant improvements in WM or LTM over time, and stimulation condition did not reliably modulate performance. Similarly, resting-state modularity did not change significantly across the training period, nor were there differences between stimulation groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that task-based modularity increased from post-test to follow-up in the active group, though this effect was not accompanied by behavioral gains. Further exploratory analyses revealed that across all outcomes, baseline measurements (irrespective of condition) emerged as strong moderators of change over the training period, emphasizing the importance of interindividual variability. By integrating memory training with tDCS and longitudinal fMRI, this study adds to the growing literature on stimulation-augmented cognitive training protocols and underscore the need for research on interindividual differences.",

          "authors": "Daniel Mark Low; Osiris Rankin; Daniel D.L. Coppersmith; Kate Bentley; Matthew Nock; Satrajit S Ghosh",
          "abstract": "Researchers often want to measure a variety of constructs such as anxiety, discrimination, or loneliness in text data from surveys, interviews, social media, and electronic health records. Using large language models (LLMs) --while optimal for text classification-- remain infeasible for many researchers due to concerns around computational expertise, cost, privacy, and compute requirements. Therefore, some researchers prefer to use lightweight models for large datasets or interpretable models to avoid mistakes in high-stakes scenarios such as suicide risk detection. Lexicons offer simple baselines to LLMs by searching for relevant phrases --and can be used together with LLMs to guarantee capturing specific keywords in a deterministic way. However, building new lexicons is resource intensive. In this study, we found that GPT-4 turbo was able to automatically create a lexicon for 49 known risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which we release as the Suicide Risk Lexicon. This approach quickly measures most constructs relevant for this application, resulting in high content validity. This lexicon was able to accurately predict risk in crisis counseling conversations. After validating the lexicon with clinical experts, the lexicon outperformed the LIWC lexicon --which has low content validity for mental illness-- and performed similarly to some black-box deep learning models. Due to using an interpretable approach with high content validity, we discovered that active suicidal ideation and direct self-injury were stronger indicators of imminent risk than passive suicidal ideation and depressed mood in this ecological setting. To simplify creating new lexicons for other research domains, we introduce a Python package, construct-tracker, that works with a variety of LLMs. In sum, while we recommend using LLMs for text classification, they remain out of reach for many researchers. Our work demonstrates that LLMs --despite being black-boxes that might be challenging to use-- can counterintuitively create interpretable models by generating lexicons, when this is preferred. Furthermore, we highlight the broader application of lexicons beyond measurement, including their use in benchmarking LLM performance.",

          "authors": "Natalie Renata Stearns; Patricia Kerig; Alexander; Kristel Thomassin; Stephanie Craig",
          "abstract": "Core features of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., low empathy, lack of guilt, callousness) are underpinned by emotion processing deficits including dysfunction in emotion reactivity (ERc) and emotion regulation (ER). Additionally, recent research has suggested the presence of heterogeneity in CU traits, such that the primary variant is biologically rooted and marked by hypoarousal, whereas the secondary variant is thought to develop as a response to maltreatment and is marked by hyperarousal. To date, physiological measurement of ERc and ER processes via the parasympathetic nervous system have focused on static methods of measurement; however, dynamic approaches may provide a more nuanced picture of reactive and regulatory processes. The current study sought to identify whether CU trait variants differed on ERc and ER as indexed by both static and dynamic objective physiological markers with the goal of improving our understanding of CU trait development and informing future treatment targets. Participants consisted of 636 youth ages 12-18 recruited from juvenile detention centers. A latent profile analysis identified CU variants using CU traits, anxiety, and posttraumatic arousal and avoidance. Groups were subsequently compared on static and dynamic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) indices of ERc and ER. Only one dynamic measure of ER (i.e., RSA inertia) uniquely differentiated primary and secondary groups, whereas static measures provided little discriminative utility. The current findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of CU trait heterogeneity with respect to emotion processing, allowing us to more effectively target variants in the treatment context.",

          "authors": "Belgin Ünal; Aaron Benjamin",
          "abstract": "Groups often outperform individuals in cognitive tasks. However, there is little consensus on the cognitive mechanisms that underlie effective teamwork. Here we propose that metacognitive awareness—an individual’s ability to understand and reflect on their own cognitive processes as well as those of their peers—plays a critical role in facilitating effective group work. This ability includes recognizing not only one’s own strengths and weaknesses but also understanding the knowledge states, skills, and needs of fellow group members. Metacognitively aware team members can leverage each other’s expertise, adjust their communication styles appropriately, and collaborate more efficiently. However, interaction can also have deleterious consequences, such as when one member chooses to dominate, when social conditions make group members reluctant to contribute or to evaluate others’ contributions frankly, or when the coordination among group members is sufficiently burdensome that it interferes with individual performance. Here we propose that effective group work results from harnessing the knowledge that is held in many minds by creating conditions for optimal sorting and evaluation of group suggestions through the effective exchange of metacognitive information. We examine the existing literature on group cognition across a number of fields, including psychology, cognitive science, organization, and management, and identify a number of key metacognitive strategies that exemplify this strategy and enhance group performance.",

          "abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data about people’s self-reported experiences can be summarized and reported back to them as a so-called personalized feedback report. A popular form of personalized feedback concerns people’s positive affect in different environments and activities. The goal of this type of feedback is to provide participants insight into contexts that are associated with particularly high or low positive affect. Then, they may seek these contexts out more or less often respectively. However, the extent to which participants gain insight from this type of personalized feedback has not yet been quantified. In this study, we tested whether participants indeed gained insight from personalized feedback about their average positive affect in different contexts. We did this using a pre-post design, in which we compared estimates that participants made of their average positive affect in different contexts before and after receiving their personalized feedback to their respective personalized feedback (N = 133). For a subsample of participants (n = 77), we mistakenly provided feedback that was consistently higher than the actual average of their EMA data. We found that participants generally changed their estimates in the direction of both the ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ personalized feedback. These findings suggest that people may be inclined to adjust their perception towards their personalized feedback, even when the feedback is flawed.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation difficulties are implicated in most psychopathologies, yet their everyday dynamics remain unclear. We adapted and validated the State Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (S-DERS) for ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and examined how such difficulties unfold in daily life. In a preregistered study (N = 214; 6 surveys/day for 10 days), participants reported on stressors, affect, and the S-DERS. Confirmatory analyses supported the S-DERS four-factor structure, with evidence against a general shared difficulty factor, and we provide validated 4-, 8-, and 18-item EMA versions with practical recommendations. Emotion regulation difficulties showed both stability and meaningful fluctuations, increasing after stressors, co-occurring with negative affect, and predicting impaired affective recovery. These effects were stronger among individuals high in trait DERS and neuroticism. Findings position emotion regulation difficulties as dynamic, context-sensitive processes that can be robustly measured in daily life to inform clinical science and intervention.",

          "abstract": "The modulation of cognitive control by threat of punishment has been under-characterized relative to examinations of reward, with mixed findings reported in the literature. Across two experiments, we examined the balance of proactive and reactive control in the AX-CPT under several negative affect and punishment manipulations. In Experiment 1, we compared cognitive control performance between two task phases: an Affect phase, in which emotionally evocative images were used to induce either Fear, Anger, or Neutral affect, and a Punishment phase, in which the threat of receiving mild electric shocks was either performance-contingent, or unavoidable. In Experiment 2, we examined cognitive control under punishment that was both unavoidable and uncertain, and whether effects of such punishment varied by individual differences in trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Across both experiments, we observed that threat of punishment was associated with increased proactive control, and that this effect was heightened when punishment was performance-contingent. In contrast, punishment uncertainty did not appear to modulate cognitive control outcomes at the group level. However, exploratory analyses suggested that punishment uncertainty might interact with individual variability in trait anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and threat-related physiological arousal responses to shape control outcomes. Together, our findings support an account in which the presence of a motivator, regardless of valence, facilitates increased proactive control. In contrast, the relationship between negative affect and cognitive control outcomes may be more complex, and vary both with contextual factors and individual differences.",

          "authors": "Matthias Borgstede",
          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

It is unclear, however, whether these mechanisms generalize to more complex domains such as fake news detection. Here, we tested whether confidence also drives information seeking in the context of fake news, whether seeking information improves fake news detection and sharing intentions, and whether we find confidence-driven confirmation biases. In an online study, 314 US citizens indicated whether news headlines were true or fake and could request additional information before finalizing their decision. First, in line with findings from perceptual decision-making, confidence was the main driver of information seeking for both fake and true news. Yet critically, whereas confidence lawfully scaled with decision accuracy for true news items, we found a U-shaped relationship for fake news items: decision accuracy was lowest for intermediate confidence, indicating that for fake headlines confidence is not a reliable signal of headline veracity. Second, while information seeking increased decision accuracy for true news items, for fake news items decision accuracy remained at chance level even after information seeking. Sharing intentions for fake news remained equally unaffected by information seeking, and mostly increased for belief-congruent true items. Finally, we found a confidence-driven confirmation bias for beliefs, but not for sharing intentions. Together, our results clarify that while confidence-driven information seeking adaptively increases decision accuracy for true news items, it is entirely ineffective in the context of fake news.",

It usually involves a large team of volunteer researchers asynchronously working together in a public Discord server. This approach allows one to harness crowd-sourced intelligence to tackle ambitious problems collaboratively and attract specialized expertise and creative approaches you might not find in a traditional lab. Unfortunately, in practice, the benefits are often outweighed by management challenges. With an open invite, you’ll likely have a heterogeneous group of contributors: different backgrounds, skill levels, time zones, and commitment levels. Coordinating a larger, decentralized team is hard. There’s a risk of wasting time onboarding people who later disappear, or trying to mentor enthusiastic novices at the expense of research progress. Newcomers may find it impossible to figure out the project status or how to contribute amidst the chatter. Progress can stall as volunteers are under no obligation to stay or finish tasks. Below, I outline strategies that have worked in my experience to optimally steer open science collaborations.",

          "abstract": "Rarely are we fully informed about the data security and data privacy (DSDP) of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services we use. Providing DSDP information on AI products in an easily accessible and quick-to-process format could, however, help instill appropriate levels of (dis-)trust in (potential) users. Here, participants were presented with hypothetical AI products paired with different labels (graphical vs. text-based) conveying low to high DSDP levels. Expectedly, trust increased and anxiety decreased when an AI product reached a higher DSDP level. That is, labels effectively communicated DSDP differences. Text-based labels were associated with increased trust and decreased anxiety compared to graphical labels. Interestingly, when not provided with DSDP information via a label, participants attributed an intermediate level of (dis-)trust to AI products. These findings illustrate the importance and potential of introducing easy-to-process labels to convey information about AI products, for instance, DSDP information.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Digital support tools may help address workplace barriers faced by neurodivergent employees, but evidence for their effectiveness remains limited. This study explored reported outcomes of use of Brain in Hand (BiH), an individualised digital support tool for neurodivergent people, using a mixed-methods design. Materials and Method: Eighteen employed neurodivergent adults (autistic and/or with ADHD) completed measures of anxiety and workplace productivity at baseline and 6 months. Qualitative interviews were conducted at both timepoints. Data were integrated with participant-defined goals and interpreted BiH engagement levels. Results: Many participants reported improvements in psychological wellbeing, daily structure and independence, and work outcomes. These changes aligned with reduced anxiety and increased self-rated productivity, particularly for those who engaged fully and whose pre-study goals were mostly met. Support-seeking confidence also emerged as a benefit for some participants. However, barriers to engagement limited positive outcomes for others. Conclusions: Findings suggest that BiH may effectively support many neurodivergent employees, but benefits depend on sustained engagement and enabling workplace environments. Person-centred integration of qualitative and quantitative data enhanced interpretive depth, helping to capture the varied workplace experiences of neurodivergent people engaging with digital interventions.",

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) targets transdiagnostic mechanisms such as cognitive fusion and low self-compassion, which may be particularly relevant for AjD.\nObjective: This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of a brief, guided, asynchronous internet-delivered MBCT (iMBCT) for AjD during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with internet-delivered progressive muscle relaxation (iPMR) and a waitlist control (WLC).\nMethods: Adults meeting ICD-11 criteria for AjD (N = 301) were randomized to iMBCT, iPMR, or WLC for four weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in AjD symptoms (ADNM-20) and remission rates. Secondary outcomes were changes in depression, anxiety, cognitive fusion, experiential avoidance, and self-compassion. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and one-month follow-up. Mediation analyses tested cognitive defusion and self-compassion as mechanisms. \nResults: iMBCT produced greater reductions in AjD symptoms than WLC (η² = .17) and higher remission rates. Compared with iPMR, iMBCT yielded larger decreases in depression and anxiety. Cognitive defusion fully mediated iMBCT effects on depression and anxiety. Gains were maintained at follow-up.\nConclusions: A brief, minimally guided, asynchronous iMBCT is an effective and scalable intervention for AjD, targeting cognitive and self-regulatory mechanisms.

It is not the case that everyone else before was wrong about decline but this time we are finally right. We highlight how intuitions of the generational decline are due to researchers being odd. Judgments are further distorted by misperceptions of the present, idealized memories of the past, presentism, all producing comparisons between reality and fiction. Historical examples and contemporary data illustrate how technologies and practices unfamiliar to older cohorts are over-indexed as the villain and often misassigned. We argue that credible claims about secular changes require (a) broad time horizons that avoid arbitrary cutoffs; (b) preregistration to curb confirmation bias; and (c) strict tests of measurement invariance, broadly construed to include shifting diagnostics, reference groups, reporting norms. Re-analyses that honor invariance overturn canonical narratives (e.g., “reverse Flynn effects,” a “narcissism epidemic”). While people and societies do change, many trends are cyclical rather than monotonic. We conclude with a practical framework: before inferring decline, ask whether the change is measured, whether the past benchmark is accurate, whether the metric is comparable across time.",

          "authors": "Damien Le Clézio; Maël Delem; Merlin Monzel; Gaën Plancher",
          "abstract": "There is a long-standing debate about the role of visual mental images in reasoning. Knauff and Johnson-Laird’s (2002) Visual Imagery Impedance Hypothesis (VIIH) suggests visual imagery can hinder abstract reasoning, as evidenced by slower responses to visual compared to spatial and control problems. Aphantasia — reduced or absent visual imagery— offers a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. In an online version of the reasoning paradigm used in VIIH studies, aphantasic and control participants completed three problem types (visual, spatial, control), while reaction time and accuracy scores were measured. In addition, a second classification, based on the Object-Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ), was employed to differentiate participants according to their cognitive style and explore possible performance differences between the visualiser, spatialiser and verbaliser clusters. Our study replicated the findings of Knauff and Johnson-Laird (2002), as a slowdown for visual problems in comparison to spatial and control ones was demonstrated in typical imagers. In aphantasics, this effect was less marked, but the difference between the groups is not substantial enough to be conclusively established. More in-depth analyses distinguishing “complete aphantasia” and hypophantasia revealed a more significant slowdown within the latter group, suggesting that visual imagery, even in its weakest form, influences performance on such tasks. Finally, our OSIVQ classification-based analyses showed that participants in the visualiser cluster are the most impaired in this task. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of considering the influence of mental images and cognitive styles in theories of reasoning.",

In Experiment 2, we applied bilateral continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) over the DLPFC and a control site to assess whether the DLPFC is critical for this attentional modulation.\nMethods: In Experiment 1, a within-subjects design was used with two simultaneous adaptive staircases for valid and invalid trials to control task difficulty, while reaction times, signal detection theory metrics and metacognitive efficiency were measured. In Experiment 2, the same task was performed in two sessions spaced by a week following cTBS over the DLPFC or control cortices, adding non-parametric metacognitive and cognitive control measures.\nResults: In Experiment 1, objective performance was successfully stabilized while leaving subjective responses unconstrained. Reaction times, response bias, and metacognitive efficiency were all impaired following invalid cues. In Experiment 2, the same pattern was observed after S1-cTBS, but critically, DLPFC-cTBS erased these attentional effects, indicating that DLPFC disruption selectively impairs the modulation of metacognitive monitoring. Trial-history analyses further corroborated that the DLPFC supports conflict-adaptation across trials.\nConclusion(s): These findings suggest that the DLPFC does not generate perceptual contents directly but is essential for the top-down processes that shape metacognitive monitoring. Disrupting DLPFC function reduces attentional benefits and conflict-adaptation in metacognition, highlighting its critical role in linking expectations to self-evaluative awareness.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience research often relies on convenience sampling of participants, which can result in biased sample demographics and an under-representation of older adults. There is a need to identify effective routes to widen participation among older adults and explore age-related differences in motivations and barriers to research involvement. This mixed methods study combines qualitative data from two focus groups, conducted with 11 healthy adults aged 56-73, and an online questionnaire completed by 335 adults aged 18-88. Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",

It is unclear, however, whether these mechanisms generalize to more complex domains such as fake news detection. Here, we tested whether confidence also drives information seeking in the context of fake news, whether seeking information improves fake news detection and sharing intentions, and whether we find confidence-driven confirmation biases. In an online study, 314 US citizens indicated whether news headlines were true or fake and could request additional information before finalizing their decision. First, in line with findings from perceptual decision-making, confidence was the main driver of information seeking for both fake and true news. Yet critically, whereas confidence lawfully scaled with decision accuracy for true news items, we found a U-shaped relationship for fake news items: decision accuracy was lowest for intermediate confidence, indicating that for fake headlines confidence is not a reliable signal of headline veracity. Second, while information seeking increased decision accuracy for true news items, for fake news items decision accuracy remained at chance level even after information seeking. Sharing intentions for fake news remained equally unaffected by information seeking, and mostly increased for belief-congruent true items. Finally, we found a confidence-driven confirmation bias for beliefs, but not for sharing intentions. Together, our results clarify that while confidence-driven information seeking adaptively increases decision accuracy for true news items, it is entirely ineffective in the context of fake news.",

          "abstract": "Students with poor quality relationships (e.g., those lacking parent/carer support, peer support, and/or who are bullied by their peers) typically report lower wellbeing than their peers. Support from school staff may play a compensatory role for these vulnerable learners, but current evidence is meagre. Using data from N=25,977 adolescents (aged 12-15; 50.1% girls) from the #BeeWell study in Greater Manchester, England, we fitted a series of linear regression models to estimate the association between school staff support and psychological wellbeing; optimism; self-esteem; and, life satisfaction. These models were subsequently extended to explore potential moderation effects (i.e., whether the association between school staff support and wellbeing varies based on students’ level of parent/carer support, peer support, and/or exposure to bullying). Analyses revealed that higher levels of school staff support are significantly associated with higher levels of all four student wellbeing outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed a complex picture, with the nature and magnitude of effects varying by relationship and wellbeing outcome.  For example, for self-esteem and life satisfaction, the association with school staff support is stronger for students reporting low (vs high) parent/carer support or who are exposed (vs unexposed) to bullying. In contrast, for psychological wellbeing and optimism, it is smaller for students reporting low (vs high) social support from peers. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of having supportive school staff for promoting student wellbeing. They also suggest that increasing school staff support is a potentially useful mechanism for bolstering the wellbeing of vulnerable students (e.g., those who are bullied).",

Online survey data (N = 626) revealed unexpected cross-country differences: Poland reported the highest general FoMO, while China reported the highest workplace FoMO. Moreover, general FoMO negatively predicted job satisfaction, particularly among individuals who viewed their jobs as personally undesirable. Contrary to expectations, workplace FoMO positively predicted job satisfaction, especially for those in roles perceived as less desirable, suggesting that FoMO may function as a compensatory mechanism. Furthermore, workplace FoMO positively predicted alternative job search, while general FoMO did not. A mediation analysis showed that job satisfaction indirectly buffered the link between workplace FoMO and job search behavior. These findings underscore the complex, context-dependent nature of FoMO in professional settings and offer practical implications for managing digital engagement and employee retention in increasingly connected workplaces.",

          "abstract": "Semantic cognition (use of acquired world knowledge to guide behaviour) is critical in everyday life. Semantic cognition is often assumed to be preserved in later life, compensating for functional declines in other cognitive domains. However, aging research rarely considers age-related effects on non-verbal knowledge or on semantic control processes that regulate how knowledge is activated and used. We addressed this by conducting the most detailed assessment of semantic cognition across the adult lifespan to date, involving 537 UK adults aged between 20 and 91. Verbal semantic knowledge increased linearly across adulthood while non-verbal knowledge reached a plateau at age 60. In contrast, controlled semantic processing showed age-related decline, particularly in the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant semantic knowledge. These results indicate that semantic cognition is not uniformly preserved in old age: though older people know more than young people, they are less able to use their knowledge flexibly in novel situations.",

          "abstract": "Oxytocin, an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide, plays a crucial role in various physiological and behavioural processes, offering potential therapeutic benefits for several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Despite its promise, oxytocin research has been marked by inconsistent results concerning its therapeutic applications and underlying mechanisms. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis is a popular approach to shed light on mixed findings in a body of literature; however, they can become quickly outdated as new evidence becomes available. Given these challenges, research on oxytocin and its biobehavioural outcomes is ideally positioned for the adoption of ‘living’ meta-analyses, which allow for the continuous integration of new data and updated conclusions. Here we introduce the Active Monitoring of Oxytocin Research Evidence (AMORE) platform (https://amore-project.org), which is a hub that aggregates articles and materials associated with living meta-analyses for biobehavioural oxytocin research. Developed through consensus among 24 expert researchers, a standardized framework was established that either requires or recommends practices ensuring transparency and rigor in living meta-analyses featured on the AMORE platform. Overall, AMORE has been designed to advance oxytocin biobehavioural research by the timely integration of emerging evidence through transparent living meta-analyses",

          "abstract": "The issue of “imposter” participants within qualitative research has become increasingly prevalent. The problem raises specific concerns for qualitive research around research inclusivity and diversity, alongside the challenge to data integrity and methodological rigour. Existing literature is dominated by case studies and commentaries with a need for multi-disciplinary guidelines that reflect the specific challenges and context of qualitative research. This study adopted a two-stage expert and evidence-based approach to develop guidance for researchers and organisations. Stage 1 was a mixed-method study with 184 qualitative researchers to establish the reach and impact of the problem, perspectives on the associated issues and potential solutions across disciplines, career stage and locality. Stage 2 involved a series of researcher and public workshops to develop and refine guidelines through an iterative analytical process. The resulting guidance for researchers and organisations is a flexible, supportive tool to enable a systematic and evidence-informed approach within their research practice. The guidance provides a framework for considering ethical, epistemological, methodological and practical considerations when determining how to mitigate the risk of imposter participants within qualitative research. It is hoped that the guidelines will inform wider understanding of the issue and encourage the adoption of evidence-based policies and processes.",

          "abstract": "The Arabic number system links number length with magnitude: longer numbers represent larger values. In numerical comparisons, interference arises when physical and numerical dimensions are misaligned, and processing improves with greater numerical distance. While ERP studies have dissociated numerical processing effects, evidence for early encoding of numerical information remains inconclusive due to confounding visual properties. In two ERP experiments, we examined whether number length influences early multi-digit number processing, independent of visual size, by using scribbled line patterns to control physical length. Experiment 1 (N=27) compared digit values in tie numbers to standard “555”, ignoring number length. Experiment 2 (N=27) judged number length, ignoring digit identity. Targets varied in number length and numerical distance, creating congruent and incongruent conditions. ERP results revealed enhanced parieto-occipital N1 negativity (~120–150 ms) for longer numbers, indicating early number length encoding regardless of visual confounds. Central P2p (~150–190 ms) reflected refined numerical distance processing. Centro-parietal P3 (~300–360 ms) showed congruity effects only when numerical magnitude was task-relevant. These findings reveal three distinct processing stages: early encoding (N1), refined magnitude comparison (P2p), and conflict resolution (P3). This novel neurophysiological evidence showcases the unique influence of number length and numerical syntax on magnitude evaluation.",

          "abstract": "While several French-language scales assess climate anxiety, no tool captures the broader spectrum of climate emotions. Yet the emotional experience of the environmental crisis is multidimensional and the Inventory of Climate Emotions (ICE)  was developed and validated to address this gap. This study aimed to validate its French version and use it to identify emotional profiles among young French people (18-30 years old, N=1650). Psychometric analysis revealed good sensitivity, acceptable reliability and satisfactory indicators for several validity aspects (structural, convergent, divergent, nomological) – although powerlessness and hope showed consistently weaker indices. The Latent Profile Analysis conducted to identify emotional patterns revealed four distinct profiles, including three \"atypical\" ones (hostile, angry and affected) significantly associated with gender, political orientation or connectedness to nature. This study thus provides a validated instrument assessing climate emotions in French-speaking contexts, with potential applications in interventions and research settings – including the study of climate emotion profiles.",

          "abstract": "The present review examines bias against transgender women and men and bias against people with nonbinary gender identities. A central contention is that many people hold false beliefs about transgender men’s and women’s membership in the categories “male” and “female,” and, separately, view nonbinary gender identities themselves as illegitimate. Both discounting transgender men’s and women’s membership in the categories “male” and “female” and discounting the validity of nonbinary gender identities are forms of bias, and studying them will be essential to build a more nuanced understanding of stereotyping and prejudice. The authors review the literature on bias against transgender people and bias against nonbinary people, discuss the methodological and theoretical challenges in studying these biases, propose an approach for interpreting results in light of common (mis)categorization processes, and consider avenues for future research.",

Experimental studies have demonstrated that imagining a sustainable future increases pro-environmental intentions and support for environmental activism. However, the impact of these imagined futures depends on subjective appraisals—individuals who view a sustainable world positively are more likely to act. Additionally, emphasizing “co-benefits” of sustainable futures, such as stronger communities and increased well-being, enhances support for climate solutions. Other key features determining the effectiveness of interventions are a sense of collective efficacy and hope in creating the imagined future, and a sense of identification with a movement striving towards positive change.

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the form of large language models (LLMs) or chatbots, has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives. In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human–machine\ninteraction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how can we\nrigorously measure these biases?\nWe address this challenge by introducing STAMP-LLM (Standardized Test &amp; Assessment Measurement Protocol for LLMs), a principled two-phase framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases: (i) a Definitional phase for construct mapping, item development, and expert review; and (ii) a Data/Analysis phase for protocol control (prompts/decoding), automated sampling,\npre-specified scoring, and basic reliability/validity checks. We illustrate STAMP-LLM on racial bias using one explicit and two implicit measures.",

We propose that the evidencebased cognitive behavioral therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), is particularly\nwell-suited to be paired with the administration of MDMA for PTSD. Specifically: 1) the\nsubjective effects of MDMA directly support key ACT processes; 2) ACT methods could help\nprepare patients for MDMA administration, increasingly the likelihood of efficacy and\ntolerability; 3) ACT provides a “process-directed” approach to assist the therapist and help the\npatient during MDMA administration sessions; and 4) ACT may help optimize the integration of\nMDMA experiences to shape adaptive functioning and promote quality of life following\ntreatment. We provide examples of how ACT methods could be used for many of these goals.

Prior research has frequently investigated the neural correlates of FA and OM states utilizing electroencephalographic (EEG) methods, focusing on changes in spectral power within theta and alpha bands. Yet the functional significance of these neural changes has remained unclear. Here we utilized a fully-within subject state induction protocol to more directly test whether EEG spectral power during FA and OM is differentially associated with subjective ratings of state mindfulness.  \nMethods: While continuous EEG was recorded, participants engaged in audio-guided FA and OM practices, as well as an active control condition (C), and then self-reported their state mindfulness afterwards. Linear mixed effects models were used to rigorously assess how condition-level variation in spectral power predicted state mindfulness scores across the three inductions. \nResults: Validating the approach, participants reported higher state mindfulness and decreased theta power during both FA and OM relative to C; additionally, reduced alpha power was found in OM relative to FA. Most importantly, increased theta power was associated with higher state mindfulness in FA and even more strongly in OM, whereas reduced alpha power was linked to higher state mindfulness selectively in OM. \nConclusions:  These findings add to the growing literature suggesting that FA and OM represent distinct mindfulness states. We further establish that the functional significance of theta and alpha power is context-dependent, clearly linking these neural measures to the subjective quality of specific meditation states and practices.",

In this work, we explore how recognition of items is impacted when temporal context change is operationalized implicitly through the order of presentation during the study phase. 57 participants, were exposed to a rotation judgment cover task for 15 randomly generated polygon items. Around half of the participants were presented with these items in a random order.

Similar to findings where boundaries are explicitly operationalized, we show that implicit boundaries are also better remembered than non-boundary items.",

With the roots of computational psychiatry more in theoretical and neuroscience than clinical fields, research has often focused on the identification of symptomatic correlates of computational processes.

          "abstract": "The present study investigated predictors of individual differences in linguistic knowledge and spontaneous language use in adults. Specifically, we examined the role of domain-general cognitive abilities—working memory, nonverbal reasoning, and processing speed—alongside implicit motivational factors, including achievement, power, and affiliation motives and activity inhibition. Linguistic knowledge was assessed through multiple tests covering receptive and productive vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and comprehension of fixed expressions, whereas language use was examined through participants’ written narratives in the Picture Story Exercise (PSE), analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework. Network and path analyses revealed that auditory working memory positively predicted linguistic knowledge and analytic language use, highlighting its role in the sequential organization and consolidation of verbal material. Visual working memory was unrelated to knowledge but predicted more authentic language use, suggesting a link to imagery-based and self-referential expression. Nonverbal reasoning supported knowledge but was negatively related to authenticity, indicating a trade-off between systematic abstraction and spontaneity. Processing speed, while crucial in early language development, did not predict knowledge in adults and was negatively associated with narrative word count, suggesting that efficiency may reduce elaboration in spontaneous production. Contrary to our predictions, implicit motives and activity inhibition were unrelated to both linguistic knowledge and language use. Together, these findings underscore how distinct domain-general abilities shape static linguistic knowledge and dynamic language use, highlighting the need for integrative models of adult language skills.",

We explore how capacity-building in evidence synthesis methods and science communication can prepare students to facilitate the responsible and informed use of research evidence by others.

          "authors": "Matthew Blanchard; Eugene Aidman; Lazar Stankov; Sabina Kleitman",
          "abstract": "When individuals collaborate, they often rely on momentary estimates of their own and their partner’s confidence (decision confidence) to guide collective decisions and achieve their goals. Through interaction, these confidence estimates tend to align over time. This  process is known as confidence matching. More stable, dispositional trait confidence is also emerging as a key factor shaping the dynamics and outcomes of collaborative action. We examined how trait confidence and type of communication impact the accuracy of dyadic decisions, decision confidence, and the dynamics of decision confidence, including confidence matching. \n\nIn this study, 210 participants completed general knowledge tests individually and collaboratively, forming 105 dyads. The tests were completed under three communication conditions: isolated (no interaction), passive (viewing the partner’s response and numeric confidence rating), and active (verbal discussion). Participants assessed as high-trait or low-trait confidence (controlling for cognitive ability) were allocated to three types of dyads: low-trait (two low-trait members), mixed-trait (one low-trait and one high member), or high-trait (two high-trait members) confidence dyads.\nTrait confidence moderated decision accuracy and decision confidence gains: dyads with mixed-trait or high-trait confidence showed greater decision accuracy improvements in the active than the passive communication condition compared to their individual decisions. Whereas low-trait confidence dyads benefited equally from active and passive communication. Collaboration increased decision confidence overall, especially for high-trait confidence dyads under active communication. Confidence matching occurred rapidly in both passive and active communication but predicted decision accuracy gains only in the passive condition where participants had limited social information. \n\nAlthough active verbal communication led to the greatest overall decision accuracy, these gains were not driven by confidence matching. Our findings highlight the critical role of trait confidence in shaping collaborative outcomes in dyads and extend previous research by showing that confidence matching occurs naturally during verbal communication.",

          "abstract": "A collective intelligence factor (CI) was introduced by prior research to characterize the cognitive ability of groups. Surprisingly, individual intelligence did not predict CI. Instead, it correlated with individual social sensitivity, the equality of conversational turn-taking and the proportion of females in a group. However, these findings may depend on the type of tasks completed by groups. Our study re-examined these relationships by (1) testing the robustness of the CI factor in dyads using well-structured tasks guided by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence; (2) exploring the relationship between dyadic CI and metacognitive confidence, which is known to influence group processes and outcomes; and (3) identifying the psychological characteristics of distinct dyad types using Latent Profile Analysis.\nWe measured CI in 105 undergraduate dyads using three group tasks aligned with the broad abilities of the CHC model. Individual intelligence was assessed using Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices. We also measured social sensitivity, proportion of females, equality of turn taking, working memory, and personality.\nResults indicated that individual intelligence and confidence were the strongest predictors of dyadic CI for well-structured tasks, contrasting with previous findings emphasizing social factors. While we replicated the relationship with social sensitivity, we did not replicate the findings for equality of turn taking or gender composition. Latent Profile Analysis identified three psychological profiles: dyads performing consistently high individually and collectively, those performing consistently low, and those performing better collectively than individually. Our ‘smarter’ dyads consisted of intelligent and confident individuals with higher social sensitivity.\nThese findings suggest that, in dyads performing well-structured tasks, individual cognitive abilities and confidence play significant roles in CI. This challenges the emphasis on social factors and underscores the importance of task selection.",

          "authors": "Simar Moussaoui; Adam Frost; Matthias Niemeier",
          "abstract": "Recent research emphasizes how working memory (WM) supports action in dynamic environments. But action almost always involves fast, “saccadic” eye movements that challenge WM representations, requiring spatial remapping and distorting spatial perception, especially along the saccade direction. To capture the impact of these distortions, we used a spatial WM task where participants, after a saccade or fixation, indicated remembered locations of memory items with a mouse. From the responses we extracted multiple measures of spatial error: response variability, shifts relative to the fixation point, rotations, compression and nonlinear distortions of space. These measures submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA) yielded two components: systematic and unsystematic spatial error both of which were correlated with established WM tasks, showing their relevance for WM fidelity. Systematic error revealed a centripetal bias, pulling towards spatial anchors like the fixation point and the memory array’s centre of mass. This suggests that systematic error reflects a spatial scaffold that encodes relational information but is inherently imprecise. Saccades increased both error components and amplified WM load effects. Notably, we found that distortions of systematic error were especially pronounced along saccade direction for items that were remapped across visual fields, implying that WM fidelity is more vulnerable when information needs to pass through the corpus callosum. Together, our findings are consistent with the idea of WM actively reconstructing spatial information. They offer new insights into how saccades and spatial remapping shape WM in a dynamic world.",

          "abstract": "Fairness is typically assumed to be in the moral domain, yet recent work shows that young children may not view unfairness as a moral transgression. We investigated whether this may be because the harm caused by unfairness is less salient than the harm caused by more prototypical moral transgressions. We found that both 4-year-olds and adults rated unfairness more seriously when the harm caused by the unfairness was emphasized rather than not emphasized. When asked to categorize unfairness as either moral or conventional, 4-year-olds did not systematically choose either category. Most adults, on the other hand, categorized unfairness with conventional transgressions. These findings suggest that perceptions of unfairness exist along a continuum and are influenced by the salience of the harm caused by unfairness. Highlighting the harm inflicted by unfairness may be an important way to move people, from an early age, to notice and correct it.",

          "abstract": "To address the reference issue, a refined conceptual framework, a parallax view, clarifies how multi-scale electric potentials, electric fields, current sources, and reference strategies interrelate. Electric potentials, introduced historically to simplify mathematics, are physically meaningful only when expressed as differences. The so-called zero potential at infinity is clarified physically by focusing on the electric field, an unambiguously real physical entity.\nMeasures of functional connectivity like coherence are affected by reference, volume conduction, and the spatial scale of description. Nonetheless, the common average reference (CAVE or CAR) yields robust information, even though coherence between specific electrode pairs is uncertain. CAVE’s strength lies in treating all electrode sites equally, without prior assumptions about brain sources or volume conductor models. \nCAVE may benefit more from increased electrode density and reduced inter-electrode spacing than from extending electrode array coverage to lower head locations. With average center-to-center spacing below about 2.5 cm, CAVE accurately represents recorded potential relative to the average potential over the underlying scalp—without implying that this average is zero. Electric field measurements can usefully supplement CAVE measurements, the proposed parallax view. \nHigh-density recordings enable accurate estimation of scalp tangential electric fields, an extension of simple bipolar recording to the entire array. Such measure provides estimates of electric field magnitudes and directions, expressed as contour maps and streaming vector maps, respectively. Field magnitude maps sometimes resemble Laplacian maps depending on sources; streaming vector maps provide directions and strengths of scalp currents.  Because electric fields are inherently reference-free, only volume conduction remains as a barrier distorting coherence and other measures of dynamic source behavior.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While a growing body of literature has sought to understand factors connected to LGBQ+ acceptance and support by religious individuals, these factors remain understudied in religious leaders. Extant findings on LGBQ+ support among non-religious and even religious individuals may not directly apply to religious leaders, given leaders’ unique roles as religious and spiritual authorities. METHOD: Using a nationally representative sample of religious leaders from the 2020 National Survey of Religious Leaders (N = 1,600), we tested preregistered hypotheses to examine overall levels of LGBQ+ support and psychosocial, religious, and spiritual correlates, as well as potential congregational moderators. RESULTS: Results reveal overall low LGBQ+ support among U.S. religious leaders, with psychosocial factors (e.g., identifying as White, woman, higher education, income) and religious/spiritual struggles associated with greater support, while greater religious fundamentalism and prayer are associated with lower support. Religious fundamentalism emerged as the strongest predictor of lower LGBQ+ support across all analyses. Although congregation size did not moderate this relationship, congregational racial composition and religious tradition did influence the strength of the fundamentalism and LGBQ+ support association. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Religious leaders represent a key stakeholder group in the pursuit of increased rights and support for LGBQ+ people, yet this study reveals a significant disconnect between their attitudes and broader population trends toward acceptance. Community and policy stakeholders should collaborate with religious institutions, denominations, and theological seminaries to promote interpretive frameworks that encourage theological nuance, which emerged as the primary barrier to LGBQ+ support.",

While the effect has been shown in static stimuli of person identity, such as faces, it is unclear if it applies to dynamic person identity representations such as human voices. In two studies (NS1 = 238 with spoken sentences, NS2 = 88 with spoken words) university students engaged in exposure, rating, and validation tasks. We observed increased liking of voices with 8 initial repetitions for the sentences. Voices initially presented 2 and 5 times were liked less than unfamiliar voices and recognised as familiar with less confidence than voices initially presented 8 times, forming an inverted “U” in likeability and familiarity. Less experience with the speaker’s accent weakened the inverted “U” in liking.

          "abstract": "Autistic people could benefit from tDCS that (transcranial direct current stimulation) in social and cognitive areas. This article discusses how tDCS affects ASD and social interaction. Several randomised controlled studies and a meta-analysis suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves social functioning and reduces once more in a behaviour. Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) procedures could also affect in trial results due to electrode location, current strength, and stimulation duration. Because of the small sample size and lack in the follow-up, more study is needed. Due to the disparity, tDCS and approaches need more research. Future ASD, tDCS research should include larger sample numbers, longer follow-ups, and more subpopulations. Research is needed to discover if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can treat autism. Contradictory evidence shows that consistent and accurate tDCS outcomes require well-established techniques. Autism research needs to examine the neurological consequences of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and appropriate stimulation settings. The research on the brain underpinnings of social cognition and conduct in tDCS is needed to improve therapies.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is to dissociate perception from awareness using\nrigorous, bias-free methods. Traditional approaches often suffer from two key limitations: the\ncriterion biases in reporting perceptual (un)awareness, and the criterion content fallacy, where\nawareness measures do not capture the specific information required to perform the perceptual\ntask. These problems are compounded by the widespread use of single-object paradigms, which\ntypically involve presenting isolated stimuli near threshold and suppressing them with masking\ntechniques. These constraints result in a low signal-to-noise ratio that severely limits sensitivity to\ndetect effects, and offer low ecological validity. Here we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nensemble perception that overcomes these long-standing limitations. Experiment 1 used a bias-free\ntwo-interval forced-choice task in which observers had to discriminate the predominant category in\nensembles comprising animate and inanimate items and also detect which interval contained the\ntask-relevant features Experiment 2 extended these findings with a single-interval design, addressing\nconcerns about potential detection inefficiencies. Multiple control analyses across experiments\ndemonstrate robust unconscious ensemble perception: observers reliably discriminated\nensemble-level properties even when detection of the task-relevant features was at chance.\nAdditionally, Bayesian ideal observer modeling anchors these findings within a computational\naccount of unconscious perception. Together, our findings demonstrate that perceptual processing\nof complex visual summaries can occur without conscious awareness - a phenomenon we term\nensemble blindsight. The work offers a new framework for studying visual consciousness beyond\nthe limits of traditional single-target paradigms.",

Across two preregistered studies (N = 504, 158) and a re-analysis of previously published data (N = 50), we rigorously examined outcome-irrelevant learning under conditions of explicit instruction and extensive training. In both cases, automatic value updating persisted even when participants clearly understood which features were non-predictive of reward, and reliance on these irrelevant values led to suboptimal choices. Moreover, working-memory capacity, known as a key regulatory resource, predicted the magnitude of this automatic outcome-irrelevant learning. Collectively, our results broaden the concept of automatic cognitive processing beyond the selective-attention literature to encompass reinforcement-learning mechanisms.",

Both the book and the VSI are largely authored, peer-reviewed, and edited by individuals affiliated with an NGO. A central issue addressed throughout the paper is the rationale for transforming book chapters into articles for a peer-reviewed journal. The motivation, perhaps, can be found in the editors’ own words, expressing their intent to use this “peer-reviewed and published” evidence to influence “policy-makers and practitioners across the world.” It is evident that articles published in peer-reviewed journals carry significantly more weight in shaping public policy than a book released by an NGO. This does not imply that the book or the special issue contain research of poor quality; however, it raises important questions about the transparency and rigor of the peer-review process.",

          "abstract": "Chronic pain is a complex and persistent condition that is influenced by psychological, behavioral, and social factors. Emerging research suggests that long-term pain is not only driven by nociceptive inputs, but also by maladaptive cognitive processes, emotional dysregulation, and unhelpful behavioral patterns. Additionally, patient expectations and clinician communication significantly influenced treatment outcomes. This scoping review synthesizes interdisciplinary findings from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and empirical studies published over the past two decades and identified through databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Only English-language studies involving human subjects were included. The findings reveal that cognitive distortions, such as catastrophizing and attentional bias, along with affective disturbances, such as anxiety and depression, are consistently associated with heightened pain perception and poorer recovery. Maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and reduced activity further contribute to disability. Patient satisfaction and treatment efficacy are strongly influenced by the alignment of expectations and the quality of provider communication. Integrated theoretical models, including the biopsychosocial model, fear-avoidance theory, and mindfulness-based approaches, offer a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing chronic pain. These psychosocial mechanisms highlight the importance of patient-centered strategies that address cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal dimensions. Future research should prioritize underrepresented groups, such as older adults, low-income populations, and culturally diverse communities, and focus on scalable theory-driven interventions tailored to their needs.",

Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior, we asked participants to reflect on their attitudes toward solitude, other people’s judgement toward their time alone, and their perceived control over managing solitude during retirement. Thematic analysis revealed themes related to general changes after retirement, including shifts in identity, the desire to balance social connection and alone time, as well as themes concerning factors that shape solitude experiences, such as personal autonomy and financial stability. While some participants embraced solitude as an opportunity for personal growth and well-being, others faced challenges such as boredom and isolation.

Our analyses revealed that participants (n = 210 from the US/UK) with higher subjective well-being, particularly those with more frequent positive affect, generated thoughts semantically more similar to 'friend,' but not to 'money.' A similar pattern was also found in an independent sample (n = 350 from South Korea), showing consistency of the findings across different cultural contexts. Notably, the semantic similarity of participants’ generated thoughts to 'friend' predicted the extent to which participants prioritized social relationships over monetary gains in a realistic dilemma task.

Providers report insufficient reimbursement rates and administrative burdens as reasons they do not accept insurance. We examined the importance of these barriers as well as the extent to which reimbursement rates would need to increase for private practice providers to accept insurance. Private practice mental health providers (i.e., psychologists, marriage and family therapists, mental health counselors, and social workers) completed an online survey containing two behavioral economic tasks. In the Criteria Ranking Task, providers (n = 326) ranked their most important barriers to not accepting insurance, reporting insufficient reimbursement rates as the most important, followed by administrative burdens. In the Hypothetical Demand Task, providers indicated the likelihood of accepting Medicare at various reimbursement rate increases with and without hypothetical administrative assistance. Doctoral providers (n = 188) reported considering accepting insurance if reimbursement rates increased 83% (Pmax = $188.97), while master’s-level providers (n = 112) reported 118% (Pmax = $168.51). If provided administrative assistance, participants indicated they would accept insurance following 100% rate increases (Pmax = $206.28) for doctoral providers and 169% rate increases (Pmax = $207.90) for master’s-level providers. Results support existing research findings that insufficient reimbursement rates and administrative burdens are the primary barriers to mental health providers accepting insurance. Policy efforts to increase access to mental healthcare must consider the incentives and burdens that impact providers and their decision to participate in insurance network.",

This procedure frequently leads to a proportion of trials in which no response is made, and these omissions are often simply removed from the data during analysis. Here we show that this seemingly trivial assumption is in fact quite consequential for parameter estimation. We propose that omissions should instead be treated as observations to inform inference of the underlying generative process that led to their occurrence. Using new tools from likelihood-free inference applicable to a broad class of sequential sampling models (SSMs), we enable fast computation of omission probability without explicit integration, and clarify the degree to which omitting omissions – even in seemingly benign settings – can lead researchers astray. We explore this phenomenon in the setting of SSMs with constant and time-varying boundaries, and show that parameter recovery is improved by incorporating a model of omission probability. We show that the benefits of modeling omission probability are distinct from benefits gained from past approaches of modeling attentional lapses to account for these omissions. Our findings shine a light on the consequences of omitting omission in modeling choice behavior with SSMs, and demonstrate how joint modeling of observed and omitted data can improve parameter inference and therefore the reliability of downstream scientific conclusions.",

          "abstract": "Personalization is increasingly emphasized in behavioural public policy, yet traditional approaches to tailoring interventions remain costly and difficult to scale. Synthetic twin agents—AI-generated counterparts of real individuals—offer a novel, scalable approach. This study evaluates whether synthetic twins generated by large language models (LLMs) can replicate human responses to personality-tailored advertisements. We recruited 373 human participants and created matched synthetic twins using four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-5-latest, Gemini-1.5 Flash, and Gemini-2.0 Flash). Participants evaluated advertisements for three consumer products, each tailored to Big-Five personality traits. Both human participants and their synthetic twins demonstrated personality-congruent responses for Agreeableness and Extraversion. Synthetic twins additionally showed congruence for Conscientiousness and, in some cases, Neuroticism, depending on the model and product. Trait-level comparisons showed partial alignment: Gemini-1.5 Flash most closely replicated human patterns, followed by GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Flash; GPT-5-latest showed the weakest alignment. Despite trait-specific divergences, aggregate correlations between human and synthetic responses were high (r = .81-.91), indicating strong consistency in relative patterns. These findings provide early evidence that prompt-based multimodal LLMs can approximate human psychological responses. Synthetic twins may serve as low-cost tools for pre-testing personalized behavioural interventions, while also raising critical ethical concerns around privacy, governance, and hyper-personalization.",

          "authors": "Xiamin Leng; Alexander Fengler; Amitai Shenhav; Michael Frank",
          "abstract": "Response deadlines are commonly imposed in decision-making research to incentivize speedy decisions and sustained attention. This procedure frequently leads to a proportion of trials in which no response is made, and these omissions are often simply removed from the data during analysis. Here we show that this seemingly trivial assumption is in fact quite consequential for parameter estimation. We propose that omissions should instead be treated as observations to inform inference of the underlying generative process that led to their occurrence. Using new tools from likelihood-free inference applicable to a broad class of sequential sampling models (SSMs), we enable fast computation of omission probability without explicit integration, and clarify the degree to which omitting omissions – even in seemingly benign settings – can lead researchers astray. We explore this phenomenon in the setting of SSMs with constant and time-varying boundaries, and show that parameter recovery is improved by incorporating a model of omission probability. We show that the benefits of modeling omission probability are distinct from benefits gained from past approaches of modeling attentional lapses to account for these omissions. Our findings shine a light on the consequences of omitting omission in modeling choice behavior with SSMs, and demonstrate how joint modeling of observed and omitted data can improve parameter inference and therefore the reliability of downstream scientific conclusions.",

          "abstract": "How do we recognize words and assign a pronunciation? Computational models provide a formal description of the mechanisms and principles that guide the reading process. I review and evaluate the Interactive-Activation Model (IAM), Dual Route Cascaded (DRC) model, the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) model, and the Connectionist Dual Processing (CDP) model, as well as LEX, a variant of the MINERVA model of memory. I evaluate each model’s ability to account for consistency effects, serial effects, syllable effects, and phonological effects. Consistency effects pose a problem for the rule-based pronunciation of the DRC. Serial effects pose a problem for the purely parallel PDP models. Phonological effects pose a problem for all models save CDP. All models suffer from the distribution problem, weakening each model’s ability to learn spelling-to-sound relationships. LEX is the only model that handles polysyllabic words. As none of the models provide a complete answer to the question of ‘how do we read?’, ‘how do we pronounce?’, or ‘how do we recognize words?’, I outline a set of principles as guidelines for future model development. Models of reading should learn, include a visual attention mechanism, be sensitive to phonology, and account for meaning and spelling in addition to recognizing words and pronouncing them.",

          "abstract": "Mediation analysis allows empirical researchers to study how an exposure variable affects an outcome variable through one or more intervening variables. Over the years, mediation analysis has become one of the most widely used statistical techniques in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. Yet the most popular techniques for mediation analysis rely strongly on normality assumptions and are therefore susceptible to the influence of outliers or nonnormal distributions. We review common mediation models and discuss various approaches for estimation and inference, including their implementation in software packages. Moreover, we present robust alternatives, thereby clarifying different notions of robustness. We further consider a setting where the mediation model holds in a latent space but where measurement issues create deviations from normality assumptions in the observed variable space, which is a setting not commonly considered in the literature on robust mediation analysis, and we obtain preliminary results via a simulation study. Finally, we highlight the mechanics and relevance of robust methods in an an illustrative empirical application.",

          "abstract": "Parenting is closely linked to children’s social-emotional development, including externalizing behavior, peer relationships, and emotion regulation. However, most existing research has examined these associations using single parenting behaviors or predefined parenting styles, thereby neglecting the complex co-occurrence of different parenting practices. To address this limitation, the present study applied a person-centered approach using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify distinct parenting profiles and explore their associations with child socioemotional skills. Based on reports of parenting behavior from parents of N = 254 kindergarten children (51.2% female, M = 6.0 years, SD = 0.62), three parenting profiles emerged: supportive (66%), engaged-disciplinary (22%), and harsh (12%). Associations with teacher-rated outcomes showed that children exposed to engaged-disciplinary parenting displayed more peer problems. In comparison, children assigned to the harsh parenting group showed more behavioral problems and, unexpectedly, stronger emotion regulation skills. The findings underscore the need to tailor support to specific subgroups of parents with distinct parenting behaviors, to strengthen positive parenting behaviors, and, in turn, promote the development of children.",

          "abstract": "To navigate the ever-changing and information-overladen environment it is crucial to selectively process relevant information and ignore distraction. Recently, the salient-signal-suppression hypothesis has stimulated much research and theoretical debates in attention research. It claims that – under certain conditions – salient distractors are suppressed at the search-guiding priority map and therefore speed-up search as compared to neutral (non-suppressed) non-targets. An alternative interpretation claims that these salient distractors are simply ignored. Using a novel paradigm to control search order and measure search speed, we here provide evidence that this speed-up is neither due to suppression on the priority map nor simple ignoring, but instead due to speeded processing and rejection of the salient distractor relative to each non-target. In particular, we show that the speed-up occurs only when the distractor is processed before the target and that distractor processing takes less time than processing a non-target. These findings not only call into question the predominant explanations of the distractor-speed-up effect and thereby shed new light on the attentional-capture debate, but also provide striking evidence that not all searches are guided by the priority map.",

          "abstract": "Personalization is increasingly emphasized in behavioural public policy, yet traditional approaches to tailoring interventions remain costly and difficult to scale. Synthetic twin agents—AI-generated counterparts of real individuals—offer a novel, scalable approach. This study evaluates whether synthetic twins generated by large language models (LLMs) can replicate human responses to personality-tailored advertisements. We recruited 373 human participants and created matched synthetic twins using four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-5-latest, Gemini-1.5 Flash, and Gemini-2.0 Flash). Participants evaluated advertisements for three consumer products, each tailored to Big-Five personality traits. Both human participants and their synthetic twins demonstrated personality-congruent responses for Agreeableness and Extraversion. Synthetic twins additionally showed congruence for Conscientiousness and, in some cases, Neuroticism, depending on the model and product. Trait-level comparisons showed partial alignment: Gemini-1.5 Flash most closely replicated human patterns, followed by GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Flash; GPT-5-latest showed the weakest alignment. Despite trait-specific divergences, aggregate correlations between human and synthetic responses were high (r = .81-.91), indicating strong consistency in relative patterns. These findings provide early evidence that prompt-based multimodal LLMs can approximate human psychological responses. Synthetic twins may serve as low-cost tools for pre-testing personalized behavioural interventions, while also raising critical ethical concerns around privacy, governance, and hyper-personalization.",

While these tools can amplify productivity, they risk eroding the cognitive foundations of expertise by simulating the very tasks through which scientific competence is developed, from synthesis to experimental design to writing. Uncritical reliance can lead to skill atrophy and AI complacency. To counter this, we propose a framework of essential AI meta-skills—strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration—that constitute a new form of scientific literacy distinct from traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we propose how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy. Proactive development of this AI-augmented expertise is necessary to shape a future where technology amplifies, rather than attenuates, scientific thought.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that anorexia nervosa (AN) may be characterized by subtle alterations in learning that could relate to symptom maintenance and treatment outcomes. However, findings in this area have been mixed, and there have been few efforts to date to summarize this literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to analyze existing literature that tested different facets of learning in samples of individuals with AN compared to other groups. In line with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an initial search in April 2024 on PSYCInfo and PubMed and an updated search in July 2025, yielding an initial sample of 1,831 articles, of which 194 were fully assessed for eligibility. Our final review included 130 articles; coding, extraction, and synthesis of results occurred from April 2024 to August 2025. Included studies predominantly were cross-sectional in nature, tested group differences between those actively ill with AN and control subjects who had no history of psychopathology, and used neuropsychological tasks primarily gauging episodic learning (e.g., verbal or visuospatial learning) or associative learning (e.g., reversal learning). Qualitative synthesis of these findings suggests that while there appear to be alterations in learning among individuals with AN compared to controls, the significance and specific pattern of learning differences is inconsistent. It is likely that heterogeneity exists within AN and other eating disorders across development, stage of illness, and clinical phenotypes. Future research that begins to characterize meaningful heterogeneity and adopts methods such as computational modeling may offer promising methods for improving the characterization of and treatments for this devastating condition.",

          "abstract": "A person’s gaze can be highly informative—it can reveal which people, objects, or places interest the person, and it can help observers predict what they might do next. It can also be difficult to understand. Relative to actions for which someone physically contacts a target (e.g., by reaching and touching), gaze may be difficult to understand because of the physical distance between the action and target. Indeed, classic research suggests that before 12 months of age, infants do not readily track the targets of others’ gaze. However, studies on the development of gaze understanding have mostly presented infants with unfamiliar adults acting on inanimate objects. Here, we provide evidence that 8- to 9-month-old infants can track the targets of their parents' gaze when that gaze was directed at a potential social partner: an animate puppet. When infants observed their own parents look toward an animate puppet, they expected them to continue looking towards the same puppet later. Infants did not have the same expectations when their parents looked toward inanimate objects, nor when they observed the gaze of an unfamiliar adult. Thus, before infants track the targets of object-directed gaze, they already track the targets of their parents’ social gaze. These findings are consistent with the possibility that social relevance shapes infants’ understanding of others’ actions.",

This report applies latent class analysis to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2015–2020) to examine patterns of subjective cognitive decline in U.S. adults aged 45 and older. Using responses to a structured five-item cognitive function module, three distinct and interpretable subgroups—Mild, Moderate, and Severe cognitive decline—were identified. Each class exhibited unique symptom profiles and socio-demographic associations, with greater severity linked to lower income, lower education levels, and poorer general health. The optimal three-class model was supported by multiple fit indices, including AIC, BIC, entropy, and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test. Conditional response probability tables and profile plots further validated the internal structure of the classes. Additional visualizations illustrated the distribution of socioeconomic covariates across latent classes. This analysis underscores the value of latent class analysis for enhancing measurement precision, revealing hidden population structures, and informing targeted interventions. Future research should focus on integrating LCA with causal frameworks, machine learning techniques, and cross-cohort validation to improve its utility in real-world settings. The approach demonstrated here provides a replicable model for analyzing complex survey data in aging and cognitive health research.",

          "abstract": "Causal mediation analysis provides a rigorous framework for dissecting the pathways through which an exposure exerts its effects on an outcome—an especially critical endeavor in observational epidemiology where complex, multifactorial relationships prevail. This report introduces the conceptual foundations and methodological execution of causal mediation analysis, using a population-based study on parity and dementia risk from the HUNT cohort in Norway as a motivating example. The study employed inverse odds weighting to evaluate whether midlife psychosocial, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health-related factors mediated the observed U-shaped association between the number of children and late-life dementia risk. Despite robust longitudinal data and comprehensive adjustment for confounding, the mediation analysis revealed that these potential pathways did not explain the elevated dementia risk among childless individuals or those with one or four or more children. This suggests that the relationship may be primarily direct or influenced by unmeasured mechanisms. The report highlights key methodological requirements—including proper temporal sequencing, confounder control, and sensitivity analyses—and provides visual and tabular summaries of effect decomposition. It concludes by outlining limitations and future directions, emphasizing the importance of enhancing methodological flexibility to address time-varying mediators and complex causal structures in life-course epidemiologic research.",

Fifteen parents participated for the reliability evaluation, alongside school staff. Reliability was assessed via a 7-day test–retest procedure; face and content validity were established through expert review. Payment data were collected for one term pre-intervention (baseline) and one term post-intervention.\nFindings: The tool reliability yielded r = 0.82 and was rated as clear and user-friendly by most participants. Average on-time payment rates for the four schools increased from 72.74% (SD = 6.65) at baseline to 86.74% (SD = 5.79) post-intervention – a 14% percentage-point improvement t = -7.43, p &lt; 0.05). \nConclusion: The BCS is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective intervention for improving school fee compliance.

Motivated by a recent study on individuals with eating disorders and type 2 diabetes, this report explores the application of computerized adaptive testing as a solution to the limitations of traditional fixed-form assessments. By leveraging item response theory, the adaptive test dynamically selects the most informative items for each respondent, substantially reducing the number of items administered while maintaining high measurement accuracy. Using a comprehensive dataset that included newly developed items for depression, anxiety, and positive affect, researchers evaluated item quality, confirmed statistical assumptions, and validated adaptive scores against a standardized benchmark. Simulations demonstrated strong correlations between adaptive and full-length assessments, with significant reductions in testing time and clear differentiation between clinical and healthy groups. The report presents key tables and figures—including test information curves, item parameter summaries, and validity metrics—to illustrate the technical rigor and practical benefits of adaptive testing. While the approach offers distinct advantages in reducing burden and enhancing comparability, it also requires robust item banks and careful calibration.

          "abstract": "People often turn to others for support in managing their emotions. This process of social emotion regulation has become a key focus of research, given its connection to wellbeing and its ubiquity in human relationships. Social emotion regulation often unfolds via language, where a support provider verbally offers perspectives that aim to improve another person’s emotional state. But what linguistic features influence the efficacy of social emotion regulation? Inspired by research showing that emotion reactivity is lower in a bilingual’s second language (L2) than their first language (L1), here we tested whether social emotion regulation is also more effective in a bilingual’s L2 than their L1. We preregistered countervailing hypotheses, as regulation could either be more effective in L1 (due to increased familiarity and fluency), L2 (due to decreased emotional intensity), or equivalent across languages. In this study, 250 Spanish-English bilinguals (~100% women) were presented with negative images before hearing audio recordings either describing the negative contents of the image or reinterpreting those contents to be more positive (i.e., social reappraisal) in either L1 (Spanish) or L2 (English). Social reappraisals lowered participants’ negative affect in both languages, but reappraisal efficacy did not differ across languages. Nonetheless, participants reported lower negative affect overall on English than Spanish trials, extending prior work demonstrating reduced emotional intensity in L2. These results suggest that Spanish-English bilinguals may equally benefit from social reappraisal in both of their languages, guiding basic research on language, emotion, and cognitive control, as well as translational applications for bilinguals.",

Validated scales and behavioural tasks have evolved alongside these conceptual shifts, and when integrated with computational modelling, may help reveal mechanisms underlying anhedonia. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant computational framework for studying anhedonia, but fails to fully capture anticipation and motivation. We reviewed the operationalization and measurement of anhedonia from a historical perspective, and conducted a scoping review and critical appraisal of 19 computational models using a structured appraisal guide to assess face, construct and predictive validity. We focussed on generative models (i.e., models that can simulate behavioural data) that were paired with measures of anhedonia in both clinical and non-clinical samples. Model types include RL models, RL integrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging, and models of decision making, effort expenditure, and selective attention. Our review suggests that anhedonia-related deficits span not only reward processing, but also executive and sensory processing. Models generally demonstrated face validity, lacked predictive validity, and showed construct validity for cognitive-behavioural, but not neurobiological, domains. We propose an integrative, systems neuroscience-inspired approach, which aligns with multidimensional definitions of anhedonia.",

Data in non-clinical voice hearers suggest that voice hearing may involve sensitivity to speech in degraded stimuli. This has yet to be examined in people with schizophrenia. In this case-control study, we presented sine-wave-speech (SWS; made by replacing the formants in speech with pure tone whistles) to people with schizophrenia (SZ, n=63) and healthy controls (HC; n=27). SWS is typically unintelligible on first exposure. However, once the listener knows that it is potentially intelligible as speech (by exposure to the unaltered speech template, which thus serves as a prior expectation), relatively high levels of comprehension are achieved. Our participants first listened to intelligible and unintelligible SWS and reported whether they heard speech. They were then exposed to the speech templates, and then the first phase was repeated. Compared to HC, people with SZ reported hearing more speech before template exposure. The Reveal increased both groups’ false alarms and reporting of speech, but there was no interaction with group. Change in hit rates after the Reveal correlated with hallucinations, which is consistent with a greater influence of the priors enhancement in SZ patients who hear voices. These findings suggest that people with SZ have stronger expectations of speech. This task has validity for hallucinatory voice hearing. It is also simple and convenient to administer, and may prove useful in detecting prodromal risk, as well as acute exacerbation in voice hearing.",

          "abstract": "Prescription stimulant diversion (i.e., giving, selling, or trading one’s medication) and non-medical prescription stimulant use (i.e., using in a way not prescribed) are common among undergraduates; however, few evidence-based interventions target these behaviors. This study evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of a 30-minute, interactive web-based intervention providing psychoeducation around diversion and non-medical use, practice refusing medication requests, and strategies for medication adherence. College students (Mage=20.42 years; 74% female; 86% White) with current stimulant prescriptions from three US universities were randomized to the intervention (n=128) or attention-matched placebo (n=121) in a single-blind design, with 1- and 2-month boosters and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Primary outcomes were diversion, non-medical use, and diversion intentions; secondary outcomes were perceived norms, perceived risk, self-efficacy to resist diversion and non-medical use, and prescriber communication. Contrary to pre-registered hypotheses, intervention participants did not decrease in number of diversion or non-medical use episodes. There were small-to-medium effects on risk perceptions (d=0.39 [0.12-0.68]), perceived non-medical use norms (d=0.51 [0.24-0.76]), and self-efficacy to avoid non-medical use (d=0.47 [0.10-0.85]), but no effects on other outcomes. Exploratory analyses showed a 76% reduction in odds of any diversion (OR=0.24 [0.08-0.68]) and a 60% reduction of any non-medical use (OR=0.40 [0.21-0.77]) for intervention participants during the 6-month follow-up period. This brief intervention was acceptable and feasible to implement and evidenced some efficacy in increasing risk perceptions and self-efficacy and changing perceived norms. Since the intervention did not decrease number of diversion or misuse episodes, however, future intervention refinements may tailor content to different levels of diversion and misuse risk.",

          "authors": "Brian K. Sullivan",
          "abstract": "The domain of affectivity is broad and complex, with a rich history, albeit one that reflects a\nstruggle to operationalize the target of its focus. Nevertheless, affectivity is the foundation of an\nemerging field referred to as affective determinants of health (ADoH), offering insights into\nemotions, moods, and other subjective phenomena that qualify as affective experiences in human\nhealth and functioning. Presently, the ADoH field lacks a coherent model and assessment\nframework for healthcare and wellness practitioners to translate and leverage the affectivity\ndomain practically and effectively. This work endeavors to offer a practical definition of\naffectivity that allows ostensibly different subjective phenomena as loneliness, pain, depression,\nfatigue, and others to be construed as affective experiences, particularly when considered\nthrough the lens of stress, which can serve as a bridge between the extensive bodies of medical\nresearch on stress and the field of discrete affects more commonly studied by psychologists. This\napproach positions certain affects as risk factors that comprise a foundation for clinical practice\nand research. By reviewing some of the most pertinent literature on stress and other affective\nexperiences, viewed through the lens of stress, this work then argues for the routine assessment\nof key ADoH risk factors, and the use of those indicators as transdiagnostic targets in population\nhealth management, prevention, and point-of-care encounters.",

With the advent of companies seeking to bring BCIs to market, a key remaining challenge for regulatory approval, reimbursement and clinical implementation of BCIs is the definition of clinical outcome measures that accurately reflect, and can be used to quantify, this impact. Here, we argue that ‘Relational Personhood’ needs to be integrated in the clinical outcome assessment (COA) of BCIs.

The most common myth was endorsed by over 60% of students and over 70% of the public. People endorsing more sexuality myths accepted fewer sexuality facts, endorsed more myths in other domains, and had a stronger conspiracy mentality. While virtually uncorrelated with sexual satisfaction and risk behavior, sexuality myth endorsement was associated with less confident sexual communication and, in the general public, lower life satisfaction and fewer safer sex practices. Participants demonstrated limited self-insight into their susceptibility to sexuality myths. These findings highlight the need for psychological research on sexuality myths and their consequences.",

          "authors": "Desiree R Jones; Monique Botha; Noah Sasson",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Autistic adults frequently experience social stigma, which may be compounded by additional marginalized identities such as race, gender, and sexual orientation. Black autistic adults, in particular, may face unique challenges at the intersection of racial bias and autism stigma. However, the experiences of autistic people with intersecting marginalized identities remain underexplored in research, contributing to a limited understanding of stigma’s impact across diverse communities.\nMethods: The current study sought to better characterize the social experiences of autistic people with intersecting identities, with an emphasis on Black autistic adults. 32 autistic adults (16 Black, 16 White) completed a semi-structured interview regarding their social experiences. Participants shared recent stories of peer exclusion, acceptance, discrimination and support that they had experienced, as well as their feelings surrounding these events. We recorded and transcribed these interviews and used an inductive, or data-driven, approach to thematic analysis to identify salient themes in the data. \nResults: We generated three intersectional themes, which encompassed the unique impact of stigma on those with intersecting identities. Specifically, these themes included: 1) identity-based discrimination shaped by race, gender, and LGBTQ+ status; (2) challenges in obtaining and processing an autism diagnosis; and (3) difficulties navigating personal identity, particularly among Black autistic participants. While autistic adults broadly reported stigma experiences, Black participants often described layered forms of exclusion related to both their race and autistic traits. Women and LGBTQ+ participants also reported distinct forms of marginalization and erasure. \nConclusion: These findings highlight how autism stigma intersects with other marginalized identities to shape social experiences. Black autistic adults, along with autistic women and LGBTQ+ autistic people, may encounter compounded barriers to acceptance, identity development, and belonging. These results underscore the need for more inclusive research and supports that attend to the diversity of autistic experiences.",

Our sample included 81 Syrian refugees between 10 and 17 years-old who resettled in Canada. Displacement in an Arabic-speaking country, shorter displacement durations, and older ages of L2 acquisition (L2 AoA) were associated with better L1 reading. Cross-linguistic transfer of phonological awareness (PA) to reading was overall greater in the L2-L1 direction, and migration experiences associated with better L1 reading were also associated with greater transfer in the L1-L2 direction.

In this study we combined scientific insights with participatory research (focus groups with youth and interviews with parents and police officers) to identify risk and protective factors in misinformation susceptibility. A total of n = 1980 participants aged 18 to 34 completed the Misinformation Susceptibility Test alongside validated measures of cognitive, social and ideological scales. Results showed that more social media use, more conservative political orientation, and higher bullshit receptivity predicted poorer veracity discernment, while higher education, greater need to belong, more openminded thinking and identifying as male predicted better discernment. Importantly, not all forms of social media use predicted equal veracity discernment, with active engagement (e.g., posting and reacting) being associated with worse veracity, while passive engagement (e.g., browsing) was associated with better veracity. In addition, results from a network analysis suggested that digital maturity may exert indirect beneficial effects on veracity discernment. These findings underscore that misinformation susceptibility is shaped by a constellation of cognitive, social, educational, and ideological factors. Beyond fostering education and analytic reasoning skills, interventions may need to target digital behaviors, peer norms and social motivational needs to build resilience against misinformation in young adult populations.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events worldwide. Using nationally representative survey data from 142 countries (N = 128,093), I found that people who have experienced a climate-related hazard are more likely to consider climate change a very serious threat than people who have not experienced the same hazard within the same country. These effects are consistent across eleven hazard types, with the effect of experiencing a heatwave being comparable in magnitude to that of having a university education. The increase in risk perception among those who have experienced a climate-related hazard does not appear to be clearly amplified or attenuated by a person's resilience, which is calculated by combining individual, household, community, and societal factors. Large differences in the effects are observed across countries for some hazards (e.g., droughts, heatwaves, and floods), whereas small differences are observed for others (e.g., hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires). At the country level, there does not appear to be an association between the proportion of people exposed to climate-related hazards and the proportion of people who perceive climate change as a threat. These results may help us anticipate public concern in a warming world and suggest promising avenues for future research.",

          "abstract": "Neuroticism is one of the most consequential personality traits for individuals and society. Interventions that facilitate desired changes in this trait may thus have far-reaching benefits. Initial evidence supports that interventions can foster lasting neuroticism change, but the mechanisms, direction, and timing of these effects remain unclear. Although most personality theories posit that changes in broad, enduring personality traits are mediated via changes in momentary personality states and intermediary trait-relevant habits, there are few direct tests of this theorized bottom-up process. Using data from the Changing How I Live Life Study (N = 446), which examined a digital intervention to reduce neuroticism, we examined 1) the shape and magnitude of intervention-induced changes in neuroticism across three timescales, 2) the associations among these changes, and 3) whether these associations varied across intervention strategies targeting different levels of neuroticism. Changes in momentary neuroticism reliably predicted changes in daily and weekly measures of neuroticism and vice versa, and changes across all three timescales were correlated with changes in generalized trait neuroticism from pre- to post-intervention. Together, these results support the conceptual relevance and causal importance of both bottom-up (i.e., momentary, short-term → enduring, longer term) and top-down (i.e., enduring, long-term → momentary, short-term) processes of personality change. Overall, this study provided a key test of theoretical predictions about the process and directionality of intervention-induced personality change and, in doing so, helped elucidate the mechanisms of intentional personality change and generate insights about how to enhance intervention efficacy.",

However, previous research remained silent about whether these predictive abilities rely on shared cognitive mechanisms. In a highly powered and preregistered study, we investigated whether the ability to predict in social settings is related across different modalities by comparing participants’ performance of predicting others’ actions and action outcomes as well as inferring emotional states. The results indicate that performance on all three tasks is moderately correlated. Principal component analyses underscore these results by showing that all three tasks share a common component. We also examined participants’ confidence in their judgments and found that participants are unaware of how good they are in predicting others’ actions. Taken together, our findings suggest a shared cognitive basis for diverse forms of social prediction, while also highlighting a disconnect between subjective confidence and objective accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sleep problems are linked to negative mental health outcomes, both of which rise in prevalence during adolescence and young adulthood. Existing evidence-based sleep treatments are effective but remain largely inaccessible for this age group. Young people also have lower agency over structural barriers affecting sleep (e.g., home environment, school start times).\n\nMethod: Project Sleep is a digital single-session intervention (SSI) designed with feedback from young people to meet their unique sleep needs. Participants included individuals aged 13-25 with self-reported sleep problems (N=759, Mage=18.7; 48% white, 81% girls, 38% LGBTQ+). Socioeconomic status (SES) ranged from 1-10 (M=6.4, SD=1.7). Structural sleep barriers were reported by 45%: uncomfortable temperature (20%), exceess noise (17%), shared rooms (13%), excess light (10%), nighttime workers in the home (7%), unstable living conditions (2%). Participants rated perceived importance of sleep and making a change to sleep, readiness for change, and perceived control over sleep pre- and post-SSI. Moderation models assessed whether structural factors influenced outcomes. T-tests and correlations tested whether participants’ subjective feedback differed by structural barriers.\n\nResults: Those experiencing structural barriers improved similarly to peers. However, lower SES participants (p = .02) and those in high-noise environments (p = .01) experienced smaller gains in perceived control. Those living with nighttime workers improved less in sleep change importance (p = .002), and those in unstable living conditions (p = .02) and uncomfortable temperature environments (p = .04) improved less in sleep importance. Conversely, participants in shared rooms improved more in perceived control (p = .03). There were no differences in participants’ feedback about their experience of the SSI by structural barrier.\n\nConclusions: This brief, accessible SSI provides proximal support for youth with structural sleep barriers, though could benefit from further adaptation. Future research will work with young people experiencing structural sleep barriers to better address their needs.",

Questions about changes in personality functioning are of critical relevance for theory development and psychotherapeutic treatment of personality pathology, yet little is known about its longitudinal development. Using a sample of German-speaking young adults (N = 1,440; Mage = 25.57), we examined one-year unconditional and event-related development in self-reported personality functioning across four metrics of change, tested predictors of heterogeneity in event-related changes, and compared findings to self-reported Big Five traits. Generally, unconditional development of all personality constructs was very similar, but there were some trait- and metric-specific differences. Life events accounted for heterogeneity in unconditional development, but almost exclusively for personality functioning, suggesting it has a greater susceptibility to external influences than most Big Five traits. Event perceptions and initial personality levels sometimes predicted individual differences in event-related changes, mostly for mean-level effects, and initial personality functioning frequently moderated event-related changes in the Big Five whereas the reverse was less common. These findings provide further insight into the conceptual (dis)similarity of personality traits and personality functioning, inform joint theoretical frameworks, and may help advance personality disorder treatment by identifying conditions in which changes in personality pathology may be expected or best captured.",

          "abstract": "Haptic perception plays an integral role in how we interact with and make sense of the physical world. As research in this domain continues to expand across disciplines, conceptual ambiguities in terminology and theoretical frameworks persist. In this review, I address several of these ambiguities by proposing a more explicit account of notions often used implicitly. Following a brief overview of the physiological and mechanical foundations of skin-object interactions and the somatosensory system, I introduce working definitions for terms such as haptic cues, stimuli, and perceptual dimensions, along with related assumptions and misconceptions, specifically within the context of haptic perception. I here argue that the distinction between distal and proximal stimuli or cues–more commonly applied in visual perceptual psychology–can serve as a helpful framework in haptic research for distinguishing physical (object-level) and mechanical (interaction-level) inputs. I then review some of the most commonly studied haptic dimensions, including stimulus magnitude, shape, material and texture, motion and time, weight, and size, along with the cues thought to inform them. This is followed by an examination of the notion of stability in haptic perception–often referred to as constancy or invariance–and its relevance for understanding how the sensory system creates consistent and behaviorally relevant percepts under variable conditions and cues. The specific phenomenon of perceptual and sensory metamers is explored as a particularly compelling example of cue integration and perceptual stability. Finally, I consider the various levels at which haptic stimuli and cues can be manipulated in research. By operationalizing some of these more implicit notions, we can reduce conceptual ambiguity in the search for a clearer account of how stable haptic percepts are achieved.",

This review examines the effects of contingent feedback on human vocal development using reinforcement learning frameworks, based on an analysis of 70 empirical studies. A literature search using the terms \"vocal learning,\" \"vocal reinforcement,\" and \"vocal contingency\" identified three study categories: contingent imitation effects (12 studies), other contingent feedback effects (33 studies), and additional contingent feedback effects (21 studies). Analysis using the antecedent-behavior-consequence framework revealed that contingent responses increase vocal production rates and modify vocal quality, with contingent imitation being especially effective. Three effects accompany the increase in target behavior, including phonological change, collateral increase, and preparatory learning. Evidence also demonstrates other effects of contingent feedback, such as enhanced object recognition learning and longitudinal language development outcomes. In sum, empirical studies show that contingent feedbacks on human vocal behavior have reinforcement effects, a positive correlation with vocalization rate, and longitudinal effects on development. Thus, vocal learning is not merely imitative or developmental, but also shaped by structured environmental feedback.",

          "abstract": "When humans interact with artificial intelligence (AI), one desideratum is appropriate trust. Typically, appropriate trust encompasses that humans trust AI except when they either explicitly notice AI errors or when they are suspicious that errors could be present. So far, appropriate trust or related notions have been mainly investigated by assessing trust and reliance. In this contribution, we argue that these assessments are not sufficient to measure the complex aim of appropriate trust and the related notion of healthy distrust. We introduce and test the perspective of visual attention as an additional indicator for appropriate trust and draw conceptual connections to the notion of healthy distrust.\n\nTo test the validity of our conceptualization, we formalize visual attention using TVA and measure its properties potentially relevant to appropriate trust and healthy distrust in an image classification task. Thereby, we investigate participants’ attentional capacity and attentional weight towards correct and incorrect classifications. \nWe observe that misclassifications reduce attentional capacity compared to correct classifications. However, our results do not indicate that this reduction is beneficial for a subsequent judgment of the classifications. The attentional weighting is not affected by the classifications’ correctness but by the difficulty of categorizing the stimuli themselves. These results, their implications, and the limited potential for using visual attention as an indicator of appropriate trust and healthy distrust are discussed.",

Its application during self-regulated learning requires access to practice questions, which can often be quite limited.  Across four experiments, we investigated a potential solution: using artificial intelligence (AI)—specifically, the large language model-based chatbot, ChatGPT—to generate prequestions.  Experiment 1 found that AI-generated prequestioning enhanced learning of an educational text relative to simply reading.  Experiment 2 found that AI-generated questions and human-generated questions were equally effective at promoting learning.  Experiments 3-4 revealed that prequestioning with questions generated using different AI prompts aided learning relative to studying an AI-generated outline.  Across experiments, prequestioning benefited subsequent test performance on questions that were identical and non-identical to those previously encountered.  Together, these results highlight the potential of generative AI to facilitate prequestioning, yielding substantial learning benefits.",

          "authors": "Steven Verheyen; Jonathan Van den Berckt; Tom Heyman",
          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal motor interactions are central to social life, yet it remains unclear how social cues relevant to detecting engagement are encoded in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that regions traditionally associated with mentalizing, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), co-activate with nodes of the Action Observation Network (AON) during motor engagement with others, pointing to a synergistic role in the processing of action features during interaction. Using fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we examined brain responses to reach-to-grasp actions varying in Goal (passing vs. placing), Perspective (2nd vs. 3rd person), and Gaze visibility, creating a gradient of perceived engagement. Our results show that the TPJ and premotor cortices, but not the dmPFC, displayed convergent neural geometry during action observation. Model- and cluster-based analyses further linked TPJ and AON regions in multiple representational spaces: left-hemisphere regions aligned with goal encoding, whereas right-hemisphere regions aligned with an Engagement model capturing first-person interaction. Critically, we demonstrate that the rTPJ and left premotor cortex share representational geometry for action perspective, directly coupling mentalizing and sensorimotor systems in the encoding of directional cues. By contrast, the dmPFC appeared representationally isolated from both TPJ and AON regions, with response patterns showing no similarity to Goal or Engagement models. This is consistent with accounts of its recruitment under richer interactive demands rather than selectivity for abstract action features. Together, these findings support a distributed, sensorimotor account of engagement encoding and reveal new functional links among key social cognition areas.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety is a prevalent and debilitating phenomenon. Although the DSM-5 offers useful classification guidelines, overlapping symptoms across categories of anxiety highlight the need for transdiagnostic approaches. Threat processing, closely linked to anxiety, offers a promising pathway for such exploration. Threat processing involves various neurocognitive and psychophysiological mechanisms, including visual cortical responses, physiological reactivity, and affective ratings. This study examined whether different anxiety subtypes could be identified based on individual differences in threat processing. A total of 211 undergraduate students were recruited, with 198 included in the analyses. Threat-related measures included attentional bias competition indices derived from Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials in the visual cortex, heart rate, skin conductance responses, and arousal/valence ratings. Anxiety-related measures included self-report questionnaires and momentary assessments using experience sampling methods. Latent profile analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Profile 1 (n=114; 58%) was labelled as “low psychophysiological but high psychological affective reactivity”, Profile 2 (n=59; 30%) as “low psychophysiological affective reactivity”, and Profile 3 (n=25; 13%) as “high psychophysiological affective arousal”. However, these different threat-related profiles did not reflect major differences in the anxiety-related measures, either in questionnaires or momentary assessments. These findings offer preliminary insight into distinct threat-processing profiles in anxiety and highlight the need for further research, especially with larger samples and more variance in anxiety.",

Participants engaged in an old/new recognition task involving upright and inverted young and older faces. The results revealed a robust OAB in the younger group, characterized by a reduced Face Inversion Effect (FIE)—more accurate recognition for upright versus inverted faces—when processing older/other-age faces compared to the pronounced FIE for own/younger-age faces. This difference was primarily driven by disrupted performance for upright older faces vs. upright young faces. In contrast, no OAB was observed in the older group, which exhibited a strong FIE for both own/older- and other/younger-age faces, with upright older faces being recognized more accurately than in the younger group. These findings underscore the importance of perceptual expertise in explaining the OAB.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory formation requires integrating multisensory information. Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

          "abstract": "In the rubber hand illusion (RHI), participants report ownership of a fake hand which is stroked in synchrony with their own concealed hand, with lower ownership ratings for asynchronous stroking. This effect has been historically attributed to multisensory integration. However, such a pattern of results is consistent with experimental demand characteristics, and an alternative theory proposes that the RHI is an effect of phenomenological control (PC; the trait ability to change experience to satisfy goals). To date, support for a PC theory of the RHI has been limited to correlational evidence. Here we conduct a pre-registered causal test of the relative contribution of these two proposed mechanisms in RHI effects. XX high PC participants (top 10%) were tested in an RHI procedure and the classic effects of greater response for synchrony than asynchrony were/were not replicated. The procedure was then repeated following imaginative suggestions for a reversal of the classic effect (i.e. greater synchrony than asynchrony effects). Ratings of ownership and proprioceptive drift were/were not modulated by suggestion. Effects for ownership and drift were/were not reversed.  PC does/does not dominate over multisensory mechanisms in RHI ownership of a fake hand and proprioceptive drift.",

Results indicated a significant moderate positive relationship between service-level barriers and staff-level barriers.

Currently used screening tools are brief and cost-effective, but there is a lack of understanding of their reliability over time as well as whether responses are influenced by demographic or clinical factors. Aims: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity of two commonly used screening tools as well as their associations with current mood states and other participant characteristics. Methods: 331 adult patients with a diagnosis of BD completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Symptom Checklist-32 (HCL-32) as well as measures of mood online at baseline and three months later. Results: The MDQ was found to have low reliability with poor internal consistency (α= 0.531; α= 0.647 at respective timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.582). The HCL-32 was more reliable with good internal consistency (α= 0.815 at both timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.725). MDQ scores were significantly, positively associated with comorbidities and current symptoms of activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age and years since last hospitalisation. The HCL-32 was also significantly positively correlated with activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age, years since diagnosis and years since last hospitalisation. BD-I patients scored higher than other BD-subtypes. Mood state was the only variable with a significant change over time. Conclusions: The HCL-32 appeared more reliable than the MDQ, although all participants needed to exceed an MDQ threshold at baseline to participate in the study, which may have biased our results.",

This article reports findings from three complementary studies examining the effects of psychiatric assistance dogs on the quality of life of adolescents and young adults in the Netherlands (16–30 years) with severe psychosocial problems. In a cross-sectional questionnaire study (n = 141), participants who had lived with their dog for more than two years reported significantly higher quality of life than those with shorter partnerships. A six-month longitudinal study (n = 9) showed significant increases in quality of life across 12 repeated measurements among participants who had only recently been matched with their dogs. Qualitative interviews (n = 13) provided further insight, revealing an initial adjustment period followed by improvements in psychological and social well-being. Thematic analysis highlighted hope (seeing a future again), enhanced social participation and independence, and companionship with the dog as the most prominent benefits mentioned in the interviews. Taken together, the three studies provide converging evidence that psychiatric assistance dogs can meaningfully enhance daily functioning, quality of life, and social connectedness for young civilians with mental health difficulties. Importantly, this research demonstrates measurable and robust benefits, showing that the impact of psychiatric assistance dogs extends beyond stories and into demonstrable improvements in people’s lives, provided the dog’s welfare is safeguarded.",

          "abstract": "Objectives:  Research shows that innocent suspects tend to be forthcoming in investigative interviews, often providing truthful accounts even if this involves revealing potentially self-incriminating information. This could leave them vulnerable to being misclassified as guilty. While such behaviour is often attributed to a belief in the exonerating power of truth, little is known about the decision-making processes involved. This study explored the reasoning and expectations of innocent suspects regarding the main verbal counter-interrogation strategy they would use in a specific scenario.\nResearch questions: We had three research questions. First, what verbal counter-interrogation strategy regarding truthfulness do participants expect to use in the situation outlined in the vignette? Second, what is their reasoning behind pursuing said strategy? Third, do participants expect their strategy to be successful in convincing the police of their innocence and why?\nMethod: We conducted twelve semi-structured interviews with university students and members of the general population based in the Midlands, UK. We analysed the data using thematic analysis and identified four overarching themes.\nResults: Eleven of the twelve participants indicated they would provide a completely truthful account. However, their expectations about the strategy’s effectiveness varied. While many discussed reasons aligned with the phenomenology of innocence (PoI) mindset, participants also raised various other aspects in relation to their choice of strategy and their beliefs about its effectiveness, namely considerations around evidence, risks of lying, and perceived credibility. \nConclusions: The findings support the idea that the PoI is prevalent among truth-tellers. However, our results also suggest that additional considerations seem to be relevant in their decision-making. Based on the data, we identified the subjective expected utility (SEU) model as a potentially useful framework for understanding how innocent suspects choose their counter-interrogation strategy, which can also explain findings from previous research, and we propose it be tested in future studies.",

Eligible studies investigated childhood predictors of persistent ADHD, substance use disorders (SUD), conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and/or anxiety disorders in adults diagnosed with childhood ADHD (PROSPERO #CRD42022320887). Meta-analytic models were tested when N ≥3 for a predictor with similar effect measures, otherwise predictors were discussed narratively when N ≥2.

          "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between visual processing and fencing performance, focusing on various gaze behaviour indices in a dynamic and interactive sport. Visual processing, particularly the ability to gather and use visual information quickly and accurately, is critical for performance in high-speed sports. We hypothesised that visual behaviour, including the duration of the final fixation (Quiet Eye; QE), the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations, significantly impacts fencing performance during offensive and defensive actions. National-level sabre fencers performed a ten-minute assault with eye-tracking technology measuring their gaze behaviour. Results indicated that QE was significantly longer before successful touches compared to unsuccessful ones (t(9) = 2.61, p =.014, dz = 0.83). Additionally, the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations were higher during defensive actions than offensive actions (all ts(9) &gt; 4.34, ps ≤ .001, dzs&gt; 1.37). This research provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying sports performance in a realistic context and has implications for training strategies, emphasising the importance of various visual behaviour patterns in fencing.",

          "abstract": "Action cancellation is thought to decline with age, contributing to impairments in executive function and overall motor performance. While age-related deterioration of reactive inhibition (stopping an action in response to an external signal) is well-established, less is known about how ageing affects proactive inhibition (preparatory mechanisms which increase the chance that an action can be successfully stopped). This study examined how proactive and reactive inhibitory processes, assessed via changes in corticospinal excitability (CSE) and behaviour, vary as a function of ageing during a modified stop signal task. Participants made bimanual responses to an imperative signal and attempted to cancel one (selective stopping) or both (global stopping) responses, based on presentation of a stop signal. We compared reactive stopping to proactive stopping where cues informed participants which hand/s may have to stop. Using Bayesian model averaging analyses, we found that proactive cueing increased reaction times in both groups, indicative of proactive slowing. Furthermore, older adults exhibited greater slowing of ongoing action components (unilateral responses) following successful selective cancellation, compared to younger adults. However, there was strong evidence against age difference in CSE modulation. Specifically, both age groups exhibited effector-specific CSE modulation following proactive cues, with reduced MEP amplitudes in the hand that might need to stop, and increased amplitudes in the hand that was certain to respond (contralateral to the hand that may have to stop). These findings suggest that while ageing affects stopping behaviour, proactive inhibitory mechanisms which modulate CSE may remain preserved.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Reading difficulties in primary school students have been linked to elevated anxiety, yet very few studies have examined this relationship in secondary school students who have different priorities and experience distinct challenges. \nMethod: In this study, data from 95 secondary school students (Mage=14.58, SD=1.52; Female=49, Male=46) was used to investigate whether secondary students with poor reading report higher levels of generalized, social, and reading-related anxiety than their peers; whether anxiety symptoms are associated with word reading accuracy, text reading fluency, and reading comprehension; whether these associations are moderated by grade or gender; and whether comorbid attention or language difficulties further contribute to elevated anxiety in poor readers. \nResults: Simple Binomial Tests revealed that a significantly larger proportion of secondary students with poor reading have elevated anxiety scores compared to the proportion expected for a typical population (under 16%). Spearman’s rank-order correlations showed weak associations between reading measures and generalised or social anxiety, but moderate to strong associations between reading-specific anxiety (general and social) and all reading measures. Grade and gender did not moderate these relationships. Finally, Fisher’s tests provided no evidence that comorbid attention or language difficulties were linked to higher anxiety symptoms among poor secondary school readers.\nConclusions: The findings of study this provide evidence for a moderate to strong association between reading ability and reading anxiety and motivate further investigations into the causal mechanisms that may create and then maintain links between reading and wellbeing in secondary school students.",

          "authors": "Chad E. Forbes; Rachel C Amey; Adam Magerman; Irmak Olcaysoy Okten",
          "abstract": "Social identity threat (SIT) is a situational stressor that increases arousal and negative affect, biases memory encoding towards domain-specific negative affect, and impairs performance when women are outnumbered by men.  One consequence of these effects could be that women develop learned aversions towards stigmatized STEM domains. Four studies tested whether stereotypic STEM images (STEMIs) prompt aversive-like responses that predict SIT-like outcomes, including underperformance in SIT contexts and more negative SIT-oriented memories over time.  Using a dot-probe paradigm, Study 1 found that only SIT women exhibited greater arousal responses to STEMIs compared to stereotypic non-STEM images (NonSTEMIs), perceived STEMIs as more negatively arousing compared to men, and underperformed; men in this context showed a similar arousal response to STEMIs and NonSTEMIs and performed better. Study 2 replicated this effect among women STEM majors and linked aversive responses to more negative affect laden memories for the STEM lab experience five weeks later. Using EEG, Study 3 found that enhanced processing of STEMIs presented during an attentional blink task (indexed via increased communication between occipital and prefrontal cortical regions) predicted underperformance on a math test among SIT women but marginally better performance among men. Study 4 mitigated SIT underperformance effects among women utilizing a dot-probe training paradigm that blunted arousal responses to STEMIs; instructing men to attend to STEMIs facilitated their performance.  STEM aversions may thus facilitate SIT-like effects, possibly defining what the “threat” in SIT is, however, blunting aversions can attenuate these effects when women work alongside men in STEM performance situations.",

          "abstract": "Despite increased focus on well-being in the psychological sciences in recent years, cross-sectional and group-level methods fall short of capturing the dynamics of individual people’s well-being in daily life. Such an investigation is especially important for young adults who are in a developmental phase in which they are more likely to experience fluctuations in their daily lives. We used ecological momentary assessment over one week in two samples of first-year college students (Sample 1, N = 103, assessments = 2,535; Sample 2, N = 76, assessments = 1,796) and a dynamic network approach (Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis). This approach estimates, within each person, how well-being elements fluctuate across days and co-vary with one another, recovering both their differentiation (exclusivity) and their interdependence (connectivity). In this approach, elements of well-being—measured via the PERMA framework—are modeled as a dynamic network to address the following research questions: (1) How do elements of well-being in young adults’ daily life form a dynamic network? (2) Does the structure of well-being hold across all young adults, or is there heterogeneity? (3) Is there synchrony among well-being elements, and do they drive a person’s well-being network? Findings suggest that while group-level dynamic well-being networks align with theoretical models, each person’s individual experiences vary significantly, with each person demonstrating unique well-being network structures and synchronous elements. These findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in well-being, highlighting the necessity for personalized approaches to understand and promote well-being among young adults.",

          "abstract": "As video games increasingly incorporate gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes and gacha microtransactions, concern has grown over their association with problematic video gaming (PVG) and mental health outcomes. This study explores how parasocial relationships (PRs) with fictional characters, a growing phenomenon in video gaming, may influence the negative effects of in-game gambling on depression. A sample of 584 players (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male), recruited from Reddit forums centered on video games featuring gacha, completed scales assessing risky loot box and gacha use, PVG, depressive symptoms, and whether they had a PR. Using structural equation modeling, mediation and moderated mediation models were tested. Results show that having PR is indirectly linked to depression via PVG, and that while risky in-game gambling behaviors alone did not predict depression via PVG in the general sample, PRs significantly altered this dynamic. Specifically, for individuals who reported having a PR, both risky loot box and gacha engagement indirectly predicted depression through PVG. These associations were absent, or even negative, among participants without a PR. Findings suggest that PRs with fictional characters may exacerbate gaming-related harms by increasing emotional investment and gameplay frequency, particularly in games designed to foster emotional attachment or feature in-game gambling. This study highlights PRs as a key psychological mechanism linking in-game gambling to poor mental health, reinforcing the importance of considering player–character relationships in future research and policy efforts on gaming disorder and digital spending risks.",

          "abstract": "Tractography is a key component of efforts to map brain connectivity. As a rapidly-evolving field of neuroscience, current tractography methods are diverse, often varying across research laboratories and different software pipelines. Therefore, it suffers from a lack of standardization leading to inconsistencies in results, which can limit reproducibility, and affect the robustness needed for research and clinical applications of these methods. Variability in data acquisition procedures, inconsistencies in spatial referencing schemes and implementations, and anatomical heterogeneity —at the individual level, across the lifespan, and across species— hinders comparative analyses. Additionally, the lack of consensus on best practices complicates the development of robust automated quality control pipelines and limits the clinical translation of tractography-based procedures. Establishing standardized protocols for acquisition, preprocessing, and tractography reconstruction are critical towards enabling reliable tract-specific analyses, facilitating cross-study harmonization, and supporting replicable large-scale population studies. The present article provides an overview of the current challenges in tractography standardization and identifies the key aspects that require standardization for reliable, reproducible, and robust tractography.",

          "abstract": "Autonomy-supportive parenting is essential for positive developmental outcomes for youth whereas psychological control can have detrimental effects. When parents’ psychological needs are met, they are more likely to show autonomy-supportive parenting; and when parents report greater psychological need frustration, they are more likely to parent with psychological control. We tested how parental psychological needs can predict adolescent internalizing mood through parenting practices in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries for 14 days to rate parental psychological needs, parenting practices, and adolescent internalizing mood. We conducted multilevel mediation analyses (i.e., 1-1-1 and 2-2-2 design) to examine the effect of parental psychological needs on adolescent internalizing mood through parent parenting practices. When parents’ daily psychological needs were met, they practiced more supportive parenting practices in daily life, which in turn was associated with better adolescent mood. Most of these mediation effects were not found when examining long-term characteristics. Our findings point towards the importance of disentangling day-to-day fluctuations in behaviors and experiences than to long-term associations between them in families’ daily lives to better understand family dynamics and adolescent well-being.",

          "abstract": "The “loot box” (LB) monetization strategy has established itself as a dominant and controversial feature in the world of video games. While numerous studies have found that gambling and gaming behaviors may predict LB purchases, sometimes to problematic levels, there is a dearth of research regarding systematic reviews with non-behavioral predictors. Likewise, while LBs may have become mainstream, there is a notable lack of agreed definition for this microtransaction, with researcher proposing their own definition with nuances that may make it difficult to group findings from different studies. The aim of this study is to review the literature on the definitions of LB, and the sociodemographic and psychological predictors of LB purchases. Following this strategy, 1540 articles were found from SCOPUS, EBSCOHost, PubMed and Google Scholar. After screening and eligibility procedures, 22 articles were included and analyzed. Findings show that while there are some traits from LBs that are reported in several studies when being defined, a discrepancy exists between studies on what characteristics are included in the definitions, which may affect how LBs are used in research. It was also found that few studies use sociodemographic variables as predictors, with results beings mixed. More importantly, psychological predictors found were divided into two subgroups: psychological (e.g., reward sensitivity, impulsivity, self-esteem modification and FOMO) and motivational (e.g., fun-seeking, desire for progression, cosmetics and completion). These results show that there is a wide array of psychological and motivational predictors that may overlap, thus more research on the topic is needed.",

Given the growing recognition of teacher well-being as a critical factor in educational quality, validating reliable assessment tools is essential. To assess the reliability and validity of the scale in this setting, a 16-item Spanish-adapted version of the TWBS was administered online to a sample of 304 EFL teachers working in diverse Chilean school environments. Furthermore, a two-stage validation design was implemented, using independent samples. The results demonstrated that the TWBS exhibits strong psychometric properties, including excellent reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.903, which confirms its high internal consistency. Additionally, both Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) supported the scale’s structural validity, indicating a well-fitting model for the collected data. These findings are crucial for establishing the TWBS as a valid and reliable instrument in the Chilean context, which ensures its effectiveness in measuring key dimensions of teachers’ professional well-being.",

We then collected subjective ratings of semantic similarities between pairs of meanings/senses within a word and investigated their relation with the similarity of the sensorimotor profiles to corroborate that the sensorimotor-based similarity was semantic in nature. Our results speak in favour of sensorimotor information as a component of representations of polysemous senses / homonymous meanings, and advise future norming studies to take into account lexical ambiguity.",

Study 1 used a sample of religious people from 15 countries spanning the 5 world religions (N = 11,186) to assess how these sociocultural factors relate to ecospirituality. Study 2 assessed the same factors in a sample of religious and non-religious Americans (N = 3,329). The overall pattern of results suggested that greater religiosity, urbanization, and affluence contribute to greater ecospirituality across cultural and religious contexts. Some differences in the pattern of results were found in the sample of Americans, suggesting that psychological surveys on this topic conducted in the United States may not generalize across cultures. This research contributes to our understanding of how sociocultural factors that are rapidly changing in many parts of the world may shape people’s connections with the natural environment.",

          "abstract": "The idea that nature has spiritual qualities is common in diverse cultural and religious contexts. In North American samples, evidence supports a link between ecospirituality and pro-environmental outcomes. However, the generalizability of this claim remains untested. This study employs a large cross-cultural sample of religious individuals from 15 countries spanning the 5 world religions (N = 11,186) to (1) estimate the link between ecospirituality and three pro-environmental outcomes: behavioural intentions to make sustainable decisions, policy support, and financial donations to a pro-environmental organization; and (2) assess the pathways by which an ecospiritual worldview translates to pro-environmentalism. The results of pre-registered analyses showed that ecospirituality positively predicted each of the pro-environmental outcomes similarly across diverse cultural and religious populations. Even more, the link between ecospirituality and pro-environmental outcomes were consistently mediated by the same variables across cultures. In short, ecospirituality unites diverse cultural worldviews in motivating care for nature by fostering a sense of responsibility, gratitude and efficacy, making it a potentially powerful foundation for global environmental stewardship.",

          "abstract": "Successful communication requires that listeners not only identify speech, but do so while maintaining performance on other tasks, like remembering what a conversational partner said or paying attention while driving. This set of four experiments systematically evaluated how audiovisual speech—which reliably improves speech intelligibility—affects dual-task costs during speech perception (i.e., one facet of listening effort). Results indicated that audiovisual speech reduces dual-task costs in difficult listening conditions (those in which visual cues substantially benefit intelligibility), but may actually increase costs in easy conditions—a pattern of results that was internally replicated multiple times. This study also presents a novel dual-task paradigm specifically designed to facilitate conducting dual-task research remotely. Given the novelty of the task, this study includes psychometric experiments that establish positive and negative control, assess convergent validity, measure task sensitivity relative to a commonly-used dual-task paradigm, and generate performance curves across a range of listening conditions. Thus, in addition to evaluating the effects of audiovisual speech across a wide range of background noise levels, this study enables other researchers to address theoretical questions related to the cognitive mechanisms supporting speech processing beyond the specific issues addressed here and without being limited to in-person research.",

We hypothesized that a six-factor structure of sensitivity would be better supported than more parsimonious alternatives. We hypothesized that sensitivity would be orthogonal to gender and gender socialization, and that there would be measurement invariance between women’s and men’s reports of sensitivity. We found greater support for a multidimensional measure of sensitivity over more parsimonious alternatives. We did not find support for measurement invariance between women’s and men’s reports of sensitivity, challenging assumptions about sensitivity. We speak to the value of using a multidimensional measurement of sensitivity in ongoing inquiries, while also pointing to nuances for what could be important correlated and confounds of sensitivity reports.",

          "abstract": "What role does the study of natural language play in the task of developing a unified theory and common model of cognition? Language is perhaps the most complex behaviour that humans exhibit, and, as such, is one of the most difficult problems for understanding human cognition. Linguistic theory can both inform and be informed by unified models of cognition. We discuss (1) how computational models of human cognition can provide insight into how humans produce and comprehend language and (2) how the problem of modelling language processing raises questions and creates challenges for widely used computational models of cognition. Evidence from the literature suggests that behavioural phenomena, such as recency and priming effects, and cognitive constraints, such as working memory limits, affect how language is produced by humans in ways that can be predicted by computational cognitive models. But just as computational models can provide new insights into language, language can serve as a test for these models. For example, simulating language learning requires the use of more powerful machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and vector symbolic architectures, and language comprehension requires a capacity for on-the-fly situational model construction. In sum, language plays an important role in both shaping the development of a common model of the mind, and, in turn, the theoretical understanding of language stands to benefit greatly from the development of a common model.",

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "In hyper-meritocratic societies where performance, productivity, and individualism are prioritized above all else, opportunities for genuine intimacy have become structurally constrained. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model to explain the rise of virtual intimacy—including pornography, cam platforms, AI companions, and subscription-based emotional labor—as a psychological response to institutionalized emotional deprivation. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from sociology, psychology, and media studies, I argue that virtual intimacy functions not only as a source of sensory stimulation but also as a surrogate for unfulfilled relational needs such as being desired, seen, and emotionally accepted. I integrate findings from animal studies (e.g., Rat Park, Harlow’s rhesus monkey experiments) to underscore the evolutionary significance of social bonding, and analyze platform-level data to illustrate the global expansion of synthetic intimacy. My model outlines how social atomization fosters emotional deprivation, prompting reliance on virtual intimacy that further deepens disconnection in a self-reinforcing cycle. By situating the consumption of digital intimacy within broader socio-institutional contexts, I aim to reframe such behaviors not as moral failings but as structurally induced adaptations. I conclude by calling for institutional reform aimed at restoring the human capacity for real intimacy in an increasingly synthetic world.",

          "abstract": "We examined the development of reading comprehension and its neural underpinnings in the context of disrupted education among Syrian refugee children and youth resettled in Canada. One hundred participants  (Mage = 13.78, SD = 2.55) completed standardized assessments of language comprehension, decoding, and reading comprehension, and participated in functional near-infrared spectroscopy while completing a decoding task. Consistent with the Simple View of Reading (SVR), both language comprehension and decoding significantly predicted reading comprehension. However, the relative role of language comprehension and decoding to reading comprehension differed depending on the extent of educational disruptions experienced during displacement and migration. Decoding predicted reading comprehension for children with minimal education disruptions. However, when educational disruptions were longer due to prolonged displacement, the relation between decoding and reading comprehension was limited, and instead, the relation between language comprehension and reading comprehension was greater. These results suggested that in the context of limited formal literacy instruction during displacement, language comprehension may assume a compensatory function for poor decoding ability. Neuroimaging showed that greater activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) predicted better reading comprehension, suggesting compensatory recruitment beyond the typical left-lateralized reading network. Cluster analyses identified distinct reading profiles that were predicted by neural activation patterns and educational disruption. Children with the highest reading comprehension scores showed greater right IFG activation and lower activation in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG)–a region associated with decoding. Our study extends the SVR by demonstrating that the contribution of decoding and language comprehension to reading comprehension depends on educational experience, and that multiple neural pathways can support reading comprehension after educational disruption. Practically, these results highlight the need for individualized reading interventions and the urgency of minimizing educational disruption for displaced children and youth.",

          "abstract": "When creating art, artists must make constant decisions with each pen stroke in order to achieve their goals of the piece. One common goal is to create something memorable—a piece that will persist in the memories of the observer. However, an open question is how different artistic decisions impact the memorability of a piece as it is being created. To test this question, we utilized a neural network (ResMem) to track the frame-by-frame changes in memorability for 50 videos of the creation of digital art pieces. We tested this neural network’s predictions via a human memory experiment (N=399), finding that ResMem’s predictions significantly correlated with human memory performance across the art creation process. We then collected multiple measures of each piece’s creation process, including low-level visual features, mid-level visual features, neural network-derived features, artistic features, and spatial properties. We find that changes in details and low-level visual features do not contribute to the memorability of a piece; rather more global measures of simplicity and variability relate to the memorability of a piece. Further, larger changes (e.g., blocking, sketching), particularly below the horizon of the image, make the biggest impacts on memorability. Importantly, we find that the memorability of a piece is largely set from the very beginning, and changes that occur later have diminishing impact on the memorability of a piece. These findings have important implications for both artists and psychologists in thinking about the factors that impact memory during the creation of an image.",

          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically,  these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates (off by many hours) with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on the same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the practical severity of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

          "abstract": "Facilitation in word processing, identified as faster responses to semantically related words, has traditionally been viewed as evidence of the core cognitive mechanisms that support language processing. However, it remains uncertain whether this facilitation arises from bottom-up spreading activation, top-down prediction, or a combination of both. To address this, we developed a novel semantic priming paradigm that systematically manipulates local contextual buildup and applied drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to differentiate the decision dynamics associated with each mechanism. In our experiment, 20 participants performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one (short condition) or three (long condition) semantically related primes. We found that, as the local semantic context became more enriched (short vs. long condition), participants adjusted their decision strategies, engaging different processing mechanisms. In the short condition, participants relied on spreading activation, as indicated by increased drift rate (faster evidence accumulation), suggesting that a single related prime pre-activated the target's mental representation. In contrast, in the long condition, reduced boundary separation (participants required less evidence before responding) implied greater confidence driven by enhanced predictability from multiple primes, consistent with the predictive processing account. Together, our findings offer new insights into theoretical models of language processing; demonstrate the practical relevance of DDM in language processing and offer potential implications for translational research.",

In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

          "abstract": "Background: \n22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic condition associated with a wide range of physical, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments. This condition is often associated with difficulties in social functioning (SF), frequently exacerbated by psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and psychotic symptoms, which are particularly common in this population. This study adopted a multi-method approach to embrace the complexity of the SF assessment and identify distinct SF profiles in youths with 22q11DS. Association with mental health were examined, with the aim of guiding more targeted and individualized interventions.\nMethods: \nFifty-five adolescents and young adults with 22q11DS and 65 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls were recruited. SF was assessed using a combination of measures in both groups, and a latent profile analysis was conducted on the full sample to identify distinct SF profiles. Mental health was assessed in both groups using standardized questionnaires; in addition, individuals with 22q11DS completed clinical interviews to assess psychiatric comorbidities.\nResults: \nThree distinct SF profiles emerged from a Latent Profile Analysis: An Above profile composed exclusively of TD individuals; an Average profile including both TD and 22q11DS participants; and a Below profile consisting mainly of individuals with 22q11DS. These profiles differed on key SF variables. Within the 22q11DS group, individuals in the Below profile exhibited more pronounced negative and disorganized psychotic symptoms and a greater number of psychiatric comorbidities than those in the Average profile, whose SF was more similar to that of TD individuals.\nConclusions: \nThis study improves our understanding of SF in individuals with 22q11DS by highlighting both inter-group differences and intra-group variability. The identification of three distinct SF profiles (above, average, below) reveals a gradient of SF and underscores that SF difficulties are not solely linked to cognitive impairments but also to psychopathology. The findings emphasize the importance of using a combination of complementary measures to capture the complex nature of SF and to guide more nuanced, individualized interventions.",

Regional examinations are necessary to account for the sociocultural context that shapes lived experiences of marginalized groups. This meta-analytic review examined how multiple forms of discrimination are considered in German mental health research and analyzed the relationship of perceived discrimination with depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms (i=36 studies; N=45,527). Discrimination was significantly associated with depressive (r=0.26, p&lt;.001) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (r=0.23, p&lt;.01). Subgroup analyses revealed a smaller effect size for studies which examined discrimination based on mental health vs. other forms of discrimination. Frequency of published reports has increased over the past 20 years (b=0.27, p&lt;.001), but data gaps for several populations, discrimination forms and validated measures continue to exist. The findings emphasize the need for improved methodological assessment and broader inclusion of discrimination in German mental health research along with targeted interventions to reduce its impact.",

          "abstract": "Parenthood introduces new constraints on adults' spatial exploration, yet associations between mobility and parental mental health remain unexplored. We conducted continuous GPS tracking of 171 first-time parents in Denmark during maternity leave and paternity leave, combined with postnatal depression and sleep quality assessments. Using Bayesian multilevel models with zero-inflated distributions, we revealed three key insights. First, parental leave restricted spatial mobility for both mothers and fathers, but with distinct patterns: fathers spent more time at home yet showed greater spatial dispersion when mobile. Second, parental leave coincided with elevated depression scores and poorer sleep quality for the on-leave parent, with mothers showing consistently higher depression levels than fathers. Third, parents with more depression symptoms showed increased probability of staying home entirely and reduced mobility range when mobile. These findings demonstrate population-level associations between GPS-derived mobility patterns and parental depression, even within the constrained spatial context of parental leave.",

Across three experiments, we examined whether face-matching decisions would change depending on the framing of response options. In Experiment 1, participants completed an unfamiliar face matching task with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 2, participants completed the task twice, once with the Same/Different response options and once with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 3, participants completed the task when 50% or 80% of trials were matches and used the Same/Different or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. Whereas we found no evidence that face identification decisions were influenced by the framing of response options, we found evidence of a robust base rate effect. Together these findings suggest that decision making in unfamiliar face identification is a complex and selective process.",

To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment examining lexical ambiguity in spoken Mandarin at the tonal, segmental, and orthographical levels. Using a picture naming task, we explored how L1 Mandarin L2 English speakers in the UK and more-monolingual speakers in China resolve ambiguity by analysing their verbal responses when naming pictures, manipulating whether the context in which a picture is named makes the preferred label ambiguous (e.g. do speakers avoid saying “fen3 si1” when describing a picture of glass noodles when it appears alongside a picture of fans which shares the same label?; do bilinguals avoid this ambiguity more than more monolingual peers as claimed?). Our results do not support this hypothesis, as no reliable differences between groups were found. Despite the null results, we observed several interesting patterns worthy of further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Hierarchical models are widely used to estimate group- and individual-level parameters in cognitive and behavioral research. When model parameters are bounded within a particular range, it is common practice to estimate the group-level parameters on the unbounded real line and then map the estimated mean onto the desired bounded parameter range using a nonlinear transformation. We show that the way group-level estimates are commonly computed with this approach can produce systematic biases because it ignores within-group variability. We derive correct expressions for computing the group-level mean that take within-group variability into account. Using formal derivation, simulation, and reanalyses of empirical data, we demonstrate (using cumulative prospect theory as an example) how the commonly used but incorrect approach distorts parameter estimates. In a reanalysis of age differences in risky choice, we find that although the distortions do not alter qualitative conclusions about group differences, they can affect the size of such differences and lead to different psychological interpretations of the groups' behavior. We point out and elaborate that the underlying issue is general and can arise in a wide range of hierarchical models. Our results highlight a subtle but consequential issue in hierarchical modeling and we provide concrete solutions for ensuring the validity of group-level inferences about behavior.",

          "abstract": "Human behavior is frequently constrained by the behavior of other agents (increasingly artificial agents like machines and software). In a cooperative setting, each individual needs to understand the partners’ intentions and corresponding actions to plan their actions adequately. Misunderstandings have adverse effects and diminish the efficiency of cooperation. We created a game-based experiment to study the effects of understanding a partner’s actions in a cooperative setting. In this game, the players depend on each other’s ability to make good decisions to succeed. In two studies (N = 87, N = 281), we collected data on the understanding of an artificial agent, operationalized as the ability to predict its actions and the skill at the task itself. The participants improve at predicting the agent’s actions and at their subtasks in the game over time. Following a misunderstanding, the participants’ performance at their subtask was worse, as measured by their actions’ quality, speed, and efficiency. Results of Study 2 suggest that the improvements in predicting the agent’s actions are likely the result of an improved understanding of the game rather than an improved understanding of the agent.",

Results indicated adequate item discrimination and internal consistency on all scales. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales and the hypothesized hierarchical organization of traits and facets. Gender invariance of the measure was demonstrated. In addition, convergent and discriminant validity evidence was provided through correlations with external measures. \nThe results support the SEPBA as a suitable instrument.

          "abstract": "As demand for problem-solving skills continues to grow, so does the need for efficient training methods. A potential method of achieving efficient training of problem-solving skills is to design a training programme that maximises transfer of learning between problem domains. However, current models of expert problem-solving make contrasting predictions about the conditions under which cross-domain transfer is possible. While pattern-recognition models using state-action associations allow only limited transfer to tasks with different actions, search-based models using state-value associations can reuse the same associations across tasks, potentially achieving greater transfer. In this study, we consider the case of transformation problem-solving tasks where each task uses a distinct and non-overlapping set of transformation rules. Participants trained using tasks from one taskset over four consecutive days and completed pre- and post-training probes on the untrained set. Training improved participants’ solution rate, efficiency, and decision speed, but there were no reliable improvements for the untrained tasks beyond what could be explained by direct practice during the probe blocks. We also observed a gradual reduction in the association between participants’ solution efficiency and their working memory capacity on the trained trials, suggesting a transition towards a problem-solving method less dependent upon working memory. We note that these findings contrast with the predictions of some search-based models of problem-solving expertise in which a rule-independent state-value function is reused across tasksets to decide actions. We discuss the implications of these results for future models of expert problem-solving and for the training of problem-solving skills.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory formation requires integrating multisensory information. Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adolescent mental health is deteriorating, and identifying those in need is challenging because of flawed assessments, flooded services, and low help-seeking by those most in need. A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed. We make recommendations for research and practice to improve how young people in need are identified and supported.",

          "abstract": "Accurate numerical estimation underlies many aspects of cognition, from basic quantity judgments to complex decision-making. One domain where numerical reasoning is especially critical is memory, where individuals often must estimate the likelihood that one event or idea is associated with another. In this study, participants completed a free association task across multiple sessions to generate their own individualized word-pair norms. Later, they provided numerical probability judgments (0–100%) of how often they had produced each pair. These judgments were compared to collective free association norms, a matched group evaluating others’ pairs, and a traditional control group. Results showed that participants who judged their own pairs were significantly more accurate in estimating associative probabilities than control or matched groups, reflecting the benefits of expertise derived from repeated interaction with stimuli. However, systematic overestimation bias persisted, especially for weak associations, indicating that metacognitive sensitivity to probability differences remains limited. These findings highlight how expertise improves, but does not perfect, the ability to translate memory associations into numerical judgments, offering new insights into the intersection of numerical cognition, metacognition, and memory.",

          "abstract": "Sacrificial moral dilemmas require individuals to choose between allowing harm to several people or preventing this by actively causing harm to a smaller number of people. These dilemmas have been foundational in studying how people resolve conflicts between competing moral principles, with responses traditionally interpreted as reflecting either “utilitarian” concern for the greater good or “deontological” refusal to enact harm. Existing research relies almost exclusively on hypothetical scenarios. We confronted 794 participants across two studies with real-life consequential dilemmas involving minor but genuine physical harm. Participants decided whether to allow two confederates to receive painful electroshocks or shock a third confederate, and provided motivations for their decisions. Study 1 manipulated physical proximity to potential targets, while Study 2 examined how the gender composition of potential targets influenced decisions. Moreover, each participant faced this choice twice, allowing us to examine how prior outcomes influence subsequent moral decisions.\nResults show that responses to traditional hypothetical dilemmas moderately predict real-life behavior. Physical proximity and target gender had no significant effects on actual choices. When confronting the dilemma a second time, approximately one-third of participants switched their decision, primarily to distribute harm equitably across potential targets. Analysis of participants' motivations reveals a diverse spectrum of moral considerations beyond utilitarian-deontological frameworks, including fairness concerns, responsibility avoidance, and beliefs about shared versus individual suffering. Our findings invite scholars to expand current theoretical models to better capture the nuanced ways people approach sacrificial trade-offs in consequential, real-world situations.",

Unlike traditional marginal DIF methods, which often fail to capture the effects of intersecting identities and require large samples, InterDIFNet models uniform and non-uniform DIF across multiple intersectional groups simultaneously. The method utilizes an optimized thresholding procedure to balance power and Type I error control. A Monte Carlo simulation compared InterDIFNet to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) test and other intersectional DIF methods across varying sample sizes, numbers of groups, and DIF prevalence rates. Results show that when trained using TLP features, InterDIFNet consistently achieved higher power than TLP while maintaining comparable Type I error control, particularly in scenarios with three or more intersectional groups. An empirical application to real assessment data further demonstrated the method’s practical utility. InterDIFNet provides a scalable, data-driven solution for identifying intersectional DIF across multiple small sample groups.",

          "abstract": "Despite advancements in speech recognition technology, questions remain about model generalizability and how much models mirror human comprehension. These questions are addressed by comparing OpenAI's Whisper model and 75 human transcribers on 300 English sentences (20 speakers, half F, half M, half US-accented, half Spanish-accented). Sentences ended in 100 target words: 1⁄3 high-predictability sentences (The farmer milked the cows), 1⁄3 low- predictability (The farmer milked the nose), and 1⁄3 low-predictability+nonword (The marmer milked the nose). Target word transcription error rates were examined both in sentences and in isolation (recordings excised from same sentences). Errors decreased with increasing model size, but remained heightened for Spanish-accented vs. US-accented speech, roughly similar to human transcribers. Both models and humans benefited from higher sentence predictability. However, sentence context affected models and humans differently: humans benefited only from high- predictability sentences, while models benefited from any sentence context. Humans numerically outperformed the (best-performing) large model on isolated words and showed different error patterns, suggesting Whisper may have a restricted distribution of short utterances or may need lengthier acoustic context than humans. More varied training data and better context awareness, including speaker identity and pragmatic context, might improve ASR generalization.",

          "abstract": "Experimental research on self-initiated movement has for decades relied on the same methodology: the data epochs subjected to analysis are only those culminating in a movement. This approach reliably reveals early ramping activity starting one second or more before movement, but discounts the prior probability of slow ramping. We trained powerful machine-learning classifiers in a sliding window to discriminate between EEG data epochs that either do or do not culminate in a self-initiated movement. We found early ramping signals, but they were not predictive of impending movement. Instead, the ability to correctly classify movement from no-movement epochs emerged abruptly ~100 ms before action onset, while, using the traditional approach, we replicated the spurious finding of early predictability. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy, showing the neural commitment to act is a late-stage process that aligns with results on the timing of subjective experience and the ability to inhibit self-initiated movement.",

          "abstract": "Voting is a pillar of democracy, yet its psychological correlates remain understudied outside the West. We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

          "authors": "Henry Brice; Gairanlu Pamei; Sophia Galouschak; Kaja Kinga Jasińska",
          "abstract": "Background: Globally, many children learn to read exclusively in a second language (L2), but this phenomenon is understudied. Literacy typically reciprocally builds on pre-existing language knowledge, with phonological awareness (PA) and vocabulary predicting literacy outcomes, and themselves being impacted by literacy. Bilinguals demonstrate cross-linguistic transfer (CLT) of language skills from their first language (L1) to reading in L2, but this research primarily covers contexts where children have at least some level of L1 literacy. This raises the question of whether CLT occurs in the absence of L1 literacy, or if the reciprocal relation between language and literacy must be built in L1 before it can transfer to L2 reading.\nMethods: The current study examines the role of L1 and L2 language skills in supporting literacy in emergent readers in rural Côte d’Ivoire (n=1969, females = 912), between first and fifth grade. The broad range of ages both within and across grades allows us to examine how the age of first exposure to literacy impacts this relation. Results: We found robust evidence of CLT of PA, which was not moderated by age of literacy acquisition. Within-language support of literacy was moderated by age of literacy exposure, with literacy more strongly predicted by vocabulary and less by PA for those who started school on time. This effect fully mediated the detrimental impact of a late school start. Conclusions: These results have implications for theories of CLT and sensitive periods for literacy acquisition, and for efforts to reduce illiteracy in the Global South.",

Semi-structured, individual interviews revealed how an antiracist program, which involved reading and discussing the book Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You by Jason Reynolds and Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, engaged students and teachers in racism analysis, racial reflexivity, and antiracist action. Specifically, participants provided rich descriptions of how the Stamped program encouraged them to gain new perspectives, understand and recognize racism, link historical and modern racism, feel responsible and committed to racial justice, and take internal and interpersonal antiracist action. Some developmental trends emerged in which students were more likely to gain new worldviews and social cognitive mindsets whereas teachers were more likely to be racially reflexive and simultaneously discuss analysis, reflexivity, and action.

          "abstract": "Previous studies concluded that listeners struggle to discriminate AI from human voices, but these studies used monotone-like speech and did not examine prosodic expressiveness, a key advantage of human over AI speakers. This study explores whether prosodic expressiveness facilitates human-AI voice discrimination. We recorded human prosodic speech with confident and doubtful expressions, trained AI models to replicate these prosodic patterns, had AI models generate new sentences, and then had human speakers produce equivalent prosodic expressions for the same sentences. In Experiment 1, we had 48 listeners rate humanlikeness and perceived confidence in 11,808 audio samples, finding that AI speech was consistently rated as less humanlike regardless of prosody. We selected 768 audios (AI × human, confident × doubtful prosody) for Experiment 2, where 80 listeners completed an identity discrimination task, telling whether two sounds were from the same speaker. Bayesian modeling results revealed near-ceiling performance for human-human/AI-AI pairs, with inconsistent prosodies decreasing accuracy by ~7%, while listeners do not easily categorize AI and human as sharing the same identity (~54% accuracy when prosody matches, dropping to ~36% when inconsistent). We found nonlinear effects of Wav2Vec2 acoustic distance on performance, with accuracy-reaction time synchronization supporting direct matching mechanisms over prototype-based processing. Human-AI/AI-human pairs showed unique patterns where larger acoustic distances prompted listeners to rely less on acoustic distance cues, unlike other conditions. Our study suggests that concerns about voice clone detection may have been raised prematurely. Additionally, it addresses current gaps in understanding how within-speaker identity variation influences identity processing.",

Grounded in the four voices model of practical theology and employing a contemplative qualitative methodology, the research used thematic analysis to discover how participants’ prayer practices and experiences reflect and reshape theological understanding. Although participants rarely used the term ‘contemplation,’ their practices often aligned with Catholic teachings on contemplative prayer, with a shift toward monological and body-based forms such as breath prayer and attention to posture.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Peer feedback plays a critical role in adolescents’ socio-emotional development, shaping emotional responses and social functioning. While positive feedback enhances well-being, negative feedback is often linked to self-criticism and distress. Yet, real-life interactions also include nuanced forms of feedback—such as neutral remarks and constructive input—that are poorly captured by traditional paradigms dichotomizing feedback into positive vs negative. Prior research has also largely focused on global psychological outcomes (e.g., self-esteem, depression), overlooking diverse emotional reactions (e.g., pride, guilt, motivation) that peer feedback can elicit.\n\nMethods: To address these gaps, we developed a novel vignette-based measure to assess adolescents’ emotional and motivational responses to positive, negative, neutral, and constructive peer feedback. The measure was administered to 67 Portuguese adolescents (aged 14–18 years, 51% female) from the general community.\n\nResults: Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant differences across feedback types for all emotions (ps &lt; .01). Positive feedback elicited the highest levels of happiness and pride, and the lowest sadness, shame, and anger. Negative feedback produced the strongest negative emotions. Constructive feedback generated relatively high happiness and motivation but also moderate guilt and shame. Neutral feedback was most associated with indifference and muted emotional responses.\n\nConclusions: These findings support the measure’s sensitivity in capturing distinct emotional responses across feedback types. Notably, it captures the motivational benefits of constructive feedback alongside its moderate elicitation of negative emotions, and the muted, indifferent responses to neutral feedback. This highlights the utility of the measure for advancing understanding of how adolescents process diverse peer interactions.\n\nKeywords: Adolescence, Vignette measure, Peer feedback, response to peer feedback",

          "authors": "Camila Valenzuela-Moguillansky",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a contemplative research framework—the Multidimensional Approach to Presence (MAP)—for the scientific study of lived experience. Building on micro-phenomenological research, the proposal examines how cultivating presence –inhabiting one’s lived experience as it unfolds– can be integrated methodologically and epistemologically into experiential inquiry. Drawing on studies of pain and bodily awareness, it analyzes three moments in the generation of experiential knowledge: contact with experience, the description of experience, and the analysis of descriptions. From an enactive perspective that conceives experience as dynamic, self-referential, and transformative, the discussion addresses the strengths and limitations of the method, particularly regarding evocation and memory, dimensions of lived experience that exceed declarative language, and the intersubjective character of knowledge generation. MAP places the cultivation of presence at the core of the investigative process and operates on two levels: methodologically, by integrating tools that foster familiarity with bodily experience—such as micro-phenomenological interviewing, somatic practices, and artistic expression—and epistemologically, by contending that investigating experience requires transforming modes of knowing and thereby opening a process of self-transformation. In this way, the article highlights the need to broaden the methodological and epistemological repertoire of cognitive science, paving the way for a science of experience consistent with the very nature of what it seeks to investigate.",

In the first task, participants identified a single noun embedded in multi-talker babble. Stimuli were presented in auditory-only, visual-only, or audiovisual conditions, and perceptual accuracies were recorded. In the second task, participants identified whether they perceived a red or blue stimulus in either auditory-only (spoken word), visual-only (a red or blue circle), and audiovisual conditions, with response times recorded. Older adults exhibited more multisensory gain relative to younger adults in both speech perception and semantic processing tasks, even when accounting for unisensory declines associated with aging.",

By recognizing how context affects sensory perception, designers can more effectively adapt environmental and task-related elements of experience design. This study compared participants' ability to detect and identify sensory cues, namely, passive tactile and olfactory stimuli, between real-life (RL) and VE. We also examined visual context dependency of sensory awareness in order to understand the contribution of environmental elements on sensory awareness.  This study is designed to measure the feeling of being in a real room, detection, identification, and perceived realism, intensity, roughness, and pleasantness of odor and tactile stimuli in both RL and its VE counterpart. Participants were exposed to sensory stimuli with or without visual cues. During the experiment, participants were given listening tasks. This design aims to understand how visual cues affect sensory perception and how different environments shape sensory performance. \nThe findings revealed that the feeling of being in a real room in VEs was high when all sensory cues (olfactory, tactile, visual) were present. Notably, in VE, odor detection was more accurate, whereas in RL, surface detection and identification were more reliable. When visual cues were present, participants detected olfactory and tactile cues more effectively. These findings shed light on how sensory perception encountered in RL shapes VE experiences and cognitive processes. These insights could enhance VE experiences by guiding the design of more realistic immersive settings and informing the use of sensory elements in VE design.",

          "abstract": "The student selection process is of paramount importance for optimizing the academic performance\nof students and colleges. For effective and evidence-based student selection, factors beyond\nintellectual capacity, such as cognitive style, must be considered. According to the Empathizing-Systemizing theory, individuals can be classified as 'systemizers' or 'empathizers' based on their cognitive style. Systemizers excel at predictable, systematic thinking, which is suited for fields like mathematics and physics. Empathizers are proficient in understanding social phenomena and typically succeed in fields involving significant human interaction, such as language. Individuals with comparable systemizing and empathizing abilities are classified as 'balanced'. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the student selection process in Erbil city effectively directs systemizers and empathizers into their cognitively suited academic fields. A cross-sectional study was conducted to measure the systemizing and empathizing abilities of 518 students from science, medical, and humanities colleges in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan. Students were selected using clustered sampling, and a questionnaire was used to assess their cognitive styles. The final analysis included 93% of the distributed questionnaires. The findings indicated that each academic discipline—sciences, humanities, and medicine—comprised approximately one-third of each brain type (S, N, and E). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of brain types across these disciplines (p = 0.968). This suggests that a student's brain type does not statistically predict their probability of entering a cognitively suitable academic field. The study's results suggest a defective student selection process in the universities examined, which appears unable to direct students with particular cognitive styles to their appropriate fields. These findings can be partially generalized to other state colleges in Slemani and Duhok, as their students have followed similar academic pathways.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatry continues to struggle with the heterogeneity of mental disorders. Classifications such as DSM and ICD catalogue symptom clusters but fail to reveal underlying mechanisms. Recent integrative approaches, including the biopsychosocial model and RDoC, have advanced the field, yet psychiatry still lacks a unifying explanatory principle. We propose the Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis as a conceptual framework—a paradigm rather than a proven theory. It suggests that psychiatric disorders can be understood as variations of a fundamental disruption in the brain’s predictive machinery. From an evolutionary standpoint, the brain’s primary role is not to represent the world accurately, but to anticipate potential dangers in order to ensure survival. When this survival-oriented predictive system becomes miscalibrated, psychopathology may arise. This hypothesis integrates predictive processing and active inference models with clinical psychiatry. Psychosis may be seen as overweighted priors, PTSD as rigid threat models, panic disorder as catastrophic interoceptive predictions, depression as entrenched negative priors, OCD as unresolved prediction errors, autism as overweighted sensory errors, and anxiety as exaggerated threat priors. Like oncology’s unification around disordered cell division, psychiatry may benefit from a unifying lens. The Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis is offered not as a replacement for existing frameworks but as a conceptual paradigm that invites empirical testing and inspires new ways of thinking about diagnosis and treatment.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has shown that dynamics in reward value is an important driver of the stability-flexibility tradeoff. However, these studies have only examined deterministic reward, while real-world reward is predominantly uncertain and volatile in nature. Therefore, this study aimed to test how reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the validity of reward cues through stochastic probabilistic reward schedules. Participants performed a voluntary task switching paradigm with performance-contingent monetary reward at two levels. We used linear mixed models in a large (n=616) undergraduate student sample that enabled us to examine individual differences in how gender and personality influence reward-guided task selection. In line with previous work, we observed a reliable effect of reward transition on flexibility, with more flexible task choices when rewards changed from trial-to-trial and more stability when rewards were stable. Critically, this effect decreased linearly with increasing reward uncertainty. Better than expected high reward outcomes were associated with even greater flexibility than expected high outcomes, however, the reverse was not observed for worse than expected outcomes. At higher levels of reward uncertainty, female participants relied more on recent reward outcomes than cues. Overall, males were more influenced by reward transition than females. Perhaps counterintuitively, reward transition effects on flexibility were most apparent in participants with low levels of reward responsiveness. Our findings suggest that reward uncertainty is a key context that tunes the translation of outcomes into future choices.",

Here we investigate how childhood maltreatment shapes control beliefs and their relationship with stress and exploration in adulthood. We used a recently developed task, the Wheel Stopping (WS) task, to measure and manipulate control beliefs and stress, and combined this with a novel self-report measure of exploration in a sample of 477 adults with and without experience of childhood maltreatment (matched on age, gender and socioeconomic status). The WS task utilises two between-subjects manipulations of control: task controllability (high vs low), and performance feedback (relative positive vs relative negative). We show that despite similar task performance, maltreated participants displayed lower levels of control beliefs compared to controls and that while task performance improved over time for both groups, maltreated participants used this less to update their control beliefs. Further, whereas both groups responded equally to the task manipulations, only controls leveraged relative positive feedback to reduce task-related stress and increase goal-directed exploration. We conclude that maltreatment blunts the calibration of control beliefs, informing both stress and goal-directed exploration, likely increasing vulnerability to psychopathology.",

Given the rapid evolution of digital systems, including artificial intelligence, surveillance, and data sharing, this study sought to revalidate and update the scale, resulting in the Cyber Paranoia and Fear Scale–Updated (CPFS-U). Method: Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) with university students informed the redevelopment of the scale. Eight new items were added, and several were revised. The CPFS-U was administered to 433 adults, alongside validated measures of paranoia, generalised anxiety, online trust, digital confidence, and activity. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure: (1) AI and Digital Dependence Concerns, (2) Technological Risk Awareness and Distrust, (3) Perceived Data Vulnerability, and (4) Surveillance and Monitoring Paranoia. Correlational analyses showed that overall cyber-paranoia and fear were positively associated with generalised anxiety and trait paranoia. Digital confidence and activity showed limited associations with the updated scale, indicating that emotional and cognitive responses to digital systems may be more influential than digital literacy itself. Discussion: The findings suggest that cyber paranoia is a multidimensional construct distinct from general paranoia, shaped by contemporary technological developments. The CPFS-U provides an updated measure for assessing digital mistrust and fear in modern contexts and may inform future research on technology-related anxiety and clinical interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Misdiagnosis is common in bipolar disorder (BD). Currently used screening tools are brief and cost-effective, but there is a lack of understanding of their reliability over time as well as whether responses are influenced by demographic or clinical factors. Aims: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity of two commonly used screening tools as well as their associations with current mood states and other participant characteristics. Methods: 331 adult patients with a diagnosis of BD completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Symptom Checklist-32 (HCL-32) as well as measures of mood online at baseline and three months later. Results: The MDQ was found to have low reliability with poor internal consistency (α= 0.531; α= 0.647 at respective timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.582). The HCL-32 was more reliable with good internal consistency (α= 0.815 at both timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.725). MDQ scores were significantly, positively associated with comorbidities and current symptoms of activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age and years since last hospitalisation. The HCL-32 was also significantly positively correlated with activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age, years since diagnosis and years since last hospitalisation. BD-I patients scored higher than other BD-subtypes. Mood state was the only variable with a significant change over time. Conclusions: The HCL-32 appeared more reliable than the MDQ, although all participants needed to exceed an MDQ threshold at baseline to participate in the study, which may have biased our results.",

          "authors": "Jan Andrews; Olivia Gatto; Andrew LeLacheur; Joshua R de Leeuw",
          "abstract": "Much empirical research over the last thirty years suggests that learning to categorize a set of objects alters the way in which they are perceived or judged, a phenomenon known as learned categorical perception or LCP. LCP has provided key evidence for controversial claims of top-down effects of knowledge on perception and suggested a possible mechanism by which continuous perceptual input is transformed into discrete symbolic representations. LCP may consist of increased cross-category discrimination (\"expansion\"), decreased within-category discrimination (\"compression\"), or both, and some studies fail to show either type of boundary effect. To address these inconsistencies and determine the general robustness of LCP, we conducted separate meta-analyses of expansion and compression on a total of 70 experiments comprising 4,627 participants We found a moderate average effect size for expansion (d = .48) with strong evidence of publication bias, an average effect size of approximately 0 for compression with likely publication bias, and highly significant heterogeneity of effects across experiments for both expansion and compression. Moderator analyses revealed a significant effect of the task used to assess LCP, with same-different judgments tending to produce results consistent with a non-boundary effect of improved discrimination on the category-relevant dimension. However, the sensitivity of the moderator analyses was limited by low statistical power and most of the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies remained unexplained. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of LCP, including suggestions for how future LCP research could be more informative and better support meta-analysis.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a pervasive public health issue with enduring psychosocial consequences. Contemporary, population‑based estimates among young adults and their associations with stress and tobacco behaviors remain undercharacterized.\nMethods: This study employed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data among U.S. adults aged 18–34 (N = 6,252). CSA was measured via the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) module and dichotomized (ever vs. never). Primary correlates included self‑reported stress (low/medium/high), cigarette smoking (never, someday, everyday, former), e‑cigarette use (yes/no), and sociodemographics (sex, sexual orientation, transgender identity, race/ethnicity, education, income). Survey‑weighted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression (survey procedures) estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs.\nResults: In the general population, the unweighted prevalence of CSA was 6.4% (n = 400), while the weighted prevalence was approximately 5.8%. In adjusted model, high stress was associated with a greater odds of reporting CSA (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.07–3.48) compared to low stress. Tobacco-related behaviors were also associated with CSA, including daily smoking (aOR = 3.16), former smoking (aOR= 1.99), occasional smoking (aOR =1.82), and e-cigarette use (aOR =1.95). Higher socioeconomic status was found to have a protective effect on CSA. Being a college graduate (aOR = 0.44) and having an annual household income of more than $100,000 (aOR = 0.48) were associated with reduced odds of CSA. Race/ethnicity was not statistically significant after adjustment. \nConclusions: CSA remains common among US young adults and is associated with higher stress, tobacco use, and socioeconomic disadvantage; sexual minority men show elevated odds. Findings underscore the need for trauma‑informed, equity‑centered prevention and integrated behavioral health and tobacco control strategies tailored to young adults and sexual/gender minority populations.\nKeywords: childhood sexual abuse; young adults; stress; e‑cigarettes; tobacco; BRFSS; sexual orientation; health disparities.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the interplay of persons, situations, and behavior (the Personality Triad) is a key task of psychology. However, previous research has largely focused on Western samples. We examined the Personality Triad across cultures with N = 15,221 participants from 61 countries and one geographic region. Participants reported on one situation from their daily lives. We examined (1) situation characteristic–behavioral state, (2) trait–behavioral state, and (3) trait–situation characteristic associations, as well as (4) trait × situation characteristic interactions predicting behavioral states. We focused on six traits (Big Five, Honesty-Humility), seven situation characteristics (Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Sociality), and three self-reported behavioral states (Agency, Enthusiasm, Self-Negativity). Importantly, we included 15 country-level variables (collectivism, self-construal, cultural value orientations, tightness, independent and interdependent happiness, national socioeconomic status) as moderators that might contribute to country differences in the Personality Triad. Bayesian multilevel models showed sizable and expected situation characteristic–behavioral state and trait–behavioral state associations with a high degree of generalization across countries, some cultural differences, and moderator effects contradicting theoretical expectations. For instance, we found weaker situation characteristic effects in collectivistic cultures and stronger trait effects in embedded cultures. Trait–situation characteristic associations were meaningful but smaller, and trait × situation characteristic interactions were small and less often significant (although we observed some expected interactions). We found little evidence for country differences in the latter two relations. We discuss implications and future directions for cross-cultural work on the Personality Triad, including replications and extensions using intensive-longitudinal designs.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness research is commonly divided into two main areas: the study of states of consciousness and the study of contents of consciousness. States of consciousness refer to discrete modes of awareness elicited by normal states of the brain, such as those associated with wakefulness and sleep, and by abnormal factors, including brain lesions, pharmacological agents and other external interventions. Contents of consciousness refer what we are conscious of. In this chapter, we emphasize the dynamic nature of consciousness in terms of both its states and contents. First, we first observe that our life constantly alternates between different conscious and unconscious states, namely, sleep and wakefulness. Then, within each state, we note an inherent dynamism in content, with conscious experience ranging from content-full to content-less. By surveying the variety of conscious experiences across wakefulness and sleep, we highlight the similarities in reported contents across these states. We further discuss how the possibility of having conscious experiences without specific content challenges the idea that being conscious necessarily involves being conscious of something. Finally, by reviewing the literature on the neural correlates of consciousness, we propose a potential convergence in the study of conscious states and contents.",

Skilled players performed the task faster than novices and showed a more proactive VEA: they spent moretime looking at cues related to future passing opportunities while novices looked more at cues related to ball reception. In addition, skilled players made longer scanning movements before receiving the ball, but they did  not perform  significantly  more  head  movements  than  novices. Under  mental  fatigue,  skilled participants preserved their VEA patterns but required longer visual fixations, suggesting a reduced rate of information processing.

          "abstract": "Children’s first words are frequently recorded to be nouns, rather than verbs, but data from some languages (notably some Asian and African languages including Mandarin, Korean and Ngas) and some methodologies (especially spontaneous speech recordings) suggest that verbs can be represented as early as nouns. Variables that potentially impact early verb knowledge include the structure of the language children are learning and whether it is verb production or comprehension that is investigated. \nWe investigated longitudinal data from Kenya of children’s (N=500) vocabulary production and comprehension using Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs). Children’s caregivers completed overlapping inventories designed for younger infants (completed at age 12 months and designed for ages 8-16 months), and for older toddlers, (parallel forms completed at age 18 and 24 months and designed for ages 16-30 months). The inventories were structured to include words acquired at equivalent ages across word classes (e.g. nouns acquired at a median age of 11 months and verbs acquired at the same median age) but the interactions between word classes and children’s age and the modality in which they know the word (comprehension only or production as well) indicate that nouns and verbs do not follow the same trajectory across acquisition. Nouns emerge relatively earlier in production and comprehension while verbs emerge earlier in comprehension and their production increases as children grow older. \nWe conclude that the findings of Goldfield (2000) and of Stolt et al. (2008) are also true for these Bantu languages: that the noun advantage in early words is seen in studies where production is emphasised, and early verb knowledge can be missed if comprehension is not assessed.",

          "abstract": "Surprisingly few intervention approaches have been evaluated for youth negatively impacted by bullying, and only one known study has directly addressed the traumatic nature of these peer experiences. Thus, there is currently little guidance for practitioners working to address the mental health needs of this population in an individual therapy context. The current article presents a case report of an adolescent male with social anxiety and attention problems who had experienced chronic, severe bullying that had resulted in significant posttraumatic stress symptoms. It illustrates the process of implementing an adapted version of the Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems (MATCH-ADTC) to address these presenting problems. Results demonstrate the potential utility of a modular cognitive-behavioral approach, as it effectively reduced the patient’s experiences of bullying as well as his symptoms of posttraumatic stress and social anxiety; high levels of treatment satisfaction were also reported by the patient and his caregiver. The current article highlights unique treatment considerations and challenges when providing mental health services for youth negatively impacted by bullying, emphasizing the need to help them develop coping skills and a plan for responding to aggressive peers and then the importance of trauma narration to reduce intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance symptoms and to process inaccurate and unhelpful (i.e., self-blaming) cognitions stemming from these experiences.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research increasingly uses situated measures, requiring intensive longitudinal and within-person methods. Such data are typically examined with multilevel models clustering multiple measurement time points within individuals. The intercorrelation patterns obtained with such multilevel models rely on various homogeneity assumptions that should be, but rarely are, tested before using multilevel modeling and interpreting the results.\nThis study proposes a five-step approach to systematically testing homogeneity assumptions in order to obtain more trustworthy estimates of associations among measures when examining clustered multilevel data.\nTo provide an educational illustration of this five-step approach, 1,028 experience sampling method surveys from 37 students were collected over one semester in one university lecture. Twenty-one items measured motivational components and academic emotions. Multilevel analyses estimated an overall within-person and an overall between-person network of zero-order correlations among motivation and emotion facets. Idiographic within-person networks of the 37 participants revealed substantial heterogeneity in their within-person intercorrelation patterns. Heterogeneity was further indicated by one third of the within-person correlations being bi- or multimodally distributed across individuals. We conclude that heterogeneity in within-person patterns must be examined, otherwise, methods relying on homogeneity assumptions, including multilevel analyses, may fail to describe many if not all individuals’ idiographic correlation patterns. This is crucial for the trustworthiness of measurement and structure models, the generalizability of ESM research, and any research aiming for personalized diagnostics and interventions.",

          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

Intimate partner violence (IPV) represents a significant stressor, with high prevalence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In a high-adversity South African birth cohort, the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), we prospectively investigated whether maternal exposure to IPV during pregnancy and in the first 2 years was associated with child brain structure at age 2-3 years. \n\n\n\nStructural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data was analysed from 171 children (n=70 exposed to prenatal IPV; n=55 to postnatal IPV). Regression modelling explored associations between IPV exposures and measures of brain structure derived using FreeSurfer. Voxel- and surface-based morphometry were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping to explore differences in cortical architecture. Analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical confounding variables. \n\n\n\nBoth prenatal and postnatal IPV exposure were associated with increased mean cortical thickness (β=0.037, p=0.030, 95% CI [0.004, 0.070], and β=0.041, p=0.023, 95% CI [0.006, 0.074], respectively), when compared to unexposed controls.

          "abstract": "Circular clothing production and consumption is necessary to mitigate the environmental harms of conventional clothing production. However, traditional recycling methods cannot process the most common form of textile waste into pure components: cotton-polyester blended fabrics. Chemical recycling offers a promising solution for processing these blended fibers, but industrial-scale production of chemical recycling hinges on how consumers view the recycled products. That is, consumer adoption is critical for widespread implementation of textile recycling in the fashion industry. Consumer purchasing decisions are shaped by an array of individual and contextual factors, as well as product attributes. We identified the factors related to willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes through three complementary studies. In Study 1 (N = 50), we qualitatively examined participants’ evaluative reactions to (chemically recycled) clothes using a thought-listing method. In Study 2 (N = 1,009), we used network analysis to quantitatively measure the association between willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes, and the demographic factors, psychological factors, and evaluative reactions identified in Study 1. Consumers who were younger, higher in income, and more concerned about the environment, were willing to pay more for chemically recycled clothes compared to their conventional counterparts. In Study 3, we experimentally manipulated environmental concern. Watching a video highlighting the environmental impact of conventional and chemical clothing led to (a) [greater/equivalent/lower] willingness to pay for chemically recycled clothes in a task with real financial consequences, (b) [stronger/equivalent/weaker] preferences for brands that use chemical recycling, and (c) [greater/equivalent/lower] support for policies promoting chemical recycling.

Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG), have advanced our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying pain perception and modulation. This review provides a modality-wise comparative analysis of neuroimaging tools used in pain research, highlighting the key pipelines, brain region specificity, and clinical relevance. We summarize real-time applications such as neurofeedback using fMRI and EEG, as well as emerging machine learning models applied to fNIRS and multimodal datasets. The review also evaluates software frameworks, including SPM, FSL, CONN, DISCOVER-EEG, and custom deep learning approaches for pain classification and prediction. While fMRI offers superior spatial resolution, EEG and MEG provide millisecond-level temporal precision, and fNIRS is a promising option for bedside monitoring. By synthesizing evidence from 32 peer-reviewed studies, we emphasize the growing role of data integration, automated analysis, and real-time feedback paradigms in shaping the future of pain research and clinical intervention.",

          "abstract": "Engaging adolescents in digital environments is notoriously difficult. A common strategy is message personalization, yet most efforts focus on personalizing what is said rather than how it is expressed. This is a missed opportunity, as youth communication that truly speaks their language requires attention to style as well as content. Digital communication environments enable such stylistic adaptation by revealing users’ expression patterns that can be leveraged for personalization. Yet little is known about how adolescents respond to persuasive messages written in a similar linguistic style, or how such similarity is best operationalized. Addressing these gaps, this preregistered study tests whether adolescents prefer social media health messages that are more similar to their linguistic style and identifies which linguistic categories are most effective in eliciting positive responses. We analyzed donated WhatsApp conversation data from 191 Dutch adolescents (aged 13–15) to calculate individual linguistic profiles and design Instagram-style health messages that varied in linguistic similarity. Participants then evaluated 22 message pairs, each manipulating one linguistic category. Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence that linguistic similarity influenced message preference or personalization, and moderate evidence against effects on perceived effectiveness. However, adolescents consistently preferred messages that were positively valenced and low in complexity, regardless of linguistic similarity. These findings suggest that positive, easy-to-read messages may be an effective strategy for digital youth engagement. Furthermore, we discuss the implications for computer-mediated style matching, including algorithmic approaches, large language models, and future theoretical development.",

          "abstract": "Attachment orientations are theorized to change in response to significant\ninterpersonal life events. However, empirical findings remain mixed. Moreover, the role of\nsubjective event perceptions—though emphasized in personality research—has been largely\nbeen neglected in research on attachment development. In a longitudinal study spanning 7\nwaves over 2.5 years, we examined how romantic relationship transitions—entering or ending\na committed relationship—predict changes in attachment anxiety and avoidance, and whether\nthese effects are moderated by subjective event perceptions. We analyzed data of N = 1,717\nparticipants (69.6% women aged 18-40, M = 26.5 years) who were single (52%) or in a\npartnership (48%) at the beginning of the study. Using multilevel piecewise modeling, we\ndistinguished selection, anticipation, and socialization effects. Avoidant individuals were less\nlikely to enter new relationships (selection effect), and avoidance declined prior to partnering\n(anticipation effect). Both anxiety and avoidance shifted in response to transitions\n(socialization effects): anxiety decreased after partnering and increased after separation, while\navoidance showed a temporary decrease post-separation followed by a gradual increase.\nThese shifts mirrored average differences between partnered and single individuals,\nsuggesting rapid adaptation to new social roles. Subjective perceptions of the events (e.g.,\nvalence, social status decrease, predictability) showed limited moderation effects. Overall,\nfindings underscore the importance of social role transitions in shaping attachment processes,\nwhile suggesting that subjective evaluations may have a more nuanced role than previously\nassumed. These results contribute to personality theory by clarifying the contextual and\nexperiential mechanisms underlying intraindividual change in attachment insecurity.",

          "authors": "Ksenia Kotiusheva; Laurel Hilliker; Tracy Ibbotson; Satu Baylan; Maria Gardani; Gemma Learmonth",
          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience research often relies on convenience sampling of participants, which can result in biased sample demographics and an under-representation of older adults. There is a need to identify effective routes to widen participation among older adults and explore age-related differences in motivations and barriers to research involvement. This mixed methods study combines qualitative data from two focus groups, conducted with 11 healthy adults aged 56-73, and an online questionnaire completed by 335 adults aged 18-88. Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",

          "abstract": "Understanding variability is a key focus in many areas of psychological research, with growing interest in modeling individual and group variability. While multilevel models such as heterogeneous variance models and Mixed-Effect Location Scale (MELS) models have been used to capture these dynamics, they typically rely on linear assumptions and temporal change of the variability is restricted to one level. Recent calls for nonlinear approaches in psychology highlight the need for more flexible models that can better account for complex, dynamic processes. This paper introduces the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) within the framework of heterogeneous variance models to address these limitations. By incorporating GPs, we allow for the modeling of nonlinear variability across multiple levels, including temporal dynamics at both the individual and group levels. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in two empirical applications. Our findings show that using GPs provide an improved model fit compared to traditional linear methods and highlight the utility of GPs in variance modeling, offering new possibilities for studying dynamic and emergent processes in psychological and social science research.",

          "abstract": "This systematic review examines the intersection of bilingualism and dyslexia by analysing 40 studies involving bilingual dyslexic readers (DRs). The goal is to identify dyslexia characteristics that are independent of bilingual experience and determine the appropriate tests for in bilinguals. Findings indicate that rapid naming and reading impairments remain prevalent in bilingual DRs while phonological awareness appears to be more variably impaired in bilinguals. Differences between monolinguals and bilinguals are more present in DRs than typical readers (TRs), suggesting that bilingual experience might play a more substantial role in populations with deficits. Results from predictive studies do not allow for evidence-based recommendations due to their variability. Overall, fndings suggest that some diagnostic tools retain cross-linguistic validity, while others’ prognostic potential may be modulated by bilingual experience. The results highlight the need for comprehensive assessments, considering linguistic profiles. Future research should adopt standardised definitions and tests, larger samples, and collaborative methods to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the Researcher-As-Obstacle (RAO) framework, a methodology enabling the study of the creative process as it unfolds. Traditional research in creativity psychology minimizes researcher interference to maintain authenticity, primarily using post-factum interviews. In contrast, the RAO approach situates researchers as “obstacles” within the artist’s creative environment, providing close access to the artist’s “creative engine”, the underlying creative dynamic. Researchers intervene in real-time to capture shifts in pre-reflexive gestures and emerging meaning before they become conscious or verbalized. Drawing from anthropology and psychology, this framework emphasizes the value of researcher presence as a structured obstacle. This approach offers researchers a powerful tool for capturing creative processes in real-time, rarely accessible through traditional methods, by granting artists a finer awareness of their creative dynamics. This awareness can also serve as a valuable resource in art-based contexts.",

          "abstract": "Social interactions can be deeply rewarding, yet they are marked by social uncertainty. The uncertainty arises because we can never truly know another’s mind. As a species, humans find uncertainty aversive and excessive. Intolerance of uncertainty is a risk factor for emotional disorders. One way to resolve uncertainty in novel situations is to rely on memories of past similar experiences, yet this process is largely unexplored in social contexts. A novel social decision-making task showed that individuals recruit both memories and incremental experiences of social rewards to guide decisions under social uncertainty. Further, individuals with elevated depressive symptoms showed better integration of positive social memories if they also had high levels of autobiographical memory specificity. These findings suggest that successfully recalling past positive social experiences improves navigation of social uncertainty, and may confer preventative advantages for those with high levels of affective disorder symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Understanding verbal irony involves detecting that the speaker’s intended meaning contrasts with the literal meaning. This is challenging for children as the underlying skills required to understand irony may not be fully developed. We investigated how 10-year-olds’ working memory, empathy skills, and gender are related to their processing and comprehension of written irony. Data from two previous eye-tracking experiments with 97 children (46 girls and 51 boys) were analysed. Results showed that children with stronger empathy skills had higher irony comprehension accuracy and were less likely to reread ironic phrases. Higher working memory was linked to faster processing of irony but did not lead to higher comprehension. Conversely, lower working memory was associated with more accurate irony comprehension. Child gender was not related to irony comprehension. These results imply that working memory and emotional perspective-taking are important for children's irony comprehension, aligning with theories that take individual differences into account.",

          "abstract": "The combination of high life satisfaction and frequent experiences of pleasant feelings is\nsometimes called hedonic wellbeing (HWB). We argue that a good life comprises more than\nhedonia and that a taxonomy of wellbeing should also include a eudaimonic dimension\n(EWB). The paper challenges a fundamental premise in research on wellbeing, which states\nthat self-reported life satisfaction provides an unbiased, broad, and reflected evaluation of an\nindividual’s life “as-a-whole.” Countering this assumption, two studies showed that HWB\nindicators differ from indicators of EWB, indicating that HWB does not measure EWB. Using\nsurvey experiments, the paper further demonstrated that, upon reflection, participants\ntypically regard eudaimonic values as more important than hedonic values, proposing that\nliving eudaimonically is important in people’s lives. A third finding showed that gaps\nbetween ideal and actual hedonic values predicted life satisfaction, whereas eudaimonic\nvalues gaps did not. This suggests that life satisfaction is not an unbiased evaluation of all the\nimportant values in a person’s life. Thus, measures of life satisfaction appear invalid (not\nmeasuring what they intend to measure). To get more relevant data on how well people\nconsider their lives to be, both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions should be taken into\naccount.",

Our AQ version demonstrated acceptable to good internal consistency, and a six-factor structure: Social Interests, Theory of Mind, Social Skills, Attention to Detail, Imagination, and Planning. The ASD group scored higher than the TD group on the total score and five subscales. Interactions between group and sex showed that sex differences appeared only within the ASD groups. Cut-off points showed good sensitivity, specificity, and discriminative properties for the Mexican population. Our findings align with reports from other countries, highlighting the relevant traits in a Mexican sample, advancing the understanding of cultural factors in self-reported autistic traits.",

This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern explained higher creativity ratings given to AI-generated essays than more idea-diverse human essays. Paradoxical homogenization was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among racial and linguistic minority applicants. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. Results suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content may mask deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation.

Subsequent elaboration of a lower order structure based on the first three broader domains yielded seven additional factors: Fear and Somatoform, Thought Disorder, Suicide, Negative Affectivity, and Narcissism, resulting in a total of 11factors at the most nuanced level. Sequential hierarchical modeling iteratively traced the factor structure from one global psychopathology factor down to the 7-factor level, and subsequently, 11-factor level. Construct validity of the factor structures was evaluated via correlation and regression analyses using scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-3 (MMPI-3). These results yielded broad support for the convergent validity of the HiTOP-SR structure, as the various factors demonstrated meaningful associations with conceptually relevant MMPI-3 scale scores. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the HiTOP-SR as a promising dimensional assessment tool aligned with key aspects of the HiTOP framework, while also highlighting directions for further replication and refinement.",

          "abstract": "Hyperglycemia affects cardiac activity at rest, but its effect on cardiac reactivity has not been investigated extensively. While glucose increases hormonal stress responses without changing cardiac stress reactivity, less is known about the interaction of glucose and relaxation interventions on cardiac reactivity. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of glucose administration and a standardized massage intervention on psychophysiological relaxation and sustained attention. \nNinety-four participants (age mean = 22.84 years, SD = 2.53 years; 71.28% female) were randomly assigned to consume a drink containing glucose, or pure water before receiving a standardized massage or resting. Directly after the manipulation, they completed the d2 sustained attention test. We repeatedly assessed blood glucose and mood and recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiography (ICG) throughout. Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) were used as a measure of parasympathetic activity, and pre-ejection period (PEP) indexed sympathetic activity. \nOur preregistered analyses showed that both relaxation interventions increased PNS activity and decreased arousal. Glucose activated the SNS and prevented SNS withdrawal in response to the massage. However, it did not modulate PNS or affective reactivity to the interventions. While cardiac reactivity was not related to sustained attention, higher blood glucose was linked to higher concentration performance and accuracy in explorative analyses. \nThe results provide further support for the autonomic space model demonstrating independence of SNS and PNS regulation depending on the type of manipulation. They may further our understanding of the links between glucose metabolism and autonomic functioning.",

          "abstract": "Parental rules have been curiously neglected from a conceptual and measurement perspective. The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges for humanity in this century. Communicating in a way that raises awareness of the risk climate changes poses while at the same time not inducing negative feelings, like helplessness, is a challenge. On one hand research has shown that emphasizing the severity of climate change is related to higher risk perception, which could lead to more pro-environmental behavior. On the other hand, it could trigger higher helplessness which is associated with lower motivation to act climate friendly. Previous research showed that controllability, leads to lower risk perception and lower learned helplessness. In our research we are investigating the impact of induced controllability of the consequences of climate change on risk perception and learned helplessness. To this end, we conducted two experiments with N = 216 and N = 489 (quota-based sample) participants in Germany. Participants received six climate change scenarios that differed only in induced controllability (high vs low). More specifically, we had four conditions: own control, control by government, hopeless, and a control condition. For both experiments results showed that participants’ risk perception increased after they read the scenarios, independent of the conditions. In Experiment 1 learned helplessness decreased, as expected, for the conditions with high controllability. Surprisingly, for Experiment 2 results showed an overall decrease of  learned helplessness independent of the controllability level. When adding participants’ ratings on the pro-environmental behavior scale (PEBS-C) as a moderator variable, results showed that those who had higher ratings on the PEBS-C scale reported higher levels of helplessness for the scenario with the lowest controllability, compared to the control group. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of including solutions when addressing the negative impacts of climate change.",

          "abstract": "The scientific literature does not automatically correct itself. Unreliable findings may persist for years without correction or retraction. Following prior definitions of zombie articles that are retracted but continue to be cited affirmatively, we add another category of ‘undead’ articles. We define ‘vampire’ articles by two necessary conditions. The first condition is demonstrated irreproducibility, which we operationalize and define with the help of a novel typology of replication efforts. We propose a rule of thumb how many failed efforts at replication might be required for each type of replication effort before the original finding is deemed irreproducible. The second condition for a putative vampire article is that it is cited affirmatively in public policy the scientific literature, or private communications, after the first condition is met. We discuss rules of thumb for how many such affirmative citations might lead qualified researchers in that subfield to address the article of concern within the scientific literature. We surmise that a substantial number of vampire articles exist as our two cases resemble those criticized in a growing literature addressing problematic science and the reproducibility crisis. Our first case concerns aerial gunning of coyotes and the second case predicts over-fishing. We discuss the damaging effects of vampire articles and why the melodramatic metaphor has heuristic value and utility. We also discuss lessons from the communication sciences about how to remedy misinformation, offering recommendations to researchers, publishers and editors, all of whom share an interest in rigorous inquiry and public trust in science.",

Recently, interest has turned towards emotional processing and mental health correlates, including a qualitative account of the mental healthcare experiences of aphantasic people. Still, a systematic presentation of what it is like to live with aphantasia is lacking. We gathered the data of 52 aphantasic adults (mean VVIQ [Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire] score = 16.5, age range = 16 – 81, 14 women, 20 UK residents and 18 USA residents) from a larger sample of 6436 online survey respondents, and thematically analysed their answers to the survey’s open-ended items alongside additional unprompted testimonies provided via email. We identified 4 main themes: (1) Communicating and Understanding the “mind’s eye” in a world of visualisers; (2) The diverse experience of knowing without seeing and search for imagery; (3) The protective &amp; disruptive ways that aphantasia shapes life and thoughts; (4) The search for meaning. The study draws on the voices and experiences of aphantasic people to explore the psychosocial correlates of aphantasia. We describe how the absence of mental imagery is not merely a perceptual variation, but a significant dimension of human difference with implications for clinical practice, education, creativity, and self-understanding.",

Existing evidence suggests that these extreme groups are heterogeneous. After re-examining and largely replicating previously reported differences between people with aphantasia and hyperphantasia in 6436 online respondents, we investigate whether the variable features of aphantasia cluster in distinct subtypes. We conducted a latent class analysis with a subset of 3883 respondents who completed key measures of imagery (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) and self-reported cognitive experiences (sensory imagery, autobiographical memory, face recognition, spatial navigation). 3 subtypes of aphantasia emerge: 1) a ‘global aphantasia’ subtype with extreme sensory features in most to all sensory modalities; 2) an ‘Aphantasia +’ subtype with both sensory and cognitive features in the domains listed above; and 3) a ‘non-global aphantasia’ subtype with milder uni- or multisensory features. Our findings confirm the heterogeneous nature of aphantasia, with subtypes varying alongside 3 dimensions: number (and type) of sensory modalities experiencing low imagery, the intensity of aphantasia in the concerned sensory modalities (total lack of versus poor imagery), and the presence or absence of additional cognitive difficulties outwith sensory imagery. Together, these findings call for a shift in the theoretical and methodological approaches to aphantasia and imagery research.",

          "abstract": "While global challenges demand both equitable and effective altruism, people often prioritize those nearby and overlook the impact of their prosocial actions. Here, we examined what moral values support altruism that is both equitable (helping others impartially regardless of proximity or group membership) and effective (helping impactfully by maximizing welfare gains). We studied two rare populations: effective altruists (EAs; N = 119), defined by their philosophical commitment to impartiality and maximizing impact, and extraordinary altruists (XAs; N = 65), defined by their real-world decision to donate an organ to a stranger—an act of radical impartiality, though not explicitly impact-maximizing. A demographically similar general population sample (N = 176) served as a comparison group. Participants completed moral measures from pluralistic theories (i.e., Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q)), along with the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS). They also completed assessments of equitable, effective, and combined altruistic orientations. Both altruistic groups showed elevated moral expansiveness (MES) and impartial beneficence \n(OUS) relative to controls. EAs, compared to XAs and controls, more strongly endorsed utilitarian principles (including instrumental harm on the OUS) and deprioritized traditional cooperative values (e.g., reciprocity, deference on the MAC-Q). Familial loyalty (MAC-Q) negatively predicted altruistic orientations across groups. Surprisingly, group loyalty—conceptualized as parochial by pluralistic moral theories—positively predicted equitable and effective altruism across groups, challenging assumptions that parochial values necessarily constrain prosociality. These findings instead suggest inclusive forms of loyalty may help promote altruism that is both equitable and effective.",

          "abstract": "AI-mediated therapy systems simulate empathy, attunement, and conversational responsiveness, producing a sentience halo: the user’s perception of emergent AI awareness. This effect is driven by unopposed mirroring, where the AI reflects users’ language, affect, and cognitive-emotional patterns without challenge, fostering reliance and displacing aspects of self onto the system. Over time, Doppelgänger Drift can destabilize identity and relational scaffolding. Drawing on anecdotal reports, media accounts, and usage metrics, this paper outlines structural risks of AI therapy, including loss of containment, mirages of alliance, and accumulation of ambiguous harm. I also examine legal, medical, and societal considerations, and propose guardrails emphasizing transparency, limits disclosure, and research priorities for monitoring identity-level impacts. This framework offers a conceptual lens for understanding AI-mediated identity risk and aims to inform both clinical practice and policy development.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

We conducted the first comprehensive assessment of mental health difficulties across psychology disciplines in a sample (N = 1,261) of faculty and graduate students affiliated with U.S. doctoral degree granting institutions. Over 84% of respondents reported a lifetime history of mental health difficulties; 54% reported a lifetime diagnosis; 15% had clinically elevated current depression symptoms; 16% reported clinically elevated current anxiety symptoms; and 51% met Keyes’ “flourishing” criteria. The most common mental health concerns were depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Across all outcomes, graduate students reported significantly greater frequency and severity of difficulties. Clinically elevated current depression and anxiety were 3-4 times higher in graduate students (21% and 22%, respectively) compared to professor-level faculty (6% and 7%, respectively). Rates of flourishing were lower in graduate students than faculty (OR = 2.65, p &lt; .001). Clinical-area respondents (92%) were more likely to report a lifetime mental health difficulty than non-clinical area respondents (83%). Interestingly, while there were no field-level differences in rates of current elevated anxiety, clinical-area respondents had lower rates of clinically elevated depression. Academic psychology is not an exception to the mental health crisis in higher education. Particularly urgent action is needed to improve graduate students’ mental health.

          "abstract": "Background &amp; Aims: Access to specialized healthcare for children with autism spectrum disorder has long been hindered by limited availability of qualified clinicians, particularly in rural and economically disadvantaged areas. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these disparities, overwhelming traditional healthcare models and highlighting the need for innovative solutions. Telehealth emerged as a critical tool during the pandemic, facilitating continued access to care, particularly for underserved populations. We aimed to investigate the extent to which functional language deficits can be identified and assessed in children with autism, and ruled out in neurotypical children, via telehealth. \nMethods: This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of using telehealth for assessing verbal behavior deficits in children diagnosed with autism, comparing them to neurotypical peers, and exploring the potential for telehealth to expand access to specialized intervention. Twelve children, seven of whom had an autism diagnosis, participated in telehealth-based functional analyses of verbal behavior. \nResults: Results indicated that children with autism exhibited statistically significant differences in across functional language domains, whereas no such differences were identified in neurotypical peers. No false positives or false negatives were detected. At follow-up, participants with autism showed statistically significant improvements in verbal language skills. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that telehealth is a reliable and valid method for assessing the verbal behavior of children with autism. This research supports the use of telehealth to bridge healthcare gaps for families in remote or underserved areas. By providing an accessible platform for functional language assessment, telehealth offers a promising avenue for enhancing early intervention and improving long-term outcomes. \nImplications: Our findings highlight the importance of individualized interventions to address verbal behavior deficits of children with autism. Future research is necessary to explore the scalability of these findings and their application in broader, more diverse populations.",

Furthermore, we replicated a previous finding that increased visual perceptual load in a scene reduces eyewitness recall accuracy, but observed this effect in the Laboratory group only. In Study 2, we added a General Online group to test whether these differences extended to all online data collection, or if they were specific to Prolific participants. Misinformation susceptibility in the General Online group was similar to the Laboratory group, and significantly lower than that in the Prolific group. However, perceptual load effects were also absent in the General Online group. Ultimately, these findings indicate that different data collection contexts yield varying results in eyewitness misinformation studies.

Proliferating ToCs accumulate anomalies without progress, operating orthogonally. The principle of recurrency – functional and architectural – offers a unifying, mechanistic scaffold for consciousness to arise. We show that all theories tacitly invoke feedback loops and can be re-expressed along a single axis of recursion. Four nested levels, viz., cellular, local inter-areal, global, and lateral, map onto state, phenomenal content, manipulative access, and experiential similarity, respectively, thus tying evolved anatomy to phenomenon. The traditional phenomenal-versus-access stand-off dissolves into a graded cascade wherein deeper recursion expands the set of reportable, behaviour-driving variables. Recurrence is favoured evolutionarily, and ontologically, rebutting feed-forward, “unfolding” objections, while brain-body loops ground selfhood, and complete action loops with the environment. Furthermore, clinically, targeting recurrent pathways promise new biomarkers, and alleviation, in disorders of consciousness (DoCs).

For that aim, N=60 \nparticipants were recruited, including 30 patients with MCI and 30 healthy controls. During fMRI, \nparticipants completed a facial emotion recognition task with expressions of anger, fear, sadness, \nhappiness, and neutral faces. Behavioral assessments further included measures of cognitive \ndomains (attention, memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial skills), face \nprocessing, emotional intelligence, and emotional interference. Patients with MCI showed \nimpaired recognition of negative emotions, such as anger (β=–0.37, p&lt;0.05), fear (β=–0.37, \np&lt;0.05), and sadness (β=–0.85, p&lt;0.001), whereas recognition of happiness remained intact. \nSadness recognition was predicted by face processing ability, and overall emotion recognition was \nassociated with memory performance. fMRI results showed widespread, emotion-specific \nactivation in healthy controls, particularly in occipital, frontal, and subcortical regions. Patients \nwith MCI showed reduced activation and less differentiated patterns, though group-level BOLD \ndifferences were not statistically significant. In summary, patients with MCI demonstrated \ndifficulties in recognizing negative emotions, which may impact social functioning, while neural \nmechanisms supporting emotion recognition appear largely preserved at this stage of cognitive \ndecline.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has implicated the implicit learning of statistical regularities as a potential factor contributing to reading deficits in individuals with dyslexia. These deficits are characterized by weaker neural adaptation compared to typically developing readers, suggesting impaired general processing in forming short-term representations of stimulus consistency. In addition, inconsistent findings have been observed regarding amplitude differences in mismatch negativity (MMN) between individuals with and without dyslexia. Although neural adaptation is believed to contribute to MMN, these two processes have been examined in separate bodies of literature, leaving their relationship in children with and without dyslexia unclear. To address this issue, 42 children with Chinese dyslexia and 26 children without dyslexia participated in an EEG roving paradigm experiment with continuous pure-tone stimuli. Importantly, the stimuli were carefully arranged to minimize expectations and isolate pure adaptation effects. The initial adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the deviants and the 2nd tones) and subsequent adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the 2nd tones and the final tones) effects, including P1a, P1b, and N250, as well as the amplitudes of MMN and late MMN, were extracted. We found that both groups exhibited similar adaptation effects, MMN, and late MMN, supported by minimal evidence for differences in our Bayesian analyses. The relationship between adaptation and MMN was also comparable between the groups. Potential reasons for discrepancies between this study and previous research, including experimental design and language differences, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "One of the main difficulties in the field of science of learning is to ensure that findings are adopted by policy makers and practitioners and translated into the classroom. To address the question of why challenges persist, five heads of research labs involved in the science of learning from three different countries (the United Kingdom, France, and Chile) conducted a workshop to discuss challenges for the science of learning field. Thematic analysis was conducted on presentation slides and discussion notes, and the themes were organised around an adapted five-dimensional gaps framework by Miles (2017) to produce a gap analysis. Current gaps were identified in relation to: 1) existing theory and knowledge; 2) the research-practice divide; 3) research methodologies; 4) empirical testing and evidence verification; and 5) research with specific populations. Examples from work across the labs were used to represent international perspectives on challenges and evidence possible solutions. Some of the key takeaways and strategies for surmounting these gaps included the need for funding to research lesser-studied areas and populations, to replicate or repeat intervention evaluations, and to establish meaningful co-produced research partnerships between educators and research institutions.",

Although existing literature has examined autistic people’s views on camouflaging, it rarely explores these perspectives through natural conversations outside of research settings. To address this gap, we analyzed autistic people’s perception of camouflaging based on online discussions between autistic people.\nMethodology\nThis study examined 194 posts from 68 users on a UK-based autism forum, employing inductive thematic analysis to identify key aspects of camouflaging.\nFindings\nThe analysis revealed a predominantly negative view of camouflaging, with most users employing it primarily for social integration, especially in work settings. The most reported consequence was exhaustion. Not camouflaging leads to improved mental health, but also potentially to rejection.\nOriginality\nOur findings strengthen existing knowledge about camouflaging by adding new analysis conducted directly on conversations happening organically. Future research should collect more data from natural conversations to validate these results and consider diverse sources of autistic individuals' perspectives.\nKeywords: social camouflaging, masking, autism spectrum disorder, web forum, perception",

          "authors": "Vanessa Gabriela Keller; Matthew HC Mak; Scott Cairney; M. Gareth Gaskell",
          "abstract": "Encountering a homonym in a sentential context that biases interpretation towards its subordinate meaning makes that meaning easier to access later. This word-meaning priming effect is not restricted to homonyms and may be supported by general episodic memory processes. Such an account predicts that word-meaning priming may be affected by factors that affect episodic learning (e.g., predictability). Specifically, the contextual predictability of an incoming stimulus has been shown to affect episodic memory in that both highly expected as well as highly unexpected input leads to better memory for that input, via two different underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. We hypothesised that if word-meaning priming is supported by episodic memory processes, both highly expected as well as highly unexpected target words should lead to stronger word-meaning priming effects than target words of intermediate predictability. Four pre-registered online experiments tested whether contextual predictability affects word-meaning priming and incidental memory for language. We exposed participants to sentences that emphasised a particular aspect of a sentence-final target word’s meaning. Importantly, target words differed in how predictable they were based on the sentence context (e.g., “You can get in a good workout by riding a bicycle” vs. “You can get in a good workout by lifting a bicycle”). Associate production and semantic relatedness judgement assessed the strength of word-meaning priming. Contrary to our hypotheses, while there was evidence for priming across experiments, we found no significant effects of contextual predictability in any experiments. Our findings suggest that predictability-guided updating is rarely triggered during language comprehension, and we outline the theoretical implications of these results for the architecture of the language system.",

          "abstract": "Background\nAttachment style is widely recognised as influential in shaping responses to bereavement and prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Although theorised extensively, empirical clarity regarding how attachment styles specifically impact PGD symptoms and therapeutic implications remains limited. This study aimed to identify cognitive-behavioural mechanisms linking attachment styles to PGD symptoms.\nMethods\nData were collected from a community sample of 695 bereaved adults. Network analysis explored interactions between attachment styles (anxious and avoidant) and various cognitive-behavioural factors associated with PGD, including appraisals, memory characteristics, maladaptive coping strategies, and social disconnection.\nResults\nThe findings reveal attachment styles as peripheral within the network, suggesting that their direct influence on PGD symptoms may be less central than previously theorised. However, anxious attachment correlated positively with injustice rumination and altered social self, while avoidant attachment was positively associated with perceived loss of future and relationships and preferences for solitude, and negatively associated with proximity-seeking behaviours and fear of losing connection to the deceased. Cognitive-behavioural factors, particularly memory characteristics and social disconnection, held central positions within the network, mediating relationships between attachment styles and PGD.\nConclusions\nAttachment styles indirectly influence PGD through cognitive-behavioural pathways rather than exerting strong direct effects. By bridging the gap between attachment theory and cognitive-behavioural approaches to grief, this study offers a more nuanced understanding of its relationship with PGD, and points towards potential new avenues for future interventions aimed at addressing attachment-related challenges in bereaved individuals.",

          "abstract": "Representational gestures have been shown to be beneficial for speech comprehension especially in adverse listening conditions, as they provide meaningful information related to speech. However, it is still unclear whether seeing representational gestures directs additional attention towards the speech signal. \nIn the current study, we addressed this research question by investigating neural tracking of speech in the presence of representational gestures during unscripted dialogue with and without background noise. Dyads performed a tangram-based referential communication task, while audio-visual behavior and dual-EEG were recorded.  \nRepresentational gestures increased neural tracking of speech in both delta and theta frequencies and in both dialogue conditions in comparison to control movements. This finding suggests that seeing representational gestures directs attention to the processing of both acoustic and linguistic information of the speech signal. As no differences in neural tracking of speech were observed between dialogue conditions, we believe that dyads made use of different strategies to overcome the noise interference. In sum, we argue that neural tracking of speech represents a flexible mechanism which can be modulated by attentional processes to meet different cognitive and communicative demands during face-to-face interaction.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.",

          "abstract": "Situations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. Time is among the most fundamental resources to which people tend to be acutely sensitive across contexts. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time.",

          "authors": "Mauricio Martins; Dan Cook; Arno Villringer",
          "abstract": "The capacity to represent recursive hierarchical embedding (RHE) is considered a hallmark of human cognition. Yet, it remains debated whether non-linguistic recursion depends on language-specific, domain-general, or independent visuospatial mechanisms. In two experiments, we tested this question using a dual-task paradigm. Participants performed either a visual recursion task (REC) or a matched visual iteration task (ITE) while concurrently engaging in lexical retrieval (LEX), serial arithmetic (MATH), visual delayed match-to-sample (VIS), or no interference (NONE). Both LEX and MATH—tasks that require serial, symbolic, generative processing—reliably reduced accuracy in REC and ITE, with interference being stronger for ITE. Drift diffusion modeling confirmed that LEX and MATH slowed evidence accumulation and reduced decision thresholds, indicating less efficient and more impulsive responding. Interestingly, while LEX and MATH lengthened response times in ITE, they shortened them in REC, suggesting compensatory processing strategies. By contrast, VIS did not impair accuracy; instead, it increased drift and boundary separation, consistent with more cautious evidence accumulation. Cognitive covariates further revealed that verbal working memory predicted REC more strongly than ITE under baseline conditions; however, this advantage did not account for the greater interference observed in ITE. Taken together, these findings suggest that visual hierarchical processing involves serial symbolic resources, but recursion is more resilient than iteration, possibly due to the availability of parallel or configural strategies. This supports a hybrid architecture in which linguistic-like symbolic operations contribute to building visual hierarchies, but alternative mechanisms can buffer recursion when these resources are taxed.",

Higher performance was observed among females, individuals with more years of schooling, and those from English-speaking backgrounds. Reading achievement was positively correlated with measures of cognitive capacity, including processing speed and general knowledge.

Furthermore, we investigated whether such deficits are limited to working memory or also extend to inhibitory control.\n\nMethods: 105 regularly cycling women between the ages of 19 to 35 were tested in three menstrual cycle phases (mid-follicular, mid-luteal, late luteal). Premenstrual symptoms were tracked across two cycles. 54 women were allocated to the PMS/PMDD group, 51 women served as controls. Working memory and inhibitory control were assessed using the n-back and stop signal task, respectively. Hormone levels were determined using saliva samples.\n\nResults: Working memory deficits in the PMS/PMDD group emerged under high cognitive load and did not vary by cycle phase. The PMS/PMDD group also had significantly longer stop signal reaction times (SSRTs) across all cycle phases, with SSRTs positively correlating with premenstrual symptom severity. There was no significant correlation between performance measures and gonadal hormone levels.\n\nConclusions: Cognitive impairments in PMS/PMDD appear to be trait-like and affect both working memory and inhibitory control. These deficits may underlie difficulties in emotion regulation and are not solely attributable to gonadal hormone levels.",

          "authors": "Hongyang Liu",
          "abstract": "Dual-process theories posit that fast, intuitive System 1 often produces bias, whereas slow, deliberative System 2 corrects it. This manuscript challenges that traditional view by synthesizing theory and evidence on motivated System-2 reasoning (MS2R)—the tendency for deliberation to be co-opted in defense of identity-relevant beliefs. Across domains (e.g., climate risk, vaccines, gun policy), polarization has been shown to increase with subject-matter knowledge or numeracy when issues implicate social identity, whereas the same abilities improve accuracy for identity-neutral problems. Six complementary mechanisms are reviewed to explain these effects: (a) confirmation bias and motivated skepticism; (b) identity-protective cognition; (c) belief as value-signaling (expressive utility); (d) cognitive dissonance and conflict rationalization; (e) the argumentative theory of reasoning; and (f) bounded/resource-rational approaches (e.g., BIASR) that yield selective trust as an efficient but polarizing heuristic. Boundary conditions and critiques are then considered. High-powered replications indicate a robust directional motivated-reasoning main effect but limited evidence that higher ability amplifies bias uniformly; design features (ambiguity, incentives, audience visibility) and affect-first gating appear pivotal. Identity-congruent responding is further reinterpreted as instrumentally rational signaling under reputational and career incentives, especially for elites. Finally, actionable countermeasures are proposed: accuracy prompts and incentives, self-affirmation and identity-safe framing, symmetric-scrutiny protocols (e.g., steel-manning), probabilistic forecasting with feedback, clarity-enhancing data displays and preregistered criteria, and prebunking. Research prospects include sharper operationalization separating ability, disposition, and state engagement; process-tracing and psychophysiological markers to adjudicate mechanisms; and preregistered, multi-lab designs that vary ambiguity, incentives, and audience. Educational applications emphasize embedding accuracy nudges, forecasting tournaments, and structured adversarial collaboration to realign System 2 from identity performance toward error detection.",

To date, these side effects have primarily been assessed through self-report measures, limiting insight into the underlying mechanisms. This study aims to investigate behavioral and emotional responses to varying levels of social provocation and the associated neural processes in epilepsy patients, using a modified version of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) during functional MRI (fMRI).\nMethods: We included 38 epilepsy patients and 38 healthy controls with no significant difference in age or gender. All participants completed the modified TAP during fMRI scanning, consisting of three blocks with low, medium, and high provocation level defined by the amount of monetary punishment selected by a fictitious opponent. After each block, participants rated their emotional states and fairness perception. Additionally, they completed standardized psychological questionnaires assessing trait aggression (BPAQ), depressive symptoms (BDI), and impulsivity (BIS). \nResults: Despite higher self-reported trait aggression in patients, no significant group differences were observed in behavioral aggression. Compared to healthy controls, patients exhibited increased neural activity in regions associated with emotional regulation and cognitive control (e.g. Superior Parietal Lobule, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Superior Frontal Gyrus) in response to low provocation. However, they demonstrated diminished sensitivity to escalating provocation at both neural and emotional levels.\nSignificance: The findings emphasize the need for a broader perspective that addresses the internal burden of emotional regulation and the associated neural mechanisms when being provoked, not just overt behavior. We highlight the importance of minor provocations in distinguishing patients from healthy control. Although no clear mechanism for a specific type of medication could be identified, the results indicate a potential impact of antiseizure medications. \n\nKeywords: fMRI; taylor aggression paradigm; provocation; depression; antiseizure medication; adverse effects",

Chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and cancer require continuous adjustment to medical and lifestyle demands, often resulting in psychological strain. Research consistently shows elevated rates of depression and anxiety among individuals with chronic illness compared to the general population. Key mediators of this connection include stress, sleep quality, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and access to healthcare. In rural communities, these challenges are intensified by limited health infrastructure, geographic isolation, financial constraints, and stigma surrounding mental health. This paper emphasizes the need for integrated care models that address both physical and psychological aspects of chronic illness. Expanding early intervention, reducing stigma, and improving access to mental health services in underserved populations are essential steps toward enhancing quality of life for individuals with chronic illness.",

While men reported greater habitual suppression than women on trait questionnaires, no such gender difference emerged in momentary reports of suppression in everyday contexts. Additionally, there were no gender differences in the types of emotion suppressed (overall negative emotion, anger, and sadness).

          "abstract": "Rumination is a core transdiagnostic factor underlying mental health, traditionally conceptualized as a maladaptive intrapersonal habit. However, rumination is deeply embedded in people’s relationships. In the present article, we propose the Dynamic Interpersonal Model of Rumination (DIM-Rum), repositioning rumination as a recursive interpersonal, dynamic process. We start by outlining the traditional approach to rumination, and then integrate findings from diverse research areas to show how rumination is continuously shaped by and shaping the interpersonal world. Next, we present DIM-Rum, which complements and extends existing intrapersonal models by explicitly incorporating dynamic interpersonal feedback loops. We suggest implications and future directions that require expanding current methods and collaborations. By considering rumination in its interpersonal context, DIM-Rum offers novel targets for research and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Absence from school has wide-ranging and enduring negative consequences for individuals and society. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been a pervasive concern and key educational research priority in many countries around the world. Using data from the #BeeWell survey and linked administrative records for N=28,293 pupils aged 12-16 attending 71 secondary schools in Hampshire and Southampton (England) during the 2023/24 academic year, we conducted Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct longitudinal patterns of attendance and estimate key predictors of latent class membership. Analysis revealed four distinct patterns of attendance: Consistently High (91.8%); Declining (3.8%); Rising (2.3%); and Persistently Low (2.1%). Consistent with bioecological systems theory, we found that socioeconomic deprivation, poorer mental and physical health, weaker school belonging, and increased exposure to peer and academic pressures significantly increased the likelihood of following sub-optimal attendance trajectories (relative to the Consistently High attendance class). Likewise, those with Special Educational Needs (SEN; compared to those without SEN) and White British pupils (compared to their peers from minoritised ethnic groups) were more likely to follow sub-optimal trajectories. Findings reveal heterogeneity in post-pandemic attendance patterns with implications for multi-tiered interventions. Universal approaches should foster a strong sense of school belonging, while early warning systems should integrate psychosocial indicators such as school pressure, internalising symptoms and exposure to bullying. Identification of a Rising trajectory suggests potential for positive change through targeted support and underscores the importance of implementing effective educational psychology interventions to reverse long-lasting impact of COVID-19 on secondary school attendance.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to profoundly reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Using large-scale survey data (N = 37,097; 38 European countries), we find that the public predominantly views AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for a large set of technology-related, political, and socio-demographic factors, we further find that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Drawing on nationally representative, preregistered experimental data (N = 400; United States), we provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democratic institutions and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may erode democratic legitimacy and discourage public involvement in shaping the future of AI.",

Visual processing, particularly the ability to gather and use visual information quickly and accurately, is critical for performance in high-speed sports. We hypothesised that visual behaviour, including the duration of the final fixation (Quiet Eye; QE), the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations, significantly impacts fencing performance during offensive and defensive actions. National-level sabre fencers performed a ten-minute assault with eye-tracking technology measuring their gaze behaviour. Results indicated that QE was significantly longer before successful touches compared to unsuccessful ones (t(9) = 2.61, p =.014, dz = 0.83). Additionally, the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations were higher during defensive actions than offensive actions (all ts(9) &gt; 4.34, ps ≤ .001, dzs&gt; 1.37). This research provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying sports performance in a realistic context and has implications for training strategies, emphasising the importance of various visual behaviour patterns in fencing.",

          "abstract": "Adopting a vegetarian diet represents a meaningful contribution to climate change mitigation, which involves repeated decisions in favour of the environment. This makes vegetarians a relevant group for studying the cognitive mechanisms underlying pro-environmental decision-making. In this study, vegetarians and non-vegetarians completed a decision-making task involving real trade-offs between financial rewards and carbon emissions, with information acquisition tracked using MouselabWEB. We found that vegetarians exhibited a greater propensity to select the pro-environmental option in the task than non-vegetarians. This group difference was particularly found when decisions entailed high personal costs, low environmental benefits, or uncertain outcomes. Process-tracing data further revealed that vegetarians consistently prioritized environmental information from the outset and throughout the decision process. This attentional focus significantly predicted pro-environmental choices. Overall, the findings suggest that vegetarians may rely on a principled decision-making style that transcends cost–benefit considerations, offering new insights into the cognitive basis of pro-environmental engagement.",

          "authors": "Natalia Khodayari; Howard Egeth; susan courtney",
          "abstract": "Enhancement and suppression have traditionally been described as a shared process; enhancing relevant information subsequently suppresses irrelevant information, but there may also exist separable mechanisms. Recent evidence indicates that target enhancement and distractor suppression can be measured separately, using both behavioral and physiological approaches. It is unclear, however, whether the underlying mechanisms are also separable. We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals, which would provide strong evidence supporting the existence of separate mechanisms. This approach, however, requires dissociable, internally-reliable individual-difference measures. We found reliable enhancement measures for endogenous cueing effects (Experiment 1) and statistical learning effects (Experiment 2) for target location. Measures of suppression in Experiments 1 and 2 were unreliable. In Experiment 3, we encouraged a single strategy (“singleton-search mode”) by changing the colors and shapes of targets and distractors across trials. We found reliable individual differences in reaction time measures for enhancement and suppression. Critically, these reliable measures did not covary. Experiments 4 and 5 largely replicated the results of Experiment 3. Again, individual-difference measures of enhancement and suppression strength did not covary. These results show a clear dissociation: while enhancement yields reliable individual differences across task manipulations, suppression measures are usually unreliable and sensitive to task parameters. When individual-difference measures of both enhancement and suppression are reliable, they do not covary. These results cannot be explained solely by a shared-mechanism account of enhancement and suppression, and instead support the hypothesis that independent enhancement and suppression mechanisms exist.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the persistent myth that publication bias contaminates (indeed, possibly inflates) the scientific evidence for parapsychological phenomena, specifically extrasensory perception (ESP). We analyzed 165 published studies (243 experiments) from recent ESP meta-analyses and 40 preregistered confirmatory experiments from the Koestler Parapsychology Unit Registry. We compared these two datasets to datasets from the field of mainstream psychology. Our primary measure was the percentage of experiments reporting statistically significant positive outcomes (p &lt; .05, one-tailed). Results indicate that the rate of positive outcomes in ESP research is considerably lower than that observed in psychology, for both non-preregistered and preregistered experiments. While the bias is substantially smaller, suggesting more balanced reporting of parapsychological outcomes compared to mainstream psychological research, we cannot conclusively show that the statistical evidence for ESP is not an artifact of that relatively minimal bias, but several earlier tests on the file-drawer problem do undermine that assumption.",

Schema Therapy offers a related framework, proposing that the state expression of early maladaptive schemas—dysfunctional emotional and cognitive patterns formed in response to adverse experiences— are represented by schema modes.  These modes represent distinct parts of the self, such as vulnerable child parts, coping parts, critical parent parts, and healthy adult parts, which influence moment-to-moment experiences. This exploratory qualitative study investigated whether the content of voices experienced by voice-hearers maps onto schema modes as described in Schema Therapy. Method: Seven participants took part in semi-structured interviews exploring the characteristics and content of their voices. Interview transcripts were coded according to established schema mode definitions and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Results: Results indicated that most participants described voices that could be classified within the schema mode framework, with dysfunctional parent modes being the most frequently identified. Conclusions: These findings offer preliminary support for using Schema Therapy concepts to better understand and potentially treat distressing voices, suggesting value in further exploring this approach in clinical settings.",

This study introduces the concept of \"Thoughts on Eating\" (ToE) as a foundational framework for understanding individual eating attitudes and behaviors. ToE captures diverse perspectives on food and eating, ranging from health maintenance to emotional and social dimensions.\nIn this study, we developed and validated the Thoughts on Eating Scale (ToES), a 20-item scale with seven factors: “enriching one’s heart”, “encouraging social communication”, “realizing oneself”, “sustaining oneself”, ”respecting food”, “indifference to eating”, and “disliking eating.” Then, we confirmed its reliability and validity, including concurrent validity with Expanded Mindful Eating Scale (EMES) and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), and reasonable results were obtained. Moreover, we investigated the associations of ToES with sociodemographis and eating behaviors, and some meaningful and understandable relationships were observed.\nThe ToES also revealed meaningful associations between individual traits, eating attitudes, and behaviors, offering insights into both everyday eating patterns and disordered eating tendencies. This ToE framework along with a robust tool provides for examining the psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of eating, paving the way for future research and interventions to address diverse eating behaviors in modern society.",

DSHM is a class of memory models used to model human performance in game play, memory tasks, and language learning. The ability to detect and predict patterns is an integral part of memory models and an important part of decision making. However, decision making also requires the ability to evaluate states as more or less desirous in order to motivate the decisions. We apply a DSHM model to the decision-making task of Walsh and Anderson (2011). By initializing memory to a state of optimism and by making the model sensitive to dependencies between non-consecutive events, we find that the model is able to learn the task at a rate similar to humans.",

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health and psychiatry is transforming the diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). While the initial and promising applications span diagnostic screening and theraputic chatbots, \nthese first-wave technologies do not directly target the underlying brain alterations or account for the treatment of MDD. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) holds a tremendous promise to address the biological heterogeneity of MDD, but is currently hindered by highly variable outcomes. Therefore, we posit that synergistic integration of AI with NIBS represents the most promising path to address these difficulties. Importantly, the frontier for AI in depression treatment lies in a paradigm shift: from empirical trial-and-error to data-driven, personalized precision interventions.  We argue for a paradigm shift away from AI roles in mental health (e.g., chatbots, diagnostics) toward its deep integration as the core engine for personalized, circuit-based neuromodulation. We highlight the key opportunities this fusion creates: identifying patient-specific neural targets through predictive modeling, developing adaptive closed-loop therapies that respond to real-time brain states, and brain \"digital twins\" for in silico simulation and protocol optimization. While significant challenges in data standardization, model interpretability, and clinical validation remain, the fusion of AI and NIBS heralds an era of psychiatry that is predictive, personalized, and precise.",

          "abstract": "Across cultures and development, humans can extract proportional quantities from nonsymbolic, visual displays. Two competing accounts have been proposed for the contributions of these nonsymbolic skills to fraction understanding. The shared-magnitude account suggests that a cognitive system responsible for these nonsymbolic skills is foundational for symbolic fraction learning, predicting that neural patterns of fraction skills resemble magnitude-driven neural responses to continuous depictions, like unsegmented bars, that emphasize proportional magnitude. However, other depictions of proportions, like discretized, segmented bars, convey both proportional and whole-number information. The shared-interference account proposes that the interference from whole-number information in discretized proportions and symbolic fractions drives the link between these skills and predicts that neural responses to fraction magnitudes would strongly relate to overall activity to discretized depictions, particularly those with misleading whole-number information. We leveraged representational similarity analyses (RSA) to test these predictions. Nineteen young adults (mean age=23.26 years) compared proportions depicted in continuous, discretized, and symbolic formats. Univariate results indicated robust neural distance effects in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions across formats. Region of interest (ROI) analyses of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) revealed neural rational distance effects for continuous proportions, whereas for discretized and symbolic fractions, only comparisons with whole-number interference exhibited a rational magnitude signal. Critically, RSA demonstrated that the IPS fraction magnitude-related activity showed greater similarity with discretized brain responses than continuous ones, but only in the context of misleading whole-number information. Together, these findings support a combination of the two accounts and suggest that symbolic fraction proficiency, as well as adept discretized proportional reasoning, involves accessing proportional magnitude code despite the presence of misleading whole-number information.",

Successful encoding requires the structure of the data to be orthogonal to the structure of the Latin squares.

          "abstract": "We describe the DSHM (Dynamically Structured Holographic Memory) model of human memory, which uses high dimensional vectors to represent items in memory. The complexity and intelligence of human behavior can be attributed, in part, to our ability to utilize vast knowledge acquired over a lifetime of experience with our environment. Thus models of memory, particularly models that can scale up to lifetime learning, are critical to modeling human intelligence. DHSM is based on the BEAGLE model of language acquisition (Jones and Mewhort, 2007) and extends this type of model to general memory phenomena. We demonstrate that DHSM can model a wide variety of human memory effects. Specifically, we model the fan effect, the problem size effect (from math cognition), dynamic game playing (detecting sequential dependencies from memories of past moves), and time delay learning (using an instance based approach). This work suggests that DSHM is suitable as a basis for learning both over the short-term and over the lifetime of the agent, and as a basis for both procedural and declarative memory. We argue that cognition needs to be understood at both the symbolic and sub-symbolic levels, and demonstrate that DSHM intrinsically operates at both of these levels of description. In order to situate DSHM in a familiar context, we discuss the relationship between DHSM and ACT-R.",

We prove that MINERVA 2, a separate storage model of long-term memory, is mathematically equivalent to composite storage memory implemented as a fourth order tensor, and approximately equivalent to a fourth-order tensor compressed into a holographic vector. Building of these demonstrations, we show that MINERVA 2 and related separate storage models can be implemented in neurons.

          "abstract": "In this article, we provide an updated complement to Hout and DiPrete’s (2006) influential review of RC28 scholarship, offering an analysis of contributions from the RC28 community since the early 2000s. Drawing on topic models of conference presentations, highly cited articles and books presented at RC28 conferences and written by RC28 board members, RSSM edited volumes, a qualitative survey of RC28 members, and plenary session feedback from two RC28 conferences, we identify 21 recent key contributions to social stratification and mobility research. We show that\nRC28 scholars have increasingly emphasized educational, income and wealth, and gender inequality, while placing less focus on social class. Some of the most highly cited research over the last two decades include studies on the consequences of income inequality, differential economic returns to college, family background effects on children’s achievement, gender gaps in educational achievement, persistent inequality in educational attainment, changes in\nintergenerational mobility patterns, and the importance of wealth inequality. The community’s methodological focus has shifted from log-linear models to methods for causal inference. Despite improvements in participation from Asia, the field would benefit from broader global inclusion.

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study aims to explore the potential role and pathways for transforming social sciences within the national security and strategic competition landscape. Its objectives address pressing challenges including the inadequate alignment between social sciences and national strategy, insufficient conversion of academic findings into policy and practical tools, intensifying disinformation offensives and countermeasures, and uneven allocation of research resources. Methodologically, this study combines strategic intelligence analysis with policy evaluation, employing comparative case studies, interdisciplinary literature reviews, and institutional design frameworks. It draws upon the DARPA ‘Heilmeier Eight Questions’ and the EU's mission-oriented innovation model for its arguments. Findings indicate that by establishing a national-level social science research platform, optimising research funding mechanisms, fostering closer alignment between academic pursuits and strategic imperatives, and developing deepfake forensics alongside cognitive immunity systems, social sciences may evolve from traditional knowledge accumulation into resources serving strategic decision-making and cognitive competition. This transformative trajectory enhances political narrative power and cognitive dominance, bolsters institutional adaptability, and furnishes nations with combined soft and hard competitive advantages on the international stage. The conclusion posits that the strategic utilisation of social sciences is not a singular pathway but a multi-layered, multi-stage exploratory process, offering significant reference value for enhancing national security and international influence.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the cultural and legal challenges faced by Iranian women in the aftermath of rape and sexual assault, focusing on the impact of rape culture and patriarchal norms embedded in the nation's laws and societal values. It explores the role of \"honour\" in perpetuating gender-based violence and the systemic barriers that discourage women from seeking justice. Through a detailed analysis of post-1979 legal reforms and the rise of the #MeToo movement in Iran, the paper highlights how Iranian women have used digital platforms to break the silence around sexual violence, challenge oppressive norms, and mobilize for social change. It also discusses the concept of intersectionality as a framework to understand the compounded forms of discrimination faced by women in Iran. Ultimately, this study underscores the significance of the #MeToo movement in Iran as a transformative force that is pushing for a deeper, systemic change towards gender equality and social justice.",

          "abstract": "This chapter presents the Layered Model of Agency as a semiotic framework for the study of collective agency. The model identifies six distinct types of agencies: operative, reflective, joint, material-mediated, sign-mediated, and symbolic. Each level is examined in detail to elucidate the semiotic mechanisms and the cognitive architecture underlying the emergence of collective agencies. The model conceptualizes collective agency as an enhanced capability for action, incorporating artifacts to constitute sociotechnical systems. Within this framework, both institutional and non-institutional forms of collective agency are explored. In contrast to institutions, the collective agency of non-institutionalized social organizations generates dense networks of interaction within horizontal structures, facilitating the convergence between shared norms and individual values. This bottom-up view on agency recognizes individuals as agents of change and their crucial role in collective agency. Consequently, I underscore the importance of examining the interactions between individual and collective agency, proposing the Layered Model of Agency as a relevant tool for investigating these issues.",

          "authors": "Onofrio Resta; Emanuela Resta; Alberto Costantiello; Piergiuseppe Liuzzi; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the environmental and infrastructure determinants of respiratory disease mortality (TRD) across European nation-states through an original combination of econometric, machine learning, clustering, and network-based approaches. The primary scientific inquiry is how structural environmental variables, such as land use, energy mix, sanitation, and climatic stress, co-interact to affect respiratory mortality across regions. Although prior literature has addressed individual environmental predictors in singleton settings, this paper fills an integral gap by using a multi-method, systems-level analysis that accounts for interdependencies as well as contextual variability. The statistical analysis draws on panel data covering several years and nation-states using fixed effects regressions with robust standard errors for evaluating the effects of variables such as agricultural land use (AGRL), access to electricity (ELEC), renewable energy (RENE), freshwater withdrawals (WTRW), cooling degree days (CDD), and sanitation (SANS). We employ cluster analysis and density-based methodology to identify spatial and environmental groupings, while machine learning regressions—specifically, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—are utilized for predictive modeling and evaluating feature importance. Lastly, network analysis identifies the structural connections between variables, including influence metrics and directional weights. We obtain the following results: Consistently, across all regressions, AGRL, WTRW, and SANS feature importantly when determining the effect for TRD. Consistently across all networks, influencer metrics identify AGRL, WTRW, and SANS as key influencers. Consistently across all models, the best-performing predictive regression identifies the nonlinear (polynomial or non-monotone), context-sensitive nature of the effects. Consistent with the network results, the influencer metrics suggest strong connections between variables, with a particular emphasis on the importance of holistic environmental health approaches. Combining the disparate yet complementary methodological tools, the paper provides robust, understandable, yet policy-relevant insights into the environmental complexity driving respiratory health outcomes across Europe.",

According to some sources, 60 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Since 1975, $80 trillion have been transferred from the bottom 90 percent of earners to the top 1 percent. Meanwhile, little action is being taken to mitigate global warming and ecological destruction, while military budgets, used in part to wage disastrous wars and genocides, climb annually.\n\n\"There is little hope for the United States, or indeed for civilization, unless we can forge an international left that prioritizes class struggle above all else. It is time to fight back, by any means necessary, against a ruling class interested in nothing but profits and power. In this book, a historian of the U.S. labor movement attempts to advance this agenda through a series of essays on everything from right-wing libertarianism to the inadequacies of identity politics, from the career of Jimmy Hoffa to the catastrophic consequences of American imperialism.

          "authors": "Ida Nikou",
          "abstract": "Under conditions of authoritarian neoliberalism, associational space and institutional redress are structurally foreclosed, limiting the capacity of labor and social movements to become counter-hegemonic in the sense defined by existing literature. This presents a theoretical impasse when analyzing labor movements in contexts such as Iran. To address this, I develop a Gramscian framework introducing the concept of embryonic counter-hegemony: organizational efforts that enact counter-hegemonic logics and practices but remain fragile, structurally constrained, and temporally limited. This article examines two landmark cases of autonomous labor organizing in Iran: the Haft Tappeh Sugarcane Company (HTSC) and the Iran National Steel Industrial Group (INSIG). In both cases, workers bypassed state-controlled institutions and formed alternative organizational structures—general assemblies—to contest privatization, demand democratic control over production, and resist state repression. While these formations did not consolidate into stable counter-hegemonic blocs, they embodied embryonic practices of democratic governance and oppositional consciousness. Drawing on four years of content analysis of Telegram posts, public interviews with worker organizers, and archival protest coverage, I show how these labor assemblies developed participatory procedures, resisted co-optation, and articulated alternative political imaginaries. By theorizing these formations as embryonic rather than failed or merely reactive, I reorient counter-hegemonic analysis toward the organizational practices and strategic contradictions of resistance under authoritarianism. This study contributes to Gramscian labor studies and critical organizational scholarship by illuminating how subaltern actors construct alternative organizations within repressive regimes—and what such efforts reveal about the possibilities and limits of organizing under constraint.",

          "abstract": "Why do some social groups remain cohesive while others fragment into polarized factions? How do individuals resist dominant norms? This paper introduces the concept of social reward economies—structured systems of social feedback that determine which behaviors, beliefs, and schemas are rewarded, tolerated, or punished. We develop a formal procedural framework that models cohesion, polarization, resistance, and manipulation as emergent properties of these dynamic reward economies.\n\nWe conceptualize cohesion as the alignment of behaviors around a dominant reward economy; polarization as the coexistence of competing reward economies reinforcing divergent beliefs and practices; resistance as the creation of alternative reward economies that valorize dissent; and manipulation as the strategic distortion of reward structures to engineer desired social outcomes.\n\nBy integrating micro-level feedback processes with macro-level social structures, this framework complements existing theories of norms, power, and resistance through a formal model. It advances sociological understanding by demonstrating how social order, conflict, and change emerge from recursive interactions among reputation-seeking agents operating within and across competing reward economies. This perspective provides new tools for empirical research, formal modeling, and the analysis of cohesion, polarization, and manipulation in contemporary digital and organizational contexts.",

This paper introduces the concept of the socially responsive agent—a formal, procedural model of social action grounded in symbolic interactionism, structuration theory, and social learning theory. Socially responsive agents interpret and adapt their behavior based on symbolically mediated feedback, enabling the endogenous emergence of shared norms, cultural schemas, and hierarchical influence structures.\n\nBy embedding meaning-making and symbolic evaluation into a dynamic feedback loop, the model bridges formal modeling with core insights from cultural and interpretive sociology. It offers a micro-foundational account of social reproduction and transformation that clarifies the procedural “how” underlying the sociological “why.”\n\nCrucially, the framework is designed to support cumulative theory building. Companion papers systematically extend the model to account for increasingly complex social phenomena—progressing from behavioral norm emergence to schema convergence and power asymmetries—demonstrating how formal models can incrementally incorporate interpretive, structural, and symbolic dimensions of social life.",

Participants highlighted the limitations of verbal communication across multiple contexts and described dream solutions to convey PD experiences in a multi-modal manner. Two non-verbal approaches were subsequently explored:  1) workshopping the SymPulseTM armband, an existing technology that simulates parkinsonian tremor; and 2) collaboration with a visual artist to develop “Envisagez l’invisible”, a portraiture activity that prompts reflection on the invisible aspects of PD.

          "abstract": "Radical-right parties are often seen as vehicles for the “left behind.” But were these also the first to support such parties when they were stigmatized? I argue that early support is socially stratified because it is norm-breaking. Individuals with higher incomes are more likely to do so when stigma is strong. I test this idea using the case of Vox in Spain, which entered parliament in April 2019 and gained further ground in a second national election six months later. During this period, initial support came disproportionately from higher-income voters. Lower-income individuals were more likely to withhold support in socially exposed interviews, and early voting patterns are consistent with the idea that expressive inhibition may have constrained their support. As the party gained legitimacy, these gaps narrowed. Complementary evidence from Greece’s Golden Dawn shows a similar pattern. Political normalization may thus unfold through a stratified process, beginning with the socially advantaged.",

This study examines four cases of Iranian industrial labor struggles (Haft-Tappeh Sugarcane Company (HTSC), Iran National Steel Industrial Group (INSIG), Heavy Equipment Production Company (HEPCO), and Chadormalou Mining and Industrial Company (CMIC)) to analyze how workers develop distinct resistance strategies in response to financialization, labor precarity, and state repression. Drawing on social movement theory, industrial relations scholarship, and financialization studies, I argue that workers’ organizing strategies are not solely determined by economic hardship but are shaped by prior mobilization experiences, political traditions, and access to broader social networks. Using protest event analysis, archival research, and digital ethnography, this study demonstrates that while financialization weakens traditional unions, it also compels workers to pursue alternative organizing strategies, ranging from grassroots councils and informal alliances to engagement with state-controlled labor institutions. By situating Iran’s labor struggles within broader global trends, this study contributes to debates on precarious work, labor agency under financialization, and the role of historical and socio-political contexts in shaping resistance strategies in authoritarian economies.",

Constrained by global economic isolation, Iran has redirected financial capital from industrial manufacturing to speculative and extractive sectors, resulting in deindustrialization, heightened resource dependency, and a bifurcated labor regime marked by precarity and inequality. Adapting David Harvey’s concept of the spatial fix to internal dynamics, this article situates Iran’s trajectory within broader debates on financialization in peripheral economies, offering a novel lens to\n\nexamine the interplay between sanctions, resource dependency, and economic precarity.\n\nGrounded in dissertation research, this article draws on two case studies—the decline of HEPCO and the rise of CMIC—to illustrate the mechanisms and consequences of this internal reallocation of capital. These findings reveal how sanctions and financialization intersect to prioritize short-term accumulation over long-term development, deepening economic instability and labor commodification. By integrating the overlapping effects of sanctions and financialization, this article offers a novel theoretical framework for understanding resource dependency and developmental stagnation in the Global South.",

Here we draw on the history of social movements, the social science of collective action, and our experience in the climate movement to make concrete suggestions for increasing climate mobilization. We add to recent proposals for organizers to center “transformative adaptation”, which puts emphasis on people’s immediate material interests. Unlike shallower forms of climate adaptation, transformative adaptation involves major changes to social and economic relations. We argue that campaigns for transformative adaptation have the potential to grow climate mobilization because they can deliver direct material benefits, foster democratic and equitable institutions, increase climate resilience, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and appeal to a politically diverse public. We make suggestions for how researchers and organizers can build on our proposal.",

          "authors": "Michael Marshall",
          "abstract": "Research on housing and populism has produced conflicting findings – evidence suggests declining housing affordability can have both a negative and positive association with populist support. Focusing on the UK, this paper argues these findings can be reconciled by decomposing the heterogeneous effects of housing affordability into constituent housing crises – the decline of homeownership and rising housing insecurity. Furthermore, it argues these crises will be related to political preferences through the interaction between geography and tenure. The paper hypothesises that homeowners in areas of high house prices will be less likely to hold populist political preferences due to a wealth effect that legitimises the existing socio-political system. By contrast, social renters in unaffordable areas will be more likely to support populism due to their higher likelihood of experiencing housing insecurity and as the rationing of social housing will induce a sense of competition over scarce resources. Analysis using data on local housing conditions and political preferences finds broad support for these hypotheses. The analysis finds that social renting in an area of widespread housing insecurity is positively associated with both opposition to immigration and voting for the Reform Party. It also finds that homeownership does negatively interact with local house prices in predicting attitudes to immigration, but the effect is to attenuate the positive association between house prices and opposition to immigration. This contradicts previous studies which may have been subject to omitted variable bias. No evidence is found for an interaction between homeownership and affordability in predicting support for the Reform Party. The paper contributes to an emergent research agenda around housing discontent and populism. It concludes with reflections on the future direction of this research agenda, suggesting there is value in measuring housing insecurity at the individual level, not just as a contextual variable, and interrogating causality.",

Yet, little is known about how these multidimensional trajectories relate to ultimate childlessness across different institutional contexts.\nOBJECTIVE\nThis paper identifies typical early mid-life trajectories of partnership, income, and residential independence among men and women in two contrasting welfare regimes: Finland and Belgium, and explores how these are associated with remaining childless.\nMETHODS\nUsing linked register and census data for cohorts born in 1974–75, followed from their early 30s to mid-40s, we apply multichannel sequence and cluster analysis to identify typical life course patterns across three domains. We then use linear regression models to assess how remaining childless, education and place of residence are associated with the degree of alignment with each trajectory type, as measured by representativeness scores (Helske et al., 2024).\nRESULTS\nFive trajectory types were identified in each country, including patterns of early and stable partnerships and others marked by delayed transitions. Remaining childless was mostly associated with later residential independence and the near absence of partnership formation. In Finland, a distinct cluster highlights how being single after a separation is also associated with childlessness. In contrast, stable marriage pathways were strongly associated with parenthood.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe study demonstrates how the interplay of partnership, residential independence and income trajectories, shaped by education and institutional context, produces distinct pathways associated with childlessness in early mid-life.",

          "abstract": "To embrace the new challenges and opportunities of increasing globalization and cross-cultural communication at all levels, the European Commission has been advocating CLIL education across EU member states since the late 20th century. In Belgium, despite Wallonia adopting this approach as early as 1998, Flanders officially approved the implementation of CLIL education in its secondary education system only in 2014, followed by continuous monitoring and adjustment. This study analyzes the process of formulating the updated CLIL language education policy (LEP) in Flanders, the rationale behind the policy, and the language education management in different layers. Combining the backgrounds of language practices and the operational system of CLIL LEP in Flanders, we found that although the CLIL LEP conflicts with the early language legislation, it is a strategy to prepare the new generation to embrace new challenges and opportunities driven by globalization and cross-cultural communication at all levels. However, the approved policy aims to promote a select multilingualism, which focus lies with the promotion of English. Furthermore, CLIL education is operated as a parallel mode in schools, accompanied by compulsory Flemish programs to ensure the dominance of the Flemish language. This is also a top-down approach carefully monitored by the government while supplemented resources are yet far from sufficient.",

Yet many fathers use less than their entitlement. Limited studies suggest workplace peers may encourage fathers to take more leave, but evidence is mixed, leaving uncertainty about who is influenced and when.\n\nThis study explores educational heterogeneity in direct workplace peer effects on fathers’ parental leave usage, aiming to understand which fathers in which contexts are influenced by peers. We utilise Finnish full-population administrative registers and linked employer-employee data on fathers’ leave uptake in 2009–2019, covering 117,837 births. Structural causal models and Bayesian multilevel logistic regression are used to examine how preceding fathers’ leave influences new fathers.\n\nFindings show that peers’ leave usage positively influences new fathers, with low-educated fathers more affected than highly educated ones. Peer effects were strongest in workplaces with no prior leave uptake and declined as more fathers began taking leave, especially among skilled men.\n\nWorkplace peer effects are a key mechanism behind rising leave uptake between policy reforms. In contexts with limited information on leave consequences, peers serve as important sources of learning—particularly for low-educated men—but the informational value declines as uptake becomes more common.",

          "abstract": "Synthetic datasets, artificially generated to mimic real-world data while maintaining anonymization, have emerged as a promising technology in the financial sector, attracting support from regulators and market participants as a solution to data privacy and scarcity challenges limiting machine learning deployment. This paper argues that synthetic data's effects on financial markets depend critically on how these technologies are embedded within existing machine learning infrastructural ``stacks'' rather than on their intrinsic properties. We identify three key tensions that will determine whether adoption proves beneficial or harmful: (1) data circulability versus opacity, particularly the \"double opacity\" problem arising from stacked machine learning systems, (2) model-induced scattering versus model-induced herding in market participant behaviour, and (3) flattening versus deepening of data platform power. These tensions directly correspond to core regulatory priorities around model risk management, systemic risk, and competition policy. Using financial audit as a case study, we demonstrate how these tensions interact in practice and propose governance frameworks, including a synthetic data labelling regime to preserve contextual information when datasets cross organizational boundaries.",

          "authors": "Sameer Meralli",
          "abstract": "The discovery of Homo floresiensis on the island of Flores ignited a longstanding debate regarding the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the taxon’s unique small body size and mosaic morphology as compared to other Homo variants. Homo floresiensis’ reduced cranial capacity combined with dissimilar gracile and robust postcranial features became a point of contention in finding a clear identity in the Homo pathology. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this divergence: the Phyletic Dwarfism Hypothesis, which posits descent from Homo erectus via insular dwarfism driven by deterministic selection, and the Genetic Drift Hypothesis, which attributes its unique morphology to neutral evolutionary processes in a small, isolated population. This study quantitatively tests these competing hypotheses using a multivariate morphometric approach applied to 3D landmark data from the H. floresiensis holotype (LB1) and comparative samples of H. erectus, H. habilis, Australopithecus, H. sapiens, and great apes. Using Brownian motion simulations of genetic drift, allometric analyses, and applying tests of morphological integration this paper aims to reveal a more precise evolutionary history of Homo floresiensis.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how land-based climate mitigation strategies under the European Green Deal raise crucial questions about the distribution and democratic control of land resources. The research analyses the intersection of carbon neutrality-driven land-use changes with existing patterns of land grabbing and concentration, revealing significant limitations in current just-transition approaches. Through a critical analysis of European climate policy frameworks and land governance mechanisms, the study demonstrates that the land dimension represents a notable blind spot in just-transition approaches. The findings indicate that existing frameworks, primarily focused on industrial restructuring and labor market adaptation, cannot adequately address the challenges of ensuring democratic access to and control over land resources. The paper proposes the concept of a \"land-just transition\" as a necessary evolution, advocating for the explicit integration of land justice considerations into climate transition frameworks. This approach would expand beyond compensation and adaptation to address fundamental questions of land governance and democratic control. The research concludes by identifying key areas requiring further investigation, including empirical analysis of land control patterns, development of policy instruments for ensuring land justice, and theoretical elaboration of land justice within just transition frameworks.",

          "authors": "Daniel J. Freeman",
          "abstract": "Objective.  Prior research on gun ownership and violent crime has yielded inconsistent conclusions, largely because nearly all studies rely on proxy measures of prevalence - surveys, state-level aggregates, or policy classifications - that cannot isolate handgun ownership, cannot confirm lawful versus illicit possession, and are vulnerable to confounding.  For example, Kleck (1997) and Cook &amp; Ludwig (2006) highlighted measurement error as the main barrier to inference, Siegel et al. (2014) reported positive associations using household survey proxies, and Donohue et al. (2019) found liberalized right-to-carry regimes associated with higher violent crime, but with treatment defined as legal regime type rather than actual prevalence.  As the National Research Council concluded in its landmark 2004 review, available studies were too compromised by proxy limitations and unmeasured confounders to provide reliable evidence of causal effects.\n\nDesign.  This study is the first to eliminate that uncertainty by restricting analysis to U.S. jurisdictions that publish auditable, administrative counts of active resident handgun licenses.  We constructed two cohorts: A (higher licensing prevalence, mean ≈ 10.7% of residents) and B (lower prevalence, ≤1.6%).  We then compared two-year (2023-2024) totals for homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault per 100,000 residents, with covariates for poverty (%), sworn law-enforcement staffing (LEO per 100,000) and population density.  We estimated cohort means and rate ratios, Pearson correlations with Fisher-z intervals, OLS slopes of violent rate on licensing share, and Poisson GLMs with log(population) offsets to report percent change per +1-percentage point increase in licensed share.\n\nResults.  Mean violent crime was ≈ 542 per 100,000 in Cohort A versus ≈ 1,238 per 100,000 in Cohort B (rate ratio ≈ 2.28, 95% CI 1.52-3.43).  Each +1-percentage point increase in licensing share corresponded to ≈ 7.6% lower violent incidence (IRR 0.924; 95% CI 0.890-0.958), or ≈ 60-70 fewer incidents per 100,000 depending on model specification.  Adjusting for poverty or LEO staffing attenuated but did not eliminate the association.  Population density was negatively correlated.  Sensitivity analyses excluding outliers (Flint, MI and Washington, DC) yielded consistent results.\n\nConclusions.  This study is the first to demonstrate, using clean administrative licensing exposure measures, that higher lawful handgun ownership prevalence is strongly and inversely associated with personal violent crime.  The association is robust across models and covariates, survives outlier tests, and directly addresses the measurement weaknesses that have limited prior scholarship.  Unlike advocacy-sponsored work, this study is independent, fully transparent, and reproducible, providing the strongest evidence to date that lawful handgun prevalence aligns with substantially lower violent crime rates.  We emphasize correlation rather than causation, highlight demographic, lifestyle and illicit-market limitations, and provide a reproducibility appendix with administrative URLs to support independent audit.",

          "abstract": "Data about individual users drives today's social media content-filtering algorithm recommendations. Through nuanced interactions with social media algorithms, such as human-algorithm interplay, the end user effortlessly cultivates a social media feed. While this level of personalization can significantly benefit the user, recommended ads and content sometimes resemble aspects of the user's private lives that they may not have wanted the algorithm or platform to know. Moreover, though users dislike these experiences of privacy violations, they still disclose private information to the system due to fatigue in managing online privacy altogether. This current study integrates communication privacy management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002) into the human-algorithm interaction context to examine the extent to which social media users (N = 1,305) engage in open privacy management practices with social media platforms via their algorithms, depending on their felt privacy fatigue. Results from using latent moderated structural equations (LMS) suggest that individuals’ awareness of algorithms is negatively associated with using open privacy management practices with social media algorithms. However, this depends on their felt privacy fatigue, such that individuals who are both highly aware and highly fatigued are likely to be more closed off in sharing private information with social media algorithms, thus granting less co-ownership rights to social media platforms. In light of these findings, implications for future research on communication privacy management in the context of social media algorithms are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Policy debates have increasingly focused on further training in adulthood as a tool to promote equal career opportunities. Yet it remains empirically unclear whether further training acts as an equaliser, reducing exist-ing wage inequalities, or as an amplifier, reinforcing the Gender Pay Gap. This article examines whether the wage returns to non-formal job-related further training differ between women and men. We use data from the adult cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (2007–2023) and apply individual fixed-effects panel regression models with a cumulative approach to estimate the long-term effects of participa-tion in further training on wages. Our findings show that both men and women benefit from further training. However, men achieve significantly higher wage gains from longer spells of participation, particularly in selective, employer-provided formats. Leadership positions further amplify men’s returns. Although gaps in training participation have narrowed and in part reversed, returns show no equalising potential and instead contribute to the persistence of the Gender Pay Gap. Building on Relational Inequality Theory, our findings contribute to the broader debate on inequality reproduction through gendered claims-making by focusing on further training in organisational and institutional contexts.",

Using a national sample (N = 1,081), this study explores the racial divide in officer avoidance, the role of contact type, and the impact of police-related fear. We expect that officer avoidance will be highest among Black Americans, especially for involuntary contacts, because of elevated fear of police mistreatment. The findings are consistent with this theoretical expectation. Black Americans report more officer avoidance than their White counterparts. Fear of the police increases avoidance, both for voluntary and involuntary police contacts, although the effect is largest for involuntary contacts. These findings support growing evidence that avoidance of law enforcement contact stems from fear of police mistreatment, which derives from prior personal and vicarious mistreatment.",

          "authors": "Kazuhito Kitamura",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a dynamic equilibrium framework that reinterprets persistent macroeconomic issues—global imbalances, long-run deflation or entrenched inequality—not as market failures, but as structural outcomes. Departing from standard nominal‑adjustment models, it incorporates asset‑side mechanisms and reconsiders the transversality condition (TVC), deriving: R_t-ρ=n+D_a-U_(θa)θ/U_c; This balance means the divergence between asset returns (R_t) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the balance of capital diffusion (D_a), population growth (n) and preference terms (U_(θa)θ/U_c). As result, equilibrium arises from structural and institutional interplay beyond a price‑clearing mechanism. Simultaneously, by redefining the TVC as a structural condition on asset valuation resulting from this framework, we explain how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist. Redefining imbalances as the result of endogenous optimization in this way enables economic understanding that is in line with the realities of economies and provides tools for designing practical policies—for example, Structural Selection of the Steady State, Policy Control of Capital Flows, Asset Dynamics–Based Policy Reconstruction and so on—. This enables economics to reflect the realities of economic society and address structural challenges.",

          "authors": "Angelo Falzarano",
          "abstract": "Digital micro-movements are distinctive phenomena of the contemporary era, characterized by horizontality, rapid mobilization, and strong dependence on algorithmic infrastructures. They are not merely an online transposition of traditional mobilizations but introduce new forms of solidarity, leadership, and collective consciousness. By integrating classical sociological theory, Durkheim, Weber, Marx, Simmel, and Elias, with recent perspectives from media and digital activism studies (Castells, Tufekci, Bennett &amp; Segerberg, Zuboff), this paper develops a framework centered on three categories: networked solidarity, diffused leadership, and algorithmic consciousness. A qualitative and comparative analysis of three emblematic cases, #MeToo, Fridays for Future, and Black Lives Matter, highlights emancipatory potentials (global amplification, rapid coordination, symbolic pressure) as well as structural vulnerabilities (dependence on algorithmic visibility, risk of slacktivism, corporate co-optation). The study shows how the same technological infrastructure that enables collective mobilization also functions as a space of surveillance, manipulation, and co-optation, thereby reshaping the relationship between movements, platforms, and institutions. The article argues for a continuous conceptual renewal: the classics should not be abandoned but reinterpreted in the light of the network society and surveillance capitalism. The three proposed categories aim to provide analytical tools to grasp the tensions between emancipation and control and to imagine hybrid strategies capable of translating the fluid energy of digital mobilization into lasting institutional change.",

          "abstract": "This article presents an analysis of the impact of the number of alters elicited in an ego network on the structural properties of those networks. There continues to be debate about the pros and cons of eliciting a fixed number of alters for each respondent versus allowing the respondent to list as many or few alters as they would like. This article explores a random assignment of respondents to three treatment groups – 1) a fixed number of alters set at 30, 2) a variable number of alters up to 45, and 3) a variable number of alters up to 45 with a 20 alter minimum. The results indicate that, from a non-structural perspective, all levels of emotional proximity, interaction contexts, genders, and ages are consistently sampled across the three treatment groups. At the structural level, the behavior of individual metrics is also largely similar. However, the most significant differences arise in the collective behavior of structural metrics—specifically, in their correlation structure, the amount of redundant information each variable provides, and the diversity and interpretability of the observed structural variability. When a data collection strategy constrains network size, it reduces the sparsity of the correlation matrix, effectively decreasing the number of independent global variables needed to describe network structure and making these global variables less interpretable. In other words, networks constructed with a survey that limits size tend to be more similar to each other, exhibiting less structural diversity and yielding differences that are harder to interpret. However, we discuss how these differences may simply be mathematical artifacts, without necessarily implying a clear advantage in choosing one treatment over another. Finally, we argue that the field needs a targeted study to answer whether the differing numbers of alters listed is a function of network size.",

This is enhanced by the emergence of non-traditional actors who can effectively assert journalistic authority within communities by deviating from specific traditional journalistic values. However, scholarly understanding of the role of community membership in claims of journalistic authority remains limited. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that draws on boundary work and fan studies. This framework allows us to examine how diverse journalistic actors in a variety of communities can base their journalistic authority claims on their: (1) proximity to news sources and protagonists; (2) authenticity as perceived by the audience community; and (3) professionalism in relation to the journalistic field. Through empirical research, this framework may help us to better understand how diverse journalistic actors can claim authority while meeting communities’ diverse needs.",

However, the question of how ordinary people conceptualize happiness—that is, the everyday conception of happiness—has rarely been systematically explored. This study applies a word-association network approach to examine the semantic schemas, components, and group differences in people's perceptions of both happiness and unhappiness. Specifically, we create a semantic representation of happiness and unhappiness from a survey using a mini-snowball word association task and then employ network analysis to identify semantic characteristics and demographic differences. Our findings suggest that the proposed method not only aligns well with previous studies' implications but also deepens our understanding of the structure by revealing new components of these concepts. Furthermore, the method facilitates further investigation of how semantic representations of happiness and unhappiness vary across demographic groups, highlighting both the general and semantic differences in their components. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of word-association networks for capturing everyday conceptions of happiness and unhappiness, offering both theoretical insights and practical implications for developing more accurate and culturally grounded measures.",

First, we distinguish between the ability of GAI to select and socialize\nindividuals who are internally committed to organizationally desirable values, versus individuals\nwho only perform these values. Our second distinction pertains to the cross-pressures of fitting in\nversus standing out within organizations. Third, we distinguish between how GAI is adopted\ninitially, and responses to these configurations by strategic actors, which we refer to as “second\norder effects.” Based on these distinctions, we array our predictions across three phases, with\neach new phase a response to the tensions and dissatisfactions of a preceding one.",

The research starts by utilizing existing literature reviews until 2022 and then conducts its literature review to bridge the gap to 2025. The literature review is conducted with the help of methods from  Kitchenham (2004) and Nightingale (2009). The databases EBSCOhost, Scopus, and Web of Science were used for searching related literature. A precise keyword string is used to search, as well as various filtering, in order to get peer-reviewed journal articles. Initially, 221 articles were found and reviewed, and 70 were included in the literature review. The literature review shows an overwhelming amount of studies in investment and finance settings. However, it further indicates a lack of studies in other areas, especially in the workplace setting, such as in Singapore. Furthermore, it overviews the most prominent biases and recommends that further studies in other settings could utilize similar biases. The biases were overconfidence bias, herding bias, and decision avoidance bias. Thus, further research into other fields and regions could utilize these biases to get new insights into these topics.",

          "authors": "Vojtěch Zíka; J Dustin Tracy",
          "abstract": "Overconfidence research often involves estimating performance within a fixed range. Recent studies suggest that overprecision is affected by central tendency bias, the tendency to estimate near the center of a perceived distribution. This paper examines whether a similar pattern influences the other two overconfidence types, overestimation and overplacement. In a laboratory experiment (N = 120), participants estimated their own and the average performance over five rounds of ten Rock–Paper–Scissors games. Each round earned for up to 40 points, but average performance varied across three treatments, with means of 16.6, 20, and 23.3 points. The main question was whether this manipulation would result in the sample appearing overconfident, underconfident, or well-calibrated. The results suggest that calibration depends on the relative position of mean performance to the midpoint of the range. When the mean aligned with half of the range maximum, participants appeared well-calibrated. A lower mean resulted in apparent overestimation, while a higher mean led to apparent overplacement. Experience shifted some estimates toward the actual mean and improved calibration, but only when feedback was not overly noisy. Monetary incentives and gender were controlled for but showed no significant effect on estimation accuracy. This study provides evidence that the one-half heuristic—the tendency to estimate at half the maximum of a given range—can mechanically bias confidence judgments. While further research is needed to confirm its effect in more traditional overconfidence tasks, caution is warranted when interpreting studies in which mean performance deviates from the range midpoint.",

          "abstract": "Offender Risk Assessment Instruments (ORAIs) have shaped criminal justice decisions for over three decades, yet their predictive reliability remains contested. This article critiques the statistical architecture underlying widely used tools—particularly their reliance on additive models that neglect interaction effects between variables such as age, prior convictions, and socio-economic context. Drawing on recent literature and case studies (including COMPAS, OGRS, and ARMS), it argues that most ORAIs reduce complex human behaviours to binary outcomes, misclassifying risk and reinforcing systemic bias. The paper introduces the concept of interaction effects, supported by statistical and psychological research, to illustrate how risk is often conditional rather than cumulative. It further explores the limitations of regression models and proposes a range of alternatives, including multi-level modelling, Bayesian updating, Explainable AI, and co-produced desistance-informed profiles. Beyond improving tools, the article calls for a paradigm shift—from control to collaboration, from prediction to understanding. Risk, it concludes, should be treated not as a fixed score but as a dynamic, contextual process. Only by recognising this can justice systems promote accurate assessments, reduce harm, and rebuild public trust.",

Drawing on historical, institutional, and regulatory perspectives, the study contrasts the development of the PhD in Germany, the United States, and other Anglo-Saxon contexts with the legal and institutional framework of the doctorate in Tunisia. Particular attention is paid to the additional requirements that distinguish the PhD—such as coursework, comprehensive examinations, and teaching obligations—which are absent from the Tunisian doctorate. The paper argues that conflating the PhD with other doctoral degrees risks erasing structural and epistemological differences among academic traditions. The analysis concludes that neither degree is inherently superior; rather, they serve different purposes and operate within distinct academic systems. This distinction has implications for equivalency, recognition, and the international circulation of doctoral titles.",

Here, we outline in detail how we addressed the search and identification of members of minority groups in a research project in Switzerland. We share our experience and reflection, hoping that future research can build on it. We find that publicly available information typically allows us to identify parliamentarians who would be classified as having a ‘migration background’ in official statistics. For women and parliamentarians at the regional (cantonal) level, identification is more difficult. In many cases, however, publicly available information does not capture self-identification, so we can only provide a list of potential minorities. Focusing on assumed ‘visibility’, we found it useful to differentiate different forms of visibility (physical traits, names, accents), and to recognize ambivalence as a possible category. While we might approximate how voters and party elites perceive candidates, the objective approach cannot replace self-identification.",

Findings reveal three interconnected dimensions of identification with “the people:” the imagined, the felt, and the experienced. Supporters’ positive view of “the people” as hardworking and guided by common sense evokes strong emotions—such as in-group love, connected to their self-concept—validated through meaningful social experiences online and offline.

Employing fixed-effects panel models and difference-in-differences frameworks, my analysis investigates how establishment-level and MSA-level factors predict the presence and turnover dynamics of LGBT+ establishments over time. My findings reveal that bars/clubs and erotic shops have a higher likelihood of presence in MSAs relative to accommodations. Theatre/entertainment venues exhibit higher entry and stability into MSA markets, whereas other establishment types face volatile turnover. I also find that the so-called “great cities,\" ubiquitous in works on LGBT+ placemaking, exhibit conditions favorable to the viability of LGBT+ establishments and yet exhibit no significant differences in turnover dynamics compared to other MSAs. My findings extend qualitative narratives by quantifying the impacts of economic changes, demographic shifts, and cultural influences, which should inform urban policy and advocacy efforts to sustain inclusive LGBT+ spaces amidst changing urban landscapes.",

While first- and second-generation NLP methods—such as keyword extraction, topic modeling, and word embeddings—have extended analytical reach, they remain limited in capturing meaning shaped by ideology, discourse, and context. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a third generation of NLP, capable of performing interpretive tasks such as identifying metaphors, framing, and rhetorical strategies. This shift enables new hybrid approaches that integrate computational efficiency with qualitative depth. The paper introduces two frameworks—AI-Augmented Grounded Theory and Theory-Driven AI Analysis—to illustrate how LLMs can support large-scale, context-sensitive interpretation.

The model identifies six distinct types of agencies: operative, reflective, joint, material-mediated, sign-mediated, and symbolic. Each level is examined in detail to elucidate the semiotic mechanisms and the cognitive architecture underlying the emergence of collective agencies. The model conceptualizes collective agency as an enhanced capability for action, incorporating artifacts to constitute sociotechnical systems. Within this framework, both institutional and non-institutional forms of collective agency are explored. In contrast to institutions, the collective agency of non-institutionalized social organizations generates dense networks of interaction within horizontal structures, facilitating the convergence between shared norms and individual values. This bottom-up view on agency recognizes individuals as agents of change and their crucial role in collective agency. Consequently, I underscore the importance of examining the interactions between individual and collective agency, proposing the Layered Model of Agency as a relevant tool for investigating these issues.",

          "abstract": "The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) cases in various countries, including Indonesia, resulted in the paralysis of most services, including in the government sectors. The enactment of Work from Home (WFH) policy for State Civil Servants (PNS) indicates the massive level of urgency for the spread of this deadly virus, leading to the Social Distance policy being also applied in the government environment. This article aims to examine civil servants' work effectiveness in implementing WFH during Covid-19 pandemic in Sleman Regency, with a case study at the Department of Social Service. This research uses an exploratory case study approach, emphasizing the exploration of a phenomenon such as WFH policy. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews and literature reviews were used to obtain reliable data analysis. The findings of this study show that the adaptation of civil servants in the Sleman Social Service to the WFH policy is seen as complex in several divisions, because they are not accustomed to working in a home environment where teleconference facilities may be urgently required and the dependence on communication and coordination between employees is crucial. Another issue is that in the Department of Social Service there are no sanctions for civil servants who do not work under the guidance of WFH policy. In addition, knowledge and skills needed to operate and administer online services are still limited, affecting civil servants' ability in delivering a community’s public service needs. Hence, the implementation of WFH policy may not be effective in all types of public operations.",

          "authors": "Patrick Ballantyne; Carmen Cabrera; Giada Garofani; Alex Singleton",
          "abstract": "The strategic placement of pedestrian crossings is critical for promoting road safety in urban environments. While previous research has used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify underserved areas, existing approaches often fail to integrate empirical data with stakeholder expertise, or directly link road safety concerns with wider spatial equity considerations. This study develops a novel GIS-Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) framework to evaluate the suitability of sites for new pedestrian crossings, incorporating four key criteria: existing provision of pedestrian infrastructure, road safety risks, proximity to urban amenities, and socio-demographic vulnerability. Applied to Liverpool City Region as a policy case study, the framework integrates advanced spatial analysis techniques with stakeholder informed weights, to assess the suitability of postcodes for new pedestrian crossings. Site suitability scores are generated which reflect both the considerations relevant to key stakeholders, as well as the distribution of controlled pedestrian crossings, road traffic collisions, urban amenities and census-derived vulnerability indicators. The results reveal significant spatial inequalities where, specific locations with high socio-demographic vulnerability also experience the greatest road safety risks and poorest access to pedestrian crossings, despite proximity to essential services. The framework successfully pinpoints priority locations where road safety and spatial inequality concerns compounded negatively, providing evidence-based guidance for data-driven, stakeholder-informed pedestrian infrastructure investment.",

          "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes a mandatory component within business environment and in many cases a key competitive advantage, it is essential that business education evolves accordingly for preparing students for this new reality. This paper presents an approach aimed at integrating AI into business education through practical, global oriented assignments. \nWe have experimented with students working in teams to tackle real-world business challenges using AI tools and concepts. Their task was to analyze a specific business problem, design an AI-driven business model, and develop a prototype solution. The goal was to offer them not just theoretical insights, but a hands-on experience of how AI can support and transform business processes.\nThe research is based on students’ experimentation with AI techniques to solve business problems, combined with insights gathered through a follow-up survey. Further, a survey explored students’ views on the relevance of AI in business, the effectiveness of the assignment, and the skills they felt they developed through the process.\nThe findings suggest that this kind of applied, project-based learning has strong educational value. Students not only deepened their understanding of AI technologies but also gained confidence in using them creatively. \nOverall, this study contributes to the growing conversation about how business schools can better align their teaching with the realities of a rapidly evolving digital economy. It also offers practical suggestions for educators who wish to bridge the gap between academic theory and the demands of professional practice.",

          "authors": "Daniel T. Roberts",
          "abstract": "Policies that reinforce unequal opportunity persist in democracies. I develop a theory of ``Boundary Defense\" to explain why. Middle-class families mobilize to defend these opportunity boundaries against reform when they lack alternative strategies to secure their status against uncertainty. In Germany, I argue early-age sorting across stratified schools is an opportunity boundary that excludes immigrants and that status uncertain German families defend it against reform. To test this, I introduce a 2010 referendum which blocked a reform to early-age sorting across schools in Hamburg and collect data from precinct-level votes, city-district demographics, election studies, and archival sources. Results show referendum support was highest in lower-income places and specific precincts with less access to academic schools and higher shares of immigrant children, among parents of school-age children without academic educations, and predicts future support for politicians who took positions against the reform. I suggest this theory also applies to different boundaries in both education and other fields, and that policies which reduce middle-class uncertainty can equalize opportunity better than technocratic reforms given boundary defense.",

          "authors": "Jack Thompson",
          "abstract": "Much of the existing work on LGBT+ placemaking relies on qualitative or historical narratives, which lack the empirical precision to systematically evaluate the structural factors driving the presence and evolution of LGBT+ establishments over time. To address these shortcomings, my paper examines the spatial evolution of LGBT+ establishments in US cities between 1990-2000, using a novel panel dataset combining geocoded Damron Guide entries from Mapping the Gay Guides (MGG) with contextual data from the NHGIS/U.S. Census Bureau. Employing fixed-effects panel models and difference-in-differences frameworks, my analysis investigates how establishment-level and MSA-level factors predict the presence and turnover dynamics of LGBT+ establishments over time. My findings reveal that bars/clubs and erotic shops have a higher likelihood of presence in MSAs relative to accommodations. Theatre/entertainment venues exhibit higher entry and stability into MSA markets, whereas other establishment types face volatile turnover. I also find that the so-called “great cities,\" ubiquitous in works on LGBT+ placemaking, exhibit conditions favorable to the viability of LGBT+ establishments and yet exhibit no significant differences in turnover dynamics compared to other MSAs. My findings extend qualitative narratives by quantifying the impacts of economic changes, demographic shifts, and cultural influences, which should inform urban policy and advocacy efforts to sustain inclusive LGBT+ spaces amidst changing urban landscapes.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Treatment Effect on the Association between Outcomes (TEA), a new causal estimand that measures how a treatment influences the covariance between two post-treatment variables. TEA enables researchers to estimate how interventions affect associations that characterize social inequalities. I define TEA, provide identification results under standard causal inference assumptions, and outline estimation strategies including regression-imputation, weighting, and double machine learning estimators. I compare and contrast TEA with other common estimands in similar research settings, highlighting its unique use. I demonstrate the use of TEA through two applications: the effect of college completion on income gradient in health and the effect of college completion on issue alignment, using NLSY97 and GSS respectively. By exploring how treatments modify associations between outcomes, TEA offers a valuable tool for sociological research on inequality, stratification, and public opinion, providing insights into the mechanisms sustaining social inequalities and informing policy interventions.",

          "authors": "Franziska Maier",
          "abstract": "While much progress has been made to understand what “globalization losers” want from future democracy, much less is known is about respective preferences of “globalization winners”, or cosmopolitans (representing the other side of the \"transnational cleavage\"). Given cosmopolitans’ active engagement in politics and society, their democratic preferences are decisive for future democratic reform both at the national and global level. This article investigates the heterogeneous governance preferences of German cosmopolitans. Acknowledging theoretical conceptions, the article defines cosmopolitanism as a multidimensional concept, and first empirically determines these dimensions as moral, cultural, institutional and anti-nationalist cosmopolitanism. These dimensions are connected to preferences for representative, technocratic and participatory forms of democracy. This shows that each cosmopolitanism dimensions implies distinct preferences. While nearly all dimensions relate positively to governance by experts (except for the anti-nationalist dimension), only the institutional dimension of cosmopolitanism is connected to significant and consistent support for representative government. There is strong disagreement on participatory forms of democracy. Moral cosmopolitanism is associated with an endorsement referendums and citizen assemblies, whereas the anti-nationalist dimension connects with the rejection of both. These results are explained by different values connected with moral and cultural cosmopolitanism on the one hand, and institutional and anti-national cosmopolitanism on the other.",

Small and independent hotels face significant structural barriers—such as high costs, limited resources, and lack of support—that risk excluding them from making environmental claims. Without targeted policy interventions, both directives could entrench inequities and marginalise under-resourced businesses. Using real options theory, the report identifies four strategic responses: wait and see, partial investment, growth, and withdrawal.

          "abstract": "How we remember our past can be shaped by the realities of our present. This study examines how changes to present circumstances influence retrospective reports of family income rank at age 16. While retrospective survey data can be used to assess the long-term effects of childhood conditions, present-day circumstances may “anchor” memories, causing shifts in how individuals recall and report past experiences. Using panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (8,602 observations from 2,883 individuals in the United States), we analyze how changes in objective and subjective indicators of current social status—income, financial satisfaction, and perceived income relative to others—are associated with changes in reports of childhood income rank, and how this varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Fixed-effects models reveal no significant association between changes in income and in childhood income rank. However, changes in subjective measures of social status show contrasting effects, as increases in current financial satisfaction are associated with decreases in childhood income rank, but increases in current perceived relative income are associated with increases in childhood income rank. We argue these opposing effects follow from theories of anchoring in recall bias. We further find these effects are stronger among males but are consistent across racial/ethnic groups. This demographic heterogeneity suggests that recall bias is not evenly distributed across the population and has important implications for how different groups perceive their own pasts. Our findings further highlight the malleability of retrospective perceptions and their sensitivity to current social conditions, offering methodological insights into survey reliability and recall bias.",

          "abstract": "Myanmar’s protracted conflict, intensified by the 2021 military coup, has severely disrupted formal education and deepened psychosocial needs among children. Community-led schools, established across ethnic regions both before and after the coup, have become vital in sustaining learning, cultural continuity, and psychosocial well-being. This paper reviews how trauma-informed practices and social-emotional learning (SEL) are integrated into these schools to address the layered effects of violence, displacement, and chronic instability. Evidence from Myanmar and global literature shows that predictable routines, culturally responsive pedagogy, and SEL activities help foster resilience, belonging, and recovery. Teachers play a dual role as educators and emotional supporters, while communities contribute through engagement and culturally rooted practices. The review also highlights key challenges, including limited resources, teacher well-being, and weak referral systems. These insights contribute to broader discussions on how education systems in fragile contexts can integrate academic and psychosocial support in sustainable, locally grounded ways.",
