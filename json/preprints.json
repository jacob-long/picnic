          "title": "The ontological reality of communication: beyond field identity",
          "authors": "Manuel Martín Algarra",
          "abstract": "The ongoing debate over communication’s identity may appear excessive, yet it plays a crucial role by enabling exploration beyond the field, including its core object of study. In communication research, this debate serves as self-reflection, and this article argues that perceived incoherence arises less from a lack of common ground and more from an incomplete grasp of communication’s ontological reality. Drawing on Craig’s constitutive metamodel, Einstein’s reflections on scientific fundamentals, and Cooren’s concepts of materiality and sociality, this article explores the necessity for communication to address its essential nature, similar to other sciences. It concludes that an ontological turn in communication theory is essential to advance beyond current definitional debates and better comprehend how communication constitutes the social world.",

          "title": "Transformative Communication in Development Organisation: Strategic Engagement and Celebrity Influence",
          "authors": "Tao Louie Xu",
          "abstract": "This essay uncovers the evolving paradigm of communication for development, then with a focus on the strategic engagement of celebrity influence. Contextualised against the historical dominance of the Euro-Americentric modernisation discourse and with the multi-step communication framework, it situates celebrity engagement within a bidirectional model of information diffusion and participatory advocacy. The essay integrates the theoretical perspective with illustrative case studies to articulate the interplay between emotional resonance, mediated narratives, and public mobilisation. The findings reveal both the potential of celebrity influence to amplify development initiatives and the challenges posed by sensationalism and skepticism. Ultimately, it advances a call for strategic alignment between academic inquiry and institutional praxis, advocating for the positive celebrity influence to achieve cogent policy change in international development.",

          "authors": "Bart Penders",
          "abstract": "In response to various perceived crises in science, changes to the organization, conduct and publication of science have been proposed and implemented under the label of ‘reform’. This paper dives into the new collaborative form of the ManyX study and how it changes researchers' agency, engagement with and articulation of their objects of study. More concretely, ManyX consortia display strict and pervasive formalization of science, which includes bureaucratization, standardization and governance and they pursue equally strict procedural hygiene. These formalizations and hygienic labors redraw the boundaries between high and low-status scientific labor, and what constitutes reliable knowledge. Drawing from literature on virtual witnessing and thought collectives, I argue that ManyX approaches can be understood as prototypes of institutionalized scientific reform, and that they contribute to alternative processes through which researchers persuade one another, while shaping the distribution of agency between those at the relative cores and peripheries of scientific reform.",

          "abstract": "*Background:* Reproducibility is recognized as essential to scientific progress and integrity. Replication studies and large-scale replication projects, aiming to quantify different aspects of reproducibility, have become more common. Since no standardized approach to measuring reproducibility exists,a diverse set of metrics has emerged and a comprehensive overview is needed.\n\n*Methods:* We conducted a scoping review to identify large-scale replication projects that used metrics and methodological papers that proposed or discussed metrics. The project list was compiled by the authors. For the methodological papers, we searched Scopus, MedLine, PsycINFO andEconLit. Records were screened in duplicate against predefined inclusion criteria. Demographic information on included records and information on reproducibility metrics used, suggested or discussed was extracted.\n\n*Results:* We identified 49 large-scale projects and 97 methodological papers, and extracted 50 metrics. The metrics were characterized based on type (formulas and/or statistical models, frameworks, graphical representations, studies and questionnaires, algorithms), input required, and appropriate application scenarios. Each metric addresses a distinct question.\n\n*Conclusions:* Our review provides a comprehensive resource in the form of a “live”, interactive table for future replication teams and meta-researchers, offering support in how to select the most appropriate metrics that are aligned with research questions and project goals.",

          "title": "Systematic Pyramid Reviews – A new method of evidence synthesis from different research approaches for routine health care decision making and practice",
          "authors": "Bernhard Borgetto",
          "abstract": "Background: Science-based clinical decision-making and practice in everyday healthcare requires synthesized evidence from different research approaches. The usual focus on RCTs (randomized controlled trials) as the methodological gold standard and the associated neglect of observa-tional studies and qualitative studies does not meet these requirements. The aim of the project presented here was to develop a type of review with which study results from all relevant re-search approaches can be synthesized and the significance of this overall state of evidence on the effects of therapeutic interventions can be critically appraised.\nMethods: Over a period of almost 20 years, a four-sided evidence hierarchy (research pyramid) was developed on the basis of general epistemological and methodological principles, which is based on two fundamental distinctions: experimental and observational as well as quantitative and qualitative research approaches. From this the type of a Pyramid Review was developed. \nResults: A Pyramid Review is based on the usual steps for systematic reviews - but without re-striction to specific research approaches or study designs. The specific steps of a Pyramid Review are the following: (A) Assignment of the individual studies and reviews to the corresponding research approach on the research pyramid; (B) Preliminary appraisal of the level of evidence; (C) Critical appraisal of the quality of the conduct of the study, and downgrading of the level of evidence as indicated; (D) Critical appraisal of the quality of results, and upgrading of the level of evidence if appropriate; (E) Clustering the individual studies according to research approach and conducting partial reviews; (F) Critical synthesis of the overall state of evidence from the partial reviews. \nConclusion: A Pyramid Review for clinical practice and research currently seems to be the most meaningful form of evidence synthesis for supporting routine health care. It comprehensively considers evidence from different research approaches and evaluates it according to strict re-spective methodological standards. It also makes it clear which research approaches may be overrepresented and which are underrepresented in relation to a particular clinical question.",

          "authors": "Pekka Syrjanen",
          "abstract": "Predictive success is a central objective of science. However, compared to other important aims such as explanation and causal discovery, prediction remains an undertheorized aspect of science in the philosophy of science. Here, I offer an account of prediction that distinguishes between different forms of predictive success that theories and models achieve in science. I draw a distinction between logical and contingent dimensions of predictive success. Logical dimensions measure the theory’s predictive success with empirical data directly. These dimensions include accuracy, specificity, scope, and depth. Contingent dimensions encompass predictive successes that the theory or model achieves in relation to its context of discovery. These include forecasting, use-novelty, theoretical novelty, and temporal novelty. I analyse the connection of each dimension to theory confirmation and survey approaches to operationalizing the dimensions in scientific practice. I explore how understanding the dimensions of prediction can aid in theory evaluation and development and highlight further open issues and questions concerning prediction in science.",

          "authors": "Jiayi Li; Wenfeng Chen",
          "abstract": "Nomophobia refers to the anxiety individuals experience when unable to effectively access the internet. Traditional explanatory frameworks often interpret this phenomenon as withdrawal symptoms, leading to an over-pathologization of daily behaviors. Neutral theories, on the other hand, view nomophobia as a psychological manifestation of unmet connectivity needs but often fail to acknowledge the psychological benefits of digital technology. The attachment theory perspective interprets nomophobia as separation anxiety, yet logical inconsistencies remain. Self-extension theories consider digital networks as part of the individual self but insufficiently explore the systemic and unique characteristics of the internet. After evaluating and comparing these perspectives, this study introduces the concept of \"virtual ability expansion through networks\" as a complementary enhancement to existing theories. Overall, the conceptual landscape surrounding this topic is characterized by significant overlap and ambiguity. Future research should aim to delineate the boundaries and applicability of these concepts to better understand the ambivalent “love-hate”human-Internet relationship.",

          "abstract": "The Autobiographical Interview is a widely used tool for examining memory and related cognitive functions. It provides a standardized framework to differentiate between internal details, representing the episodic features of specific events, and external details, including semantic knowledge and other non-episodic information. This study introduces an automated scoring model for autobiographical memory and future thinking tasks, using large language models (LLMs) that can analyze personal event narratives without preprocessing. Building on the traditional Autobiographical Interview protocol, we fine-tuned a LLaMA-3 model to identify internal and external details at a narrative level. The model was trained and tested on narratives from 284 participants across three studies, spanning past and future thinking tasks, multiple age groups, and collected in lab and virtual interviews. Results demonstrate strong correlations with human scores of up to r = 0.87 on internal and up to r = 0.84 on external details, indicating the model aligns as closely with human raters as they do with each other. Additionally, as evidence of the algorithm’s construct validity, the model replicated known age-related trends that cognitively normal older adults generate fewer internal and more external details than younger adults across three datasets, finding this age group difference even in one dataset where human raters did not. This automated approach offers a scalable alternative to manual scoring, making large-scale studies of human autobiographical memory more feasible.",

          "abstract": "Feedback literacy is increasingly recognized as essential individual difference for how students approach and learn from feedback in higher education. This study provides validity evidence for a refined version of the Student Feedback Literacy Instrument (SFLI), designed to measure the construct across two dimensions –feedback attitudes and feedback practices– in three languages: German, English, and Turkish. We developed both a full-length and a short-form version (SFLI-S). Using confirmatory factor analyses on different student samples, we confirmed the two-factor structure across languages, supporting the model of feedback literacy comprising of attitudinal and behavioral components. Associations with related constructs further support the instrument’s convergent validity. As a psychometrically sound, multilingual instrument, the SFLI can facilitate cross-cultural feedback literacy research and provides a valuable tool for research and educational practice. The SFLI-S offers an economical alternative, enabling wider integration into studies on how students engage with feedback.",

          "abstract": "Increasing awareness of mental health problems, including that of young people, is generally seen\nas positive and several interventions to increase awareness are underway internationally. Yet, a\nprincipled evaluation of benefits and harms of increasing awareness is still lacking.\nHere, we present a conceptual and mathematical framework for the evaluation of information\ninterventions aimed at increasing public awareness of mental health problems. Borrowing from\ninfection spread and related population dynamic models, we show how benefits, but also harms,\nmay accrue at substantial rates over time.\nSpecifically, we model the links of a causal chain that starts with an attempt to increase public\nawareness through an information intervention. This allows us to show such interventions change\nthe mental health awareness in the general public, influence the number of help seekers (i.e. those\nwho seek help from mental health professionals), but may also, directly or indirectly, influence how\nclinicians practise and the accuracy of their diagnoses. Consequently, we show that information\ninterventions can increase both benefits and harms to the general population, depending on\nindividual parameters that our framework can flexibly accommodate.\nIn our paper, we detail the rigorous conceptual foundations and mathematical formalisms but also\noffer a novel software application that can be used by researchers and practitioners who wish to\npredict the effect of potential mental health information interventions, or evaluate the outcomes of\nexisting ones.",

          "abstract": "False memories occur when an individual may remember an experience or event differently from the way it’s actually happened or misremember that it even happened at all. Previous research has shown that the presence of false memories may be affected by subtle external factors such as sleep duration, caffeine intake, or the time of day (ToD) of testing. However, the effects of a wide range of sleep, tiredness, ToD and caffeine variables, specifically at the time of testing or prior to testing has rarely been explored. Fifty-seven cognitively-healthy adults completed a sleep, tiredness and caffeine questionnaire which assessed a range of variables including questions about habitual and current sleep patterns, tiredness and caffeine factors, followed by a false memory task. Results showed that (i) as participants performed further away from their subjectively reported preferred ToD the number of false memories increased and (ii) caffeine intake prior to testing reduced the number of false memories made when people were performing further away from their preferred ToD. These findings highlight the need to consider one’s subjective ToD preference for taking part in false memory tasks, and prior caffeine intake on the development of false memories in clinical, research and legal settings.",

          "abstract": "Wayfinding is an important everyday activity, which can be conceived as a dynamic process of spatial problem solving. Existing research has significantly increased our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of wayfinding but has necessarily minimised the importance of ecological factors. Therefore, in this study we conducted a thematic synthesis of 38 articles, investigating an important yet minimised factor: the experiences and perceptions of everyday wayfinding. Our findings suggest that people’s experiences and perceptions are an integral part of everyday wayfinding, which manifests most explicitly in how landmarks are selected and utilised, how individuals’ wayfinding experiences and strategies are idiosyncratic, and how wayfinding can be conceived as a dynamic, collective and socially-situated activity. These findings, we suggest, can act as a catalyst for an expansion of wayfinding research towards more ecologically sound approaches with diverse methodologies. This, we argue, provides support for an exciting new ‘situated turn’ in wayfinding research.",

          "abstract": "Distorted information has been shown to affect individual cognition, behavior, and societal dynamics. This study examines belief formation in misinformation and conspiracy theories, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a relevant case. It addresses gaps in understanding whether different distorted beliefs arise from distinct factors and how they influence information processing. By analyzing misinformation and conspiracy theories—types of distorted information that differ in facticity and intent to deceive—this study seeks to clarify the cognitive and social mechanisms behind these beliefs. Findings reveal that a conspiratorial mindset and intuitive thinking significantly predict belief in distorted information, highlighting the need for tailored interventions. Institutional mistrust, reliance on alternative media, and group identity further shape susceptibility to such beliefs. Insights from this research support the development of targeted strategies to address distinct cognitive profiles, emphasizing the importance of fostering critical media skills and understanding motivations behind belief formation.",

We employ a qualitative methodology using rich interview data with a sample of residents from one neighbourhood that had adopted these devices and present this in the form of four composite narratives. By shifting the unit of analysis to the neighbourhood level and employing a structurational practice lens, we shed light on the complex situated uses of these novel technologies and how their use interacts with existing structures leading to varied privacy and security outcomes for neighbourhood residents. We conceptualise the outcomes of the emergent structures and practices as a Faustian Bargain - when residents enact structures in their recurrent use, in order to gain a combination of security, control, convenience and entertainment they trade their own and their neighbour’s privacy. More interestingly however, we see that the privacy that is being traded in this ‘devilish’ transaction is not paid proportionally by all.",

          "abstract": "Socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to psychological and behavioral outcomes like time discounting, trust, sense of control, and life satisfaction. This pre-registered study examines daily hassles—routine stressors in everyday life—as contributors to SES-related differences in stress, attitudes, decision-making, and well-being. 230 UK participants documented three negative events daily for one week, providing descriptions and subjective ratings. Text analysis using large language models supplemented these data. Despite higher overall stress among low-SES individuals, they did not experience more frequent or intense daily hassles than their high-SES counterparts. Instead, low-SES participants reported lower perceived control, more health-related stressors, and fewer work-related hassles. These findings challenge assumptions that heightened stress in low-SES groups stems from more frequent or severe routine stressors. By integrating subjective and computational analyses, this study highlights the nuanced relationship between SES and stress, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to addressing SES disparities in well-being and decision-making.",

          "title": "A Theory of Multi-Attribute Search and Choice",
          "authors": "Sebastian Gluth; Jordan Deakin; Jörg Rieskamp",
          "abstract": "Decisions problems are often characterized by the presence of many choice options described by several attributes. To behave efficiently, people are thus required to limit information search. We propose that humans search and thereby devote attention to relevant information in an efficient and goal-directed, but not necessarily optimal manner. Thereto, a novel hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model of information search in multi-attribute and multi-alternative decisions is presented and tested. The search process is assumed to be governed by the desire to quickly identify the option that meets the current choice goal best, which in turn depends on the importance and uncertainty of information as well as the accumulated evidence. The theory accounts for many empirical findings from existing research on the interplay of attention and decision making, including the positive correlation of gaze time and choice probability as well as the preference for sampling promising choice candidates. To rigorously test a series of predicted top-down effects of attention, results of a new and preregistered eye-tracking experiment on multi-attribute decisions are presented, in which the influence of bottom-up attention on visual search is minimized. The theory accounts for the various interactions of attention and choice in this experiment, while variants with different search rules fail to capture them. Furthermore, the theory predicts additional choice dynamics such as the dependency of decision speed on the number and overall value of options. Our work offers a general framework to understand the intricate dynamics of search and valuation mechanisms in multi-attribute decision making.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has provided evidence of the interaction between eye gaze and turn-taking, showing that turn yielding is generally signalled with mutual gaze, whereby the primary speaker assesses the interlocutor's availability, which is subsequently confirmed by the interlocutor, as the next or secondary speaker reciprocates the gaze. However, the relation between eye gaze and turn-regulating vocal feedback signals, indicating the intention to take the conversational floor or not, can be influenced by different experimental designs. In task-based conversations, turn-regulating vocal feedback reportedly occurs predominantly when speakers avert their gaze. In this study, we investigate the relation between turn-regulating vocal feedback and eye gaze patterns, extending the binary paradigm of averted versus mutual gaze to include unilateral gaze, which can be directed towards the interlocutor when feedback signals are followed by a turn. We also find by-dyad variability, which we attribute to the fact that interlocutors can use the vocal and visual channels of communication together or separately.",

          "abstract": "The growing integration of AI tools in communication promises enhanced efficiency and productivity. However, concerns about the erosion of trust and authenticity have fueled debates over the disclosure and regulation ofAI-mediated communication. It remains unclear a) how AI mediation influences trust, b) whether the efficiency gains outweigh potential compromises in trust, and c) how proposed transparency policies would impact these trade-offs. To address these questions, we conducted two online studies (total N = 1637). We adapted the well-established incentivized trust game to measure objective behavioral trust. Additionally, we use subjective, self-reported trust ratings. Before each game, some participants could write a message with or without an AI assistant to elicit trust. We also systematically varied actual and expecteddisclosure of AI assistance. Results reveal that AI assistance had little to no consequences for trust, even when AI use was transparent. However, participants using AI assistance composed their messages more quickly, achieving higher returns of trust per writing time invested. Importantly, this efficiency boost was not suppressed by expected or actual disclosure of AI involvement. Contrary to prevailing concerns, these results suggest that AI-mediated communication could enhance efficiency and facilitate trust-building rather than undermine it.",

Using a pseudo-experimental, cross-sectional study that approximates populations of AI-builders and -users (N = 914), both current (N-adults = 519; over 20 years) and projected (N-students = 395; 16-18 years), we observe persistent gender disparities in AI engagement that translate into different moral preferences among AI-builders and AI-users. We discuss the implications of the observed idiosyncrasies in the AI workforce, emphasizing the need for renewed efforts to address these disparities and highlighting the potential impact of homogenous, hegemonic machine morals for moral cognition.",

          "abstract": "The importance of supporting mental well-being is increasingly critical, but patient engagement in psychological talking therapy remains a challenge. To address this, we developed an AI-enabled therapy support tool designed to offer therapeutic support during mental health treatment. Here, we conducted a real-world, observational study to test the effectiveness of the tool in improving patient engagement and clinical outcomes. The tool was piloted with patients undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) treatment in the National Health Service (NHS) Talking Therapies services in the United Kingdom. We find that patients who used the tool achieved significantly better treatment outcomes, demonstrated by higher rates of reliable improvement (94.3% vs. 69.8% in the control group) and reliable recovery (71.4% vs. 50.7% in the control group). Interestingly, the results also indicated that the AI tool was associated with faster recovery, i.e. fewer therapy sessions were required to achieve recovery. These results suggest that the use of AI-enabled therapy support tools in talking therapy could lead to increased patient engagement, better treatment outcomes and reduced cost of service delivery. This study illustrates the potential of AI tools to improve efficacy and efficiency of psychological talking therapies.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools with potential applications across multiple sectors, including healthcare, where resource constraints make efficiency gains particularly valuable. However, the domain of mental healthcare presents distinct challenges, as its vulnerable patient population necessitates high standards of clinical performance and safety. To address this, we introduce the Limbic Layer — a novel system of machine learning (ML) models designed to augment LLMs with specialized clinical decision-making capabilities specific to a mental health setting. This study evaluated the impact of the the Limbic Layer on clinical performance and safety compared to a state-of-the-art, stand-alone LLM (OpenAI GPT-4). We investigated the impact from the perspective of service users as well as trained clinicians. In the first phase, users interacted with either a prompted LLM or an LLM powered by the Limbic Layer. We found that the Limbic Layer demonstrated superior performance in both therapeutic relationship building and clinical skills. In the second phase, clinicians blindly assessed the user conversations, rating the Limbic Layer as significantly more clinically accurate than the stand-alone LLM. This enhanced clinical accuracy was reflected in clinician preference, with 94% indicating they would prefer patients to be treated by the Limbic Layer compared to a stand-alone LLM. These findings suggest that the Limbic Layer significantly improves the clinical performance and safety profile of state-of-the-art LLMs, unlocking their implementation in real-world clinical settings.",

In a laboratory study involving 47 four-person teams engaged in a collaborative game, we used synchrony and regularity in heart rate and skin conductance to reflect team physiological coordination and examined how this coordination relates to team adaptation and overall performance. We found that regularity in heart rate and skin conductance decreased across levels of game play, while synchrony in skin conductance increased, particularly when teams had to adapt to task changes. Moreover, higher levels of regularity in heart rates and lower levels of regularity in skin conductance predicted performance through associations with team adaptation. In addition, synchrony in skin conductance also predicted team performance. These results show promising potential for using wearable technology to measure real-time team adaptation processes and predicting team performance in crisis situations.",

          "abstract": "AI-generated faces have become virtually indistinguishable from real human faces. In this study, we demonstrate that super-recognisers—individuals with exceptional face recognition abilities—can reliably detect AI-generated faces, while typical observers cannot. Super-recognisers (N=36) and typical observers (N=89) were shown images of real and AI-generated faces and classified each as real or fake. Super-recognisers performed significantly above chance, with decision confidence positively correlated with accuracy, indicating metacognitive insight. In contrast, typical observers performed at chance level, with no insight into their accuracy. Aggregating responses using a wisdom-of-crowds approach improved super-recogniser accuracy substantially but did not affect typical observer accuracy. To understand the basis of super-recognisers’ enhanced sensitivity to real faces, we examined the facial cues used by each group. Super-recognisers and typical observers showed qualitative differences, with super-recognisers relying less on perceived familiarity and memorability—cues that have previously misled typical observers when assessing face authenticity. These findings suggest that understanding individual differences in face-processing ability may help mitigate risks associated with hyper-realistic AI faces.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is associated with negative social behaviors impairing social relationships. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we investigated whether paranoid thoughts affect lonely individuals’ willingness to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity during trusting interactions in individuals with and without psychosis. We found that loneliness and paranoia were strongly correlated with each other and with more distrustful behavior after breaches of trust. Sensitivity to changes in partner reciprocity were higher in lonelier and more paranoid individuals. Lonelier individuals also trusted highly-reciprocating partners less. Computational modeling revealed that lonelier and more paranoid individuals were less willing to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity. Importantly, these effects were observed in both patients and controls, indicating the important impact of loneliness and paranoia on both clinical and general populations. These findings demonstrate how loneliness affects social behaviors and expectations, pointing to important downstream implications for lonely individuals’ relationships.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Rhyme increases the phonological similarity of phrases individuals hear and enhances recall from working memory. The present study explores whether rhyme aids word learning and examines the underlying neural mechanisms through which rhyme facilitates word learning. \n\nMethod: Fifty-seven adults completed a word learning task where they were exposed to 15 nonwords (NWs), four times each, in the sentence-final position as their EEG was recorded. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Rhyme or No-Rhyme group, where the NWs rhymed or did not rhyme with a prime real word in the sentence, respectively, during the exposure phase. Subjects were then tested on their recognition of the NWs. \n\nResults: Behavioral accuracy on the NW recognition task did not differ between the Rhyme and No Rhyme groups; however, the Rhyme group showed an enhanced bilateral P2 in the early exposure phase, which has been linked to increased attention to the phonological and semantic features of speech. By contrast, the No-Rhyme group showed an attenuated N400 amplitude at left centro-parietal sites in the later exposure phase, related to semantic retrieval of NWs. \n\nConclusions: These findings indicate that rhyme may facilitate encoding of word meaning via attention to both phonology and semantic information; however, the absence of rhyme does not hinder adults’ ability to map meaning to novel words.",

Drawing on the racial noticing framework and insights from teacher psychological characteristics, the present study examined pre-service teachers’ competence to attend and interpret ethnic microaggressions and explored the attitudinal dispositions that contribute to teachers’ awareness of these discriminatory actions. Using a vignette design across two experimental studies in Germany, our results indicated that participants demonstrated noticing ability in detecting microaggressions. We found less consistent evidence for the role of participants’ attitudinal dispositions as predictors of racial noticing. Implicit prejudice was only related to attending microaggressions, and this result was not replicated in the second study. Surprisingly, explicit prejudice was positively associated with interpreting microaggressions in both studies. Additionally, higher levels of critical consciousness were positively linked to a greater ability in attending and interpreting ethnic microaggressions. We discuss implications for teacher education on noticing ethnic microaggressions in schools.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the development and validation of the Short Phronesis Measure (SPM), a novel tool to assess Aristotelian phronesis (practical wisdom). Across five studies, using large, nationally representative samples from the UK and US (demographically matched to census data), we employed a systematic and rigorous methodology to examine the structure, reliability, and validity of the SPM. In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis identified ten distinct, internally reliable components of phronesis, challenging the traditional four-component Aristotelian model. Study 2 confirmed these findings in two additional nationally representative samples from the UK and the US. In Study 3, the SPM demonstrated strong test-retest reliability over two months. Study 4 used exploratory network analysis to uncover interrelations among the components, allowing for the creation of a new and empirically driven neo-Aristotelian model of phronesis. In Study 5, we tested criterion validity, showing phronesis correlates positively with flourishing and predicts flourishing two months later, demonstrating strong predictive validity. Phronesis also correlated with Big 6 and Dark Tetrad personality traits, moral disengagement, and Moral Foundations in expected directions. Importantly, phronesis predicted key outcomes—related to flourishing, moral disengagement, and morally relevant aspects of personality—beyond what Moral Foundations alone explained, with an average increase in predictive power of 13.7% across all outcomes. The SPM is quick to administer (15-20 minutes), making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in psychology, education, and professional ethics. The introduction of the neo-Aristotelian Phronesis Model, and the identification of central phronesis components, offers actionable insights for moral psychologists and moral educators, suggesting areas of focus that could yield broad, positive effects across related traits, providing a significant contribution to both theory and practice.",

          "abstract": "Preregistration is the practice of formally documenting the plan for a study, including the research questions, hypotheses, design, and analysis before the data has been collected or analysed. To be a valid, this ‘study plan’ should be prospectively registered in a publicly accessible, verified repository with an associated date- and timestamp. Preregistration can be implemented for all types of research, including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods, and primary and secondary data designs. Dependent on such methodology, the overarching goals of preregistration are to: (1) distinguish confirmatory from exploratory research; (2) increase transparency; (3) reduce bias; and (4) help evaluate the severity of hypothesis testing. Written for students, this guide provides an overview of the ‘what, why, and how’ of preregistration as well as a discussion of its benefits, barriers, and solutions. After reading this guide, you should feel confident to use preregistration in your research training – whether this be through adopting preregistration in your own research projects and/or being able to critically evaluate this open research practice in the published literature.",

          "abstract": "Cue-based retrieval, a theory of sentence processing, has received considerable attention in psycholinguistics over the years. The retrieval account seeks to explain a signature phenomenon, similarity-based interference, whereby a linguistic dependency–such as subject-verb dependency–is harder to complete when a non-dependent word, called a distractor, makes it more difficult to identify the correct subject. One question that remains open in cue-based retrieval is: What cues are actively employed during the retrieval process? While previous work has largely focused on morphosyntactic cues in Indo-European languages, the current work explores the potential use of semantic cues from classifiers in the processing of long-distance classifier-noun dependencies in Mandarin Chinese. A further open question is whether the distractor must intervene between the co-dependents (so-called retroactive interference) or whether the distractor can appear to the left of the dependent elements (so-called proactive interference). Previous work has suggested that proactive interference is weaker than retroactive interference, i.e., that the distractor has to intervene between the co-dependents to influence the dependency completion process.  Using self-paced reading and A-Maze tasks, and Bayes Factors for hypothesis testing, we found robust evidence for a predicted interference effect in retroactive configurations, but no interference in proactive configurations. We discuss the theoretical implications of the current work for theories of retrieval and sentence processing in general.",

          "abstract": "According to one model of reading, words are recognized one at a time because of a bottleneck in the brain that cannot process two words simultaneously. Consistent with this serial model, we first show that participants can report lexical information about only one of two unrelated words that are flashed briefly above and below fixation and then masked. We then investigate whether two words that compose a single compound word (e.g., bottle + neck) can nonetheless be processed in parallel. The results demonstrate that indeed, under the same conditions in which two unrelated words cannot be recognized simultaneously, accuracy for recognizing either or both of two words that form a compound exceeds the prediction of the serial model. This result complicates theories of a serial bottleneck in lexical access, especially in the context of natural reading when words often form meaning jointly.",

          "abstract": "We often judge music in everyday life, by choosing tracks for workouts, work, or sleep. These judgments can be made through heuristics (intuitive decisions) or analytically (deliberate decisions), according to dual-process theory. Decisions about what music to listen to are made by individuals in many contexts, although it’s unclear how music features and familiarity influence these choices. For example, sleep research recommends choosing calm music, but surveys show that people also select energetic music. Here, we wanted to understand how people judged these different kinds of sleep music. In an online experiment, 97 participants listened to 10-second musical excerpts and rated on a 0-100 scale each track’s suitability for sleep and how much they liked the track. The tracks were in a 2x2 design: familiarity (unfamiliar or familiar) and type (calm or energetic). For tracks rated above 50, participants answered additional questions about potential sleep-related uses (e.g., relaxation). As expected, calm music was most often rated appropriate for sleep, but surprisingly familiar music was less favoured. This suggests participants relied on heuristics, viewing calm music as more fitting, and familiar music may carry associations that hinder imagining it for sleep. Additionally, liking a track was more important for the judgment of sleep music than familiarity. These findings, differing from survey and physiological studies, suggest a gap between judgments of sleep music and physiological responses to it. We urge caution in future experiments or interventions where participants consciously judge music, as such judgments may not fully reflect felt reactions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adolescents experiencing mental health problems have an elevated risk of persisting difficulties as they transition into adulthood, stressing the importance of identifying modifiable factors impacting mental health during adolescence. The family environment is recognised as a key influence on adolescent mental health in theory and interventions, yet there is scarce longitudinal evidence pertaining to how family dynamics influence mental health in this period. Notably, few studies have disentangled within-person and between-person effects in relating adolescent mental health and the family environment.\n\nMethods: We analysed data from 1,067 adolescents across three waves using panel graphical vector autoregressive modelling, separating contemporaneous and temporal within-person and between-person associations in relationships between mental health difficulties (i.e., emotional, hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems) and family-related factors (i.e., aspects of the general family environment, parent-child relationships, and sibling dynamics). The mean age (in years) was 10.51 at Wave 1, 12.49 at Wave 2, and 14.49 at Wave 3.\n\nResults: Emotional symptoms predicted increases in hyperactivity/inattention and more sibling problems over time. Lack of family support and negative feelings towards family were reciprocally related, indicative of a reinforcing loop. Both mental health difficulties and family environment factors exhibited considerable stability. In contemporaneous within-person associations, mental health difficulties were strongly interrelated, as were aspects of the family environment. Furthermore, conduct problems were linked to externalising\nbehaviours (e.g., fighting with parents, bothering siblings) and emotional symptoms to internalising experiences of family dynamics (e.g., feeling negative towards family, being bothered by siblings). Negative feelings towards family and hyperactivity/inattention were strongly predicted by included variables, while emotional symptoms, fighting with parents, and lacking family support were predictive of other variables.\n\nConclusions: Our findings point to the importance of emotional problems in adolescence, which may contribute to worsened hyperactivity/inattention and more problems with siblings over time, and the interrelatedness of mental health and the family environment. Alleviating internalising problems in affected adolescents may help mitigate development of other mental health difficulties and negative sibling dynamics.",

However, existing research often relies on self-reported measures of time spent on digital devices, which fail to capture the complexity and nuances of digital interactions and experienced. Data donation offers a more reliable alternative by allowing for the collection of objective, time-stamped data from social media platforms. Using a longitudinal feasibility trial (N = 358, aged 13–18 years), alongside focus groups and input from youth advisory panels, we demonstrate the effectiveness and acceptability of data donation as a data collection method. High engagement rates indicated participants’ willingness to donate their social media data for research, with privacy concerns and trust in researchers acting as pivotal factors in participation. Based on our findings, we propose six key recommendations for conducting adolescent data donation studies, emphasising transparent communication, ethical consent, and collaborative design. In future, the effectiveness of this highly promising data collection method relies on incorporating adolescents’ perspectives, ensuring their agency and concerns are central to the research process, and fostering their digital well-being through inclusive, ethical study designs.",

          "abstract": "Peripherally located objects are often perceived to be smaller than centrally located objects. This perceptual phenomenon, known as the Size-Eccentricity Effect (SEE), is mainly due to the structural properties of the visual system and is further modulated by covert attention. In this study, we evaluated whether pre-saccadic attention could also compensate for this effect. Participants performed a judgment task where they compared a test disk of varying size, briefly presented in peripheral vision, to a reference disk appearing 450 ms later in foveal vision. When no saccade was made toward the location of the test disk, the SEE was observed. However, when participants initiated saccades about 200 ms after the test disk extinction, points of subjective equality were close to objective equality. The second experiment aimed at excluding an explanation involving non-specific arousal mechanisms, also known to enhance visual perception. Participants executed a keypress or an antisaccade instead of a saccade. The SEE disappeared only in the saccade condition, confirming the crucial role of pre-saccadic attention shifts in this SEE compensation. Therefore, pre-saccadic attention improves not only the processing of orientation, contrast and spatial frequency (as previously demonstrated), but also the processing of peripheral object size.",

In contrast, most recent studies of visual working memory (VWM) using continuous-outcome decision tasks, in which responses are made on continuous scales, do not distinguish between memory variability and decision-process variability in characterizing retrieval errors and are silent on decision times. We combined a successful model of continuous-outcome decisions, the circular diffusion model (CDM), with a peaked, heavy-tailed distribution of memory representations, the Jones-Pewsey distribution, to characterize the speed and accuracy of continuous-outcome decisions about the hues of saturated and desaturated color patches in four experiments that varied the difficulty of the decision task and the memory load of the VWM task. The CDM provided a good account of the marginal and joint distributions of response times and response errors and the anisotropies of stimuli in different parts of the color space across all experiments. VWM precision followed either an inverse square-root law or power law in set size, depending on saturation, as predicted by sample-size and attention-weighted sample-size models, respectively. The results support a model in which the capacity limits of VWM reflect the statistical properties of a population of noisy neurons that are divided among items in memory under attentional control and determine the precision of recalled items.",

A total of 753 participants rated 1,028 translated words on valence, arousal, and dominance using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale. The adaptation ensured linguistic equivalence through iterative translation and consensus processes, selecting region-specific terms verified with the Corpus XXI of the Royal Spanish Academy. Split-half correlations confirmed high internal consistency across dimensions (valence: r = 0.96, arousal: r = 0.89, dominance: r = 0.90), demonstrating stable and reliable ratings within the Mexican sample. Cross-linguistic analyses revealed strong correlations between Mexican Spanish and norms for European Portuguese and Spanish, with moderate correlations to English norms, highlighting cultural and linguistic influences on emotional word ratings. Gender differences further provided insights into demographic factors affecting emotional word processing. These findings underscore the need for culturally specific adaptations in research, ensuring that affective norms align with regional language use and emotional perception.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Individuals’ construals of aging capture how they think of aging, and what aging well means to them. Assessing such construals is important for understanding attitudes towards aging and, ultimately, how to tailor personalized aging well interventions to an individual.\nMethods: We analyzed 100 younger adults and 92 older adults’ spoken narratives of what aging well means to them using two language analysis approaches, closed vocabulary, word-count analysis via Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and open vocabulary, word-co-occurrence analysis via topic modelling. \nResults: Younger and older adults’ spoken narratives differed in both word and topic use. Younger adults used more words related to physical aspects, more tentative language, and expressed themselves via higher status language (clout), while older adults used authentic language, i-talk, and words related to work, home, family, and religion. Topic modelling complemented the LIWC analyses and showed that younger adults primarily discussed topics of bodily and cognitive decline, and strategies of preventing aging, conveying concerns about, and negative stereotypes of aging. Older adults topicalized family reflections, openness to new experiences, and their social engagement, signaling a more positive outlook on (continued) aging.\nConclusion: Our complimentary word-count and word-co-occurrence language analyses of aging well construals revealed stark differences between younger and older adults’ perceptions of aging well, that raise important questions about intergenerational exchanges and communications about aging more broadly. Further, we found that aging construals of older adults are useful for estimating their future outlook, an important aspect of resilience against cognitive decline and possible entry point for targeted precision aging interventions.",

          "authors": "Jillian Jordan; David Gertler Rand",
          "abstract": "We investigate the replicability of prior work (Jordan et al., 2016) hypothesizing that “uncalculating cooperation” (i.e., cooperation without careful consideration of the costs and benefits) can signal an actor’s commitment to behaving prosocially, and thus trustworthiness. Jordan et al. found that subjects recruited from Amazon Turk make less calculating cooperative decisions when their decision-making process is observable to others, suggesting that uncalculating cooperation is used to signal trustworthiness. Moreover, Jordan et al. found that uncalculating cooperation is perceived as a signal of trustworthiness (subjects preferentially trust cooperators who made uncalculating, rather than calculating, decisions) and actually is a signal of trustworthiness (uncalculating cooperators actually behave in a more trustworthy manner). A recent replication effort (Holzmeister et al., 2024)—investigating the replicability of 26 studies with MTurk samples published in PNAS between 2015-2018—attempted to replicate the finding that observability increases uncalculating behavior, with mixed results (a significant effect in one, both not both, of two batches of data collection). However, subjects in both batches of Holzmeister et al. data, who were recruited directly from MTurk, performed relatively poorly on task comprehension questions compared to Jordan et al., 2016. We thus present results from an additional pre-registered replication of Jordan et al., 2016, conducted through the CloudResearch platform, that recruited a more attentive sample (comparable to the original study), as well as analyses drawing on all studies collected thus far. Together, we find strong evidence that uncalculating cooperation is used as, perceived as, and actually is a signal of trustworthiness, especially among attentive samples.",

          "authors": "Anastasia Kobzeva; Dave Kush",
          "abstract": "Children induce complex syntactic knowledge from their native language input. A long-standing discussion focuses on types of learning biases that help them arrive at correct generalization and solve induction problems posed by impoverished input. Studies employing computational models for learning specific language phenomena serve as testing grounds for evaluating types of biases required for successful acquisition. Recent work by Pearl and Sprouse (2013b) demonstrates that a distributional learner that tracks trigrams over structurally annotated input can acquire wh-filler-gap dependencies and island constraints on them in English. While intriguing, it is unclear yet whether a similar distributional learning model is a viable mechanism for learning island facts in other languages given the possibility of cross-linguistic variation. In this study, we explore whether a distributional learner can acquire wh- and relative clause filler-gap dependencies and island constraints in Norwegian from child-directed annotated text. We find that the proposed learning strategy can capture some patterns of island-insensitivity in Norwegian while failing to learn others due to a lack of relevant data in the input. Our findings suggest that given limited input data, a simple n-gram-based distributional learning over structured representations may not be sufficient to fully recover human-like knowledge of filler-gap dependency relations and island constraints cross-linguistically.",

          "abstract": "People have spontaneous intuitions about the acceptability of sentences. \"She gave me a book\" is acceptable in English but \"She gived I a book\" is not. These intuitions are critical for the scientific study of language and cognition in many ways. They are widely assumed to be outputs of an intuitive sense of grammaticalness, and this assumption has provided the basis for many influential research programs, over many decades. Here I describe this assumption as illusory. Linguistic intuitions are better explained as byproduct effects of humans’ intuitive sense of communicativeness. Precisely, sentences are unacceptable when there appears to be an inherent impossibility of interpreting them in any way consistent with the unconscious presumption of communicative efficiency that governs the interpretation of all stimuli perceived as communicative. As such, linguistic intuitions parallel the intuitions that accompany ‘impossible objects’: visual illusions in which stimuli appear as objects but cannot be interpreted in any way consistent with the unconscious presumptions that govern the interpretation of all stimuli perceived as objects. The communicativeness approach accounts for signature features of linguistic intuition more parsimoniously than the grammaticalness approach. A single general principle may govern all linguistic intuition, but that general principle is about communicativeness, not grammaticalness.",

Objective: This paper presents a Micro-phenomenological self-description of proprioceptive attention, with the objective of supporting the design of a future study that will use the Micro-phenomenological interview. Method: A micro-phenomenological self-interview was conducted by the author of this paper, with the intention of detecting how attention moves between different parts of the body. Results: The role of the throat and eye region in the orientation of this attention was observed, manifested through light tensions and movements that establish a kind of \"subtle internal posture\". In addition, associated sensations were identified, such as changes in breathing and general body state, which seem to derive from these initial actions. Discussion: To facilitate future participants to perceive the sensations associated with the identified attentional process, an orientation focused on breathing was proposed. This approach aims to promote indirect identification and familiarization with subtle movements and tensions in the throat region, without explicit instructions aimed directly at this area. Conclusion: Micro-phenomenological self-exploration revealed pre-reflexive actions that seem to play an important role in helping to guide proprioceptive attention. In addition, the additional sensations observed – especially related to breathing – offer subsidies to develop strategies that lead - without inducing - naïve participants to the perception of these subtle movements in a future study, which were expressed in the form of preparatory orientations.",

          "abstract": "AI-generated voices are increasingly prevalent in our lives, via virtual assistants, automated customer service, and voice-overs. With increased availability and affordability of AI-generated voices, we need to examine how humans perceive them. Recently, an intriguing effect was reported in AI-generated faces, where such face images were perceived as more human than images of real humans - a “hyperrealism effect.” Here, we tested whether a “hyperrealism effect” also exists for AI-generated voices. We investigated the extent to which AI voices sound real to human listeners, and whether listeners can accurately distinguish between human and AI voices. We also examined perceived social trait characteristics (trustworthiness and dominance) of human and AI voices. We tested these questions using AI voices generated with and without a specific human counterpart (i.e., voice clones/deep fakes, and voices generated from the latent space of a large voice model).\nWe find that deep fake voices can sound as real as human voices, making it difficult for listeners to distinguish between them. However, we did not observe a hyperrealism effect. Both types of AI-generated voices were evaluated as more dominant than human voices, with some AI voices also being perceived as more trustworthy.\nThese findings raise questions for future research: Can hyperrealistic voices be created with more advanced technology, or is the lack of a hyperrealism effect due to differences between voice and face (image) perception? Our findings also highlight the potential for AI voices to misinform and fraud, alongside opportunities to use realistic AI-generated voices for beneficial purposes.",

There is a critical need for a robust, reliable, and contemporary measure to identify populations at risk of avoiding HIV testing, treatment, and prevention, thereby supporting global HIV eradication goals. Method:  Focus groups informed the initial development of the HIV Anxiety Scale (HAS), revised through expert feedback. The factor structure was assessed in two studies. In Study 1, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted with 251 participants. In Study 2, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with 200 participants was performed alongside validity, internal consistency, and measurement invariance assessments. Findings: Studies 1 and 2 supported a 3-factor model, resulting in a 16-item measure with the following subscales: Psychosocial Implications of HIV, Lifestyle Implications of HIV, and HIV Testing Anxiety. The HAS demonstrated a good factor structure, acceptable validity and excellent internal consistency across diverse groups in Study 2. Conclusions: The HAS provides a contemporary, robust measure of HIV anxiety, addressing limitations of previous tools and contributing to efforts to identify and support populations at risk of HIV avoidance behaviours.",

One of the prominent examples is the push for green gaming. However, the movement has not successfully taken off. Academically, the term “green gaming” is being used interchangeably between other terms such as “ecological games,” or “ecogames.” The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to systematically examine the question of what is green gaming? Searching from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and other sources, the author have found 50 eligible documents of various types such as books, articles, doctoral theses. Systematic review of these documents highlights a sparse and understudied nature of the topic video games and environments. Moreover, there is also a lack of clear definition and distinction between various terminologies, which leads to the abovementioned interchanged use of different terminologies in both academic and public writings. In conclusion, the study suggests the term “green gaming” should be understood as an aspect of the green consumption movement.",

          "authors": "Alan Fraser",
          "abstract": "In this study, we investigate how varying levels of behavioural realism in two distinct avatars affect social interactions involving self-disclosure in virtual reality (VR). These two avatars involved an avatar using full-body and facial motion capture for a high level of behavioural realism and the other using basic tracking of VR headsets and controllers for a more basic level of behavioural realism. Fifty-seven participants interacted with these avatars, sharing positive and negative experiences in a reciprocal social interaction. Results showed that full-body and facial motion tracking was more preferred and rated higher in enjoyment, realism, and eye contact duration. However, some participants preferred the avatar with more basic behavioural realism. These differences in avatar preferences could be tied to an uncanny valley effect, where realistic human avatars with movement imperfections may cause discomfort for some people. These findings suggest that allowing users to choose their level of preferred realism may help improve engagement with VR avatars. Although avatars with higher realism are generally preferred, the avatars with lower levels of realism were still acceptable for most participants. Thus, lower levels of avatar realism may still be effective for VR therapy when affordability and accessibility are crucial.",

One strategy is self-handicapping, by which people deliberately impede their performance in order to protect or enhance perceived competence. Despite much prior research, it is unclear why, when, and how self-handicapping occurs. We develop a formal theory that chooses the optimal degree of self-handicapping based on its anticipated performance and signaling effects. We test the theory’s predictions in two experiments (𝑁 = 400), showing that self-handicapping occurs more often when it is unlikely to affect the outcome and when it increases the perceived competence in the eyes of a naive observer. With sophisticated observers (who consider whether a person chooses to self-handicap), self-handicapping is less effective when followed by failure. We show that the theory also explains the findings of several past studies. By offering a systematic explanation of self-handicapping, the theory lays the groundwork for developing effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "Executing go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses toward objects can increase people's choices of go over no-go items, and of approach over avoidance items. Some theoretical accounts explain these effects as the results of merely executing these responses (i.e., action execution), while others propose that these choice effects stem from interpreting these motor responses as valenced actions (i.e., action interpretation). To test the role of action execution versus action interpretation in both go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses, we employed a recently developed training that combined both dimensions orthogonally. Participants either pressed a key or not (i.e., go/no-go) to control a shopping cart on screen, to either collect or not collect certain food items (i.e., approach/avoidance). After the training, they repeatedly chose between food items (i.e., candies) for real consumption. When the instructions framed the responses as approach/avoidance actions, participants (N = 98) preferred approach items over avoidance items, but did not show preferences between go and no-go items in their choices. In contrast, when the instructions framed the responses as go/no-go actions, participants (N = 98) preferred go items over no-go items, but did not show preferences between approach and avoidance items. Despite making the same actual responses in both instruction groups, action interpretation determined whether go/no-go or approach/avoidance actions influenced food choice. Disambiguating the interpretation of motor responses as clearly valenced and meaningful actions may therefore be a fruitful way to maximize the effectiveness of response-based behavioral interventions.",

First, we reviewed and evaluated recent efforts to replicate past experiments testing the MS hypothesis, summarizing the conflicting evidence and arguments to the evidential value of the MS literature. Next, we performed a random effects meta-analysis on the MS literature using multiple bias correction meta-analytic techniques, including selection models, PET-PEESE, WAAP-WLS, as well as the more recently developed p-curve and z-curve. Overall, the different meta-analytic tools often pointed to conflicting conclusions, reflecting methodological and philosophical differences among these tools. A synthesis of our findings suggests there are nonzero effects underlying some studies of the MS hypothesis, although the effects are highly heterogeneous, most studies are underpowered, and many individual effects may be spurious. We recommend future replications to assume a smaller effect size (r = .18) and to strictly follow expert guidance in the experimental protocol. Given the conflicting findings that emerged, we suggest future attempts to evaluate other literatures would benefit from a multitool assessment approach.",

          "authors": "Jay Joseph",
          "abstract": "The author reviews University of Virginia psychology professor Eric Turkheimer’s 2024 book Understanding the Nature-Nurture Debate. Turkheimer has long been known for taking a critical position within the field of behavioral genetics. While mentioning several important limitations, Turkheimer upholds the validity of the heritability concept, twin studies, and adoption studies. The author notes that “heritability” is a disputed concept, and briefly describes what he sees as the invalidating aspects of behavioral and psychiatric genetic twin and adoption studies. He then reviews Turkheimer’s analysis of DNA-based (molecular genetic) behavioral research methods such as linkage, candidate gene, genome-wide association (GWAS), and polygenetic score (PGS) studies. The first two methods ended in failure. Although GWAS and PGS researchers have claimed many “gene-behavior associations,” Turkheimer shows that, after decades of attempts,  DNA-based research has failed to uncover genetic variants shown to cause human behavioral differences. Disagreements between Turkheimer and behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin are also examined. The author, though not Turkheimer, concludes that DNA-based research failure provides additional evidence that the critics of twin and adoption studies and accompanying heritability estimates were right all along and that the behavioral genetic paradigm is unraveling.  As behavioral genetics attempts to extricate itself from the failed causal gene discovery corner it has painted itself into, the social and behavioral sciences should begin work on a new environmentally focused post-behavioral genetics developmental paradigm. Understanding the Nature-Nurture Debate is worth a look, in part due to Turkheimer’s timely arguments against IQ hereditarianism and race science. At the same time, the author advises readers to be aware that the dual “heritability” mirages of twin and adoption studies inspired the DNA-based “genes for behavior and psychiatric disorders” fiasco in the first place.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of many visual art practices. Audiences, however, may have a bias against AI in visual art: knowing that AI was used to create art can broadly diminish their aesthetic experience. Whether this bias occurs structurally and across the systems involved in an aesthetic experience remains an open question. To address this, a systematic search and meta-analysis were conducted, categorising data under the sensory-motor (6 studies, 16 effect sizes), knowledge-meaning (27 studies, 94 effect sizes), and emotion-valuation (26 studies, 49 effect sizes) systems. The meta-analysis showed evidence for bias against AI in all three systems but with varying magnitudes of effect. Significant negative but small pooled effect sizes were observed for the sensory-motor and emotion-valuation systems, while a significant moderate negative pooled effect size was found for the knowledge-meaning system. Significant moderator analyses and residual heterogeneity suggest that the bias against AI in visual art is likely sensitive to specific conditions, rather than being a structural phenomenon. Herewith, this meta-analysis contributes novel insights into the bias against AI in visual art.",

In particular, we show that group judgments are more accurate than the average of a comparable number of individual judgments, and that group judgments can be as accurate as the judgments of the best individual member of the nominal groups (i.e., the person with the lowest judgment error). Additionally, our meta-analytic results substantiate two different mechanisms that lead to synergy in quantitative group judgment. On the one hand, group members can learn from each other and, thereby, increase their individual accuracy (G-I transfer). On the other hand, when controlling for G-I transfer, group members are also able to identify the more accurate judgments and assign more weight to them (differential weighting).",

          "abstract": "The human brain functions as a highly integrated system. Interconnected cellular and molecular networks within this system adaptively process sensory information, cognitive functions, and motor responses. This system also exhibits a remarkable potential for plasticity-driven adaptive learning and memory. Importantly, neuroplasticity serves as a key mechanism of neuroprotection, enabling the brain to compensate for injury through adaptive structural remodeling. Understanding the brain as a dynamic system requires examining how its components interact to produce adaptive physiological responses and complex behaviours, such as social interactions. Key molecules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin (OT), play pivotal roles in maintaining the brain's dynamic complexity and integrative functioning. In this review, we introduce the concept of neurosocial plasticity, which refers to the brain’s ability to adapt both neural circuitry and social behaviour through the dynamic interaction between BDNF and OT. This concept highlights how BDNF-OT collaboration may support both neural plasticity and the capacity for adaptive social functioning. We then explore how their co-localisation, co-expression, and co-regulation may regulate neural and social plasticity, ultimately shaping the brain’s adaptability and the development of social behaviours across various contexts.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing need for independent, ecologically valid research on prosocial design interventions within online platforms. Platform design has a significant impact on user interactions, yet independent researchers often lack access to live platforms, limiting the ecological validity of studies that test the effectiveness of prosocial interventions. In response, thirty-one experts from academia, industry, and civil society gathered for a workshop focused on understanding methods that enable effective research on design interventions that result in prosocial outcomes, such as healthy interactions and individual safety, wellbeing, and dignity. This paper synthesizes the workshop findings to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing prosocial design and to provide stakeholders—platforms, advocacy groups, and regulators—with evidence-based tools to promote healthy online behavior. First, we present an in-depth review of the dominant research methods in the field as identified in the workshop. Second, we highlight challenges that workshop participants agreed were most prominent, such as the constant 'reinvention of the wheel' for intervention testing, and recommend how to deal with them. Finally, we propose specific future actions to address challenges in the areas of knowledge sharing, events, and supporting infrastructure that experts consider most worth pursuing, laying out an agenda for future online prosocial research and investment.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study explores the self-regulation strategies and Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs) employed by individuals who successfully quit smoking unassisted, aiming to understand the processes behind their cessation journeys. \nMethods: A qualitative content analysis was conducted on semi-structured interviews with 32 unassisted quitters. Data were analyzed inductively to identify themes related to the challenges faced, and deductively to map strategies used onto existing frameworks, including the Process Model of Self-Regulation and the BCT Taxonomy. \nResults: Participants employed a variety of strategies to manage cravings and avoid smoking triggers, including changing their environments, diverting attention, reappraising situations, and leveraging social support. The analysis revealed that participants engaged in polyregulation, whereby they used multiple strategies concurrently. The most frequently used strategies were situation selection/modification (51.9%) and cognitive change (28.3%), with behavior substitution and habit reversal being common BCTs. \nConclusion: Unassisted quitters drew from a sophisticated array of strategies beyond the traditional notion of willpower, suggesting a “toolbox” approach to self-regulation and behavior change. These findings can inform public health policies and interventions to better support smoking cessation by promoting practical, learnable strategies for individuals attempting to quit without formal assistance.\n\nKeywords: Unassisted smoking cessation, self-regulation strategies, behavior change techniques, polyregulation, public health policy",

          "abstract": "There is extensive debate about the effects of social media use on wellbeing. Central to this debate is that evidence is lacking due to an inability to confirm causal pathways through experimental research. The rise of social media intervention experiments to tackle this issue has represented a positive change for the field. However, these studies are themselves encumbered by methodological issues, preventing a clear take-home message from this line of research. In the current paper we attempt to tackle this issue by highlighting to researchers what some of these issues are, and how they may design and interpret their research to allay or avoid such issues going forward.

          "abstract": "While pre-verbal infants may be sensitive to others’ mental states, they are not able to accurately answer questions about them until several years later, an ability referred to as having a theory of mind. Here we ask whether infant social-cognitive sensitivity is subserved by the same brain mechanisms as those that support theory of mind in childhood. To do so, we explored the relationship between functional sensitivity of the right temporal-parietal junction to mental state processing in infancy, a region known to underlie theory of mind in older children, and explicit theory of mind reasoning in the same group several years later. In a small initial sample (N=33), we find evidence of a longitudinal brain-behavioral link from infancy to childhood, providing preliminary support for a common mechanism for theory of mind across development. However, the brain metric that was predictive of individual differences was not the response to conditions that required tracking the beliefs, but instead, responses to a control condition where belief tracking was not obligatory to predict others’ behavior. In hindsight, the ambiguity of this control condition may have best distinguished between infants who had different propensities to engage in belief tracking, suggesting a potential role for active experience in infancy contributing to individual differences in later theory of mind development in childhood. Given the exploratory nature of the study, other alternative explanations for these results must also be considered.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to visualize things outside our field of view feels similar to our visual perception. Yet, perception arises from real-world sensory experiences, while imagery depends on mental representations. This raises important questions about whether imagery and perception involve distinct mechanisms, how similar latent spaces support semantic representations in imagery and perception, and the extent to which one’s imagery vividness and performance measures relate. To answer these questions, we employed a computerized battery prompting visual perception and visual mental imagery across five semantic domains: Colors, Faces, Letters, Maps, and Shapes. Seventy-five participants with typical imagery (based on their scores obtained from the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, VVIQ) completed this battery. On each trial, we recorded two imagery performance measures, accuracy and response times (RTs), and two subjective measures, vividness for the imagery and confidence for the perceptual trials. Two analyses suggested the existence of domain-specific processes that differentiate imagery from perception: (1) there is a difference in both performance measures among some domains (Color, Face, Map) but not others (Letters, Shapes); (2) the logistic regression models predicted domain-specific performance. Participants’ accuracy and RTs for imagery and perception were highly correlated, suggesting shared processes exist across these two modalities. Further, unsupervised clustering analysis revealed a latent space of four clusters, fewer than the 10 theoretically possible clusters (2 modalities × 5 domains). Last, we found that trial-by-trial vividness better predicted imagery performance than off-task VVIQ, indicating its more accurate reflection of an individual’s imagery performance.",

          "abstract": "The behavioral sciences have long studied how people make risky choices, yet it remains unclear to what degree the choices used by researchers (e.g., to develop and calibrate novel measurement tools) reflect those made by people in real life. To address this question, we compared risky choices in the focus of researchers' and laypeople's perspectives. In a first study, we examined the overlap between these perspectives by determining how many choices they have in common. Leveraging large language models and calibrating semantic similarities with human judgments, we found an overlap of only 18%. To further examine the implications of this mismatch in terms of the psychological mechanisms that these various choices may tap into, we conducted a second study in which 825 participants rated the perceived relevance of seven classes of psychological mechanisms to their decision making in choices from both perspectives. Bayesian mixed effects models revealed credible differences between the perspectives in five out of seven classes of mechanisms. These findings suggest that current theories of decision making may explain only a narrow scope of choices, underscoring the need for the behavioral sciences to realign their focus to better capture the complexity of real-life decision making.",

While prosody crucially aids the process of L1 acquisition, for adult L2 learners it is often considerably challenging. Is it because of an age-related decline of the language-learning ability or because of unfavourable learning conditions? We investigated whether adults can auditorily sensitise to the prosody of a novel language, and whether such sensitisation is affected by orthographic input. After 5 minutes of exposure to Māori, Czech listeners could reliably recognize this language in a post-test using low-pass filtered clips of Māori and Malay. Recognition accuracy was lower for participants exposed to the novel-language speech along with deep-orthography transcriptions or orthography with unfamiliar characters. Adults can thus attune to novel-language prosody, but orthography hampers this ability. Language-learning theories and applications may need to reconsider the consequences of providing orthographic input to beginning second-language learners.",

To study how these properties affect speech processing, researchers can create retimed experimental stimuli with varying temporal patterns. However, retiming speech also poses significant challenges, such as preserving naturalness, intelligibility, and prosody.\n\nIn this chapter, we present three methods of altering the acoustic speech signal to achieve a desired rhythmic structure. Each method differs in how it adjusts the timing of the utterance and its segments. The methods are used to create stimuli with regular isochronous stress. We evaluate the methods in terms of how much they disrupt the speech signal and how effective they are in achieving isochrony.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate how retiming can be used to produce stimuli with more naturalistic rhythmic characteristics. We show that retiming can be a powerful tool for exploring perceptual effects of timing in speech.",

Specifically, we tested the ability of N=105 Korean participants to categorize male faces into Korean, Japanese, or Chinese ethnicities - a categorization that according to participants​‌‌‍‍​‍’ own introspective opinion should be easily doable for them. Participants were split into two groups: one group (N=53) was shown cropped, grayscale images showing solely internal facial features, and the other (N=52) was shown faces including external features, including hair and full face outline. Our findings indicate categorization based on internal features only was barely above chance level, whereas external features resulted in more reliable above-chance performance - albeit at a low overall level of around 52%. Our study emphasizes the importance of external features in the accurate categorization of ethnic backgrounds, and establishes an overall low ability of Koreans to reliably distinguish between East Asian ethnicities.",

To date, there has been no conclusive analysis of the cross-cultural and cross-temporal comparability of the values. We conduct invariance tests of the Portrait Values Questionnaire collected as part of the European Social Survey (ESS) with 261 samples and responses from 443,655 participants from 2002 to 2024. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we found that the theoretical value model fits the overall data well, as we obtained both configural and metric invariance. Ignoring temporal information, pooling the data across all years, correlations and mean patterns of values can be compared across countries. However, when testing individual country samples collected in specific years and rounds, we found evidence of poor fit even to just the theoretical structure without imposing any equality constraints which implies that results from specific samples may not be directly comparable across countries. Considering cross-temporal invariance, only 17 out of 35 countries with multiple participation in the ESS showed metric invariance and a number of countries did not show even configural invariance (implying the conceptualization of values has changed over the period). Exploring systematic changes in model fit, we found some evidence that the fit of the theoretical model has deteriorated over time.",

          "abstract": "There is a debate about statistical models for analyzing longitudinal data. Models based on cross-lagged effects may give false positive results under certain conditions. We have proposed a triangulation method where cross-lagged effects of a predictor (X) on a subsequent score on an outcome (Y2) when adjusting for a prior score (Y1) are scrutinized by estimating a reversed effect of X on Y1 when adjusting for Y2 and an effect of X on the Y2-Y1 difference. Lucas et al. (2024) conducted simulations and reported that our triangulation method may flag genuine causal effects of X on Y2 when adjusting for Y1 as spurious and concluded that the triangulation method is not valid. Here we respond to this criticism. We show that the simulations and conclusions by Lucas et al. are focused on the ability of the test to avoid type II errors. Here we complement this view with a discussion about type I errors. Further, we show that the criticism by Lucas et al. appears to be founded on a view that causality is best analyzed as an adjusted between-individual difference. We argue that causality is best assumed to operate, and to be analyzed, within rather than between individuals. Therefore, we continue to claim that our triangulation method may be a useful tool to scrutinize causal claims based on adjusted cross-lagged effects.",

          "abstract": "The development of formal models of decision making under risk has been shaped largely\nby decisions between options with monetary outcomes. The most prominent\nmodel—cumulative prospect theory (CPT)—is good at describing choices between\nmonetary lotteries, but performs less well with nonmonetary and nonnumerical outcomes\n(e.g., medications with possible side effects). We suggest that affective processes, which are\nnot considered in CPT, play a larger role in nonmonetary than in monetary choices, and\npropose two psychologically motivated modifications to CPT’s modeling framework to\ncapture these differences: (a) using affect ratings rather than monetary equivalents to\nrepresent the subjective value of nonmonetary outcomes (affective valuation); and (b)\nallowing the probability weighting of an outcome to depend on the amount of affect\ntriggered in a choice problem (affective probability weighting). We compared model variants\nof CPT implementing the proposed modifications in four empirical datasets (total\nN = 240). For choices between options with negative nonmonetary outcomes (medications\nwith possible side effects), these modifications substantially improved model performance\nrelative to the standard implementation of CPT. The same did not hold for monetary\nchoices. Further, an eye-tracking study on nonmonetary choice (N = 68) provided evidence\nfor two key behavioral and cognitive predictions of affective probability weighting—namely,\nthat risk aversion increases and attention to probability information decreases as the\naffective value of the worst outcome in a choice problem increases.

          "abstract": "The emerging field of Metabolic Psychiatry has brought mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction into focus in bipolar disorder research. In this manuscript we highlight the preserved evolutionary roots of mechanisms of metabolic adaptation and their interaction with established mechanisms of circadian dysfunction in bipolar disorder. \n\nThroughout evolutionary history, selective pressures in the environment caused many biological organisms to develop patterns of seasonal metabolic adaptation. States of hypometabolism, characterised by reduced basal metabolic rate, suppression of insulin signalling and glucose metabolism, suppressed circadian rhythmicity, and increased reliance on fatty acid and ketone body metabolism were adaptive during states such as torpor and hibernation. Conversely, seasonal hypermetabolic states were advantageous for survival in scenarios such as migration, where increased fatty acid metabolism was also a critical component of physiological adaptations. The mechanisms underpinning these metabolic changes are intricately interlinked with circadian systems, which are responsive to changes in photoperiod and drive patterns of seasonal adaptation. \n\nWhile humans have been largely removed from the selective pressures of our evolutionary predecessors, similar chrono-metabolic mechanisms underlying seasonal adaptation are preserved in human biology, and play important roles in tuning metabolism to environmental cues. In this manuscript we highlight evolutionarily preserved metabolic and circadian mechanisms which are implicated in bipolar disorder pathophysiology, and we compare these to mechanisms which have mediated seasonal metabolic adaptation throughout evolutionary history.",

          "abstract": "Characterising the neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic defensive behavior remains a significant challenge. While substantial progress has been made in unraveling the neural basis of specific behaviors, a critical gap persists in our comprehension of the circuits that implement algorithms capable of generating the diverse defensive responses observed outside experimental constraints. Recent advancements in neuroscience technology now allow for an unprecedented examination of naturalistic behaviour. To guide this nascent experimental programme, this article summarises the main computational and statistical challenges of defensive decision making, encapsulated in the concept of critical intelligence. Next, drawing from an extensive literature in biology, machine learning, and decision theory, we explore a range of candidate solutions to these challenges. While the proposed solutions offer insights into potential adaptive strategies, they also present inherent trade-offs and limitations in their applicability across different biological contexts. Ultimately, we propose series of experiments designed to differentiate between these candidate solutions, providing a roadmap for future investigations into the fundamental defensive algorithms utilized by biological agents and their neural implementation. Thus, our work aims to provide a roadmap towards broader understanding of how complex defensive behaviors are orchestrated in the brain, with implications for both neuroscience research and the development of more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems.",

Evidence suggests that long-term heavy use of cannabis is negatively associated with important cognitive functions related to executive functioning, attention, and working memory, learning, and memory. Previous findings link the early onset of cannabis use to more extensive cognitive alterations. However, significant inconsistencies exist across studies. \nMethod: In this cross-sectional study, we examined associations between cannabis use and cognitive performance across a broad range of cognitive tests (including a new test of visuo-spatial abilities, The Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test) in a sample of 109 Danes aged 15-26 with varying risk of developing harmful cannabis use and varying levels of current use. Cannabis use was evaluated using the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test-Revised (CUDIT-R) and questions on recent use (past 30 days) and age of onset. Cognitive performance was assessed using subtests from WAIS-IV, WMS-III, and the Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test. \nResults: Findings show a negative association between recent cannabis use and specific cognitive functions of working memory and visual memory, while the CUDIT-R was not associated with cognitive functions. \nConclusion: Our findings nuance previous findings by suggesting differences in vulnerability across cognitive domains, while providing the first evidence of a negative association between recent cannabis use and visual memory based on visuo-spatial functions without requiring visuo-constructive abilities (Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test). Furthermore, findings suggest that past-month use may be a more relevant measure than CUDIT-R when evaluating cognitive correlates of cannabis use in youth. This has implications for treatment and preventive interventions in this age group.",

Little is known regarding the implementation and effectiveness of FN for children with autism. The aims of this scoping review are to: (1) summarize the breadth, quantity, and characteristics of the existing literature on FN for children diagnosed with autism; (2) describe the models and outcomes of FN for this population; and (3) identify knowledge gaps and provide directions for future research.\n\nMethods: Authors used the Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework for scoping reviews. Searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Social Services Abstracts, and Web of Science, resulting in identification of 479 papers. Two independent raters completed title/abstract and full text screening, followed by extraction of pertinent data using a researcher-developed tool. Synthesis of results involved content and constructs analysis and descriptive numerical summaries.\n\nResults: 17 publications met inclusion criteria. Seven studies evaluated FN programs delivered by a professional or peer navigator. Three studies assessed FN tools. Overall, the studies reported positive impacts on family activation, family well-being, parental knowledge, and service utilization. Navigator programs were generally found to be feasible and acceptable. However, none of the navigator programs addressed their effect on wait times to services or child-specific outcomes. \n\nConclusion: FN is a promising intervention for improving family outcomes and increasing service utilization. Further research is needed to establish best practices, identify child- and family-centered outcome metrics, and promote scalability and sustainability.",

          "abstract": "Flowers provide a rich stimulus set to estimate the extent to which basic visual features predict aesthetic appeal and visual interest. We selected images of 70 different gerbera flowers representative of those available to the cut flower industry. These were described by dimensions capturing the salient variation among the flowers. These descriptors are broadly categorised into those representing perceptual qualities, computational measures of texture, and chromatic features. Our analyses involved relating these descriptors to ratings of the “appeal” and “interest” of the flowers. 1056 participants rated the appeal of each flower while 1194 participants rated both appeal and interest on an 11-point scale via an online experiment. A general linear model including the descriptors showed good agreement with the observed appeal and interest ratings. Additionally, both ratings correlate with each other. The predictive performance of reduced forms of the model showed the smallest model capable of equal performance with the full model was that containing only perceptual qualities (‘complexity’, ‘depth’, ‘pointiness’, ‘symmetry’, and ‘target-patterning’). Both the appeal and visual interest of these complex floral stimuli can be predicted by a reduced set of features relevant to basic visual perception, showing the importance of visual features for aesthetic processing of natural stimuli.",

Changes in pupil diameter (PD) are thought to reflect changes in locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC/NE) activity, which is associated with cognitive and behavioral optimization. Here, we present novel algorithms to decompose the pupil signal into its tonic and phasic components. We evaluate the utility and validity of the algorithms using both artifically generated data and an existing dataset from a fast-paced finger-tapping task. Results show that the novel algorithm outperforms traditional approaches on simulated data. We further demonstrate that the novel algorithm provides more conclusive evidence for relationships between mind wandering reports and pupil predictors compared to traditional window-averaging. Finally, we show that the novel and traditional estimates contain different information with regards to neuroimaging correlates and task performance.",

          "abstract": "Real-world decision-making often involves navigating large action spaces with state-dependent action values, taxing the limited cognitive resources at our disposal. While previous studies have explored cognitive constraints on generating action consideration sets or refining state-action mappings (policy complexity), their interplay remains underexplored. In this work, we present a resource-rational framework for policy compression that integrates both constraints, offering a unified perspective on decision-making under cognitive limitations. Through simulations, we characterize the suboptimality arising from reduced action consideration sets and reveal the complex interaction between policy complexity and action consideration set size in mitigating this suboptimality. \nWe then use such normative insight to explain empirically observed phenomena in option generation, including the preferential sampling of generally valuable options and increased correlation in responses across contexts under cognitive load. We further validate the framework's predictions through a contextual multi-armed bandit experiment, showing how humans flexibly adapt their action consideration sets and policy complexity to maintain near-optimality in a task-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for fine-grained resource constraints in understanding human cognition, and highlights the presence of adaptive metacognitive strategies even in simple tasks.",

          "abstract": "Behavioural addictions, characterised by compulsive engagement in rewarding activities despite adverse consequences in the long term, are more heterogeneous and less well-understood than substance addictions, and there is a relative lack of translational research. This study investigates \"excessive toy motivation\" in domestic dogs as a potential parallel to behavioural addictions in humans. Employing a combination of a behavioural test and an owner questionnaire, we examined whether a subset of highly play-motived dogs meet key behavioural addiction criteria including craving, salience, lack of self-control, and mood modification. Data from 105 highly play-motivated dogs revealed that 33 subjects exhibited behaviours consistent with addictive-like tendencies, including an excessive fixation on toys, reduced responsiveness to alternative stimuli, and persistent efforts to access toys. Owner-reported behaviours not only corroborated these findings but also demonstrated significant associations with behavioural test scores. Our results highlight parallels between excessive toy motivation in dogs and human behavioural addictions, with dogs as the only non-human species so far that appears to develop addictive-like behaviours \"naturally\" without artificial induction. This exploratory study provides foundational insights and proposes future research directions that have the potential to significantly deepen our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying behavioural addictions across species.",

However, how male and female heavy drinkers employ different protective behavioral strategies with respect to their drinking motives, and whether these impact drinking patterns differentially, are currently understudied.\n\nMethods: We analyzed data from 109 college student participants (ages 18–21; 51.4% female) with problem drinking to examine associations between drinking motives, protective behavioral strategies, and their interaction on drinking outcomes. We also assessed moderation by sex in our analyses.\n\nResults: Across all measures, men reported significantly higher values for total drinks, drinking days, drinks per drinking day, some types of protective behavioral strategies (i.e., limiting/stopping alcohol use, harm reduction), and enhancement-related drinking motives. Key findings from linear regression models indicated that drinking motives and protective behavioral strategies were differentially associated with various drinking outcomes and sex as main effects and in interactions. \n\nConclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of examining sex differences in alcohol-related behaviors, cognitions, and outcomes among college students. This work demonstrates the nuance and complexity of such alcohol-related factors, and for whom they are most relevant (i.e., males or females). As such, findings from the current study may inform the development of more targeted alcohol use prevention and interventions efforts on college campuses.",

Hybrid search involves two stages: visual search for possible targets to select and then memory search for a matching target. In two studies, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of a common feature across targets (e.g., “red” if searching for tomato sauce and a can of Campbell’s soup) will facilitate hybrid search by allowing a single feature to be extracted and used to guide attention during the visual search stage. In experiment 1, we confirmed that the common target color could be prioritized over other target colors during visual search (1a) and that this effect could not be accounted for by repetitions of target color across trials (1b). In experiment 2, we manipulated the memory set size and the presence of a common color on every trial and found main effects of each, but no interaction, suggesting additive effects on hybrid search. There were also individual differences in the ability to use the common color. Together the data indicate that the presence of a common target feature can be strategically exploited to create a more efficient target template, but the ability to do so varies across individuals.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the impact of service quality on customer satisfaction within the banking sector in Quetta, Balochistan. Service quality is a critical determinant of customer satisfaction, which in turn influences customer loyalty, retention, and the overall success of banks. The research examines key dimensions of service quality—tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy—and their relationship with customer satisfaction. It also highlights the role of employee satisfaction in enhancing service quality and improving customer experiences. Given the unique socio-economic and cultural context of Quetta, the study investigates how local factors such as infrastructure, demographic diversity, and cultural expectations shape the banking service delivery. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods, including surveys of bank customers and employees, is employed to gather data. The findings suggest that service quality, particularly in areas like responsiveness, reliability, and assurance, plays a significant role in shaping customer satisfaction. Additionally, employee satisfaction is shown to have a positive impact on the quality of service provided to customers. The study concludes with recommendations for banks in Quetta to invest in employee training, enhance infrastructure, and tailor their services to the specific needs of the local population in order to improve overall customer satisfaction. This research contributes to the understanding of service quality dynamics in emerging markets, particularly in underrepresented regions like Balochistan.",

          "abstract": "Bereavement poses a significant mental health risk in later life, yet many older adults show resilience. This study, based on the Dual Process Model (DPM) of coping with bereavement, investigated how psychological and social factors pertaining to loss- and restoration-oriented processes predict geriatric depression trajectories following spousal loss. Using eight waves of data from the 2006-2020 Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLoSA), this study analyzed 510 individuals who experienced spousal loss during the 14-year period. Longitudinal multilevel modeling showed that time alone did not predict decreases in depression. Instead, sudden loss and higher baseline depression led to increased depression, whereas greater informal social engagement (meeting friends), older age, better general health, and economic satisfaction were associated with lower depression. Notably, the effects of sudden loss and baseline depression decreased over time. Consistent with the DPM, loss-oriented processes, such as sudden loss, predict short-term outcomes, while restoration-oriented processes, particularly informal social engagement, facilitate long-term adaptation. Highlighting the heterogeneity of depression trajectories among Korean older adults, this study suggests the importance of evaluating both individual differences and changes to effectively address geriatric depression following spousal loss.",

          "abstract": "Fear can significantly increase the experienced pain intensity in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain and limit their ability to engage in daily activities. Fear of movement-related pain (FMRP) is commonly assessed via self-report, but research suggests measuring psychophysiological or behavioral parameters as an alternative. The objective of this scoping review was to identify and evaluate existing paradigms to induce FMRP, as well as the psychophysiological, behavioral and neural measurements used for its assessment. Experimental studies, with adult participants (≥18 years, healthy and chronic pain) observing or performing movements were included if they used a FMRP induction paradigm or measured psychophysiological and behavioral proxies of FMRP. A total of 1883 studies were screened; 34 eligible studies were included. Paradigms inducing FMRP involved anticipated pain paired with movement (via classical or operant conditioning) or elicited pre-existing FMRP through the observation of movements potentially associated with pain. The identified studies employed various psychophysiological and behavioral measures indicating FMRP, such as response latency/duration, decision-making behavior, eyeblink startle response, and autonomic nervous system responses (e.g., skin conductance, heart rate, respiratory rate), as well as neural correlates (fMRI). fMRI studies revealed activation in fear- and pain-processing brain areas that correlated with patient-reported measurements (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus, lateral orbitofrontal cortex). Among the psychophysiological and behavioral measures displaying significant differences between fear-evoking, and neutral conditions, heart rate, respiratory response, skin conductance, and eyeblink-startle response demonstrated the largest effect sizes. In conclusion, physiological reactions can be measured during imagined, observed, or performed movements as a proxy for FMRP.",

Out-of-scanner variables tested as predictors were age, self-reported inhibition ability (Behavior Rating of Executive Function (BRIEF)), tic severity (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS)), and tic suppression ability (Tic Suppression Task, TST). In-scanner head motion was measured as the amount of time framewise displacement was &amp; &lt;0.2 mm. Almost all participants (92%) had sufficient amounts of usable resting state data (≥5 minutes at FD &lt;0.2 mm) without re-scanning or other adjustments. Younger age, lower inhibitory control, and lower tic frequency when attempting to suppress during the TST predicted increased motion in the scanner. Tic severity (YGTSS total severity score) did not significantly predict motion.

This study used an image choice task to test three key factors—category templates, threat, and utility—believed to influence people's preferences within the CSR framework. The study had three main goals: (1) to refine previous CSR research by providing a more accurate, empirically scaled measure of these three factors using the image choice task; (2) to assess how each factor affected participants' image preferences; and (3) to explore any interactions between these factors. In a pilot study, we first quantified the threat and utility levels for each image stimulus. Our main study found that, contrary to some previous findings, category templates significantly influenced image preferences, though not in the hierarchy proposed by traditional CSR models. Threat and utility also had independent, significant effects on preferences. However, category templates had the strongest influence on participant choices. The effects of threat and utility varied depending on whether the influence of category templates was accounted for. These findings support certain CSR theories but challenge the proposed hierarchical structure. We also confirmed some previous findings, clarified the relative impact of the three factors, and provided empirical measures of template typicality, utility, and threat for future research.",

          "abstract": "Background: The distressing nature of delusional beliefs is considered key to their persistence. One potential mechanism underlying delusional distress is global emotion dysregulation, which refers to a broad deficit in overall emotion regulation and emotional functioning. Global emotion dysregulation is associated with general psychotic symptom severity, but its specific relationship to delusional distress has yet to be closely examined.  \n\nMethods: People with (n = 100) and without (n = 52) schizophrenia-spectrum disorders completed measures of delusional ideation (Peters Delusion Inventory; PDI-21) and global emotion dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DERS-16). Participants with schizophrenia also completed a measure of delusion severity (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales; PSYRATS). Relationships between delusion severity and global emotion dysregulation were assessed with linear regression, controlling for age, sex, and group. Associations between delusional distress and specific aspects of emotion dysregulation were determined using stepwise linear regression.   \n\nResults: Global emotion dysregulation was significantly elevated in those with schizophrenia compared to healthy comparison participants, across all subscales (p&lt;.001). Global emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with delusional distress on both the PDI-21 (p&lt;.001) and PSYRATS (p&lt;.001). Stepwise regression revealed a specific association between limited access to emotion regulation strategies and delusional distress on both scales (p’s&lt;.001). Delusional distress remained associated with emotion dysregulation when controlling for delusional preoccupation, and emotion dysregulation was not significantly associated with delusional conviction on either scale.  \n\nConclusions: Emotion dysregulation, particularly the sense that there is little one can do to regulate themselves when upset, relates to delusional distress. Interventions that increase access to more emotion regulation strategies may help decrease distress associated with delusional thinking.",

The preliminary item pool covered eight conceptual domains: Conflict, Attachment-related Dissociation, Attachment Phobia, Victim, Compulsive Savior, Dangerous Self, Revengeful Perpetrator, and Sadistic Perpetrator. The items were subsequently analyzed through two pilot studies. After revising the items according to the results, the final item pool underwent Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), and convergent and incremental validity studies in a general sample of 407 Italian adults. The EFA supported the eight-factor structure. The convergent validity analysis demonstrated excellent convergent and predictive validity across all questionnaire domains, except for two domains (Compulsive Savior, Sadistic Perpetrator) that did not exhibit good performance and were subsequently removed. This led to a final structure of six subscales and 28 total items, confirmed in a further EFA. Regarding incremental validity, the AATQ performed better than a popular fearful/disorganized attachment measure (Adult Disorganized Attachment scale) and a standard measure of adult attachment (Emotions in Close Relationships) in predicting traumatic and pathological outcomes.",

Intellectual humility involves an accurate understanding of the limitations and imperfections of one’s knowledge and cognitive capabilities during the acquisition of new information. Being intellectually humble enables individuals to not feel threatened in the face of disagreements and leads to an openness in learning about alternative viewpoints. We investigated the relationship between intellectual humility and well-being in an exploratory study and a pre-registered replication (total N = 898). Results indicated that intellectual humility relates to higher meaning in life and flourishing, and lower levels of anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. Independence of Intellect and Ego, a key component of intellectual humility that captures the healthy separation between one’s cognitive abilities and identity, appears to be the primary driver of these associations. Finally, these associations were robust to controlling for other factors (such as trait levels of agreeableness and modesty), indicating a consistent association between specific components of intellectual humility and positive and negative mental health outcomes.",

Parents need evidence-based advice on specific feeding practices, such as distraction techniques and portioning, that can be used to reduce children’s intake of high energy-dense snacks. This experimental laboratory study tested the effectiveness of these feeding practices. Parents and children (3-5 years; N=129) who were identified as having an avid or typical eating profile were recruited and randomly allocated to one of three conditions. Following a standardised meal, children’s energy intake (measured in kilocalories) in the absence of hunger was assessed. While children had access to a snack buffet, parents were asked to use one of the following feeding practices: (1) Distract – using distraction techniques to delay children’s snack intake; (2) Portion – allowing children to have snacks from pre-portioned pots; or (3) Control – allowing children to eat the type and number of snacks that their child wanted to. Results showed that children in the distraction condition consumed significantly less energy from snacks compared to children in the portion or control conditions. Energy intake in the portion and control conditions was not significantly different. There was also no difference in energy intake between children with avid versus typical eating profiles. These findings suggest that parental use of distraction techniques may be effective for reducing children’s intake of high energy-dense snacks and could be recommended for use to support the development of children’s healthy eating behaviour. Further research to examine the effectiveness of distraction in real-world settings is now needed.",

This study introduces a novel ambiguous motion stimulus: A line segment elongating with a disc at its end, perceived as either “a disc pulling an elastic band” or “a rigid stick pushing a disc.” Across three experiments (n=138 young adults), causal and material judgments were strongly influenced by acceleration and deceleration patterns. Four follow-up experiments (n=120) using a pause- detection task revealed participants’ sensitivity to dynamics incompatible with the expected behavior of a stretched elastic band, underscoring the visual system’s integration of kinematic patterns into coherent perceptual interpretations. These findings demonstrate how subtle kinematic manipulations can entirely reverse perceived force dynamics, causal roles, and material properties in sync, advancing a unified framework for material and causal perception.",

          "abstract": "This commentary engages with Fleming and Shea's (2024) recent work on computational functionalist theories of consciousness through a structural lens. We address three key aspects: the role of subjective experience in theory building, the hypothesis regarding local lateral connectivity in sensory areas, and the implications of \"silent units\" for consciousness. We argue that while their structural turn is welcome, many of their insights were previously predicted by Integrated Information Theory (IIT). We question the coherence of these claims within the functionalist paradigm and emphasize the importance of distinguishing genuine predictions from post-hoc accommodations in consciousness science.",

As a novel psychometric method, multiple psychometric properties of psychometric modeling have been compared to factor analysis models. However, compared to scoring in factor analysis and classical test theory, the scoring method in psychometric network modeling is not well examined. Thus, this study aims to propose novel network scoring methods and compare them to factor scores.  In this study, we first proposed the general form of network scoring and conducted two simulation studies and one empirical study to examine the performance of different network scores. The results of this study suggest that non-regularized network scores performed better than regularized network scores and factor scores under certain conditions, especially non-regularized network scores with node strength and hybrid centrality. The limitations and future directions are also discussed.",

Here, we provide an overview of genetic conflict theory, summarize the changes in pregnancy complications during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide insight into how the public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic potentially influenced the genetic conflict that underlies these pregnancy complications.",

          "abstract": "Psychotic disorders are a class of heterogeneous disorders for which there is evidence of numerous structural and functional brain abnormalities. One proposed neural marker for psychosis is a disruption in white matter, the structural architecture for connectivity throughout the brain. The role of white matter integrity, often measured via Fractional Anisotropy (FA), has played a controversial role in individuals with a first episode of psychosis (FEP), with some finding widespread white matter deficits and others finding no significant differences between FEP and controls. Similarly, some FEP studies have observed that higher FA is associated with better verbal memory, but others failed to find such an association. Studying the early stages of psychosis represents a promising avenue to overcome previous confounding factors and characterize the disease in its early clinical stages.\nEighty individuals with a FEP were recruited from a specialized early intervention program for psychosis alongside 55 non-clinical controls from the community matched for age and sex. Both groups were followed and scanned 4 times: at baseline (within 3 months after program entry), 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. TBSS were used on 3.0 Tesla diffusion-weighted images to extract fractional anisotropy values for white matter regions of interest in accordance with the JHU white-matter tractography atlas. The analysis revealed no significant main effect of group or time, and no significant associations between FA and verbal memory. Fractional anisotropy is still within normal ranges 18 months after the onset of FEP with no substantial differences between groups or over time.\nKeywords: Diffusion, fractional anisotropy, schizophrenia spectrum, cognition, neuroimaging",

          "abstract": "Instrumental music has been recognized for its therapeutic potential, particularly in reducing agitation and distress in individuals with a history of psychosis. In the medical context, numerous studies have highlighted the efficacy of music therapy in alleviating symptoms of psychosis. However, a comprehensive review of this body of work is limited. Till date, there have only been six systematic reviews identified, with just two conducted in the past eight years. This systematic literature review aims to consolidate and discuss current findings on the effect of instrumental music in managing psychotic episodes. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a search across five major databases – ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, DOAJ, and Google Scholar – resulting in the identification of 12 peer-reviewed studies for inclusion. Key topics explored in this review include: (1) the efficacy of instrumental music in reducing psychotic triggers across different demographic groups; (2) its impact on various forms of clinical psychosis; (3) the influence of music duration on treatment outcomes; (4) the comparative effectiveness of different genres of instrumental music; and (5) theoretical frameworks that underpin the therapeutic mechanisms of music in psychosis management. The findings support the potential of instrumental music as an adjunctive therapy in reducing psychotic symptoms, with implications for both clinical practice and future research. Further longitudinal studies are recommended, particularly those involving diverse population groups and extended follow-up periods, to better understand the sustained impact of music therapy on psychosis, both during clinical treatment and post-discharge.",

          "abstract": "The decision sciences have long striven to measure and model how people perceive uncertainty in specific choice situations. In the latter, people may be confronted with two types of uncertainty—epistemic and aleatory uncertainty—and in principle these may occur independently of each other. But how specific are people’s subjective perceptions thereof? And how are they related to perceptions of general uncertainty? We aimed to address these and related questions by reconciling different approaches to inducing and measuring perceptions of epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Specifically, we conducted a study with a 2 (epistemic uncertainty: low vs. high) x 2 (aleatory uncertainty: low vs. high) x 2 (choice modality: described choice scenarios vs. incentivized monetary lotteries) mixed experimental design (N = 185). The key results suggest that people’s perceptions of epistemic and aleatory uncertainty are strongly correlated and that both types of uncertainty are associated with the perception of general uncertainty. Additionally, learning about choice options in decisions from experience was associated with reduced epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Finally and at a more practical level, a novel and frugal measurement tool consisting of only two items achieved the same (and in some conditions an even better) performance as compared to the established but lengthier Epistemic Aleatory Rating Scale (Ülkümen et al., 2016). Overall, these findings provide insights on how to study epistemic and aleatory uncertainty with incentivized tasks and choice scenarios, as well as how to measure subjective perceptions of these types of uncertainty. As such the current study contributes to the conceptual debate on the structure of uncertainty perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Motor learning is proposed to be associated with a minimization or optimization of physical and cognitive resources. Effort involves the voluntary investment of resources for task performance. While these two constructs are intrinsically linked, their relationship has never been empirically examined. This study aimed to investigate how the perception of effort evolves throughout the motor learning process. Thirty young adults volunteered in this study. In a within-subject design, each participant had four visits to perform 10 blocks of a continuous tracking task on each visit. The sequences within these blocks were either random (control condition) or repeated (experimental condition). Following each block, participants rated the intensity of the effort invested to perform the task. Sequence-specific motor learning was observed, with the repeated outperforming the random sequence condition at the retention test. Perception of effort decreased with sequence-specific motor learning, which was not observed during practice of the random sequences. Our findings suggest that motor sequence learning reduces perceived effort. Thus, as sequence-specific task proficiency increases, individuals find the task less effortful. This link between learning a motor task and effort perception presents valuable opportunities for future research to investigate the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying motor learning and effort.",

However, self-report measures of this ability are extremely scarce. The current study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the EC scale within the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ), the only available self-report measure of EC in middle childhood. Participants were 441 Italian children (53.7% girls) aged between 7.9-10 (Mage = 9.05, SD = 0.56). A series of confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor lower order structure, whereas evidence for the intended 1-factor higher order structure was not found. Structural equation modeling confirmed convergent validity of the questionnaire with theoretically related constructs such as self-worth, emotional-behavioral problems, and prosocial behavior, and confirmed inhibitory control and attentional focusing as core aspects of EC. Overall, the EC scale is a valuable tool for assessing temperament-based self-regulation in middle childhood using four separate scores, but reliability analyses suggest the need for refinement, and more research is needed to clarify its hierarchical structure in the TMCQ.",

This paper investigates the detrimental effects of food insecurity on early childhood development, focusing on physical, cognitive and behavioural development. The critical years of life, first 1000 days are important for child’s brain and body development, therefore nutritional deficiencies can lead to stunted growth, weakened immunity and cognitive impairment such as poor memory due to low iron. Furthermore, food insecurity is associated with behavioural changes in children such as externalizing behaviours like aggression and internalizing behaviours like anxiety. This paper also highlights the need for thorough strategies such as government policies, community level initiatives and educational programs for parents to address and increase awareness about food insecurity. By incorporating these interventions that improve food accessibility, we can support developmental requirements of at-risk children. Further research is suggested to develop targeted solutions, to avoid lasting impacts on health and development in children. \nKeywords: Food insecurity, Nutritional Deficiency, Cognitive impairment, Child health, Parental Education.",

Here, we formally introduce an extension to the MELSM, a Spike and Slab\nMixed-Effects Location Scale Model (SS-MELSM), for simultaneously modeling location\nand scale parameters while incorporating a spike and slab prior to select or shrink random\neffects. Our approach involves identifying clusters with unusually large or small\nwithin-cluster variance in academic achievement, which can indicate overly inconsistent or\nconsistent academic achievement.

Moreover, we show how to compare models with varying\nparameters regarding expected predictive accuracy. The results demonstrate that the\nSS-MELSM successfully identifies schools with unusually high and low consistency in\nmathematics achievement and that school- and student-level SES were relevant covariates\nwhen modeling the location and scale components.

We repeated this procedure for 5 times in Exp 1, and 12 times in Exp 2 and 3. Interestingly, we discovered that individual differences in working memory continually predicted LTM accuracy across all repetitions. In Experiment 4, we replicated the stable working memory demands with word pairs. In Experiment 5, we generalized the stable working memory demands model to attentional control abilities.

          "abstract": "A central goal of research in perceptual decision making is to determine the internal computations underlying choice and confidence in complex, multi-alternative tasks. However, revealing these computations requires knowledge of the internal representation upon which the computations operate. Unfortunately, it is unknown how traditional stimuli (e.g., Gabor patches and random dot motion) are represented internally, which calls into question the computations inferred when using such stimuli. Here we develop a new behavioral paradigm where subjects discriminate the dominant color in a cloud of differently colored dots. Critically, we show that the internal representation for these stimuli can be described with a simple, one-parameter equation and that a single free parameter can explain multi-alternative data for up to 12 different conditions. Further, we use this paradigm to test three popular theories: that confidence reflects (1) the probability of being correct, (2) only choice-congruent (i.e., positive) evidence, or (3) the evidence difference between the highest and the second-highest signal. The predictions of the first two theories were falsified in two experiments involving either six or 12 conditions with three choices each. We found that the data were best explained by a model where confidence is based on the difference of the two alternatives with the largest evidence. These results establish a new paradigm in which a single parameter can be used to determine the internal representation for an unlimited number of multi-alternative conditions and challenge two prominent theories of confidence computation.",

Specifically, expressions for a comprehensive assessment of introversion in a linear model and the posterior probability of the econometric (scientometric) degree of introversion in a Bayesian model are formulated.\n\tThe models are based on several econometric (scientometric) hypotheses regarding various aspects of professional activities of introverted scientists, such as a preference for solo publications, low social activity, narrow specialization, high research depth, and so forth. Empirical data and multiple linear regression methods can be used to calibrate the equations. The model can be applied to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological characteristics of scientific employees, which is particularly useful in ergonomics and the management of scientific teams and projects. The proposed method also provides scientists with pronounced introversion the opportunity to develop their careers, focusing on individual preferences and features.",

We find that ND children with SOR have reduced exogenous and elevated endogenous functional MRI connectivity which is diametrically opposed to ND children without SOR. Furthermore, this double dissociation is specific to ND children who are behaviorally resilient, while emotionally dysregulated ND children possess a distinct pattern, suggesting that achieving optimal brain system connectivity—a balanced contrast—is influenced by sensory over-responsivity and essential for resilience.",

          "authors": "Drew E. Winters; Juliet Spitz; Kristen Raymond; Crystal Natvig; Rebecca Waller; Susan Mikulich; Joseph T. Sakai",
          "abstract": "Background: Antisocial behavior in youth can encompass both conduct problems (CP; e.g., aggression, rule-breaking) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits (i.e., limited empathy, remorse, and guilt). CP are associated with pronounced and broad cognitive difficulties whereas CU traits have stronger links to disrupted affective theory of mind (ToM) and more specific cognitive difficulties involving cognitive control. Cognitive control difficulties have been linked to affective ToM among early adolescents with elevated CU traits, suggesting an interaction between cognitive and affective processing that are unique to CU traits. Here we sought to improve on those initial findings by leveraging a randomized dual-task (within-trial) design to replicate and extend prior findings.\nTrial design: The preregistered study leveraged a double-blind randomized controlled trial using a dual-task design. The dual-task used an inhibitory processing task as a secondary task to impose additional demands on cognitive control implicated in ToM to compete with a primary ToM task with cognitive, affective, and physical ToM condition. Participants were randomized into control and test conditions using a permuted block randomization stratified by sex at birth and severity of CU traits. The order of single ToM task or dual-task was counterbalanced to test within subject effects of cognitive control on affective ToM inferences.\nMethods: A total of 85 participants (47% female) were used in the final analysis. Primary and preregistered hypotheses were tested using a repeated measure random effect model that accounted for individual variance and tested fixed effect interactions for CU and CP with group across time. Outcomes tested involved change in accuracy and reaction time from single ToM to dual-task. Secondary analysis examined contrasts between ToM trial types, dual-task effect, and single ToM task performance as well as associations with antisocial behaviors. \nResults: CU traits were independently associated with decrements in affective ToM from single to dual-task for both accuracy and reaction time, as well as secondary contrast tests when comparing affective &gt; physical and cognitive trials. CU traits were also related to greater dual-task effects indicating greater difficulty in ToM after taxing cognitive control. CP were related to decrements at baseline ToM task performance but were not associated with changes after taxing cognitive control during the dual-task. Importantly, a subset of participants appeared to be resilient to dual-task effects reported lower baseline antisocial behavior even at elevated CU traits. \nConclusions: Resource limitations for cognitive control in those elevated in CU traits is an important mechanism underlying difficulty utilizing affective data from the environment to inform social behavior. Those less vulnerable to additional demands on cognitive control reported fewer antisocial acts even at higher CU traits. Overall, findings suggest specific cognitive-affective interactions that relate to CU traits and explain real world antisocial behavior. This is a novel mechanism outside of the traditional cognition or affect etiologies that may indicate a developmentally specific mechanism critical in the study and treatment of youth antisocial phenotypes and development of psychopathy in adulthood.",

          "abstract": "It is not obvious why we are conscious. Why can’t all of our mental activities take place unconsciously? What is consciousness for? We aim to make progress on this question, focusing on conscious vision. We review evidence on the timescale of visual consciousness, showing that it is surprisingly slow: postdictive effects reveal windows of unconscious integration lasting up to 400 milliseconds. We argue that if consciousness is slow, it cannot be for online action-guidance. Instead, we propose that conscious vision evolved to support offline cognition, in tandem with the larger visual sensory horizons afforded by the water-to-land transition. Smaller visual horizons typical in aquatic environments require fast, reflexive actions of the sort that are guided unconsciously in humans. Conversely, larger terrestrial visual horizons allow benefits to accrue from “model-based” planning of the sort that is associated with consciousness in humans. We further propose that the acquisition of these capacities for internal simulation and planning provided pressures for the evolution of reality monitoring—the capacity to distinguish between internally and externally triggered signals, and to solve “Hamlet’s problem” in perception—the problem of when to stop integrating evidence, and fix a particular model of reality. In line with higher-order theories of consciousness, we associate the emergence of consciousness with the emergence of this reality monitoring function. We discuss novel empirical predictions that arise from this account, and explore its implications for the distribution of conscious (vs. unconscious) vision in aquatic and terrestrial animals.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous institutionalization (PI) is a unique form of early life adversity that is associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially internalizing disorders. Onset of internalizing disorders is most common during adolescence. Developmental models emphasize differences in childhood learning, and corresponding avoidance behaviors, as a core pathway linking adversity to internalizing disorders yet little empirical research has tested this theory. \n\nMETHODS: During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 43 PI (12.1 to 22.8 years) and 47 comparison (9.9 to 22.9 years) youth completed an aversive learning task. The task involved an escapable stimulus reinforced with an aversive sound (CS+r), the same escapable stimulus without reinforcement (CS+nr), or an escapable stimulus that was never reinforced (CS-). Internalizing symptoms were measured using the parent-report Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scales.\n\nRESULTS: Functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala was elevated among the PI versus comparison youth, specifically for the CS- (p=.035). PI youth showed elevated connectivity for the CS- regardless of symptoms, whereas comparison youth showed elevated connectivity at higher but not lower levels of symptoms (p=.027). Elevated connectivity for the CS- was more evident among the PI group during early adolescence relative to late adolescence (p=.007).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: NAcc-amygdala functional connectivity, a circuit which has previously been implicated in escape from threat, is elevated during safety learning among PI adolescents. Differences in NAcc-amygdala functional connectivity may attenuate with age following adoption. Institutionalization may impact neurodevelopment in ways that increase generalization of threat appraisals to safe stimuli, thereby increasing risk for developing psychopathology.",

Four hundred and twenty-eight patients diagnosed with various DSM-IV mental disorders were treated with PP or AP and provided annual self-reports of their mental health over a six-year period. Using propensity score methods and piecewise linear latent growth curve models, we identified distinct trajectories of change for the two treatments. In particular, symptom distress, personality dysfunction, interpersonal problems, and general life satisfaction improved substantially and persistently in both treatments, with PP showing faster initial improvements and AP maintaining gradual progress over time. AP showed greater long-term effectiveness, particularly for patients with more severe problems at baseline. These findings indicate the value of AP for complex cases.

          "abstract": "Sleep dysfunction can impair cognition and may play a causal role in the development of hallucinations. Deficits in cognitive control have been implicated in cognitive models of hallucinations. To better understand the underpinning role of cognition in the relationship between sleep and hallucinations, the current study aimed to investigate the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive control mechanisms such as intentional inhibition and working memory capacity, as well as auditory top-down processing. Forty-five participants were allocated to either a sleep-deprivation condition (N = 15) or a rested control group condition (N = 30). Cognitive control assessments were applied at three timepoints for each condition: baseline (T1), post-sleep deprivation/post-habitual sleep (T2), and post-recovery sleep/post-habitual daily activity (T3). Results showed significant interactions between condition and timepoint on intentional inhibition and working memory, but not auditory top-down processing. Findings support current neurocognitive theories and suggest that sleep deprivation may lead to hallucinations through effects on intrusive thoughts, memories, and emotions. Future research should continue to explore the potential mechanistic pathway between cognitive control and sleep, to inform future intervention work.

The theory does not specify the origins of positive emotions during development, although experiences in the first years of life are considered influential for long-term adjustment and well-being. Here, we propose a developmental extension of the broaden-and-build theory. This extension identifies a potential third function of positive emotions in addition to broadening and building: belonging. We suggest that positive emotions, inextricably linked to social interactions, play a crucial role in satisfying infants’ and young children’s fundamental need to belong. The belonging function of positive emotions might pave the way for broaden-and-build processes. The proposed extended framework provides the opportunity to systematically consider the origins and functions of early positive emotions in the context of social interactions.",

          "abstract": "Motor Simulation Theory proposes that imagined actions are produced using the brain’s motor system, and should therefore always be temporally equivalent to physical movements. However, empirical results are not always consistent with this prediction. Studies indicate that the durations of unfamiliar imagined actions are over-estimated, whereas the durations of more familiar actions may be closer to (or even faster than) actual movement execution. We therefore examined the effects of different levels of practice on the durations of both physically performed and imagined actions. Participants (N=31) completed an initial assessment in which the durations of physically performed and imagined finger movement sequences were measured. Participants then completed three days of physical training in which different sequences received either extensive training (150 repetitions/session), minimal training (10 repetitions/session), or no training. In a subsequent assessment session, we found that the time taken to both physically execute and imagine performing sequences decreased with training. However, contrary to the predictions of Motor Simulation theory, imagined movement durations consistently over-estimated those of physically performed movements. While the difference in the timing of imagined and physically executed movements decreased between the initial and final assessment, this effect was not modulated by training. These results extend our understanding of the relationship between motor imagery and physical practice, and highlight a key limitation in the predictions of Motor Simulation Theory.",

          "abstract": "Mild stress is present in infants’ everyday life, but its effect on their cognition is largely unexplored experimentally. The present pre-registered study tested whether stress leads to a shift from a goal-directed to a movement-based interpretation of others’ actions. Eighty-eight infants aged 6 to 8 months were tested in a stress or a control condition. Pre- and post-stress levels were assessed via parental rating and salivary cortisol. In a subsequent visual habituation paradigm, infants watched videos showing a human hand repeatedly grasping one of two objects. At test, infants watched videos showing the objects in reversed positions and the objects were grasped alternately. Salivary cortisol concentrations and parental ratings indicated higher stress levels of infants in the stress condition than in the control condition after stress manipulation. No statistically significant difference in looking behavior at test as a function of condition (stress, control) was found. Across conditions infants looked longer to the test trials showing a hand grasping the new object using the old grasping path, indicating that they had habituated to the goal of the grasping movement and thereby showed an encoding of the goal of the actor. Additionally, infants in the stress condition showed a longer accumulated looking time during the habituation than non-stressed infants. These results suggest that acute stress does not influence infants’ interpretation of actions as goal-directed. Nevertheless, the slower speed of habituation in stressed infants suggests that identifying the action target may have been more difficult for them.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making is driven by factors such as motivation, pleasure, and cognitive skill. The current study evaluates how these factors are related to decision-making in a community population. In recent years, work in the field of reinforcement learning has identified two main pathways that drive decision-making: model-based and model-free learning. Model-free learning updates action values retrospectively, after a reward is received. In contrast, model-based learning updates action values prospectively, by weighing contextual factors, the overall structure of the situation, and reward received. The current study utilizes a two-stage decision-making task to assess the relative contribution of model-free vs model-based learning in relation to measures that assess motivation, pleasure, and cognition in a community sample (n=127). General linear mixed effect models showed that individuals high in motivation and pleasure had significantly greater reliance on model-free decision making (p=0.0267). In contrast, individuals with better working memory, as measured by a running span task, had significantly greater reliance on model-based learning (p=0.0003). These findings provide evidence that individual differences in motivation and cognition are associated with reliance on particular learning pathways. It has been suggested that lower levels of motivation, pleasure, and cognition in various forms of psychopathology (e.g., depression) can impair decision-making. Our results show these relationships transcend clinical contexts. Specifically, these findings suggest that individuals who experience low motivation and pleasure may be less sensitive to immediate rewards, and that working memory capacity is highly relevant to model-based learning.",

As a result, our knowledge of regional variation in male fertility remains limited. The current study addresses this research gap by examining how the timing and chances of parenthood vary regionally for women and men in four countries in Northern and Western Europe. We hypothesise that men may be subject to less regional variation in their first births than women, and that gender differences in first births may be less pronounced in urban centres, such as the capital regions, and especially among groups with higher levels of education. The study is based on data collected from female and male cohorts born between 1963 and 1970 in Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The results broadly support our hypotheses: men show modestly smaller differences in the timing and chances of first parenthood between capital and other regions than women, and consequently smaller gender differences in first parenthood exist in capital regions in all countries except the Netherlands. Moreover, highly educated women and men living in the capital regions have the most similar timing and chances of entering parenthood.",

          "abstract": "Criminologists maintain a vested interest in hard-to-reach populations, such as active offenders, former prisoners, and affiliates of criminal enterprises. For five decades, policymakers and researchers have sought national estimates of gang activity. Traditional methods, such as surveys sampling law enforcement agencies or youth populations, have provided valuable insights into gang activity in the United States. However, these approaches face limitations, including bias, obsolescence, high costs, outdated data, and restricted scope. This study examines the potential of online opt-in panels to studying gang populations. Contracting with YouGov, we administered four surveys to 13,148 respondents between January 2023 and January 2024, measuring lifetime gang membership and its correlates. Lifetime gang membership estimates ranged from 2.0% to 2.4% in custom surveys and 5.3% to 6.2% in omnibus surveys. While demographic and socioeconomic correlates showed mixed results, ecological and legal correlates consistently aligned with expectations based on prior research. Our findings suggest cautious optimism about the utility of online opt-in panels for studying hard-to-reach populations like gang members and advancing cross-national, comparative research in line with the Eurogang Program of Research. These panels offer advantages such as cost-efficiency, accessibility, and timeliness, but further validation is necessary to establish their reliability and validity for population-level estimates.",

This study documents the labor market deficits of mental disorders in both the short and the very long term using Finnish administrative data on hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and labor market outcomes. A history of psychiatric hospitalization is associated with approximately 50 % deficit in lifetime income relative to non-diagnosed control group, and this deficit is larger, the earlier that hospitalization occurs. Event study estimates suggest that labor market performance tends to deteriorate before the first psychiatric treatment, which undermines causal interpretations in the differencein-differences framework. Disorders related to acute stress are an exception, and do not exhibit pretrends; however, these disorders often originate from traumatic life-events that may also have direct impact on individuals’ work capacity, leaving the interpretation of the point estimates ambiguous.",

This study evaluates the impact of regulatory measures (charges and discounts), persuasion (environmental information prompts), and consumer motivations (using Protection Motivation Theory) on preferences for single-use, refillable, and returnable cups. Using discrete choice experiments with a nationally representative sample, we find that a charge of 25–30 pence is required to reduce single-use cup selection by 50%, whereas a discount of at least 70 pence achieves a similar effect. Information prompts have minimal influence on choices, while environmentally motivated consumer segments demonstrate greater responsiveness to discounts.

This approach allows for the experimental manipulation of network features such as homophily, clustering, and degree, enabling the assessment of their individual and combined impacts on segregation levels, patterns, and the stability of the socio-spatial system. I find that certain configurations of these network features can exacerbate residential sorting to levels exceeding those predicted by the original Schelling model. These outcomes underscore the critical role of social network dynamics, particularly the significance of weak ties, in driving a system toward a segregated state. The results contribute to the broader sociological discourse on social networks, highlighting the complex interplay between network structure and social phenomena, and offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying residential segregation.",

Adopting a qualitative mixed-method approach, the study combines screen recordings, eye-tracking, think-aloud protocols, and semi-structured interviews to analyze how users perceive and adapt to social norms. Findings from 21 participants reveal distinct patterns of norm adoption with participants actively inferring platform-specific norms through visual cues (e.g., type of photos) and contextual signals (e.g., comments). Conversely, norm adherence on familiar platforms appears to involve more unconscious, habitual inferences shaped by both close peer influence and platform-specific expectations. The study highlights variations in norm processes across platforms, where Instagram promotes curated, idealized self-presentation, while TikTok encourages authenticity. Moreover, individual characteristics, platform affordances, and peer influence were found to shape self-presentation and self-disclosure and social norm adherence in diverse ways, underscoring the complexity and at times the striking uniqueness of digital self-expression of individual people. In sum, this research contributes to social norm theory by differentiating between norm adoption and adherence and by underscoring the impact of both interpersonal connections and platform culture on online behaviors.",

          "authors": "Paolo Cardullo; Rob Kitchin",
          "abstract": "Commercial digital platforms possess a universal design and interface regardless of\ncities or particular political-cultural traditions. This is also the case for corporately\nowned platforms designed to facilitate citizen engagement in civic issues. In contrast,\ncivic platforms rooted in a FOSS approach are configurable and can be adapted in\ncontext to produce tailored interactions. In this paper, we examine what this\nadaptability means for citizenship when citizens can be involved in the making and\nrunning of platforms, and can take an active role in city governance using civic\nplatforms. We revisit the analytical framework developed by Cardullo and Kitchin\n(2019a) – the scaffold of smart citizen participation – to consider the platformisation of\nurban living designed to empower citizens to take an active role in management and\ngovernance processes and decision-making. In particular, we focus on the scaffold’s\nleast explored rungs, ‘citizen power’, providing a comparative analysis of instances of\nDecidim, a civic platform designed to engender collaborative governance, along with its\nassociated soft infrastructure, in Barcelona, New York and Brazil. We highlight how\ndifferent instances of the same platform can confer different citizenship relations\ndepending on how it is framed, configured and used. In other words, platform\ncitizenship is provincialized, enabling alternative futures to emerge from mainstream\nknowledge claims about citizens’ role in platform urbanisation.",

The study was pursued with the objective of highlighting the child’s resilience towards experiences at home, on the streets (as a homeless minor) and at childcare institutions the child had lived in so far. The study also explored if a non-familial environment in a childcare institution affected the mental health of the child and identified specific areas of concern. The case study was designed using interviews. The methodology entailed collecting primary data through administration of two Questionnaires namely the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Based on the data obtained from the interview transcripts, and field notes, an intense content analysis was done to examine the thought process of the child. The SDQ and BDI analysis revealed that the child is at high risk of developing clinically significant problems, including hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, and depression, due to non-traditional gender identity, lack of familial acceptance, violence, and alienation in the childcare institutions for boys, which may lead to mental health issues.",

          "abstract": "Although central bank communication is a core monetary policy and accountability tool for central banks, little is known about what shapes it. This paper develops and tests a theory regarding a previously unconsidered variable: central bank independence (CBI). We argue that increases in CBI alter the pressures a central bank faces, compelling them to address these pressures to maintain their reputation. We fine-tune and validate a Large Language Model (Google's Gemini) to develop novel textual indices of policy pressures regarding monetary policy communication of central banks in speeches of 100 central banks from 1997 to 2023. Employing a staggered difference-in-differences and an instrumental variable approach, we find robust evidence that an increase in independence decreases monetary pressures and increases financial pressures discussed in monetary policy communication. These results are not, as generally is assumed, confounded by general changes in communication over time or singular events, in particular, the Global Financial Crisis.",

          "abstract": "Purpose\nCustomer value co-creation (CVCC) intention has been shown to foster favorable consumer attitudes towards businesses, thereby promoting positive consumer behavior. However, research on the application of this phenomenon in the e-commerce domain remains limited. Grounded in social exchange and social identity theories, this study investigates the mediating role of satisfaction in the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) and CVCC intention, as well as the moderating effect of gender on this mediation within the e-commerce context.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted using non-probability convenience sampling, involving 309 students from Keimyung University in Korea. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using SPSS-AMOS, and the proposed hypotheses were tested through SPSS PROCESS Model 7.\n\nFindings\nThe findings of this study indicate that satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between perceived CSR and CVCC intention. Additionally, this mediation is moderated by gender, with the effect of perceived CSR on CVCC intention through satisfaction being stronger for female participants than for male participants.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study extends social exchange and social identity theories to the e-commerce domain by elucidating the mechanisms through which CSR influences CVCC intention. It highlights the pivotal role of satisfaction in linking CSR with CVCC intention and emphasizes the moderating influence of gender. Practical recommendations are provided for e-commerce businesses to enhance the effectiveness of their CSR initiatives in fostering consumer engagement.",

          "abstract": "This article reviews Loet Leydesdorff’s contributions to science mapping. It explains how over the years, his mapping techniques evolved from journal mapping to overlays over global maps of science and finally towards interactive interfaces portraying multiple classifications and ontologies. It then critically reviews the challenges of current approaches to science mapping, which implicitly assume a ‘natural’ underlying structure, with examples from recent case studies. We observe that existing algorithmic approaches, either based on citation or semantic approaches, have problems of logic consistency of the categories obtained, which belong to methods, materials, empirical objects or theories. I propose that science mapping should engage with the conceptual goals of analyses that could define the type of ontologies relevant for each specific study. To do this science mapping should embrace mixed-methods to generate plural classifications and multiple ontologies which respond more specifically to sociological and policy questions.",

          "abstract": "Our leap into emergency online teaching (EOT) during the COVID-19 pandemic was like tumbling down a rabbit hole into a surreal digital landscape, where synchronous and asynchronous teaching spaces became our new wonderland, each presenting its challenges and surprises. However, we merely encountered countless tips and professional development advice about how technology and AI tools can replace face-to-face instruction, foregrounding a technocentric discourse that ignored the centrality of educational theories for online teaching to consolidate student learning. In this paper, I argue that prevailing educational conditions, influenced by technological advancements, can find valuable support in Freire’s age-old yet enduring educational philosophy. Such a philosophy requires us to reimagine how to shift from policing knowledge to embracing new pedagogies that instil in our students the ethics and values they need to navigate the vast information readily available for consumption. I conclude that, like Alice and the Mad Hatter, we must embrace creativity and curiosity to cultivate robust online educational spaces that foster values, ethics, and proactive dispositions essential for thriving in today’s fast-paced, technology-driven world.",

We find that after adjusting for individual and school characteristics, school preferences, and neighborhood fixed-effects, total travel time and transit use are not predictive of tardiness, but requiring a bus transfer is. These estimates do not vary by student or school characteristics indicating that this is a general phenomenon that has more to do with system-level reliability than individual motivation or school climate. These findings highlight the hidden costs imposed on some students who wish to leave their neighborhood and travel across town for better educational opportunities.",

This study is the first attempt to evaluate the impact of a message sent by the government to an industry about a first mover in climate action. Among 374 wineries in Japan, randomly selected half received a message mentioning the winery that was an early adopter of renewable energy. We then observed whether other wineries participated in webinars on carbon footprint measurement to collect information. We find that this message about climate leadership did not encourage the wineries to participate in the webinar, and it even had a negative effect on nearby wineries. We interpret these results as reflecting both the strategic decisions of competing wineries and the adverse psychological effects of the message. This preregistered experiment suggests that we must be cautious when designing policies to honor first movers on the supply side.",

          "authors": "Shivam Sen",
          "abstract": "To address social concerns that online personalisation algorithms increase polarisation, scholars have studied two distinct classes of agent based models of opinion dynamics constructed to explain polarisation: contagion/reinforcement class and repulsion class. It has been rigorously demonstrated that these classes make contrasting predictions on the relationship between polarisation and homophily (thought to be a consequence of online personalisation algorithms). However, consequences of a model that combines contagion and repulsion on the relationship between homophily and polarisation has not been rigorously studied. Thus, this paper proposes a theoretical foundation for such a model and extends an existing contagion class attitude dynamics model into a  contagion-repulsion combination model. This results in a novel equation of attitude change which positions the combination model as a generalisation of several other opinion dynamics models. Subsequently, simulation experiments test implications of this model on the relationship between homophily and polarisation. Results show different parameter combinations produce several qualitatively different forms of the relationship, ranging from increasing, decreasing, U-shaped or even flat. This suggests the relationship between polarisation and homophily is sensitive to context and may be issue dependent.",

This \ndissertation took young people as the research object and analyses their \nknowledge contribution behaviour in the online SQA community. The \nstudy adopted an online observation approach and semi-structured \ninterview methodology. The researcher observed the online knowledge \ncontribution behaviour for an extended period, and conducted in-depth \ninterviews with 25 long-term users. Users were grouped according to \ngender and age, and the differences in knowledge contribution among these \ndifferent groups were analysed and compared.\nThe study asked the questions: what characters and personalities do these \nparticipants have? Why do participants contribute to the SQA community, \nand how does contributing to an online SQA forum differ from offline \nknowledge contributions? Through investigation, the study found that \nknowledge contributors are enthusiastic and have a strong sense of social \nresponsibility. They are willing to learn and self-motivated. However, even \nthough they may not have a clear purpose in the contribution of knowledge, \n6\nthey help to build their own reputations, broaden social networks and make \nmoney eventually.\nThis dissertation attempted to apply Bourdieu’s theory of capital as a \nframework to explain how users go about accumulating symbolic,\neconomic, cultural and social capital by contributing knowledge. To \nconclude the study, the researcher drew conclusions concerning the \ndifference between online and offline knowledge contribution on SQA \ncommunities.\n\nKeywords: Knowledge Contribution, SQA communities, Social Capital, \nProsocial Behaviour",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces {censobr}, an R package that provides an efficient method for accessing and analyzing Brazilian census data. The package enables in-disk data manipulation, allowing users to handle larger-than-memory datasets seamlessly with familiar {dplyr} syntax. The package integrates with {geobr}, enriching census data with geographic identifiers for easy spatial analysis. It offers a range of functions to download microdata and aggregated data for all of the Brazilian census editions since 1960 and provides access to essential documentation such as variable dictionaries and interview manuals. Through this approach, {censobr} enhances accessibility to detailed demographic and socioeconomic information, including both individual-level microdata and census tract-level aggregates. Additionally, the package's handling of complex survey designs and support for spatial data visualization facilitates in-depth analysis of the sociodemographic characteristics and living conditions of the Brazilian population over several decades. Practical examples included in the paper demonstrate its applications in areas such as demographic analysis and household-level research. {censobr} represents a significant advancement in making Brazilian census data accessible and efficient for academic and policy-related research. Future updates will expand its functionality and data coverage, contributing further to the ease of use and analytical capabilities of the package.",

Since this is one of the most common statistical analyses, Stata offers a wide variety of methods to investigate such effects. The present study outlines how these different analyses can be performed in Stata and provides a comprehensive simulation study to determine which method has the best statistical properties. To this end, both the nominal alpha error rate and statistical power are assessed for continuous and binary dependent variables. For a deeper analysis, not only are the sample sizes varied, but other potential challenges are also considered, such as heteroscedasticity for the continuous outcome and imbalanced binary outcome variables. The results indicate that some methods deviate significantly from the nominal alpha limit, leading to incorrect conclusions on average. For the continuous outcome variable, the OLS regression approach with robust (HC3) standard errors and an interaction term yields the best results. For the binary outcome, we recommend the logit model with robust standard errors or the linear probability model with robust (HC3) standard errors.",

          "abstract": "Citizenship has become a key concept for studying the relationship between individuals and the state. The notion of lived citizenship, in particular, highlights how the rights and obligations of citizenship are lived differently based on race, gender, class and other markers of social difference. However, much of the existing scholarship remains rooted in global North contexts, with limited attention to the realities of living under weak institutions. This research note builds on critical citizenship studies and foundational works on citizenship in the global South to offer an original conceptual framework for studying lived citizenship. It starts with a rethinking of the classical division of civil, social and political rights of citizenship into four fields of relating to the state: protection, provision, participation and belonging. It then illustrates how our experiences of these four fields are structured by four interconnected elements: social locations, relations, practices, and emotions. It conceptualizes these four fields and elements in ways that address dynamics of informality, clientelism, extralegal violence and authoritarianism that often mediate the relationship with the state in the global South. By bridging key theoretical and empirical gaps, this conceptualization offers new insights for organizing our inquiry into citizenship as lived and contested across the globe.",

Building on research on political trust as related to democratic legitimacy and on trust’s attitudinal and behavioral consequences, we formulate expectations about longitudinal effects of political trust on democracy. Our primary hypothesis is that political trust has a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already achieved some level of democracy. To test this hypothesis, we employ Bayesian latent trend analysis to estimate a time series of political trust for 62 countries over 30 years. We fit lagged variable models to the trust time series combined with democracy measures from the Varieties of Democracy project and economic indicators. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a positive effect among already democratic countries.",

La transizione verso pratiche di finanza sostenibile è analizzata nel contesto della crescente rilevanza della sostenibilità come driver strategico per la competitività delle banche. Attraverso un'analisi econometrica basata su modelli panel data, il paper indaga la relazione tra le componenti ESG e il valore dei mutui concessi alle famiglie. I risultati mostrano che i mutui sono influenzati positivamente da politiche di supporto creditizio, interventi di riqualificazione urbana e una maggiore educazione finanziaria nelle regioni con elevata disuguaglianza di reddito e grave deprivazione abitativa. Tuttavia, emergono anche criticità legate a rischi ambientali e di governance che possono ridurre la domanda di mutui in aree con problemi significativi di gestione dei rifiuti e deterioramento del paesaggio.
