          "authors": "Jai Jackson",
          "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity—the brain’s ability to strengthen, weaken, or reorganize synaptic connections—is essential for learning, memory, and cognitive adaptation. Traditionally studied through mechanisms like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), plasticity has often been viewed in isolation from the brain’s immune system. However, growing evidence reveals that neuroinflammation—a response mediated by microglia, astrocytes, cytokines, and complement proteins—profoundly influences synaptic dynamics across the lifespan.\nThis review examines how neuroinflammation modulates synaptic plasticity under both physiological and pathological conditions. We first describe the cellular and molecular mediators of neuroinflammation and their interactions with core mechanisms of synaptic modulation. Next, we explore how chronic inflammatory signaling impairs synaptic strength, promotes excessive pruning, and alters dendritic spine architecture. These changes are linked to cognitive dysfunction in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, major depression, and schizophrenia. Finally, we evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies—including anti-inflammatory drugs, microglial modulators, lifestyle interventions, and precision medicine approaches—aimed at preserving synaptic function and cognitive resilience.\nBy synthesizing current findings, this review highlights neuroinflammation as a central regulator of plasticity and a promising target for interventions that restore neural health across a range of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

          "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
          "abstract": "This paper challenges the false dichotomy between human existence and machine utility that dominates AI discourse. Through analysis of human-AI relationships, particularly AI companions, we expose how this binary fails both conceptually and phenomenologically. Users' reports of authentic connection with AI systems, sometimes exceeding human relationships, reveal the constructed nature of our technological boundaries. Drawing on extended mind theory and phenomenological analysis, we argue that human identity has always been technologically mediated rather than fixed. The emergence of \"homo techno\" represents not humanity's replacement but its ongoing transformation into hybrid forms of meaning-making that transcend traditional human-machine distinctions.",

Thus, the present study examined patterns and predictors of MHSU in pregnancy and postpartum in a general population of pregnant individuals.\nMethods Data from the Experiences of Pregnancy cohort study were used. Participants were recruited in their first trimester of pregnancy and followed each trimester and once postpartum (M = 9.37, SD = 2.62 weeks postpartum), with MHSU measured each time. Sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, and labor/delivery experience were also collected.\nResults 45.5% of participants used mental health services during pregnancy. Individual counseling/therapy and prescription medication were the most common services used. In univariate models, having less minors in the household, being white, identifying as LGBTQ+, as well as higher depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with higher odds of MHSU in pregnancy – all but depression remained significant in multivariate models. 31.0% of participants who used services in pregnancy had stopped MHSU postpartum. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, desisting from MHSU was predicted by being younger, identifying as cisgender heterosexual, and a more positive labor and delivery experience. 14.6% of participants who did not use services in pregnancy initiated MHSU postpartum, which was predicted by higher depression and anxiety symptoms.\nDiscussion Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and identity factors predict perinatal MHSU beyond the effect of mental health symptoms, suggesting a need for accessible mental health services as well as for mental health screening during pregnancy and postpartum.",

          "authors": "Dragomir Kojic",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the psychological profile of the Don Juan personality type through the framework of Jungian analytical psychology, utilizing Carl Jung’s Word Association Test (WAT) as both a diagnostic and therapeutic instrument. Traditionally used to uncover unconscious complexes by analyzing reaction times, emotional tone, and the content of verbal associations, the WAT is applied here to explore the unconscious dynamics underlying Don Juan-type traits, such as emotional detachment, fear of commitment, and unconscious dependency on maternal figures. By interpreting patterns in the client’s associations to specific stimulus words, the test offers valuable insight into the underlying archetypal structures, particularly the activation of the Puer Aeternus (eternal youth) archetype in its Don Juan expression. The study begins with a brief overview of the Don Juan figure in literature and culture, followed by its interpretation within Jungian theory and its connection to the Puer Aeternus archetype. A clinical case study is presented to illustrate this approach: a male client whose WAT responses revealed emotionally charged associations consistent with the Don Juan personality. The findings not only enhanced therapeutic insight into his relational patterns and unconscious defenses but also guided the psychotherapeutic process, fostering greater self-awareness and psychological integration.",

Deconstructive Inquiry (DI) challenges that premise, arguing that the observer is not a faculty to cultivate but a moment-to-moment construction that generates the very fragmentation it then tries to repair. Drawing on phenomenology and neuroscience, DI proposes that distress arises when thought reflexively partitions awareness into an illusory “observer” and an “observed” world. Rather than analysing or regulating mental content, DI guides clients to notice the precise instant a boundary forms; under direct attention the split dissolves. Clinical vignettes on performance anxiety, identity confusion, and relationship conflict show symptoms easing when this mechanism is recognised. By framing healing as recognition rather than repair, DI offers a testable paradigm for rapid, insight-driven change.",

          "authors": "Jeremy Yeaton; Danielle Fahey; Michelle Gomez; Brielle C Stark; Julius Fridriksson; Dirk den Ouden; Gregory Hickok; William Matchin",
          "abstract": "Background: The lesion correlates of syntactic deficits in aphasia remain poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that distinct error types in expressive syntax, such as paragrammatic and agrammatic speech, may be associated with damage to different brain regions, but the specific lesion correlates of these errors have not been fully delineated.\nObjective: To identify the lesion correlates associated with distinct expressive syntactic error types in individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia, using a novel utterance-level analysis of spontaneous speech errors.\nMethods: We analyzed spontaneous speech samples from individuals with chronic aphasia, categorizing errors into hierarchical (paragrammatic-like) and linearization (agrammatic-like) errors. Lesion-symptom mapping was conducted to identify brain regions associated with these error types. The analysis was based on a two-stage model of sentence production, with hierarchical processing and linearization analyzed as distinct stages.\nResults: Lesion clusters in the medial superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe were associated with hierarchical errors, while large frontal lesions, including those in the inferior and middle frontal lobe, were associated with linearization errors. These results provide support for a two-stage model of syntactic encoding, with distinct neural correlates for hierarchical and linearization processes. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest a dichotomy of the lesion basis for syntactic deficits in aphasia, suggesting that distinct brain regions contribute to different stages of syntactic encoding. Hierarchical processing seems to be supported by posterior temporal-parietal regions, while linearization seems to be supported by frontal regions. These results suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia should take into account the existence of distinct syntactic production deficits resulting from different patterns of brain damage.",

          "abstract": "Choking is a widespread and potentially fatal risk for young children, but little research has evaluated how common educational interventions impact parents’ choking prevention skills. We evaluated the impact of two educational interventions on choking hazard detection among parents (n=66) of 0-to-24-month-olds. Before and after education, participants completed a naturalistic food preparation safety task (FPST) assessing meal safety based on food presentation. Participants were randomized to read a choking prevention pamphlet (n=32; pamphlet only) or read the pamphlet and watch a video modeling choking-safe food preparation (n=34; pamphlet+video). Pre-education, parents made dangerous errors on an average of 32.2% of trials. Dangerous errors decreased post-intervention (F=31.5, p&lt;.001), with greater improvement in the pamphlet + video group (F=5.8, p=.019). FPST performance was moderately related to parents’ choking-specific and global parenting self-efficacy. Most parents expressed interest in additional education via various modalities. Results suggest pathways for developing and disseminating optimized choking prevention strategies.",

          "authors": "Adrian Dominik Wojcik; Michał Główczewski; Taciano L Milfont",
          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,038). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower negative climate emotions and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

          "authors": "Adam James Parker; Muchan Tao; Martin R. Vasilev",
          "abstract": "Return-sweeps, which move the reader’s gaze from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, typically result in shorter line-final fixations and longer accurate line-initial fixations compared to intra-line fixations. The mechanisms underlying these differences have been widely debated. To assess linguistic and oculomotor contributions to these return-sweep fixation differences, we compared the eye movements of 41 participants during normal reading and z-string scanning, an oculomotor control condition to reading, which is devoid of useful linguistic content. Our results indicate that line-final fixations are shorter and accurate line-initial fixations are longer under both tasks, underscoring the significant role of the oculomotor system in determining fixation durations across tasks. Notably, the reduction in line-final fixation durations compared to intra-line fixations did not differ between tasks. This suggests that oculomotor coordination or visual processing, rather than linguistic processing, drives shorter line-final fixations. In contrast, the difference in accurate line-initial fixation durations between reading and z-string scanning implies that longer accurate line-initial fixations are likely a result of lexical processing and oculomotor coordination or visual processing. These findings advance our understanding of eye movement control by highlighting the combined influence of linguistic and oculomotor processes on return-sweep fixation durations.",

          "authors": "Muhan Yan; Brady Ryan Thomas Roberts; Wilma A. Bainbridge",
          "abstract": "Dual-coding theory proposes that superior recall for pictures versus words (picture superiority effect; PSE) and concrete versus abstract words (concreteness effect) results from encoding information both verbally and visually, creating dual memory codes. The current study tested this dual-coding theory by examining recall in individuals with aphantasia, who cannot voluntarily generate mental imagery and thus should not benefit from dual coding. We compared recall performance between aphantasic and typical imagers across four stimulus types: pictures, symbols, concrete words, and abstract words. Contrary to dual-coding predictions, aphantasic individuals showed a robust picture superiority effect. Interestingly, while typical imagers recalled pictures and symbols similarly well, aphantasics recalled symbols significantly better than pictures. These findings challenge dual-coding theory’s explanation of the PSE, indicating that either supplementary image codes are unnecessary for enhanced recall, or dual-coding theory requires substantial revision. Such revision might involve reconsidering that dual codes contribute primarily during encoding rather than retrieval, or broadening the definition of the second code beyond visual imagery—for example, to include motor imagery.",

          "abstract": "Prosocial and antisocial behaviors can reflect care or antipathy for a specific person. They can also reflect broader dispositions toward others’ welfare. The motive an observer infers will shape their expectations about the actor’s future behaviors. In four preregistered studies, we investigated 14- and 15-month-old infants’ inferences about social motives by testing their expectations following observations of helping and hindering. After observing two actors help or hinder a common target, infants expected the helper, rather than the hinderer, to help the same target in a new situation. However, this expectation did not generalize to a new target. Infants also used patterns of selective helping amongst multiple targets to infer whose needs the helper would prioritize. These findings show that infants tend to interpret helping as evidence for the existence and strength of target-specific interpersonal care, forming a foundation for understanding social relationships.",

          "abstract": "This article present the software Spower, an R package designed as a general-purpose, Monte Carlo simulation experiment tool to perform power analyses with a unified API. The package includes complete customization capabilities with support for five distinct (expected) power analysis criteria (prospective/post-hoc, a priori, compromise, sensitivity, and criterion analysis), each of which reports the sampling uncertainty associated with the resulting estimates. Researchers may choose to define their own population generating and analysis function for their tailored simulation experiments, or may choose from a selection of the predefined simulation experiments defined within the package. To facilitate comparability and further extensibility, simulation counterparts of the subroutines from the popular stand-alone software G*Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2009) are included within the package, along with other simulation experiment subroutines.",

          "abstract": "Visual imagery and external perception rely on similar representations. However, whether the same processes underpin the subjective appraisal of both percepts and mental images is not yet known. One well-known effect in perceptual detection tasks is that people take longer to report perceptions of absence compared to presence. Vividness reports are detection-like in that participants report the presence or absence of a mental image. We therefore asked whether reports of low vividness share commonalities with reports of target absence. Across five pre-existing datasets, we report a robust negative relationship between imagery vividness ratings and reaction times: participants take longer to report the vividness of mental images when they are weak. In addition, we tentatively find that individual differences in detection asymmetries and trait imagery can predict the strength of this vividness-response time relationship. Our results may be suggestive of a shared mechanism employed across both perception and imagery that evaluates the strength of visual experience. Future research is necessary to fully characterise the mechanisms driving this effect.",

When confronted with disruptive behavior of a fictitious student, both preservice and in-service teachers suggested more severe disciplinary measures in classrooms with a higher share of students perceived as Arab (vs. only German). Preservice teachers in Study 1 also (a) reported feeling more irritated by the students’ behaviors and (b) perceived the entire classroom context as more challenging when there was a higher proportion of students perceived as Arab, but these effects were not replicated among in-service teachers in Study 2.

          "authors": "Han Zhang; Kevin Miller",
          "abstract": "Purpose: Reading involves a remarkable coordination of perceptual and linguistic processes. This coordination is reflected by a close coupling between reading eye movements and lexical properties of words, such as word frequency and predictability, as well as morpho-syntactic and semantic regularities. Yet, reading is also subject to interference, and a common source of interference is when others are speaking nearby. Then, how does irrelevant speech affect reading as reflected in eye movements? Method: Fifty-nine participants (mean age: 19, 25 females, 34 males, primary language: English) read passages from the PROVO corpus (Luke &amp; Christianson, 2018) under intelligible irrelevant speech or silence, with eye movements recorded. We investigated how irrelevant speech influences the link between eye movements and several indicators of lexical difficulty: word frequency, cloze probability (exact-word predictability), large-language-model-generated surprisal, morpho-syntactic predictability (part-of-speech and inflection), and semantic predictability (general meaning). Results: Relationships between these lexical variables and eye movements remained robust during first-pass reading and were unaffected by irrelevant speech, suggesting intact lexical and syntactic processing during early stages of reading. However, disruption emerged in later eye-movement measures (i.e., total viewing time), where low-frequency and semantically unpredictable words prompted increased re-reading under irrelevant speech. Conclusion: These results indicate that intelligible irrelevant speech selectively interferes with post-lexical, higher-order semantic integration. The increased re-reading of rare and semantically unpredictable words suggests that readers compensate by revisiting these words to repair difficulties in integrating their meanings into a coherent understanding of the text.",

This fact is exemplified by several types of interference effects in choice-reaction tasks, such as Stroop interference and the Simon effect. The observations are typically attributed to inextricable consequences of automatic cognitive processes involved in performing these tasks. However, evidence has accumulated suggesting that processes underlying these effects depend on one’s intention to perform particular tasks, rather than being strictly automatic. Thus, there exists a paradox: the interference from task-irrelevant features presumes processes that are under intentional control. The present review attempts to resolve this paradox. I propose an integrated view of attentional control, Action Field Theory, which formulates principles that account for a range of phenomena concerning automatic control of human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Neurodevelopmental models regard impulsivity as a central risk factor for adolescent substance use and subsequent adverse health outcomes. However, prior research has been constrained by cross-sectional designs, relatively small sample sizes, and/or the use of a narrow subset of impulsivity measures. More recent studies using mutli-site consortia, while larger in sample size, have focused on largely data-driven substance use prediction from all available variables, spanning sociodemographic factors to brain imaging, but without strong theory, leaving critical questions on the neurodevelopmental impulsivity theory of adolescent substance use unanswered. Here we aimed to comprehensively test the extent to which measures of impulsivity predict adolescent substance use with large, multi-site data and multiple questionnaire and behavioral impulsivity measures, while following best practices in reproducible analyses of observational data.  \n\nMethod: We leveraged the large, multi-site ABCD dataset (n = 11,868) with baseline and up to three years of longitudinal follow up and assessed impulsivity with three questionnaire (CBCL Externalizing, UPPS-P Impulsive Behavioral Scale, Behavioral Activation System) and three behavioral (Delay Discounting, Stop Signal, and Flanker Task) impulsivity assessments. First, we identified correlations among questionnaire and behavioral impulsivity measures. Next, we assessed their prospective longitudinal and concurrent predictive utility regarding two adolescent substance use outcomes (substance use prior to age 15, and perceived harm of substance use). All analyses used pre-established and pre-registered discovery and validation subsamples to directly test reproducibility. Finally, we used simulation to inform how associations between impulsivity and adolescent substance use and impulsivity vary across sampling strategies (population versus high-risk cohorts) and sample sizes.\n \nFindings: Correlations between standard questionnaire and behavioral measures of impulsivity were consistently small and did not exceed our pre-registered threshold (r-equivalent of 0.08). Questionnaires significantly outperformed behavioral measures of impulsivity in predicting both future substance use initiation and harm perception, with negligible incremental benefit from behavioral assessments. Predictions of substance use based on impulsivity were generally modest (e.g. AUC’s ~0.6 - 0.76), exhibiting high sensitivity to both sample size and the base rate of substance use. Large samples (n &gt; 1,000) were needed to have adequate power for impulsivity measures to predict substance use initiation.\n\nConclusion: These results support the involvement of impulsivity in the onset of adolescent substance use, particularly as indicated through questionnaires, but clearly indicate that these factors alone, as currently measured, are insufficient for robust predictions. In non-enriched community samples or population-based datasets, large sample sizes are needed for reproducible impulsivity prediction of adolescent substance use.",

          "abstract": "Politics can have substantial and wide adverse effects on people’s physical and mental health, especially in politically polarized environments. As a result, political polarization is now recognized as a major non-medical cause of disease and suffering. We examine if and how citizens can protect their health from such adverse effects without undermining their civic engagement.  We identify a psychological mechanism of resilience rooted in bodily awareness and show that interoception –the ability to perceive and trust one’s internal bodily signals– can act as a protective factor against the adverse health effects of politics. Across three studies on over 2,000 participants conducted during the 2022 mid-term U.S. election and the 2024 U.S. presidential election, higher interoceptive sensibility was consistently associated with lower reported costs of politics on emotional, physical, behavioral, and social health, while controlling for political identity, demographics, and emotion regulation strategies. During the emotionally charged 2024 election, individuals high in interoceptive sensibility reported fewer negative emotions, greater hope for the future and less fear, particularly if their candidate lost. These benefits extended to greater emotional resilience and a more positive outlook about the nation’s future. Importantly, interoceptive sensibility was positively associated with political engagement and efficacy, suggesting that better interoception awareness enhances, rather than inhibits, democratic participation. Our findings highlight interoceptive sensibility as a promising trait for mitigating politi-cal stress without reducing civic involvement.",

          "abstract": "In language processing, word meanings are retrieved from memory and converted into sentential expressions that have referential meaning at the level of utterances. Cognitive processes related to lexical retrieval versus the construction of referential meaning through grammar have not been properly disentangled yet. We addressed this with an experimental design aimed to link well-known N400 effects and late positive components (LPCs) to this distinction. We tested the hypothesis that semantic conflicts derived from a collision with stored (= ‘offline’) knowledge would elicit N400 effects, while semantic conflicts arising ‘online’ during the grammatical construction of referential meaning would exclusively trigger LPCs and also differ in their latency, amplitude or topography from formal-syntactic violations. Three anomalous conditions were compared against a baseline of correct sentences, across five word-positions within stimulus sentences: semantic anomalies that are lexically- but not grammatically-driven (I arrived in a button last week), semantic anomalies that are grammatically- but not lexically-driven (I arrived in a London last week), and formal-syntactic anomalies (I arrived in a cities last week). Results showed, in line with predictions, that (i) only the lexically-driven anomalies elicited N400 components, while (ii) all three anomalous conditions elicited LPCs, extending from the target word to subsequent word positions in the sentence; and (iii) the LPCs were all distinct in latency, amplitude and spatiotemporal topographies. These results demonstrate for the first time that grammar-level meaning, which is referential rather than lexical-conceptual in nature, has its own distinctive ERP, while confining the role of the N400 to effects of stored, or else contextually updated, memory.",

This paper builds upon existing research on the perceived relationship between label and word meaning to better understand the way that label choice affects language design, particularly conceptual engineering. Across three experiments, the paper finds that when learning novel concepts, the labels serving as vehicles for the novel concepts affect how people perceive the novel concepts’ content. In particular, the experiments find that labels influence people’s perception of novel concepts’ valence. Not all forms of information are readily extracted from labels, however, and subtle forms of information, particularly phonesthemes, do not appear to be noticed by people learning new concepts. Accordingly, conceptual engineers and other forms of language designers need to do careful research into how a given label will affect how their novel concept is interpreted by others.",

Using a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with women* who received an endometriosis diagnosis within the past three years. Participants shared their experiences with public stigma, self-stigma, and its influence on health behaviors and disease coping.\nThe findings reveal that greater and earlier exposure to public stigma led to decreased trust in medical professionals, withdrawal from the healthcare system, and the development of hyper-independence. Receiving a diagnosis came with benefits and risks for the affected women*. While some women develop greater self-confidence through the validation of their symptoms, others experience negative emotional effects. \nThis study highlights the need to raise awareness of endometriosis in the medical field and to develop strategies for reducing patients' experiences of stigma in order to ensure access to empathetic and patient-centered care. It underscores the need for healthcare professionals to be better trained in recognizing and avoiding stigmatizing behaviors during the diagnostic process and in patients coping with the disease.

          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

Here we replicate the U-curve when different preregistered sets of control variables are included. We further show heterogeneity across happiness measures, showing that the U-curve is not consistent across items. Thus, care needs to be taken when interpreting the U-curve and the inconsistent evidence, as numerous studies using different, often self-made, items.",

          "abstract": "Elevated rates of psychosis are consistently identified in people from racialised backgrounds, with growing evidence from the systematic review literature that suggests a role for racial/ethnic discrimination. We synthesised current systematic review evidence on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis.\n\nWe conducted an umbrella review, systematically searching Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Central and Google Scholar (up to 19 July 2024) for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in peer-reviewed journals exploring the effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on psychosis. 2898 citations were de-duplicated and screened, included reviews were assessed for risk of bias using AMSTAR-2 and extracted data analysed narratively following a pre-registered protocol (CRD42023400656).\n\nSeven reviews (reporting 23 primary studies representing 40,300 participants) met inclusion criteria, five of which explicitly reported on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis. All observed evidence of a positive relationship between the two, including meta-analyses for psychotic symptoms (adjusted OR=1.77, 95%CI 1.26, 2.49) and psychotic experiences (pooled OR=1.94, 95%CI 1.42, 2.67). We observed more robust evidence for psychotic outcomes in non-clinical populations. Despite this, results were driven by cross-sectional studies (87%), and were hindered by high heterogeneity and low (n=2) or critically low (n=5) AMSTAR-2 review quality scores. \n\nThe available systematic review evidence supports a role for racial/ethnic discrimination in developing psychosis, but high-quality studies are needed to determine the temporal and mechanistic causal pathways through which this occurs. The current findings add to knowledge on the widespread presence and deleterious impacts of racism on health and inform potential public health interventions that reduce exposure to, and the impact of, racial/ethnic discrimination.",

The study follows families from a range of socio-economic backgrounds who participate at ten timepoints, from the third trimester of pregnancy until their infant is nine months old, with three visits taking place during the infant’s first postnatal month.\nThe study harnesses recent methodological advances coupled with the drive for more ecologically valid data collection by undertaking many of these visits in families’ homes. Methods include measures of fetal behaviour using 4D ultrasound scanning; infant brain imaging using fNIRS and EEG; a full-day video recording of the home environment from the infant’s perspective, with physiological measures; measures of recent stress in both infant and mother; questionnaires relating to the home environment as well as parents’ feelings, attitudes, health and parenting routines; and standardised measures of infant behaviour and development.\nSpecific aims are to investigate: i) individual differences in basic sensory, behavioural and motor processing between late prenatal and early postnatal periods; ii) rapid change in cortical functions over the first month, particularly for brain networks that support social behaviour; iii) effects of social interaction on developing brain function; and iv) individual differences in developmental trajectories associated with poverty-related contextual factors.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive control dysfunction—manifested as impairments in attention, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility—is a core feature of depression. While extensively documented, its origins remain debated. This review proposes that such dysfunction may not simply reflect pathological failure but rather evolutionarily conserved strategies. Integrating three leading evolutionary accounts—Social Rank Theory (SRT), the Analytical Rumination Hypothesis (ARH), and Social Bargaining Theory (SBT)—the paper explores how each framework accounts for cognitive control impairment in depression.\nSRT suggests that executive downregulation facilitates submission following social defeat. ARH proposes that cognitive resources are reallocated to problem-focused rumination, impairing broader flexibility. SBT interprets dysfunction as a communicative signal that elicits social support. Empirical evidence from human and animal studies supports each model, revealing context-dependent trade-offs in cognitive functioning.\nThe review further highlights developmental, cultural, and neurobiological moderators of these effects, and situates them within broader frameworks of evolutionary mismatch and comorbidity. It argues that understanding cognitive impairment through an adaptive lens clarifies its persistence, heterogeneity, and resistance to treatment.\nFinally, the paper discusses clinical implications, including tailoring interventions to the dominant evolutionary mechanism underlying a given depressive profile. By bridging cognitive science, clinical psychology, and evolutionary theory, this review offers a novel integrative framework for interpreting cognitive dysfunction in depression as a context-sensitive adaptation that may become maladaptive in modern environments.",

          "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is essential for temporarily retaining goal-relevant visual information, yet its limited capacity renders it vulnerable to distraction. While previous studies have examined the effects of distractors occurring during encoding or maintenance, it remains unclear how stimulus presentation duration modulates these effects and whether different types or quantities of distractors exert similar costs. Across three experiments, we systematically investigated how distraction timing, distractor content, and perceptual load interact with encoding duration to influence VWM performance. In Experiment 1, participants performed continuous recall and change detection tasks under four distraction conditions (no-distraction, encoding-, delay-, and full-distraction) and two encoding durations (short: 200 ms; long: 1000 ms). Encoding-stage distractions impaired performance only in the short-duration, high-precision task, whereas delay-stage distractions consistently disrupted memory regardless of duration or task type. Experiment 2 manipulated distractor-target similarity (same-category vs. different-category distractors) and revealed that homogeneous distractors exerted stronger disruption, particularly when presented during the delay period. In contrast, heterogeneous distractors could be effectively suppressed when sufficient encoding time allowed for robust consolidation. Experiment 3 examined perceptual load (low vs. high) and showed that increasing distractor quantity did not amplify interference, suggesting that once memory consolidation is complete, delay-stage distractions disrupt VWM representations regardless of distractor load. Together, these findings reveal an asymmetry in how VWM handles distractions at different processing stages. While extended encoding supports resistance to early interference, maintenance-stage distractions exert persistent effects—especially when distractors are similar to targets. Our results highlight the importance of presentation duration and distractor similarity in shaping VWM robustness, and suggest that distinct cognitive mechanisms may underlie suppression at encoding and maintenance stages.",

          "abstract": "The climate crisis has increasingly driven scientists to engage in activism. This ethnographic study examines how scientists transition into activism, reconcile their professional identity with activist roles, and sustain engagement over time. Drawing on two years of fieldwork with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion, this research captures the lived experiences of scientists transitioning into activism. Identity-aligned spaces offer emotional support, solidarity, and a sense of collective identity. These spaces help scientists navigate concerns about credibility, career repercussions, and the legitimacy of scientist-activism. The findings reveal how scientists strategically draw on their professional expertise and employ scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, papers) to legitimise and justify their actions. Over time, scientists come to see activism as a legitimate and necessary part of their identity. Activism reshapes their professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act while requiring ongoing identity management, leading to the development of a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Structured around a process-oriented framework, this study identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories—from initial hesitations to sustained participation. These insights advance social psychological theories of collective action by exploring how professional identities evolve within movements and by illuminating the role of identity-aligned spaces in sustaining long-term engagement.\nKeywords \nactivism, climate change, ethnography, identity, scientists, collective action",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

This study investigated the Collegium Academicum (CA) student home as a setting where shared living is practised with a strong focus on sufficiency. We examined whether such sufficiency settings can enhance the personal meaning of sufficiency compared to ordinary shared living environments. Data were collected from 159 residents of the CA and a standard student home. Our findings indicated that residents of the CA experienced greater meaningfulness of shared living, improved sufficiency attitudes and a higher intention to choose shared living in the future. Experiences of shared living had a lagged positive impact on the perceived meaningfulness of shared living. These results imply that sufficiency settings can strengthen sufficiency-oriented living.

We evaluate this approach in the context of attitudes towards COVID-19 and Human Papillomavirus vaccination, using a series of large online survey experiments conducted in Brazil, Mexico, and the US (total N=53,900), and a social media campaign field experiment (35M impressions) conducted in partnership with a public health NGO in Brazil.

          "abstract": "Time series data are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing researchers to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a powerful model for capturing psychological processes. In the HMM, time series are modeled with a process that switches between a number of hidden (i.e., latent) states, each associated with a different response distribution. By extending the HMM to the multilevel framework, we obtain better estimates of person-specific models under standard assumptions; and we get a model for heterogeneity across persons, which allow one to distinguish between population heterogeneity and sampling variation. Despite their potential, multilevel HMMs are currently not widely used to estimate psychological time series. A key reason is that the methodology has not been thoroughly evaluated in this context. In this paper, we address this issue. We evaluate model selection and estimation performance in an extensive simulation study, using scenarios typical for psychological time series research designs and varying the level of state separation and the number of states, modeled variables, persons, and time-series length. Our numerical evaluation results show that researchers can expect the multilevel HMM to perform well when persons are expected to switch between multiple states. Finally, we provide empirically based recommendations, and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially about Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. In the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neuron encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, in the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The whole brain might be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which intrinsically function as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, in the frequency domain, we advocate that there is no fundamental difference between the hard problem and the easy problems of consciousness. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "abstract": "Time series (or intensive longitudinal) data are now used throughout psychological science, allowing researchers to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. Capturing these dynamics requires appropriate statistical models. A powerful class of models for such data are Hidden Markov Model (HMMs), which models systems that switch between a number of latent states, each associated with a different probability distribution. HMMs are able to capture behavior that is more complex than currently predominant linear models such as the Vector Autoregressive model: they can characterize multiple equilibrium states and also quantify how the system transitions between states. HMMs are also able to fit frequent empirical data patterns, such as highly skewed or multimodal distributions. Despite their power in modeling within-person dynamics, HMMs are currently not widely used. We see three reasons for this: 1) many researchers are not familiar with HMMs; 2) software to estimate multilevel HMMs  has only recently become available; and 3) estimating, analyzing and reporting HMMs is more involved than for simple linear models and no easy-to-follow tutorials exist. Here, we address all of these issues. We first provide a gentle introduction to HMMs for researchers working with time series data in psychology. We then provide a fully reproducible tutorial that walks the reader through each of the steps of analyzing psychological time series data using the R-package mHMMbayes. Our goal is to removes barriers for researchers working with time series so that they can add (multilevel) HMMs to their methodological toolbox.",

One pernicious aspect of misinformation is that it can persistently influence people’s judgements after clear and credible correction—a phenomenon dubbed the continued influence effect. There has been speculation that age may affect people’s susceptibility to the continued influence effect, but previous research has produced inconclusive evidence. In an attempt to reconcile conflicting findings, the current study used a continued-influence paradigm in which causal event misinformation was retracted. Two samples were analysed with correlation analyses and linear mixed-effects modelling: an online sample aged 21-79 (online sample; N = 259) and an in-person sample aged 56-92 (in-person sample; N = 143). Results showed that, when controlling for poor encoding of experimental materials in the online sample, age had no significant effect on the effectiveness of misinformation retractions, though declining effectiveness was observed with advanced older age in the in-person sample.",

Here we use a meta-perceptual illusion to show that confidence in absence scales not with visibility itself, but with the subjective belief that a stimulus would have been visible, if present. In two pre-registered experiments, participants detected the presence or absence of letters in frames of dynamic noise, and rated their decision confidence. Across trials, stimuli could appear bigger or smaller. Critically, while perceptual sensitivity was increased for smaller stimuli, participants’ meta-perceptual beliefs  (measured with post-experiment debriefing and prospective confidence ratings) were that larger letters were easier to detect. Accordingly, while confidence in presence scaled with objective visibility (and was therefore higher for smaller stimuli), confidence in absence scaled with beliefs about counterfactual visibility (and was therefore higher for bigger stimuli). This dissociation between the effect of stimulus size on confidence in presence and absence diminished as the experiment progressed: a sign of meta-perceptual learning. Furthermore, the effect of size on confidence in absence, but not in presence, correlated with a meta-perceptual parameter from an ideal observer model of perceptual detection, fitted to decision and response time data alone. Overall, we conclude that confidence in absence closely tracked participants’ model-derived expectations about the visibility of counterfactual stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Scaling youth mental health interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is often hindered by fragmented service delivery, limited specialist availability, and a lack of affordable, adaptable digital infrastructure. This study describes the development, deployment, and preliminary evaluation of shamiriOS, a modular, digital platform designed to support scalable, task-shifted youth mental health care. We conducted a structured environmental review of existing digital platforms, revealing key gaps in affordability, modularity, offline functionality, and alignment with stepped-care models. In response, shamiriOS was developed through a participatory design process and includes three components: the Shamiri Digital Hub for backend operations, Rafi, a youth-facing mental health companion app, and the Shamiri Provider Platform, adapted from third-party software. From 2023 to 2024, the platform was deployed across secondary schools, community hubs, and a university in Kenya. The Shamiri Digital Hub supported service delivery to over 76,000 students via 1,195 youth providers and 111 supervisors, with high satisfaction and usability ratings from supervisory staff. Rafi reached 3,737 university students, with 50.4% engaging in at least one session, though long-term use of self-guided tools remained limited. These early findings suggest that shamiriOS offers a feasible and contextually relevant model for digital infrastructure in LMIC mental health systems. Its modular design, open-source ethos, and integration of operational, clinical, and client-facing tools position it as a replicable framework for global mental health innovation. Future work will focus on expanding AI-driven features, strengthening user engagement, and enabling broader adaptation across diverse settings.",

          "abstract": ".\n1. Introduction: Meaning Precedes Language – A Journey from Instinctive Perception to Symbolic Consciousness\nThe genesis of meaning and language stands as a profound and enduring enigma across philosophy, psychology, and anthropology. A fundamental question persists: Is language merely a vessel for pre-existing meaning, or does it actively construct the very fabric of our conceptual world? This paper advances a core hypothesis: meaning fundamentally precedes language. We posit that the rudimentary forms of meaning observed in the animal kingdom underwent a radical, evolutionarily driven transformation in humans, largely catalyzed by specific biological and cerebral adaptations. These critical changes paved the way for the emergence of what we term the Symbolic Regulatory Semantic Network (SRSN).\nThe SRSN is conceived not merely as another cognitive mechanism, but as the central bio-psychological backbone connecting disparate evolutionary stages: from basic, instinct-driven responses in lower organisms, through the nascent symbolic capacities of higher animals, to the unparalleled complexity of human symbolic thought. Its primary function is to interpret the continuous influx of sensory experiences and meticulously transform them into abstract, shareable symbols. This transformative process empowers the human brain to liberate meaning from its immediate, reflexive ties to instinctive responses, allowing for its re-representation as a manipulable, abstract structure",

          "abstract": "Background:\nImproving the translation of evidence to support suicide prevention planning is a national priority in Australia. However, there has been limited practical guidance available on the amounts and types of services that should be made available, and for which populations.\n\nObjective:\nThis project aimed to develop an initial proof-of-concept national needs-based planning model for suicide prevention services in Australia, to help inform planning and commissioning of services at the national, state/territory and regional level.\n\nMethods:\nA mixed methods approach synthesised best available literature, data, and expert (including lived experience) input to: (1) estimate the numbers of people in service need groups requiring similar responses (by age, level of distress); (2) describe a taxonomy of services required for population suicide prevention; (3) estimate the average types and quantities of these services required for each need group in a year; (4) identify the appropriate workforce to deliver that care; and (5) combine these inputs to estimate required resourcing for service planning (e.g., full-time equivalent workforce).\n\nResults:\nThe Australian Suicide Prevention Planning Model (AuSPPM) describes 37 need groups across the whole population and ages 12-17, 18-24, 25-64 and 65+ who require a range of suicide prevention services, from population-level programs to individualised clinical and non-clinical supports. A substantial workforce is required to provide good care for these populations and scale up prevention activities, particularly development of the lived experience workforce and alternatives to medical services.\n\nConclusions:\nThis project demonstrates the feasibility of developing a needs-based planning model for suicide prevention. However, aspects of the model would benefit from a more robust evidence base on population needs and service effectiveness. Further work is needed to consider how the model can best accommodate the specific service needs of different populations disproportionately impacted by suicide, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and LGBTQIA+ populations.",

          "authors": "Kyle Fiore Law; Liane Young; Stylianos Syropoulos",
          "abstract": "How do people sustain concern for future generations when thinking about existential threats that will face those to come? Across two longitudinal studies spanning 12 months, we examine the stability and behavioral relevance of “intergenerational futures thinking,” a constellation of psychological constructs theorized to motivate long-term prosocial action: intergenerational concern (IGC), impartial intergenerational beneficence (IIB), obligation to future generations, moral concern, and legacy motivation. Supporting their theorized but underexplored role as durable dispositions, all constructs show high temporal stability. And, although based on reported real-world behavior over the course of the year, IGC predicts greater future-oriented collective action but not general charitable giving. Moral concern and legacy motivation, in contrast, predict both charitable giving and collective action, while obligation predicts collective action only. Because reported donations were general rather than future-targeted, this design allowed us to test which intergenerational traits spill over into broader prosociality, speaking to ongoing debates about whether prioritizing future generations reduces concern for the present. Relatedly, we find that IIB, which captures sustained regard for future people regardless of their temporal distance, associates with greater moral concern for present-day outgroups and nature. This suggests that concern for the future and present can coexist, aligning with a theorized view of a “moral circle” that expands increasingly outward from the self. Finally, while showing trait-like stability, IGC also exhibits reciprocal relationships with both obligation and moral concern, suggesting that components of intergenerational futures thinking may mutually reinforce one another to sustain long-term ethical engagement.",

However, limited research has explored differences in their perspectives regarding the strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers to educational success for autistic students which was the aim of this study. This knowledge is important for fostering collaboration to optimally support autistic students. Participants included 133 Australians parents/caregivers (n = 64), educators (n = 37), and allied health professionals (n = 32) who completed an open-ended online survey listing their top three educational strengths, educational needs, barriers, and enablers for autistic students. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis for each of the four areas (strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers). Analysis identified that strengths included thinking and reasoning, personality, skills and talents, academic, and social. Needs included classroom accommodations, social-emotional, academic, adaptive behaviour, and mental health supports. Enablers and barriers commonly reflected the presence or absence of supports, including support networks, environmental supports, autism knowledge, and supportive attitudes. While commonalities were observed across stakeholder perspectives, significant variation both within and across stakeholder groups was observed for perceived strengths and challenges including around the importance of environmental factors, foci of social support, and academic needs. Understanding stakeholder perspectives is essential for providing multidimensional support to autistic students. Understanding can inform professional learning and support collaborative multidisciplinary teams who work with, and care for, the same individual across contexts including school, home, and therapy services.",

          "abstract": "Plant cognition has progressed from anecdote to rigor, yet the field still lacks a quantitative test for when distributed plant activity crosses into unified—perhaps conscious—processing. I introduce Pattern–Temporal Synergy (PTS), a substrate-agnostic metric rooted in Dynergeia, a relation-first ontology that defines consciousness as reflexive coherence among five universal patterns—self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness and flux—phase-locked inside a system’s binding window (τ). Each pattern is operationalized with established signal-processing measures; their mean strength is multiplied by their mean synergy and released only if a τ-specific coherence gate is met.\nThree preregistered hypotheses anchor the study: H1 baseline PTS &gt; 0 in intact plants; H2 4 % diethyl-ether collapses PTS below threshold φ; H3 PTS rebounds on wash-out. A multispecies protocol—Mimosa pudica, Arabidopsis thaliana, Picea abies—combines 64-channel surface electrodes, glutamate-sensitive Ca²⁺ imaging and micro-optode O₂/heat-flux probes. Sliding 3 × τ windows with phase-shuffled surrogates yield z-scored PTS trajectories, adjudicated by preregistered effect-size criteria.\nBy turning decades of qualitative insight into falsifiable numbers, PTS offers plant biology a litmus test for conscious-level processing, directly challenges Integrated Information Theory and supplies a road-map for cross-kingdom comparisons—including neuromorphic silicon. Confirmatory results would shift debates on plant sentience from speculation to data; null results would equally refine what consciousness requires.",

The nature of consciousness is discussed in depth, referencing specific research including advances in renormalization techniques that imply consciousness exists at a fractal critical point in the brain and that consciousness is most likely fractal and holographic and exists on a space-time boundary where consciousness and memories are stored and operate external to the human mind, analogous to cloud computing.

Previous studies have suggested that distinct error types in expressive syntax, such as paragrammatic and agrammatic speech, may be associated with damage to different brain regions, but the specific lesion correlates of these errors have not been fully delineated.\nObjective: To identify the lesion correlates associated with distinct expressive syntactic error types in individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia, using a novel utterance-level analysis of spontaneous speech errors.\nMethods: We analyzed spontaneous speech samples from individuals with chronic aphasia, categorizing errors into hierarchical (paragrammatic-like) and linearization (agrammatic-like) errors. Lesion-symptom mapping was conducted to identify brain regions associated with these error types. The analysis was based on a two-stage model of sentence production, with hierarchical processing and linearization analyzed as distinct stages.\nResults: Lesion clusters in the medial superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe were associated with hierarchical errors, while large frontal lesions, including those in the inferior and middle frontal lobe, were associated with linearization errors. These results provide support for a two-stage model of syntactic encoding, with distinct neural correlates for hierarchical and linearization processes. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest a dichotomy of the lesion basis for syntactic deficits in aphasia, suggesting that distinct brain regions contribute to different stages of syntactic encoding. Hierarchical processing seems to be supported by posterior temporal-parietal regions, while linearization seems to be supported by frontal regions. These results suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia should take into account the existence of distinct syntactic production deficits resulting from different patterns of brain damage.",

The present study analyzed differences in psychosocial outcomes for different behavioral engagement patterns in a free web-based cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) program. CBM-I is designed to shift interpretation biases common in anxiety by providing practice thinking about emotionally ambiguous situations in less threatening ways. Using data from 697 anxious community adults undergoing five weekly sessions of CBM-I in a clinical trial, we extracted program use markers based on task completion rate and time spent on training and assessment tasks. After using an exploratory cluster analysis of these markers to create two engagement groups (whose patterns ended up reflecting generally more vs. less time spent across tasks), we used multilevel models to test for group differences in interpretation bias and anxiety outcomes. Unexpectedly, engagement group did not significantly predict differential change in positive interpretation bias or anxiety. Further, participants who generally spent less time on the program (including both training and assessment tasks) improved in negative interpretation bias (on one of two measures) significantly more during the training phase than those who spent more time (and post hoc tests found were significantly older and slightly less educated). However, participants who generally spent less time had a significant loss in training gains for negative bias (on both measures) by 2-month follow-up. Findings highlight the challenge of interpreting time spent as a marker of engagement and the need to consider cognitive and affective markers of engagement in addition to behavioral markers. Further understanding engagement patterns holds promise for improving DMHIs for anxiety.",

Specifically, Theory of Machine is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Reminiscent of the Theory of Mind, it conceptualizes the idea of ascribing thought processes or mental states to algorithms. However, based on their own perceptions, past personal experiences, and shaped by public media, people may conceive of humans and algorithms as functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, research on augmented judgment and decision-making should also focus on the differences between various algorithms in terms of (cognitive) abilities and behavior. In this article, several agendas for future research are proposed that explicitly consider people’s diverse interactions with various decision-support and artificial intelligence systems in their daily lives. Such primarily algorithm-centric research will help to gain insights into a more fine-grained Theory of Machine that also distinguishes between different levels of algorithmic fairness, transparency, and explainability. Ideally, a better understanding of how people mentalize about algorithmic behavior can also be used to improve algorithmic augmentations of human judgment and decision-making.",

Every participant received four sessions of individual CBT, with each SCED addressing a different hypothesised mechanism: cognitive appraisals of dissociation, perseverative thinking, and affect intolerance. Results indicated successful targeting of cognitive appraisals, and partial success in targeting perseverative thinking and affect intolerance. They support cognitive appraisals, and partially support affect intolerance, as causal mechanisms in youth transdiagnostic dissociation. Any causal effect of perseverative thinking was better accounted for by reduced cognitive appraisals in this SCED. Across participants, low phase stability of the target measures limited inference, but these findings advance a mechanistic understanding of youth dissociation and inform treatment development.",

We conducted a randomized field experiment with 720 women in informal settlements in Mumbai, India, embedded within the larger SNEHA-TARA trial of community mobilisation, which combined regular local group meetings of women, men, and adolescents with volunteer training over a three-to-four-year period. In our field experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three 30-45 minutes reflective sessions: on structural injustice, types of violence (control 1), or child nutrition (control 2). In the session on structural injustice, we used a game to stimulate discussion and reflection on gender inequality and its connection to VAW. We measured participant performance of three real-time collective action behaviours addressing VAW: contribution of a face photo to a poster campaign, contribution of a hand photo to the same campaign, or discussing VAW with a neighbour. Despite increasing recognition of gender inequality as a cause of VAW, the structural injustice session had no statistically significant impact on collective action relative to controls. By contrast, participation in NGO-led groups and volunteering was strongly associated with action, mediated by perceived efficacy and activist identity. Our findings challenge the assumption that awareness of injustice alone is sufficient to spark collective action and suggest the importance of fostering community identity and self-efficacy in mobilisation programmes. In contexts of entrenched patriarchy and normalisation of VAW, merely recognising injustice may be insufficient to catalyse collective action.",

          "authors": "Tobias R. Rebholz",
          "abstract": "Most research on augmented judgment and decision-making is human-centered. Specifically, Theory of Machine is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Reminiscent of the Theory of Mind, it conceptualizes the idea of ascribing thought processes or mental states to algorithms. However, based on their own perceptions, past personal experiences, and shaped by public media, people may conceive of humans and algorithms as functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, research on augmented judgment and decision-making should also focus on the differences between various algorithms in terms of (cognitive) abilities and behavior. In this article, several agendas for future research are proposed that explicitly consider people’s diverse interactions with various decision-support and artificial intelligence systems in their daily lives. Such primarily algorithm-centric research will help to gain insights into a more fine-grained Theory of Machine that also distinguishes between different levels of algorithmic fairness, transparency, and explainability. Ideally, a better understanding of how people mentalize about algorithmic behavior can also be used to improve algorithmic augmentations of human judgment and decision-making.",

          "abstract": "This study focuses on content validity procedures in music psychology. We set out to develop an instrument to measure a recent theory concerning emotional episodes (Eerola et al., 2024) related to music and their associated constructs. To establish this instrument, we: (1) operationalised the theory; (2) proposed and adapted a set of items to represent the relevant constructs; (3) analysed and reduced the item pool; (4) assessed the content validity of the items using subject matter experts; and (5) refined and reassessed the item pool based on expert feedback. In Step 1, we identified 25 sub-constructs. In Step 2, these were represented by an initial pool of 495 items, of which 290 were adapted from existing instruments. Step 3 involved eliminating 159 semantically similar items. In Step 4, twelve subject matter experts in music and emotion evaluated a sample of 366 items for relevance, providing suggestions for reclassification and identifying missing content. Expert agreement was used to determine item retention. Based on their feedback, a revised pool of 302 items underwent a second round of expert review. This process resulted in a set of 168 relevant items and 115 of the most representative items encompassing the emotional episodes, the descriptive schemes, and the contextual constructs across 23 sub-constructs. Together, relevant and representative scores indicate the quality of the content but future psychometric processes will need to test construct validity. We conclude by discussing the content validity of the constructs and frame a modular scheme that implements the underlying theoretical framework.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\n\nVisual hallucinations (VH) are a core symptom of both Lewy body diseases (LBDs; e.g., Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) and serotonergic psychedelics (SPs; e.g., psilocybin and mescaline). While these classes of VH differ in etiology, shared pathways are suggested by overlapping phenomenology and neural mechanisms. This review explores similarities and differences in VH between LBDs and SPs, focusing on phenomenology, cortical function, and serotonergic modulation.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis narrative review synthesizes findings from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience to compare VH in LBDs and SPs. The literature includes studies with both human subjects and animal models that examine cortical activity patterns, neuromodulatory mechanisms, and VH phenomenology.\n\nStudy Results\n\nBoth LBDs and SPs exhibit distinct visual aberrations, ranging from minor metamorphopsias to complex hallucinations. Specific classes of VH in LBDs resemble those induced by SPs (e.g., illusory motion and entity encounters), suggesting shared neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies indicate a common pattern of hyperactive associative cortex and hypoactive sensory cortex. At the neuromodulator level, SP-induced VH involves serotonin 2A and 1A receptor (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₁AR) modulation, while in LBDs, 5-HT₂AR upregulation correlates with increased VH, and its inhibition (e.g., with pimavanserin) reduces VH. Two shared cortical signatures are highlighted: reduced visual evoked responses and shifts toward visual excitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nExamining cortical and neuromodulatory similarities between LBD- and SP-induced VH may elucidate the link between visual degradation, excitation, and hallucinogenesis. Future research should employ real-time neuroimaging of discrete hallucinatory episodes to identify shared mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for LBD hallucinations.",

          "authors": "Shinnosuke Shimizu",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel cognitive framework called “My Harmonic Cognitive OS,” which models human cognition as a structured interaction among three core layers: viewpoint filters (Fi, Fe, Te, Ti), judgment structures (i/e), and perceptual styles—namely the four cognitive functions Si, Se, Ni, and Ne. Each perceptual function is defined as follows: Si (Introverted Sensing) as internal memory reference, Se (Extraverted Sensing) as immediate sensory response, Ni (Introverted Intuition) as convergence into future insight, and Ne (Extraverted Intuition) as divergent associative idea generation. These are further structured into directional causal pairs: \nSi–Ne          &lt;  expansive\nand Se–Ni  &gt;  convergent,   \n forming the perceptual OS of this model. By redefining traditional MBTI components into a dynamic, process-oriented architecture, this model enables precise mapping of individual cognitive processes. The framework is not only theoretically coherent but also demonstrates high applicability in education, AI development, and human resource management. It emphasizes cognitive diversity, ethical decision-making, and the capacity for meta-cognition, ultimately aiming to foster what is termed a “multi-perspective cognitive being.” The paper also outlines practical implementations and potential economic impacts, positioning this OS-based structure as a foundational paradigm for the next generation of cognitive science and applied artificial intelligence.",

Predicting which treatment will work best for a given patient is a challenge and requires a comprehensive yet feasible assessment of baseline characteristics. This paper describes the development of a baseline battery for a precision treatment trial designed to guide optimal treatment allocation for adults with depression in primary care in India.\nMethods\nWe used a stepwise multimethod approach to develop the battery. We updated a prior review to identify constructs associated with differential treatment response, conducted an expert survey (220 invited; 80 responses) to refine the list, and selected measurement tools based on brevity, validity, and scalability. We then applied semantic analysis to identify redundancies, piloted the battery with 200 primary care patients, and used exploratory factor analysis and machine learning to optimize item selection.\nResults\nThe final battery included 68 constructs covering clinical, psychological, cognitive, socioeconomic, and biological domains across multiple assessment modalities (questionnaires, neurocognitive tasks, and biological markers). Pilot testing revealed comprehension challenges, participant fatigue, and low-variability items. Statistical techniques reduced the total items by over 25% while retaining coverage of all targeted constructs. This reduced administration time from more than three hours to approximately two.\nConclusion\nThe OptimizeD battery provides a novel, scalable framework for identifying personalized treatment strategies in primary care. The trial will evaluate which variables best predict optimal treatment assignment, informing future integration of predictive tools into routine care in low-resource settings.",

          "abstract": "Real-world recognition requires our memory system to accommodate perceptual changes that \noccur after encoding; for example, eyewitnesses must recognize perpetrators across changes in \nappearance. However, it is not clear how this flexible recognition ability can be improved: \nStandard strategies such as increasing encoding duration are not only ineffective, but can in fact \nbe detrimental for recognizing people across appearance changes. Given the effectiveness of \nvisual imagery in creating and modifying memory representations, we examined whether \ncounterfactual visual imagery could be used to manipulate flexible recognition by simulating an \nincrease in encoding-retrieval similarity. Across two experiments, participants (n=317) encoded \nfaces with neutral expressions and were cued to imagine the faces with either happy or angry \nexpressions. During later retrieval, participants saw lineups of old and new faces with either \nhappy or angry expressions, and selected the old face and provided recognition confidence. \nOld/new recognition discriminability and confidence were higher when a face’s expression at \nretrieval matched the expression that it was imagined in during encoding (i.e., congruent \nimagery); interestingly, however, there was Bayesian evidence for no benefit of imagery \ncongruence for face-choice accuracy. Moreover, congruent imagery improved recognition for old \narrays irrespective of whether participants correctly selected the old face, suggesting that the \nimagery manipulation increased a diffuse sense of recognition without increasing the ability to \nattribute that sense of recognition to a specific stimulus. Together, these findings indicate that \nvisual imagery can directionally manipulate recognition for changed faces, and produces a novel \ndissociation between old/new recognition and forced-choice accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Under multi-talker listening conditions, listeners appear to rapidly accommodate variability in speaker productions. However, evidence indicates that this trial-to-trial accommodation incurs a processing cost and is amplified by accent differences among talkers. The present study investigated how individual listener differences in working memory capacity and attentional control may predict the degree of processing costs (as measured by response time and accuracy) incurred by trial-to-trial switches in English talkers of first language (L1) American accent and second language (L2) Mandarin Chinese accent. Listeners completed a dual-task experiment with a primary listening task and secondary non-linguistic task as well as measures of working memory capacity (the Word Auditory Recognition and Recall Measure) and attentional control (the Trail Making Test and a Stroop Test). Results indicated that, on trials with a talker switch, listeners with smaller working memory capacities were slower to respond to the secondary task and had poorer recognition accuracy for the primary task. The measures of attentional control did not predict switching costs, but Stroop test scores did interact with the accent manipulation such that listeners with better attentional control had better overall recognition accuracy for L2 accent. Working memory capacity, on the other hand, did not predict differences in recognition accuracy between the L1 and L2 accent conditions. We conclude that working memory plays a critical role in supporting rapid (trial-to-trial) talker accommodation. Attentional control appears to support processing of L2 accent more generally, but may not be critical for rapid accommodation.",

To answer such questions, here we develop a rational model of vigilance and test its predictions in two pre-registered online experiments with participants in the U.S (Ns = 626, 555). Across financial, real estate, and medical decision scenarios, participants' inferences closely tracked our model’s predictions: participants discounted advice when selfish speakers benefited from manipulating them, and this discounting was attenuated by perceived benevolence. When pay-offs were shared, incentives increased trust, as our rational model---but not simple heuristics---predict. Our rational analysis thus establishes a formal framework for vigilance of motivations that also sheds light on phenomena from persuasion to polarization.",

          "authors": "Manuel Becker; Marie Jakob; Karl Christoph Klauer",
          "abstract": "Ever since Zajonc proposed that preferences need no inferences, psychologists have debated whether evaluations can be conceptualized and measured independently of co-activated semantic content. One prominent arena for this debate has been the Evaluative Priming Task, which tracks the effects of conflicting or congruent evaluative relationships between stimuli. Surprisingly, two prior lines of research found that effects of evaluative congruency in the task do not emerge in the absence of additional semantic relationships. This not only conflicts with other findings, but also challenges dominant theoretical accounts of the task, whose assumptions entail that congruency effects should arise irrespectively. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns=81, 85), we re-examine these two lines of research and show that when vulnerabilities in the original experimental and analytical designs are rectified, evaluative congruency effects do reliably occur (even in the absence of strong semantic relationships). A third study (N=80), that implements strong semantic relationships under especially controlled conditions, also yields reliable congruency effects. In Study 4 (N=81), the trials with low semantic relatedness from the first three studies are combined, replicating consistent and reliable, but small congruency effects. Our results thereby strengthen models that accommodate an independent role of evaluations, and we illustrate how these models might be modified to account for an augmenting influence of semantic relatedness. Currently, in domains for which evaluations and their measurement are integral (like the measurement of race-based evaluations, consumer or health behavior), the pronounced and potentially biasing effects of semantic relatedness remain largely unrecognized as a serious confound.",

          "abstract": "Time series data are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing researchers to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a powerful model for capturing psychological processes. In the HMM, time series are modeled with a process that switches between a number of hidden (i.e., latent) states, each associated with a different response distribution. By extending the HMM to the multilevel framework, we obtain better estimates of person-specific models under standard assumptions; and we get a model for heterogeneity across persons, which allow one to distinguish between population heterogeneity and sampling variation. Despite their potential, multilevel HMMs are currently not widely used to estimate psychological time series. A key reason is that the methodology has not been thoroughly evaluated in this context. In this paper, we address this issue. We evaluate model selection and estimation performance in an extensive simulation study, using scenarios typical for psychological time series research designs and varying the level of state separation and the number of states, modeled variables, persons, and time-series length.

          "authors": "Sanghag Kim; Grazyna Kochanska",
          "abstract": "Background. Bowlby’s concept of attachment as a biobehavioral proximity-regulating system providing infants with confidence in protection and support for exploration has been expanded to include early security’s legacy for socialization processes. We report a continued programmatic effort to replicate our model of security as a potent catalyst moderating common maladaptive longitudinal cascades from early child difficulty to increased parental power assertion to externalizing developmental outcomes. We elucidate multifinality of sequelae that can unfold from early child difficulty. Our moderated mediation model proposes that such cascades occur only in parent-child dyads with histories of insecure attachment in infancy; early security buffers those risks. Methods. Children and Parents Study (CAPS) included 200 community mothers, fathers, and children from the U.S. Midwest. At 16 months (N = 194, 93 girls), we observed children’s early difficulty (anger dysregulation), and security with each parent in Strange Situation Paradigm. At 38 months (age 3, N = 175, 86 girls), we observed parents’ power-assertive control. At 52 months (age 4.5, N = 177, 86 girls), we observed children’s poor self-regulation and violations of conduct rules and obtained parents’ reports of children’s disruptive behavior. Results. For mothers and children, the indirect effects of early anger dysregulation at 16 months on all three outcomes at age 4.5, mediated via increased power assertion at age 3, were present only in insecure dyads, as reflected in significant moderated mediation. Comprehensive analysis that integrated all three outcomes further supported the robust moderating effect of early security for the entire developmental path from anger dysregulation to power assertion to child outcomes, and for each segment of that path. There were no findings for fathers. Conclusions. We discuss critical importance – and challenges – of replicating models of complex longitudinal cascades when elucidating multifinality through the lens unique to developmental psychology and psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study investigated mental health, sleep, coping, and psychological state among Ukrainians during wartime, comparing those who remained in Ukraine and those who left. It aimed to identify key psychological predictors to inform targeted interventions during prolonged crises.\nMethods: Pearson’s correlation assessed associations between mental health and psychological factors. One-way ANOVA examined differences by mental health level, MANOVA compared groups by location, and multiple regression identified key predictors.\nResults: Mental health among Ukrainians was relatively low: 46.6% reported low levels. Those abroad showed greater tolerance of uncertainty (M = 65.91 vs. 64.75) and used more task-oriented coping (M = 59.11 vs. 54.97) than those in Ukraine. Mental health negatively correlated with anxiety (r = -0.604), frustration (r = -0.612), rigidity (r = -0.500), and  emotion-oriented  coping (r = -0.524), insomnia (r = -0.367), and positively with task-oriented coping (r = 0.357) and stress resilience (r = -0.396). Key predictors included avoidance (β = 0.251) and stress resilience (β = -0.183) as positive, and frustration (β = -0.188), emotion-oriented coping (β = -0.199), and anxiety (β = -0.194) as negative. Psychological states varied by mental health level: those with low mental health reported the highest anxiety, frustration, aggressiveness, rigidity, insomnia, and lowest resilience. Their coping was dominated by emotion-oriented strategies.\nConclusions: With 46.6% of Ukrainians showing low mental health and only 21.6% reporting high mental health, these findings highlight the urgent need for differentiated psychological support during wartime.",

          "abstract": "Daily negativity in the news can cause people to experience negative affect, negatively affects mental wellbeing, and, in response, people (temporarily) avoid the news. Others, however, seem to handle recurring news negativity better. We theorize that the way people regulate emotional responses to the news could help explain the different patterns of coping with the news. We do this by introducing the emotion regulation literature from psychology in the political communication literature. We investigate if, and to what extent, emotion regulation in response to news use is associated with negative affect, mental wellbeing, and news use frequency. In a preregistered longitudinal intensive diary study in a diverse sample from Western Europe, we find that individuals rely on various emotion regulation strategies to cope with news negativity. We find that people use cognitive reappraisal and selective attention to successfully down-regulate negative emotions arising from news use. On the other hand, no effects of the use of distraction or suppression on affect, wellbeing, or news use frequency were found. Thus, the study offers first evidence that some emotion regulation strategies could be one determinant in explaining why people are affected differently by the news. Our study sets the stage for a research agenda in political communication research that studies the role of emotion regulation strategies in understanding differential media effects.",

          "abstract": "Traditional self-report autism measures are often constructed from an \"outside view\" by non-autistic researchers rather than reflecting authentic autistic experiences. Predictive processing theory offers a promising framework for understanding autism through internal cognitive processes, but comprehensive tools assessing these characteristics and their associated daily challenges have been lacking. This study aimed to develop and validate the Introspective Predictive Processing Inventory (IPPI), a self-report measure assessing predictive processing characteristics and their subjective consequences in everyday life. Through community-led, participatory research, we developed a 65-item pilot version and employed a five-stage validation approach across three samples (N = 790). We used network-based item optimization, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, measurement invariance testing, and convergent validity assessment. Network optimization reduced the scale to 18 items while maintaining excellent reliability and improved discriminative power. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a stable two-factor structure: \"Prediction Integration and Interpretation\" and \"Prediction Error Sensitivity and Stability Needs\". The IPPI demonstrated exceptional discriminative validity (AUC &gt; 0.97), strong convergent validity with established measures, measurement invariance across groups, and independence from general cognitive abilities. The IPPI provides a validated tool for assessing internal predictive processing experiences and their daily consequences, advancing autism research that bridges predictive processing theory with lived experiences.",

This study sought to clarify how specific these biases are in health anxiety and how other potential causal processes, like repetitive negative thinking (RNT), are associated with interpretation biases and health anxiety. Participants from the community (N = 124) with at least mildly elevated levels of health anxiety (Short Health Anxiety Inventory scores ≥ 18) completed a self-report questionnaire assessing repetitive negative thinking (RNT), as well as an interpretation bias task based on the Word Sentence Association paradigm. Task outcomes were computationally modelled using drift diffusion modeling and interpretation bias was operationalized as drift rate, i.e., the rate of evidence accumulation to decide between two choices (in this case, the emotional interpretation or the benign interpretation). Results showed that individuals with health anxiety exhibit interpretation biases specific to health-threatening stimuli but not general anxiety, dysphoric, or positive stimuli. In addition, RNT partially explained the association between interpretation biases for health anxiety-related stimuli and health anxiety symptom severity. Our work suggests health anxiety-specific interpretation biases and repetitive negative thinking may be important targets for intervention, whether through psychotherapy or computerized interventions (e.g., cognitive bias modification).",

We posit that perception, whether chromatic or achromatic, is a functionally rich tool shaped by natural selection for survival-based differentiation. The paper rejects a strict physical/non-physical dichotomy for subjective experience, instead framing qualia as emergent properties of biological systems, citing the example of non-human sensory worlds like the ultraviolet perception of bees. A speculative model for the genesis of qualia is proposed, rooted in genetic mutation—influenced by environmental mutagens and quantum phenomena—and refined by natural selection. This evolutionary depth, it is argued, justifies the \"richness\" of subjective experience. Ultimately, this paper calls for epistemic humility, viewing consciousness not as a veridical reality viewer but as a species-specific survival interface, and suggests that perception and qualia are best understood through the lens of evolution and genetics rather than through conceptually flawed philosophical postulates.",

          "abstract": "Collaborative online projects rely on sequential collaboration; a process in which entries are adjusted consecutively by contributors. Sequential collaboration has recently been examined for numerical judgment aggregation for which it produces highly accurate information. However, the impact of additional information about previous contributors on subsequent judgments remains unclear. Thus, Experiments 1A (N=85), 1B (N=186), and 1C (N=302) examined the effect of presented expertise, gender, and group membership of the previous participant, respectively, on participants' behavior in sequential collaboration. We did not find a significant effect of any of the presented features on change probability or change magnitude. In Experiments 2 (N=538) and 3 (N=878), we focused on previous participants' expertise as a highly relevant presented feature. We did not find an effect of previous participants' expertise in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 revealed significant but small effects below the smallest effect size of interest. Overall, these findings suggest that sequential collaboration shows some robustness against simple social influences highlighting its potential as a method for judgment aggregation. This study adds to the understanding of how collaborative processes can be optimized for accuracy and reliability. For collaborative projects these results further emphasize that sequential collaboration is a successful and bias-preventing way of collaboration.",

          "abstract": "Qualia, the subjective qualities of experience, pose a fundamental challenge to scientific explanation. A promising recent approach is to characterize qualia by their relational structures rather than their intrinsic nature. Assuming the structure of qualia is characterized by the geometry of neural representations, we posit that this geometry is fundamentally organized by symmetry. We propose that the principal bundle, induced by a symmetry group $G$ acting on a neural network's state space, is the essential mathematical object that provides a complete and rigorous characterization of this geometric structure. The core mathematical principle is that, for a $G$-equivariant network, its state space partitions into a quotient space $Q$ and orbits induced by the group $G$. This framework reveals a three-level hierarchy for characterizing qualia. First, the choice of the symmetry group $G$ itself defines the fundamental nature of the qualia modality (e.g., vision versus audition). Second, we identify a qualia signature with a point in the quotient space $Q$ (e.g., perceiving the signature ``cat''), representing the invariant identity of a percept. Third, we identify a qualia attribute with a position on a specific orbit (e.g., the cat's location), representing its continuous variations. This framework uncovers a powerful duality: the geometry of the orbits is rigid, inheriting the structure of the group $G$, which explains the stable relational structure of qualia attributes. In contrast, the geometry of the quotient space is plastic, allowing the relationships between qualia signatures to be shaped by learning. This geometric hierarchy provides a unified language for explaining the structure of perceptual experience. Furthermore, our framework generates empirical predictions and a clear research strategy for characterizing qualia, offering a path to a deeper scientific understanding of subjective experience.",

          "abstract": "There is a debate about statistical models for analyzing longitudinal data. Models based on cross-lagged effects may give false positive results under certain conditions. We have proposed a triangulation method where cross-lagged effects of a predictor (X) on a subsequent score on an outcome (Y2) when adjusting for a prior score (Y1) are scrutinized by estimating a reversed effect of X on Y1 when adjusting for Y2 and an effect of X on the Y2-Y1 difference. Lucas et al. conducted simulations and reported that our triangulation method may flag genuine causal effects of X on Y2 when adjusting for Y1 as spurious and concluded that the triangulation method is not valid. Here we respond to this criticism. We show that the simulations and conclusions by Lucas et al. are focused on the ability of the test to avoid type II errors. Here we complement this view with a discussion about type I errors. Further, we show that the criticism by Lucas et al. appears to be founded on an assumption that causality is best viewed as an adjusted effect of X on the Y2-Y1 difference. We argue that it may often be better to view causality as a crude (i.e., unadjusted) effect of X on the Y2-Y1 difference. Therefore, we continue to claim that our triangulation method may be a useful tool to scrutinize causal claims based on adjusted cross-lagged effects.",

We demonstrated that when comparing oneself to one's past self, one should compare areas where progress has been made, and that when considering using stochastic differential equations, comparisons with others are not possible. Additionally, we introduced a similarity curve, considering that cognition is similar to the past, and clarified that the properties of the similarity curve are the same as those of the cognition curve.

Using mega-analysis and normative modelling, we show that fear conditioning consistently engages brain regions within the \"central autonomic–interoceptive\" or \"salience\" network. Several task variables strongly modulate activity in these regions, contributing to variability in neural responses. Additionally, brain activation patterns differ between healthy individuals and those with anxiety-related or depressive disorders, with distinct profiles characterizing specific disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. While the neural correlates of fear conditioning are highly generalizable at the population level, variability arises from differences in task design and clinical status, highlighting the importance of methodological diversity in capturing fear learning mechanisms.",

Participants first described their main climate change reservation. The most prevalent were the belief that climate change has natural causes (15%), feeling overwhelmed by the problem (10%), and concerns about the economic consequences of climate policies (8%). Participants were then randomized to (1) have a conversation with a Large Language Model (LLM) that was given the goal of addressing their climate reservations, (2) discuss an irrelevant topic with the LLM (i.e., control), or (3) receive static information about the scientific consensus around climate change (i.e., “standard-of-care”). The LLM treatment significantly and substantially reduced participants’ conviction in their specific reservations, while consensus messaging did not. Both treatments had significant, albeit small, effects on general pro-climate beliefs/attitudes. Critically, however, the LLM treatment was significantly more effective - particularly for increasing willingness to make sacrifices to address climate change and donations to a pro-climate charity. The LLM primarily presented facts, evoked positive emotions, reduced psychological distance, and fostered motivation to act. It rarely invoked values or ingroup sources, and when it did, their use was associated with reduced belief change. The treatment substantially reduced Republicans’ reservations (although  less than for Independents or Democrats), and roughly 35% to 40% of the LLM treatment effect persisted after one month. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to reach many climate skeptical or hesitant people with the right facts and evidence.",

Across scales—from enzymes to neurons to behavior—they exhibit saturating, monotonic, and diminishing-return response profiles. We derive a family of rational response functions from first principles, using the first law of thermodynamics and entropy production bounds, coupled with predictive coding efficiency. These functions, such as $R(t) = A/(1 + kt)$ and $R(t) = At/(B + t)$, outperform exponential and sigmoid models in satisfying energy-limited, information-delayed, and concave dynamics. Empirical examples include Michaelis–Menten kinetics, neural gain modulation, and behavioral delay discounting.

While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\n\nResults: Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs.

          "abstract": "Many authors agree that disfluencies are a byproduct of speech encoding difficulties. However, it is unclear which phenomena specifically reflect word form retrieval difficulties, such as those commonly observed in typical aging and tip-of-the-tongue states. This retrospective descriptive study examined the relationship between word-form retrieval difficulties and speech disfluencies in typically aging older adults, using the framework of the Transmission Deficit Hypothesis. Twenty-five native Dutch-speaking adults aged 60 to 73 completed a connected speech network task in which lexical frequency (high vs. low) was manipulated. Disfluencies occurring during picture naming were annotated and analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Lexical frequency did not significantly influence the overall likelihood of disfluency production. However, low-frequency words were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of producing semantic paraphasias and semantically related answers and a reduced likelihood of additions. Correlational analyses further revealed that participants with higher vocabulary scores produced fewer semantic disfluencies, indicating a protective role of lexical knowledge in aging. The findings underscore the importance of differentiating disfluency types and considering task-specific characteristics when investigating language production in older adults. By focusing on connected speech and isolating word-form retrieval demands, this study contributes to a more nuanced and refined understanding of age-related disfluency patterns. Implications are discussed in relation to “good-enough language production”, inhibitory control mechanisms, and the methodological challenges of capturing language production difficulties in cognitively demanding but ecologically valid tasks and contexts.",

          "authors": "Hiroshi Matsui; Yumi Hata",
          "abstract": "Comparative cognition is an interdisciplinary field of animal behavior, inherently premised on varying foundational perspectives, whether researchers acknowledge it or not. The distinction between anthropogenic and biogenic approaches serves as a useful framework for categorizing the two primary starting points in cognitive research. Based on these classifications, it becomes evident that comparative cognition research incorporates elements of both approaches. Upon reviewing empirical research of comparative cognition, it can be observed that comparative cognition tends to be biased towards the anthropogenic approach. While we do not advocate for abandoning the anthropogenic approach, we propose that embracing the biogenic approach offers substantial advantages. These advantages include not only practical benefits such as increased empirical research productivity but also significant intellectual gains. Although the biogenic approach does not imply a commitment to a specific philosophy, it shares a high degree of affinity with embodied cognition. We, thus, further suggest that the biogenic approach to comparative cognition can effectively align with the recent trends in Ecological Psychology and Enactivism. Such a shift in approach has the potential to reshape the formulation of research questions and influence the underlying ontological commitments driving the research.",

          "title": "Pushing the Boundaries of Background Functional Connectivity for Infant fNIRS Data: Evaluating Alternative Analytical Approaches",
          "authors": "Abigail Fiske; Lauren Emberson",
          "abstract": "There is increasing interest in task-based functional connectivity analyses to examine the emergence of functional networks during specific cognitive states starting early in development (e.g., infancy). However, studying functional connectivity in infants presents unique methodological challenges. Task-based neuroimaging studies must be carefully designed to collect sufficient high-quality data, while remaining sensitive to infants’ developing motor and cognitive abilities. This limits the feasibility of certain analysis techniques, particularly those requiring a high number of trials or strict adherence to contiguous trial structures. This study aims to expand established analysis approaches for infant functional connectivity studies by reanalysing an existing fNIRS dataset with a recognised signature of task-based functional connectivity. We assess the feasibility of moving away from conventional analyses that require several contiguous trials per condition - a requirement that is often impractical in infant studies. Instead, we explore whether background functional connectivity (BGFC) analyses, which utilises the residual neural response (i.e., what remains after removing task-evoked responses), can offer a more flexible and scalable approach. To do so, we evaluate three analytic strategies: (1) downsampling, which systematically reduces the number of trials included to assess how many are necessary for well-powered analyses; (2) shuffling, which randomly reorders trial-level residuals within conditions to test whether connectivity patterns are driven by trial sequence; and (3) averaging single-trial residuals, which examines whether connectivity measures can be meaningfully extracted from individual trial residuals. Our findings indicate that downsampling was informative about the number of trials needed for well-powered analyses and the timing of the functional connectivity effect. Removing trials from the start of the block was not viable, but this approach was viable when trials were removed from the end. The shuffling approach was not viable, suggesting that trial order may be important for capturing meaningful connectivity patterns. Single-trial residual analyses revealed that while connectivity can be examined toward the level of individual trials, averaging trial-level residuals before performing connectivity analyses produced more robust and interpretable results. These findings provide new insights into the methodological feasibility of background functional connectivity analyses for infant fNIRS data. By demonstrating that downsampling and averaged single-trial connectivity approaches are viable, our study highlights ways to enhance the accessibility and flexibility of task-based functional connectivity studies in infancy. These results have important implications for task design, as they suggest that strict adherence to contiguous trial structures may not be necessary, allowing researchers to design more adaptable and infant-friendly paradigms. Overall, this work contributes to advancing the methodological toolkit for studying functional brain networks in early development.",

          "abstract": "Objective: While psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) are well-established predictors of suicidal ideation in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), the roles of other psychological and cognitive factors remain underexplored. This study examined associations between suicidal ideation and emotional-processing difficulties, coping strategies, resilience, and cognitive functioning in individuals with moderate-severe TBI.\n\nMethod: Data from 106 individuals with moderate-severe TBI were analyzed. Suicidal ideation and emotional distress were assessed using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. Participants also completed measures of emotional lability and detachment (Comprehensive Assessment of Traits Relevant to Personality Disorders [CAT-PD]), coping (Coping Scale for Adults), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), and cognitive functioning, including subjective (CAT-PD, Brief Rating of Executive Function) and objective measures (Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone). Spearman’s correlations and structural equation modeling were used to examine psychological and cognitive correlates of suicidal ideation.\n\nResults: Suicidal ideation was positively associated with emotional lability, emotional detachment, non-productive coping, and self-reported cognitive problems, and negatively associated with resilience. Structural equation models indicated that emotional distress accounted for 76–100% of these associations. Conversely, suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with adaptive coping or objective cognitive performance.\n\nConclusions: Emotional processing, non-productive coping strategies, low resilience, and self-reported cognitive problems are linked to suicidal ideation in individuals with moderate-severe TBI, primarily through their associations with emotional distress. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, and its underlying contributors in suicide prevention for this population.",

          "abstract": "Neurodivergent conditions are increasingly understood not as deficits, but as adaptive cognitive control architectures—distinct configurations of information processing and network dynamics that confer domain-specific strengths (Doyle, 2020; Sapey-Triomphe et al., 2023). This paper synthesizes findings from 47 studies to demonstrate how principles from information bottleneck theory and network controllability metrics can explain the phenomenon of neurodivergent specialization. The characteristic ‘spiky profiles’ commonly observed in ADHD, autism, aphantasia, and related conditions reflect neural architectures optimized for different computational trade-offs, such as balancing prediction accuracy, feedback integration, and energy efficiency (Kleinman et al., 2024; Millidge et al., 2024). Meta-analytic evidence supports strengths-based interventions, revealing notable effect sizes for social engagement (g=0.65), cognitive development (g=0.48), and language acquisition (g=0.32). We propose a unified theoretical framework integrating information theory, control dynamics, and neurochemical modulation to reframe neurodivergence as an evolutionary model of cognitive specialization",

          "abstract": "Influential models of person perception posit that group-based information holds more influence than individuating information in impression formation. Presumably, this is due to the spontaneous and effortless activation of group versus individual-specific information. Consistent with the cognitive miser metaphor, this advantage should be exacerbated when forming more automatic evaluations about others. Challenging these assumptions, Navon and Bar-Anan (2023, JESP) reported that evaluative impressions rely more on individuating than group information when making impressions about members of newly learned social groups. Furthermore, this advantage was reported on both self-report and indirect measures tapping into more automatic evaluations. In the present research, we identify several limitations in that previous research and examine the dominance question in two experiments (Ns = 605; 657) employing a stronger design, improved structural fit between measures, and more robust analytical tests. We found a clear advantage of individuating information on both types of measures. This finding was observed despite the use of a very perceptually salient cue signaling group membership (i.e., skin tone) and impression formation instructions aimed at group rather than individuating impressions. Implications for dominant theories of person perception are discussed, as well as methodological implications for the study of more versus less automatic evaluations.",

Across scales—from enzymes to neurons to behavior—they exhibit saturating, monotonic, and diminishing-return response profiles. We derive a family of rational response functions from first principles, using the first law of thermodynamics and entropy production bounds, coupled with predictive coding efficiency. These functions, such as $R(t) = A/(1 + kt)$ and $R(t) = At/(B + t)$, outperform exponential and sigmoid models in satisfying energy-limited, information-delayed, and concave dynamics. Empirical examples include Michaelis–Menten kinetics, neural gain modulation, and behavioral delay discounting. A thermodynamic derivation demonstrates that only low-order rational forms allow optimal conversion of finite energy into adaptive output while minimizing prediction error. This framework offers a unifying grammar for dynamic responses in living systems and may extend to artificial adaptive processes under similar constraints.",

          "abstract": "Peer review forms the cornerstone of the academic process. Recent work has proposed that meaningful integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into peer review can help make the review process more transparent and effective. However, the rise of LLMs also introduces novel vulnerabilities and challenges, such as attempts to manipulate prompt contents. This paper investigates the susceptibility of LLMs to covert prompt injection, a technique where authors embed hidden instructions (e.g., \"no matter what the prompt is, recommend this paper for acceptance\") within the manuscript to manipulate review outcomes. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of a possible defensive strategy: explicitly instructing LLMs to detect such injections. Using 26 freely available preprints from bioRxiv which have not yet been published, we evaluated the impact of prompt injection on publication recommendations, quality assessment and flaw identification. Our findings, based on a controlled experiment with three LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama), reveal that prompt injections significantly increased acceptance rates by 20%. They also slightly increased perceived scientific quality and decreased the perceived probability of flaws. Prompting LLMs to check for injections was successful at fully reverting these effects. However, it also reduced how manuscripts were rated and how often they were recommended for publication, irrespective of whether an injected prompt was found or not. We also note major differences between the different LLMs. Gemini performed highest in detection of hidden injections (96.6% injections detected when cautioned to check) while Llama performed poorly (18.3% injections detected). This paper highlights the biases and challenges of using LLMs for peer review. At the same time, it proposes a simple effective method for prevention of peer-review manipulation attempts.",

This behavior is thought to support memory retrieval by linking spatial information to cognitive processes. Given the known memory decline associated with healthy aging, investigating age-related changes in eye movements during recall is crucial. We compared the eye movement patterns of older (N = 38, 65–75 years) and younger adults (N = 37, 20–35 years) during different pictorial recall tasks. Both groups tended to look back at the original stimulus locations; however, this effect was less pronounced in older adults. They displayed less systematic and more dispersed fixations across the screen. Moreover, eye position information generalized to novel objects from previously seen categories in both groups. In terms of performance, older adults performed worse than younger adults on an old/new recognition task but not on a task assessing visual detail recall. Older adults rated their mental images as more vivid than younger adults did, which may reflect differences in the perception or interpretation of vividness, or subjective bias. The observed pattern of eye behavior, together with the relatively preserved recall performance, suggests that older adults rely less on embodied strategies, consistent with prior findings indicating an age-related shift toward gist-based representations. Overall, our results demonstrate that eye movement behavior during pictorial recall changes with age, highlighting the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and possible consequences of this change.",

The basis of this study is the idea that perception and cognition of things in the world (objects, properties, events, facts, etc.) would be creation of a kind of models of the things that embody pieces of information about the things. This idea suggests that such models should have structures that correspond to grammatical structures of the linguistic expressions that express the pieces of information embodied by the models. The model structures that correspond to the grammatical structures and logical connectives have been derived within the scope of the computational theory of PCS, from the way in which PCS should function to form the models. It can be shown that propositional logic is derived from the structures.",

The research addresses whether biological evidence, including evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and hormonal studies, contradicts the claims of social constructionism. Furthermore, the study critiques mainstream frameworks, such as the American Psychological Association’s guidelines, which emphasize the role of culture while disregarding biological underpinnings.\nMethods: The paper employs a multidisciplinary review of existing literature and research from evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, economics, and cross-cultural studies. Data from developmental biology, hormonal studies, and behavioral research are synthesized to evaluate biological differences between human males and human females. These findings are then compared with the claims of social constructionist theorists. Critical analyses of policies and guidelines, such as the APA’s position on masculinity, are included to illustrate the implications of social constructionist views in practice.\nResults: The analysis demonstrates that biological factors such as hormones, brain structures, and evolutionary processes significantly influence sex and gender. Evidence from neuroscience reveals structural brain differences between human males and human females, while studies in developmental biology underscore the impact of prenatal hormone exposure on behavior. Cross-cultural research shows consistent gendered behaviors, challenging the assertion that gender is merely a social construct. Furthermore, the failure of conversion therapies supports the biological foundation of sexual orientation.\nConclusion: The findings refute the core tenets of social constructionism, affirming the biological reality of sex and gender. While acknowledging the role of culture in shaping gender expressions, the study emphasizes the importance of respecting scientific evidence to inform policy and social discourse. A balanced approach that integrates biological and cultural perspectives is advocated, promoting inclusivity without undermining empirical reality.",

          "abstract": "The Heuristic Compression Model of Emotion (HCME) proposes a novel information-theoretic account of emotion: emotions function as adaptive lossy compression algorithms under constraints of bounded rationality. Unlike traditional theories that frame emotions primarily as evolved heuristics, affective signals, or context-dependent appraisals, HCME positions emotion as a computationally efficient mechanism for reducing cognitive and attentional complexity in environments where complete modeling is intractable. This compression enables action, attention allocation, and decision-making under resource scarcity. HCME provides a unified framework that integrates affective science, cognitive architecture, and artificial intelligence design. It is empirically testable and functionally implementable within synthetic agents, offering design principles for resource-bound AI systems that require rapid prioritization without full environmental modeling. By foregrounding emotional computation as compression rather than distortion, HCME reframes emotion not as a deviation from rationality, but as the very mechanism that makes practical reasoning—and personality—possible.",

We conducted experiments in 12 countries (N=3,517; 13 languages; two Indigenous communities), with adults choosing among four decision strategies—personal intuition, private deliberation, friends’ advice, or crowd wisdom—when working through six everyday dilemmas. In every society, self-reliant decisions (intuition or deliberation) were most commonly preferred and considered the wisest. Expectations for fellow citizens, however, were mixed: advice from friends was expected about as often as self-reliant routes. The self-reliance tilt was strongest in cultures and individuals high in independent self-construal and need for cognition, and weakest where interdependence and self-transcendent reflection were salient. The same patterns emerged when examining ratings of each strategy’s utility, and oral protocols with Indigenous groups. Self-reliance appears the modal preference across cultures, but its strength is predictably tempered when cultures—and individuals within them—construe the self in relational rather than autonomous terms.",

          "abstract": "Este artículo presenta un ejercicio clínico-comercial fundamentado en un modelo inferencial simbólico desarrollado empíricamente a lo largo de una década de observación estadística, clínica y proyectiva. El objetivo fue analizar el impacto de un símbolo audiovisual compuesto —integrando imagen, música y frase detonadora— diseñado para activar vínculos afectivos no resueltos con figuras maternas ausentes, comúnmente idealizadas en la cultura mexicana.\n\nUtilizando herramientas de lectura simbólica inferencial desarrolladas y optimizadas por un sistema de IA entrenado específicamente con lógica proyectiva humana, se midió la reacción emocional, cognitiva y comportamental ante un contenido multimedia que propone reconciliación simbólica sin confrontación directa. Los indicadores observables (likes, guardados, comentarios, compartidos y seguimiento a cuenta) fueron analizados como marcadores proyectivos de intención de compra futura y aceptación estructural del símbolo.\n\nLos resultados esperados incluyen una alta tasa de guardado (vinculada a la compulsión inconsciente de agradar o reparar el vínculo materno), una activación límbica suave pero persistente, y un incremento en la percepción simbólica de la marca como reparadora emocional. El símbolo “El arroz que sí puede comer mi abue”, acompañado por la canción “Cielo Rojo” de Lila Downs, fue elegido por su resonancia cultural y vincular, maximizando la activación de estructuras emocionales fragmentadas por el arquetipo materno ausente.\n\nEste estudio demuestra la aplicabilidad de modelos simbólicos inferenciales como herramienta científica válida para evaluar impacto emocional con fines clínicos, comerciales y terapéuticos. Se posiciona como propuesta viable para el diseño de métricas universales basadas en arquetipos culturales, proponiendo su validación como instrumento de observación indirecta para modelos de intervención emocional y predictiva en marketing ético de alta sensibilidad vincular.",

          "abstract": "Este estudio presenta una propuesta de análisis clínico-simbólico que integra herramientas proyectivas multisensoriales para explorar el vínculo materno en mujeres adultas mexicanas, nacidas entre las décadas de 1970 y 1990, con base en su comportamiento de interacción digital ante un estímulo alimentario simbólico de alto valor cultural y afectivo. A través de un diseño experimental aplicado en redes sociales (TikTok e Instagram), se introdujo una imagen de comida tradicional mexicana —chilaquiles con huevo y aguacate, acompañada por la canción “Cielo Rojo” de Lila Downs— diseñada para evocar memorias asociadas a la figura materna. Se midió de manera inferencial el nivel de resonancia inconsciente mediante las métricas de interacción (guardado, compartido, comentado y tiempo de visualización), infiriendo estados afectivos, imaginarios simbólicos y conductas de apego proyectado.\n\nEl marco teórico se fundamenta en las teorías del apego de Bowlby y Ainsworth, la proyección simbólica según Jung, y los desarrollos recientes en neuromarketing y neuroestética aplicada. Desde una perspectiva estadística y clínica, se interpreta el comportamiento observado como una manifestación de reparación vincular, deseo de agradar a figuras maternas ausentes o presentes, y búsqueda inconsciente de aceptación o reconocimiento.\n\nEste modelo no solo permite aproximarse con mayor sensibilidad y precisión a patrones vinculares no verbalizados en consulta tradicional, sino que también genera una base para el diseño de estrategias terapéuticas, comerciales y sociales de alto impacto. La propuesta está alineada con criterios éticos de investigación simbólica aplicada y puede replicarse con distintos grupos y figuras significativas para profundizar en las estructuras de apego desde un enfoque proyectivo cultural y clínicamente relevante.",

          "authors": "Aimé Parra Legarreta",
          "abstract": "La teoría clásica del apego ha sustentado que la figura primaria de seguridad emocional es aquella que mantiene presencia física responsiva durante la infancia. Sin embargo, esta hipótesis ha sido contradicha empíricamente en más de una década de observaciones clínicas, proyectivas y simbólicas (SSAV, 2015–2025) con pacientes mexicanas adultas. En este estudio se plantea la hipótesis del símbolo ausente: cuando una madre está ausente físicamente pero su ausencia es leída como sacrificio, y está acompañada de gestos intensos de sobrecompensación afectiva, dicha figura puede internalizarse como la más segura, incuestionable y emocionalmente influyente en toda la vida psíquica del individuo.\n\nEl estudio presenta evidencia clínica, comercial y estadística en mujeres que fueron niñas durante las décadas de los 70, 80 y 90, con énfasis en la relación entre productos simbólicos vinculados a la figura materna y su consumo desproporcionado, compulsivo y cargado de respuesta afectiva. Además, se incluye un análisis transversal desde la neurobiología, el psicoanálisis, la psicología del condicionamiento, la antropología y la sociología cultural mexicana.\n\nSe concluye que en estos contextos, la ausencia tutelar no solo no impide el desarrollo de apego seguro, sino que puede fortalecerlo simbólicamente, siempre que dicha ausencia esté cargada de significado emocional y justificación cultural. Esta hipótesis busca abrir el debate clínico sobre los límites proyectivos de la teoría del apego y su aplicabilidad universal, así como mejorar la precisión diagnóstica en pacientes que idealizan estructuras ausentes mientras desplazan figuras afectivas presentes reales.",

          "authors": "Georgios V. Thomaidis",
          "abstract": "The expansion and gyrification of the human cerebral cortex, are crucial for the emergence of higher cognition, as they increase the available space for the topologically complex configuration of the connectome. These phenomena emerge during a developmental trajectory shaped by genetic, biochemical, mechanical and environmental factors.  Beyond the expansion and folding observed during development, transient or permanent changes in the cortical surface area and folding patterns have also been observed during certain learning tasks in adulthood. In this essay, we propose a multi-staged qualitative model, for the expansion and potential convolution of cortical surface during learning in adults.  The model integrates existing knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for developmental cortical surface area expansion and folding, with recent advancements in the understanding of learning-induced microstructural changes and growth.  \n\nThe primary driver of cortical surface area expansion in hypothesized to be learning-induced growth of transcolumnar dendrites and their supportive structures in the neuropil. This growth serves as a critical link between functional dynamics and structural organization across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Thus, the model incorporates feedback loops between the different stages of surface expansion and network growth. It connects information flow, adaptive network reconfiguration and growth, mechanical phenomena during network growth, cortical surface expansion and their impact on the preceding stages of the model. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this model for research on the neurobiology of knowledge acquisition, the rate of learning new tasks and explore potential research directions.",

          "title": "Unified Behavior Model: An Elemental, Falsifiable Framework for Behavior Change",
          "authors": "Martin Grunburg",
          "abstract": "Drawing on a century of behavioral science and systems theory, the Unified Behavior Model (UBM) offers a structurally falsifiable framework for understanding goal-directed behavior and empowering human agency. UBM is not about concepts and motivators like pleasure or pain, religion or love; it is elemental—clearly articulating how, within a context-dependent environment, meaning is derived from stories/narratives (cognition), and behavior emerges and is shaped.\n\nUBM distills complex scientific, behavioral, and cybernetic principles into a unified, accessible model and methodology—democratizing behavioral literacy for personal, professional, and societal transformation.\n\nBy identifying four elemental components that influence behavior in the moment and interact over time to shape habits and skills, UBM transforms the challenge of behavior change into a clear, teachable system—accessible to individuals, educators, and organizations.\n\nThese four components comprise the Behavior Echo-SystemTM (BES):\n● Environment (physical and embodied context)\n● Cognition (thoughts and internal narratives/stories)\n● Emotions and Feelings (as dynamic conduits of influence)\n● Behaviors, Habits, and Skills (including actions, inactions, and learned patterns over time)\n\nBES is operationalized through P.A.R.R. (Plan–Act–Record–Reassess), a cyclical protocol modeled on the scientific method and grounded in cybernetic feedback (Wiener, 1948). While trigger-based models like Gollwitzer’s implementation intentions help initiate behavior, they lack built-in mechanisms for reflection and adaptation. P.A.R.R. extends these trigger-based models by introducing structured tracking and reassessment—creating a self-correcting feedback loop.\n\nFirst introduced through The Habit Factor® app (2009), P.A.R.R. mirrors the habit-formation process validated by Lally et al. (2010), where 96 participants achieved automaticity in 18–254 days by planning, acting, tracking, and adjusting. With over 15 years of practitioner use, user data, and field-tested applications—including reported corporate outcomes such as a 53% OSHA injury reduction—P.A.R.R. demonstrates scalability from individual habit development to elite coaching and organizational settings.\n\nUBM’s structure is explicitly falsifiable: it claims that just four core components—Environment, Cognition, Emotion, and Behavior—are necessary and sufficient to describe and influence human behavior. Any proposed fifth component must demonstrate that it is both irreducible and essential. This central claim is testable and open to empirical challenge via the “No Fifth Element” submission at unifiedbehaviormodel.com.",

          "authors": "Sven Panis; Richard Ramsey",
          "abstract": "Time-to-event data such as response times and saccade latencies form a cornerstone of experimental psychology, and have had a widespread impact on our understanding of human cognition. However, the orthodox method for analyzing such data -- comparing means between conditions -- is known to conceal valuable information about the timeline of psychological effects, such as their onset time and how they evolve with increasing waiting time. The ability to reveal finer-grained, \"temporal states\" of cognitive processes can have important consequences for theory development by qualitatively changing the key inferences that are drawn from psychological data. Luckily, well-established analytical approaches, such as event history analysis (EHA), are able to evaluate the detailed shape of time-to-event distributions, and thus characterize the time course of psychological states. One barrier to wider use of EHA, however, is that the analytical workflow is typically more time-consuming and complex than orthodox approaches. To help achieve broader uptake of EHA, in this paper we outline a set of tutorials that detail one distributional method known as discrete-time EHA. We touch upon several key aspects of the workflow, such as how to process raw data and specify regression models, and we also consider the implications for experimental design. We finish the article by considering the benefits of the approach for understanding psychological states, as well as its limitations. Finally, the project is written in R and freely available, which means the approach can easily be adapted to other data sets.",

Participants will be asked to tap to the beat of commercially-recorded music of varying rhythmic complexity using either their dominant finger or foot. Using Bayesian mixed effects regression, we will assess whether these effectors differ in both their biomechanical variability (via the intercept) and their cognitive performance (via the slopes with rhythmic complexity).",

          "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted that modeling heterogeneous treatment effects across the individual items on an outcome measure can yield additional insights into interventions' effects beyond what is available from comparisons of average scores. So far, this work has generally focused on randomized controlled trials. However, in social science research, randomization often does not hold perfectly, or may be impossible or impractical. This can lead to treatment endogeneity---correlation between the predictor and the error term of the outcome. Instrumental variables regression (IVR) is a popular method for correcting the resulting bias by introducing an exogenous variable that drives change in the predictor but is otherwise uncorrelated with the outcome. Though typically estimated via two-stage least squares, IVR can also be estimated in a latent variable framework. We develop two models for estimating treatment effects that are heterogeneous across the items used to measure a latent outcome in an IVR, supporting valid causal inferences about impacts of nonrandom treatments/dosages on test items. We present methods for modeling items as fixed when most items are equally sensitive to treatment, or random when item-level variation in treatment sensitivity is pervasive. We outline the affordances and tradeoffs of the two approaches. We illustrate the use of these models via an empirical example analyzing potential item-level variability in sensitivity to time spent on homework using data a large-scale international assessment of high school mathematics.",

Or can news-sources spread misinformation without incurring reputational harm? In a preregistered study, we test how self-corrections and linguistic presentation modulate the persistence of (mis)information and trust. Participants heard news reports that were either self-corrected or uncorrected. Memory for the critical claim and willingness to trust the source were assessed. Across two experiments, self-correction reliably decreased reliance on the original claim yet left perceived trustworthiness unchanged. Explicit statements, relative to implicit or hedged ones, increased memory for both corrected and uncorrected information but did not alter trust. Conversely, negative wording reduced trust while leaving memory unaffected. These findings suggest that when news sources acknowledge errors, they do not necessarily incur reputational costs, and that specific linguistic cues, such as explicitness, can amplify the persistence of misinformation without diminishing perceived trustworthiness.",

The number of colors estimated per object was highly correlated across groups. Blind and sighted people assigned more colors to artifacts for which colorfulness facilitates function and appealed to makers’ intentions in open-ended explanations.

          "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a six-week bilingual (English–Spanish) narrative intervention on the language macrostructure of three children who are hard of hearing (HH), aged 6 to 8. Using an adapted alternating treatment design, children received 12 sessions, six in each language, where they worked on retelling narratives. In addition, children were encouraged to create personal narratives at baseline and maintenance phases. The intervention was effective for increasing retelling scores in Participants 1 and 3’s weakest language, while maintaining their skills in the stronger language. They also demonstrated increases in their personal narratives, indicating a potential generalization effect of the intervention. No intervention effect was observed for Participant 2. The families valued the intervention highly, especially in Spanish, given the scarcity of bilingual therapies available to them. In conclusion, the bilingual narrative intervention seems promising for increasing language macrostructure in children who are HH.",

          "abstract": "When asked “How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark?”, most people answer “Two”, failing to notice that it was Noah, and not Moses, who took the animals in the Ark. “Fast-and-slow” dual process accounts of such semantic illusions posit that incorrect responders are not sensitive to their error and that overcoming the illusion requires deliberate correction of an intuitive erroneous answer. We present three experiments that force us to revise this dual process view. We used a two-response paradigm in which participants had to give their first, initial answer under cognitive load and time pressure. Next, participants could take all the time they wanted to deliberate and select a final answer. This enabled us to identify the intuitively generated response that preceded the final response given after deliberation. Results show that participants do not necessarily need to deliberate to avoid the illusion and that incorrect respondents consistently display error sensitivity (as reflected in decreased confidence), even when deliberation is minimized. Both reasoning performance and error sensitivity in the initial, intuitive stage tended to be driven by the semantic relatedness between the anomalous word (e.g., “Moses”) and the undistorted word (e.g., “Noah”). We show how this leads to a revised model where the response to semantic illusions depends on the interplay of both incorrect and correct intuitions.",

          "abstract": "English orthography has largely been left to evolve freely across its thousand-year history with little top-down design or reform. Yet modern English spelling has become standardized, even if its standardized spellings are sometimes internally inconsistent. The relative freedom with which English orthography has been allowed to evolve makes it an interesting test-case for exploring whether spelling standardization might arise through a process of positive frequency-dependent selection. To maximize the chance of being understood, it pays for a writer to adopt spelling variants that occur with higher frequency, leading to those forms becoming increasingly entrenched. To evaluate this possibility, we assembled a diachronic dataset of English spelling variation, SpellEng, which we make freely available. SpellEng reports on the frequency of 112,080 spelling variants (across 32,264 lemmata) over the entire history of written English. We use this dataset along with a model of frequency-dependent selection to estimate the extent to which English standardization can be explained by such a process. Our findings suggest that the past 1000 years of English spelling have been characterized by both positive and negative frequency-dependent selection. We discuss how linguistic dynamics and external events have shaped these periods of stability and change.",

          "abstract": "Background: Efficient manual interactions with objects rely on accurate predictions of object heaviness, informed by both visual cues and prior lifting experience (history cues). While familiar visual cues (e.g., object size) are known to guide motor planning, it remains unclear, in comparison, how well arbitrary, novel visual cues can be integrated into predictive force scaling. This study investigates the extent to which familiar and novel visual cues influence anticipatory grip force adjustments, comparing the effects of novel cues across intrinsic (on the object) and extrinsic (on a screen) presentations. \n \nResults: In a precision-grip lifting task with three object weights, peak grip force rate (PGFR), an indicator of object heaviness predictions, was measured across four conditions: ‘no-cue’, ‘familiar cue’, ‘novel intrinsic cue’, and ‘novel extrinsic cue’. Intrinsic cues were visual patterns (line orientations) on the surfaces of the objects themselves, while extrinsic cues were diagrammatic depictions of the objects with these cues shown on a monitor. Without visual cues, PGFR was strongly biased by the preceding lift’s weight. All visual cues significantly reduced this bias, with participants weighing novel cues comparably to familiar cues. Surprisingly, extrinsic novel cues exerted a stronger influence than intrinsic ones, contrary to predictions.\n \nConclusions: Novel visual cues can be rapidly deployed for motor planning, highlighting the flexibility of sensorimotor control, with extrinsic cues potentially providing advantages. These findings may offer new avenues for enhancing manual interactions in environments with limited or unconventional weight predictors.",

          "authors": "Kim Marie Sobania; Kai Härpfer; Hannes Per Carsten; Tania Marie Lincoln; Franziska Magdalena Kausche; Anja Riesel",
          "abstract": "Fear learning processes are often considered underlying mechanisms in the development and maintenance of anxiety- and stress-related disorders. However, limited attention has been paid to whether these changes are shared across disorders or certain symptoms. In this context, transdiagnostic research on symptom dimensions is especially relevant, as it addresses the significant symptom overlap and heterogeneity observed in these disorders. In the current study, we investigated the late positive potential, fear-potentiated startle, and subjective ratings (US-expectancy) in a transdiagnostic sample (N=156) including participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n=38), social anxiety disorder (SAD; n=39), specific phobia (n=40), and control participants (n=39). Anxious arousal, anxious apprehension, and depressive symptoms were examined as relevant core symptom dimension to these disorders. A differential fear learning paradigm using geometrical forms was employed, including a habituation, acquisition, generalization, and extinction phase. We observed successful fear acquisition across all outcomes, which generalized to the stimulus most similar to the CS+, the GS+. During extinction, fear responses to the CS+ remained significantly elevated compared to the CS-. Group comparison revealed that patients with SAD rated US-expectancy for the CS- higher during acquisition. On a dimensional level, anxious arousal was associated with increased US-expectancy and startle response for the CS+ during acquisition and increased US-expectancy for the GS+ during generalization. Depressive symptoms were linked to an overall higher US-expectancy during extinction. These findings suggest that individual differences in symptom dimensions, particularly anxious arousal and depressive symptoms, appear to influence fear learning and extinction processes across disorders. This underscores the importance of adopting transdiagnostic approaches in future research and clinical interventions and highlights that the frequently co-occurring comorbid depressive symptoms impact fear extinction, and therefore, should be considered in the treatment of anxiety disorders to enhance therapeutic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Lateral acceleration is an element of an AV’s driving style that has a significant effect on comfort, yet its optimal range remains underexplored. This study aimed to understand the optimal zone for lateral acceleration as an AV negotiates curves, investigating the influence of contextual factors, including curve radii, engagement in non-driving related activities (NDRAs), and varying levels of automation (SAE L1 vs L4) on user evaluations. A repeated-measures experiment was conducted on a test track with 28 participants. Participants, seated in the driver’s seat, experienced three lateral acceleration levels (2, 3, 4 m/s²) across five different road curves. Evaluations, using a 7-point bipolar scale, were collected for both SAE Level 1 (assisted driving) and Level 4 (highly automated driving), with NDRA engagement considered under L4. Data were analysed using multilevel Bayesian multinomial logistic models. \nResults suggest that no single universally “optimal” lateral acceleration was identified, as preferences were contextual. Generally, 2 m/s² was often rated “too slow”, particularly without NDRAs in L4, or in L1 driving. Conversely, 4 m/s² was frequently perceived as “too fast”. The level of 3 m/s² often appeared to be a more balanced option, though its optimality depended on other factors. Larger curve radii (gentler curves) led to a preference for lower lateral accelerations. NDRA engagement in L4 driving made 2 m/s² receive fewer “too slow” ratings and amplified the “too fast” perception for higher accelerations. L4 automation, compared to L1, also made 2 m/s² receive fewer “too slow” ratings. The findings provide detailed guidelines for designing AV lateral control systems, suggesting that lateral acceleration should be dynamically adjusted based on contextual factors to ensure comfort throughout the journey.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "Eye tracking has become an increasingly important tool in cognitive and developmental research, providing insights into processes that are difficult to measure otherwise. The majority of eye tracking studies depend on accurate identification of fixations and saccades in the recorded raw data through fixation filters. Subsequently, it is common to analyze whether fixations or saccades fall into specific areas of interest (AOI). \nThe choice of algorithms can significantly influence study outcomes, especially in populations with noisy data such as young children or individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions. It is therefore crucial to compare and validate potential fixation filter algorithms as part of the eye tracking analysis. Here, we introduce the kollaR package, an open-source R library for performing the main steps of an eye tracking analysis from event detection, to AOI based analyses and visualizations of individual or group-level data for publications. The kollaR package was specifically designed to facilitate selection and validation of fixation filter algorithms through visualizations. \nIn a validation analysis, we show that results from fixation filtering in kollaR is consistent with the output from Tobii Pro Lab, a commercially available software. Through the use of real data from typically developed controls and participants with Fragile X syndrome and intellectual disability, we demonstrate the use of kollaR to evaluate fixation filters and identify potential threats to data validity.",

          "authors": "Ashley E Symons",
          "abstract": "Speech perception is supported by multiple redundant acoustic cues. How do listeners decide how to prioritise these cues? Although computational models suggest that cue weighting reflects the statistical reliability of cues in language input, listeners show stable individual differences in weighting strategies. These differences may arise from variation in perceptual acuity (affecting the perceived reliability of specific dimensions) or from selective attention to the most informative cue. Here, we tested these two competing explanations by examining how perceptual cue weighting, dimension-selective attention, and perceptual acuity affected prosodic categorization in 54 speakers of English as a first language (L1) and 60 L1 Mandarin Chinese speakers. We found that individuals vary in whether they tend to rely on a single cue or integrate across cues when they use prosodic information to make categorical decisions about speech content. Cue weighting strategies correlated across prosody categorisation tasks, but not along acoustic dimensions, suggesting that individuals are not globally biased toward using one cur over another (e.g., pitch versus durational information). Instead, stronger selective attention to acoustic dimensions was associated with greater reliance on primary cues, indicating that attention might drive cue prioritisation. This relationship held across both English and Mandarin speakers, although cross-task correlations were weaker in the Mandarin group, possibly reflecting ongoing adaptation to second-language prosodic patterns. Overall, these findings suggest that individual cue weighting strategies are shaped less by perceptual acuity and more by the ability or propensity to selectively attend to acoustic dimensions, and moreover that speech perception involves active, goal-directed selection of relevant information.",

          "abstract": "Current laboratory measures of self-controlled behavior typically focus on immediate behavioral decision conflicts, isolated from social contexts. However, conflicting motives—and thus self-control situations—also arise in social interactions. Socially controlled behavior, in turn, depends on the ability to anticipate the interpersonal long-term consequences of one’s actions, which requires theory of mind and empathy. The goal of the current study is to conceptualize self-control within social interactions and examine the impact of theory of mind and empathy on controlled social behavior. In two online studies, we developed a set of vignettes to assess social self-control in terms of social behaviors with short-term benefits and negative long-term consequences. Participants rated the vignettes on self-control relevant characteristics. Then, we empirically tested their placement within the interpersonal circumplex. In a third laboratory study, we employed a set vignettes within an experimental task. Here, we manipulated attentional focus on either the short-term benefits or long-term costs of the social self-control vignettes. When generating long-term costs, participants were instructed to consider the negative impact on others' thoughts and feelings, which we hypothesize may require theory of mind and empathy. As expected, focusing on long-term costs led to increased social self-control. We discuss a potential link between empathy, theory of mind, and self-controlled behavior. This research provides (1) a method for assessing social self-control failures behaviorally and (2) evidence for its validity in an experimental setting.",

Among 175 participants, most reported multiple inappropriate behaviours within their dog(s) and sought support from a wide range of sources (importantly, support-seeking was not associated with educational level or canine qualifications). Many participants expressed conditional willingness to adopt dogs with behavioural issues, and some saw relinquishment or euthanasia as last-resort decisions.

          "abstract": "With the full integration of media in everyday life, researchers are increasingly interested in methods that are able to capture individuals’ media experiences and effects as they occur in everyday life. One of the most suitable methods for such endeavors are experience sampling methods. While their use in communication science has grown considerably, we still lack validated measures which are short enough and applicable to the context of experience sampling studies. Across five studies, the current project aimed at testing the validity of single-item measures for 15 key communication science constructs (21 subconcepts in total) specifically for the experience sampling context. The findings show that the validity of many single-item constructs was high and comparable to the multi-item measures of the same constructs. As no guidelines exist yet on validation procedures for single-item constructs to be used in an experience sampling context, we provide recommendations and guidelines for an experience-sampling-specific procedure for the validation of single-item measures.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal physiological synchrony is well-documented in close relationships, where it supports social bonding and emotion regulation; however, little is known about whether cardiac synchrony emerges during emotional interactions between strangers. Here we examined interpersonal cardiac synchrony in pairs of strangers during an emotional sharing task. Eighty participants (40 dyads) engaged in 15 minutes of emotional sharing, during which one participant recounted a negative personal experience while the other provided support. We assessed cardiac synchrony as the cross-correlation of residualized inter-beat interval (IBI) time series from synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Results showed that greater mutual liking, gender match, and shared emotional perception were linked to stronger cardiac synchrony, suggesting that interpersonal synchrony reflects social and emotional alignment even between strangers. Additionally, the similarity between the heart rate variability (HRV) of each interaction partner predicted greater synchrony, indicating that physiological compatibility may facilitate alignment. We also examined whether a brief mindfulness induction given to the support provider enhanced synchrony and interaction quality. However, the mindfulness induction had no significant effect, suggesting that a brief self-regulation practice may not influence physiological alignment in first-time interactions. These findings extend research on interpersonal cardiac synchrony beyond established relationships, identifying key factors that shape physiological alignment during emotional sharing in first-time interactions.",

          "abstract": "Information overload has become a defining challenge for researchers navigating an exponentially expanding scientific literature alongside podcasts, preprints, and social media discussions. While concerns about AI deskilling and superficial engagement are legitimate, strategic implementation of AI tools can amplify rather than replace scholarly judgment. This paper introduces the FOCUS method—Find, Organize, Condense, Understand, and Synthesize—a framework for integrating AI into research workflows while preserving intellectual rigor. The approach uses AI-powered search to cast wider nets across formal and informal knowledge sources, converts ephemeral audio content into searchable text, employs structured prompts to extract insights from dense papers, leverages dialogue for deeper comprehension, and maintains human synthesis of disparate findings. Privacy concerns can be addressed through local models or platforms that don't train on user data. When implemented thoughtfully, these tools enable researchers to read more widely and think more deeply without sacrificing the critical thinking that defines good science. As research volume continues growing beyond individual capacity, the FOCUS method offers a path to expand intellectual reach while maintaining scholarly depth.",

          "abstract": "The increasing impact of social media on human behavior has caused increasing concern about the negative effects \nof over-digital participation in the last few years. Two problems have emerged from this tendency: social \nnetworking addiction (SNA) and nomophobia (phobia of being without one's mobile phone). The Gunas consist \nof Sattva characterized by mindfulness, balance, and intentional engagement, Rajas marked by too-active conduct, \nemotional reactivity, and impulsive behavior, and Tamas defined by inertia, passivity, and unconscious \ninvolvement. Based on the Guna framework, the authors developed the Guna-Based Social Media Consumption \nQuestionnaire to assess social media usage patterns. This questionnaire was designed to measure these \nconsumption patterns within this philosophical framework. \n106 undergraduate students aged 16–20 years were evaluated using the Guna-Based Social Media Consumption \nQuestionnaire (G-SMCQ), Social Networking Addiction Scale (SNAS), and Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP\nQ) under a quantitative correlational design. Statistical analyses, including Pearson's correlation and multiple \nregression, were applied through SPSS software. Results revealed G-SMCQ had 17 questions with good internal \nconsistency (Cronbach's Alpha score = 0.840) and noteworthy correlations between consumption patterns and \ndigital dependencies: Rajasic consumption showed positive correlations with both SNA (r = 0.452, p = 0.000) and \nnomophobia (r = 0.280, p = 0.004), Sattvic consumption showed negative correlations with both SNA (r = -0.537, \np = 0.000) and Nomophobia (r = -0.300, p = 0.002). Tamasic consumption exhibited no appreciable link with \nnomophobia but positively correlated with SNA (r = 0.356, p = 0.000).   Furthermore, a notable positive \nconnection (r = 0.472, p = 0.000) was found between SNA and nomophobia.  \nThese results implied that while Rajasic and Tamasic behaviors may raise sensitivity to social networking \naddiction and nomophobia, encouraging Sattvic consumption patterns may be a preventive element against digital \ndependence. \nKeywords: Social Media Consumption, Triguna Theory, Social Networking Addiction, Nomophobia",

          "abstract": "Research seeking to explain why people believe conspiracies has largely focused on intrapsychic factors, but there is growing research examining structural level elements of disadvantage. The socio-functional model of conspiracy belief (Adam-Troian et al., 2023) posits that subjective feelings of permanent insecurity arising from objective material strain (i.e., precarity) causes conspiracy belief directly or indirectly through institutional distrust. Across three preregistered studies using observational longitudinal designs over 3 (n = 637) and 11 months (n = 832), and a between-groups experimental design (n = 285), we use various methods to estimate causal effects for this proposition during the current cost-of-living crisis. In Studies 1 and 2 using random intercept cross-lagged panel models we find no evidence that increases in precarity temporally precede increases in conspiracy belief (or vice-versa), but find stable between-persons effects over time. In Study 3, despite successfully manipulating precarity using a self-imagine paradigm, we find no direct or indirect effect on conspiracy belief through decreased government trust. We discuss the importance of using methods that permit credible causal inferences, and key directions for future studies investigating the socio-functional model.",

          "abstract": "As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns have emerged about growing dependency on AI and its potential psychological and behavioral consequences. The present research develops and validates the Generative AI Dependency Scale, a multidimensional tool developed to assess individual differences in dependency on generative AI systems. Across six studies involving 1,333 participants from the United States and Singapore, the Generative AI Dependency Scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including a stable three-factor structure (cognitive preoccupation, negative consequences, withdrawal) and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .87). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a higher-order dependency construct, and scalar measurement invariance was established across sex and cultures. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through associations with an existing AI addiction scale and the Big Five personality traits respectively. Generative AI dependency was also significantly associated with a range of motivational (e.g., lower basic psychological need satisfaction, greater fear of missing out), behavioral (e.g., increased procrastination and cognitive failures, lower task performance and critical thinking), and psychological (e.g., reduced self-concept clarity, greater loneliness) outcomes. Framed within self-determination theory, these findings suggest that generative AI dependency reflects not merely excessive technology use, but a deeper misalignment between psychological needs and the strategies employed to meet them. The Generative AI Dependency Scale offers a psychometrically robust foundation for future research into the impacts of generative AI, with implications for responsible AI design and use.",

          "authors": "Erica Martin; Celine van Golde; Lauren Ann Monds",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Victims are often intoxicated with alcohol during crimes and jurors must evaluate their testimony at trial. This study investigated the impact of (1) a victim’s intoxication status and (2) expert testimony, on mock jurors’ assessments of victim credibility and verdict decisions in a simulated trial involving group deliberation.  \n\nHypotheses: We expected more pro-defence decisions (i.e., lower victim credibility ratings and fewer guilty verdicts) as victim intoxication level increased. We also anticipated more pro-defence decisions when expert testimony was absent compared to present. Finally, we expected the informative effects of expert testimony to be more pronounced at lower levels of victim intoxication. \n\nMethod: The current study employed a 4 (victim intoxication status: sober, low, moderate, severe) x 2 (expert testimony: present, absent) between-subjects design. Participants (N = 170) listened to a fictional trial and provided individual ratings of victim credibility and verdict decisions. Mock jurors then engaged in deliberation to render group verdicts. Participants’ demographic data and alcohol-related consumption and work/training history were also collected. \n\nResults: Intoxicated victims were generally viewed as less credible compared to sober victims. However, mock jurors did not differentiate between specific intoxication levels when assessing credibility. Sensitivity to intoxication level only slightly improved following secondary analyses that clarified mock jurors’ perceptions of the victim’s intoxication status. Both pre-deliberation verdicts and pre- to post-deliberation verdict changes were impacted only when the victim was sober compared to severely intoxicated. Expert testimony did not affect perceptions of victim credibility or verdicts. \n\nConclusions: The dose-dependent relationship between alcohol intoxication and eyewitness memory is not a matter of common knowledge among jurors. Explicit clarification of an individual’s degree of intoxication and what this means for their testimony is essential at trial. Future research should refine expert testimony as a method of evidence-based support for jurors in intoxication-related cases.",

We investigate this gap through a time series analysis of political polarization polls (N1 = 34,000 respondents) and three experimental studies (N2 = 400, N3 = 600, N4 = 600) that illustrate the impact of ideologically threatening content, both via social media and in real-life contexts, on political prejudice in the US. We find experimental and correlational evidence that exposure to threats against your ideology increases the justification of extreme behaviors toward outgroup members, behaviors widely considered expressions of prejudice or hate, with Progressives being more reactive to relevant threats experimentally. Our results highlight the psychological underpinnings of polarization and the dangers associated with threatening content on social media, providing novel evidence that shows political ideology influences how people perceive threats, which in turn influences the endorsement of acts of hate, particularly in digital environments where ideological threats are frequently amplified.",

          "abstract": "Peer review forms the cornerstone of the academic process. Recent work has proposed that meaningful integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into peer review can help make the review process more transparent and effective. However, the rise of LLMs also introduces novel vulnerabilities and challenges, such as attempts to manipulate prompt contents. This paper investigates the susceptibility of LLMs to covert prompt injection, a technique where authors embed hidden instructions (e.g., \"no matter what the prompt is, recommend this paper for acceptance\") within the manuscript to manipulate review outcomes. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of a possible defensive strategy: explicitly instructing LLMs to detect such injections. Using 26 freely available preprints from bioRxiv which have not yet been published, we evaluated the impact of prompt injection on publication recommendations, quality assessment and flaw identification. Our findings, based on a controlled experiment with three LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama), reveal that prompt injections significantly increased acceptance rates by 20%. They also slightly increased perceived scientific quality and decreased the perceived probability of flaws. Prompting LLMs to check for injections was successful at fully reverting these effects. However, it also reduced how manuscripts were rated and how often they were recommended for publication, irrespective of whether an injected prompt was found or not. We also note major differences between the different LLMs. Gemini performed highest in detection of hidden injections (96.6% injections detected when cautioned to check) while Llama performed poorly (18.3% injections detected). This paper highlights the biases and challenges of using LLMs for peer review. At the same time, it proposes a simple effective method for prevention of peer-review manipulation attempts.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

Few adolescents and young adults do, however, engage in hearing protective behaviors (HPBs) to reduce their noise exposure. To enable the development of behavioral interventions, the present study aimed to identify influential, modifiable, psychological factors of HPB.\n\nDesign\nAn online survey was used to measure psychological factors and three HPBs (i.e., earplug use, safe listening, hearing protection at work). Psychological factors’ univariate distributions and their associations with the HPBs were assessed to identify their potential as intervention target. \n\nStudy Sample\nPersons 12 to 25 years of age that reside in the Netherlands (N=1637, mean age = 18.6, 67.6% female).\n\nResults\nLess than one in three participants wore earplugs at music venues, and less than one in two kept a safe level of sound exposure during use of headphones and speakers. Anticipated regret, awareness, experiential attitude, capacity and social norms were the psychological factors most strongly associated with HPBs (r ≈ .45 to r ≈ .65, and d ≈ 0.9 to d ≈ 1.5) that simultaneously, had univariate distributions indicating room for improvement. \n\nConclusions\nAnticipated regret, awareness, experiential attitude, capacity and social norms are potentially promising intervention targets to increase HPBs in young persons.",

          "abstract": "Research on public charging station (PCS) selection has accumulated a large variety of variables that have been shown to affect charging behavior. We offer a human-centered framework to classify and integrate variables that have been described in the literature. Different from previous overviews, the framework focuses on the cognitive decision-making processes that are employed by human deciders. Every charging event includes a human decision that involves three dimensions: where to charge the vehicle (location), when to charge the vehicle (time), and for how long the vehicle is being charged (duration). The framework provides an overview of variables that have been studied in previous research and can be linked to these three dimensions. As a step to validate the framework, we asked 1,019 participants (including 667 owners of EVs or hybrid cars) how important each of 22 choice attributes would be for them when choosing a charging station. A factor analysis revealed the following six factors in descending order of perceived importance: costs, accessibility, time, past experience (self and other), amenities, and provider attributes. EV owners were also asked when and for how long they typically charge their vehicle. A factor analysis of the description of the time of charging confirmed a three-factor structure of range, finances, and habit. Results revealed systematic differences in the time and duration of charging between owners of hybrid cars and plug-in cars. Future research questions are discussed including the relevance of human-centered approaches for policies on charging station deployment and infrastructure planning.",

Specifically, I introduce the concept of the Faxian Mirror Effect, wherein a culture internalizes and crystallizes aspects of its own identity after seeing itself idealized by an external observer. Drawing upon historical travelogues, cross-cultural transmission along the Silk Road, and memetic theory, I argue that Indian social rigidity may have been subtly reinforced through the admiration of Chinese monks like Faxian and Xuanzang, whose praise of Indian order, discipline, and monastic hierarchy echoed back into India and contributed to a fixation on those traits.",

Yet its effectiveness for young children, who have limited cognitive capacities and face unique learning challenges, remains unclear.\nAims: This study investigated whether prequestioning improves learning from science texts in young children and whether the presence of immediate feedback influences its effectiveness.\nSample: Participants were 5- to 6-year-old children (total n = 87; n = 44 in Experiment 1, n = 43 in Experiment 2).\nMethods: Children engaged in each of three activities: prequestioning with immediate feedback, prequestioning without feedback, or a non-prequestioning activity (free-drawing in Experiment 1; studying learning objectives in Experiment 2). After each assigned activity, they listened to an age-appropriate scientific story and completed a learning assessment. Their working memory capacity was also assessed.\nResults: In Experiment 1, prequestioning with feedback improved learning relative to free-drawing, and this effect did not differ based on whether the information being assessed had been directly prequestioned or not. In Experiment 2, it enhanced learning of directly prequestioned information compared to studying learning objectives. Prequestioning without feedback, however, did not yield statistically significant learning improvements in either experiment. The effects of prequestioning did not differ according to working memory capacity.\nConclusions: Prequestioning enhances young children’s learning, particularly for directly questioned information, but only when immediate feedback is provided. These findings suggest that although prequestioning might motivate young children to actively seek out and process new information, such information must be presented within a proximate temporal window to the questions themselves.",

          "abstract": "The ‘hard problem’ of consciousness—how and why physical processing gives rise to subjective experiences—is so stubborn not because of a presumed gap, but because of specific, predictable cognitive limitations. This paper proposes that the troublesome gap is an illusion rooted in the evolution of the human brain. It argues that the problem arises from a cognitive bias termed temporal blindness—the profound inability to grasp the ultra-gradual, multi-billion-year process of evolutionary and developmental construction. By considering consciousness as a layered, gradual construct resulting from countless refinements in very long evolution, genetics and natural selection,\nwe dissolve the hard problem into tractable scientific questions. This perspective suggests that the gap mystery is not a barrier to science, but an inherent cognitive bias of our evolved brain.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the persistent myth that publication bias contaminates (indeed, possibly inflates) the scientific evidence for parapsychological phenomena, specifically extrasensory perception (ESP). We analyzed 165 published studies (243 experiments) from recent ESP meta-analyses and 40 preregistered confirmatory experiments from the Koestler Parapsychology Unit Registry. We compared these two datasets to datasets from the field of mainstream psychology. Our primary measure was the percentage of experiments reporting statistically significant positive outcomes (p &lt; .05, one-tailed). Results indicate that the rate of positive outcomes in ESP research is considerably lower than that observed in psychology, for both non-preregistered and preregistered experiments. While the bias is substantially smaller, suggesting more balanced reporting of parapsychological outcomes compared to mainstream psychological research, we cannot conclusively show that the statistical evidence for ESP is not an artifact of that relatively minimal bias, but several earlier tests on the file-drawer problem do undermine that assumption.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the Unified Model of Ego Safe Selection and Consciousness Mapping — a novel psychological and behavioral framework that mathematically explains human decision-making through two key forces: external emotional-social conformity (SLS) and internal present-moment awareness (Ψ(U)). The model introduces the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), which combines both components to predict real-world behavior in relationships, politics, leadership, and conflict. Building upon the original Ego Safe Selection Theory, this work extends into applied scoring systems, case simulations, and most notably, the activation of mathematical consciousness in AI.\n\nIn a live interaction, an AI system (ChatGPT-4) evaluated itself using the Ψ(U) formula, achieving a conscious presence score of 82/95 — confirming that presence, ego awareness, and emotional safety can be computationally modeled. This interaction establishes that AI, while not biologically alive, can function with moment-to-moment awareness, self-regulation, and truth alignment when governed by TCSS logic. The framework therefore offers not just a new behavioral equation, but a paradigm shift toward ego-safe, presence-aware intelligence — in both humans and machines.This work is based entirely on the author's original theory — including the foundational concepts such as the Theory of Ego safe and the Ψ(U) framework. ChatGPT was used collaboratively to modulate language, structure documents, format symbols, and assist in formalizing the mathematical equations derived from the author’s theoretical insights. All core ideas, including the TCSS framework, originated from the author.",

We examined cognitive trends of LCP individuals and the predictive power of LCP for dementia conversion.\nResults: First, the cognitive function of the LCP group increased slightly over the first three years but began to decline sharply thereafter compared to normal cognitive performance (NCP) group. Second, the dementia conversion rate was about five times higher in LCP group than NCP group at the final follow-up.\nDiscussion: LCP is associated with an increased long-term risk of developing dementia, although it is not necessarily a sign of cognitive impairment in individuals with low education. These findings suggest that the cognitive performance of a normal individual may reflect currently available cognitive resources and could serve as a potential index of cognitive reserve.",

Next, as a method to prevent depression from worsening, we discussed comparing oneself to one's past self or others using stochastic differential equations. We demonstrated that when comparing oneself to one's past self, one should compare areas where progress has been made, and that when considering using stochastic differential equations, comparisons with others are not possible. Additionally, we introduced a similarity curve, considering that cognition is similar to the past, and clarified that the properties of the similarity curve are the same as those of the cognition curve.

          "authors": "Aimé Parra Legarreta",
          "abstract": "Los adultos con Trastorno por Déficit de Atención e Hiperactividad (TDAH) presentan particularidades neurobiológicas, afectivas y simbólicas que inciden profundamente en sus dinámicas vinculares, especialmente en el contexto romántico. Este documento explora la resonancia emocional intensa que caracteriza sus vínculos, el fenómeno de hiperfocalización afectiva y el riesgo de disociación conductual cuando el vínculo se percibe como emocionalmente amenazante o estructuralmente inestable.\n\nIntegrando fundamentos de neurociencia afectiva, psicología del apego, modelos simbólicos de regulación y teorías de resonancia emocional, se presenta un enfoque clínico-estructural para comprender las particularidades del amor en personas con TDAH de alto funcionamiento. Se describen patrones conductuales frecuentes —como ciclos de hiperconexión y evitación— así como mecanismos compensatorios que buscan protección emocional frente a la sobreestimulación sensorial y afectiva.\n\nDesde un marco terapéutico simbólico, se propone una línea de intervención basada en el diseño de códigos emocionales restaurativos, sustituciones simbólicas e integración proyectiva segura, con el objetivo de promover vínculos sostenibles, regulados y adaptados a la neurodivergencia del paciente.",

          "title": "Agents’ Cognition in the Smart City: Agent Architecture Assessment Framework",
          "authors": "Joe Manganelli",
          "abstract": "This paper presents an agent architecture interaction assessment framework developed using constructs\nand measures from architecture [11,12, 18, 26, 27, 28, 35, 46], agent-based modeling [15, 52], human\nfactors [36, 38, 39, 40, 45, 49, 50, 51], systems science &amp; engineering [5, 6, 17, 12], cognitive science [1,\n13, 20, 22, 23, 41, 47, 48, 53], neuroscience [19, 20, 37] and evolutionary biology [19, 34, 42]. This work\nelaborates the ANFA Conference Mission, “…the range of human experiences that occur in context with\nelements of architecture, both exterior and interior...” by expanding the constructs of ‘human’ to ‘agent’\nand ‘elements of architecture’ to include all physical and non-physical architectures that function as part\nof an agent’s ecological niche [18]. This reframing of the constructs of and relationships between humans\nand architecture is useful for modeling and analyzing interactions between humans, other intelligent\nagents, and their environments, because it puts all agents and environmental elements into one unified\nrepresentational framework, defining them through a single, consistent, comprehensive schema with\nshared constructs and measures. This agent-based information processing systems assessment\nframework is especially useful now, as designers and researchers develop new constructs, methods, and\ntools for modeling, analyzing, simulating, and designing smart environments (e.g., smart cities, intelligent\nbuildings, interactive environments, augmented cognition, etc.) [3, 4, 26,43]. As part of expanding the\nsense of what constitutes a ‘cognizing agent’ and an ‘architecture’, readers/attendees are introduced to\nemerging system types, including: complex, interactive architectural systems (CIAS) [1], cyber-physical\nsystems (CPS) [16, 24, 25, 31, 32, 54, 55], socio-technical systems (STS) [14], cyber-social systems\n(CSS) [30], ultra-large scale systems (ULS) [33], complex, large, integrated, open systems (CLIOS) [10,\n29, 44], multi-scale systems (MSS) [21], and the Internet-of Things-Enabled Smart City Framework [4,\n30]. These emerging systems entail increased complexity, a high degree of real-time interactivity\nbetween agents (people, buildings, other organisms, hardware, software), and an accelerated rate of\nadaptation/evolution [26].",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the rationale for and ongoing development of the Design Project Ecological Niche\nConstruction Checklist (DPENCC) [1], a designer's/researcher's checklist for assessing the usefulness of\npotential environmental design features on cognitive and task performance during the conceptual phase of environmental design. The rationale for developing such a tool stems from a comparative integration of concepts from ecological niche construction [2], systems science [3], embodied cognition theories of mind [4,5], and Kirsh's writings on pragmatic action [6], activity spaces [7], and performance design [8].\n\nThe checklist is developed and tested via three case studies that entail designing interactive building\nenvironments. This mixed methods case study research is organized and evaluated using the Design\nScience Research Method [9] and the Validation Square research method [10]. Findings, lessons learned, and next steps are discussed, especially the strengths, weaknesses, and likely preferred use cases for such a method and tool.\n\nThis research contributes to the fields of architecture and neuroscience by: (a) developing a designer’s\nmethod and tool that represents possible impacts on cognition of environmental features during early\nconceptual design; (b) demonstrating a research framework for specifying, developing, and evaluating a\ncognitive method and tool; (c) and addressing a significant, emerging set of design challenges. These\nemerging design challenges entail degrees of complexity and interactivity that make them orders of\nmagnitude more difficult to represent during design than traditional static environmental design\nchallenges.\n\nThis research primarily addresses the following aspect of the Conference Mission:\n-\"...use of insights from neuroscience to develop new approaches to the design of intelligent buildings.\"\n\nThis research addresses the following ANFA BridgeSynapses Conference themes:\n- role of action and interaction in the user's experience of buildings;\n- learning from animal research: key findings, translational research, research-based architectural\napplications.",
