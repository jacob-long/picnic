          "authors": "Krishma Labib; María de los Ángeles Crespo López; Claudia Pallise Perello; Jeroen de Ridder",
          "abstract": "The open science (OS) movement is growing, with increasing policies, guidelines, tools and infrastructures being developed to support researchers who engage in OS practices. However, there is no widely accepted single definition of OS. Different initiatives and countries employ a variety of characterizations. To chart how OS is understood in different parts of the world, we conducted a scoping review and critical discourse analysis of OS guidance documents aimed at researchers. Our search led to the inclusion of 69 national and international documents, with most originating from North America, Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that OS discourses are exaggerated, framing OS as the solution to address all scientific and societal problems. Furthermore, they provide often conflicting ideas about what OS can achieve. Many guidance documents frame OS as a tool to promote economic growth and efficiency. Others see OS as necessary to safeguard research quality and reproducibility through transparency. In contrast, few documents address knowledge equity and inclusion. Taking this into account, we see dominant OS discourses reproducing knowledge equity problems already present in research, rather than tackling them. We urge researchers be more precise about the specific approach they take to OS and more humble about the effects it can have – both positive, and negative.",

          "authors": "Merle-Marie Pittelkow; Maximilian Mönch; Lidwine Mokkink; David L. Streiner; Stig Brorson; Mohamed Shoukri; Jan Kottner",
          "abstract": "Introduction: The Guidelines for Reporting Reliability and Agreement Studies (GRRAS) were developed to improve the completeness and transparency of reporting of reliability and agreement of health measurement instruments. However, since their publication in 2011 methodological standards, both for reporting guideline development and reliability, agreement, and measurement error studies, have advanced, highlighting the need for aligning and updating. In addition, related initiatives like COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) have emerged, offering opportunities to harmonize terminology and promote consistency across diverse types of measurement instruments. This methods review aims (1) to systematically identify and synthesize commentaries on and evaluations of the original GRRAS, and (2) to map recent methodological developments in the planning, conduct, and interpretation of reliability, agreement and measurement error studies that should be reflected in the reporting and may imply or explicitly recommend updates, to inform the development of the GRRAS-COSMIN reporting guidelines. \nMethods and analysis: Two complementary search strategies will be employed. First, forward direct citation tracking of the original GRRAS publications will be conducted in Web of Science. We will include sources providing critique, commentaries, or suggestions related to the GRRAS. We will exclude publications that used GRRAS just for structuring their report, withdrawn or retracted articles, textbooks, peer reviews, supplements, and conference materials without full-text publications. Included articles will be analysed using descriptive content analysis. Second, we will perform a systematic search in Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Eric, and Cinahl supplemented by key references identified by or known to the author team. We will include studies, reviews, commentaries, editorials, methodological papers, tutorials and guidance documents that discuss or critically reflect on methodological aspects of the measurement properties reliability and/or agreement/measurement error published between 01.01.2015 and 31.07.2025 in the field of health measurement research. Eligibility will be assessed by two independent reviewers and included sources will be analysed using ‘codebook’ thematic analysis. Findings will be presented narratively supplemented by visuals and tables if appropriate.\nEthics and dissemination: This study involves publicly available data. No ethical approval is needed. Results will be disseminated through an open-access journal publication following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review Extension and conference presentations.",

          "title": "The False Currency of Authorship",
          "authors": "Javier Arredondo Montero",
          "abstract": "Authorship, once conceived as a marker of intellectual contribution and responsibility, has become an inflated and ambiguous construct in contemporary science. This transformation exemplifies Goodhart’s Law, which posits that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Converted into institutional currency for evaluation and promotion, byline positions have created distorting incentives that erode meaning. This distortion is magnified by the Matthew Effect, whereby early prestige compounds into cumulative advantage, rendering first and last author positions disproportionately valuable. Countering these dynamics requires structural reform designed to dismantle the mechanics of this devaluation. This work argues for a transition away from symbolic hierarchies toward a system based on quantified, auditable contributorship. Such a framework would neutralize perverse incentives by replacing positional credit with numerical estimates of contribution, abolishing the entrenched first-last author hierarchy, and making declarations of work verifiable. Crucially, it demands a reorientation of institutional reward structures to prioritize quality and verified contributions over mere publication counts and byline placement. Replacing authorship with verifiable contributorship is not merely a technical adjustment but a necessary evolution to safeguard accountability, transparency, and fairness in research. This transition offers a feasible path to restore the integrity of academic recognition.",

          "authors": "Quanfa He; James Janford Li",
          "abstract": "Rates of youth mental disorders vary across white, Black and Hispanic youths in the United States. The weak evidence for the generalizability of diagnostic tools significantly challenge the understanding of racial and ethnic differences in mental disorder risks. The Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) is a widely used diagnostic interview. However, its applicability across racial and ethnic groups is questionable. The current study tested the statistical generalizability, or measurement equivalence, of the K-SADS across Hispanic (n=2,015), non-Hispanic white (n=6,021) and non-Hispanic Black (n=1,420) youths, using data from the Adolescent and Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The sample was diverse in terms of child’s sex assigned at birth. Our results indicated that the K-SADS screening interview had a one-factor structure that was scalar equivalent. However, nearly 50% of its items functioned differently across groups, suggesting unequal probabilities of symptom endorsement at equivalent levels of mental disorder risks. Crucially, socioeconomic factors explained many of the measurement differences across groups, implicating their role in the validity of symptom reporting. Findings from this study can help develop clinical screening tools that are generalizable across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic factors, which is important for a contextualized understanding of racial and ethnic differences in youth mental disorders.",

          "authors": "Shawn Manuel; Vincent Taschereau-Dumouchel",
          "abstract": "This narrative review examines the evolving role of representations—neural, mental and computational constructs that mediate perception, reasoning, and behavior—across the intertwined histories of cybernetics, cognitive sciences, and artificial intelligence. We begin by revisiting the rise and decline of cybernetics and its influence on the cognitive revolution, foregrounding how early debates over internal representations continue to shape current approaches. We then explore three frameworks that exemplify how representations function in scientific practice: cognitive maps in neuroscience, schemas in cognitive and clinical psychology, and object relations in psychodynamic theory. These traditions, though methodologically distinct, converge in treating representations as adaptive interfaces tailored to disciplinary goals rather than static mirrors of reality. Drawing on insights from computational psychiatry and neuroAI, we argue that scientific progress depends not on converging toward a single “correct” model of representation, but on developing representations that are flexible, context-sensitive, and reflexively engaged with their own assumptions. We caution against equating engineering performance with theoretical adequacy and highlight how historical cycles of scientific hype, from cybernetics to modern AI, can obscure valuable, if marginalized, contributions. By integrating perspectives across psychology, neuroscience, and AI, this review offers conceptual tools to support transdisciplinary dialogue and encourages researchers not to treat representation as a fixed ontology, but rather as a problem space requiring ongoing negotiation and pluralistic experimentation.",

          "authors": "Meng Chen; Rohit Batra; Emorie D Beck; Emilio Ferrer",
          "abstract": "Characterizing psychological processes as dynamical systems has become a common practice in psychology. Most often, psychological theories are expressed in verbal terms and then interpreted by researchers in their operationalization. In contrast, theories can also be expressed formally in mathematical or computational terms. However, translating verbal theories of dynamical systems into formal theories, especially those represented by differential equations (DEs), often requires knowledge of physics and mathematics beyond the standard training received by psychologists. In this article, we seek to provide a roadmap for researchers who wish to build a formal theory expressed in DEs from a verbal theory. We use a running example to illustrate the various steps and end with a discussion on caveats of formalizing using DE models. Our roadmap aims at the phase of formal theory development and refinement, before a researcher collects their data. We discuss different DE applications and provide corresponding examples for researchers interested in further reading.",

          "authors": "Anna Aretha Sach; Cameron Brick; Disa Sauter; Nils Jostmann",
          "abstract": "Activists are mobilizing worldwide to address the climate crisis. In the past years, climate movements have attracted many newcomers. Yet, even among motivated individuals who contacted a movement, becoming an actively engaged member remains rare. Previous studies have focused on non-engaged people’s intentions and barriers to joining or have surveyed long-term activists, yet little is known about newcomers. We studied how newcomers join different climate movements. In co-creation with activist organizers, we aimed to identify the phases of joining a climate movement and what facilitates and hinders engagement. We interviewed 23 individuals who had joined Extinction Rebellion (XR) United Kingdom, XR Netherlands, or the International Climate Students Movement. Five months later, the interviewees completed a short follow-up survey. Using inductive thematic analysis, we identified three phases associated with specific facilitators and barriers. The first phase was often initiated based on previous experience and a strong motivation to make a change. The second phase was marked by becoming active and socially integrated. In the final phase, activists transitioned from newcomers to active members. In the medium term, feeling effective and positive within the movement was associated with sustained engagement. Based on these findings, we recommend tailoring support for interested potential activists, newcomers, and experienced activists. Providing clear information, dedicated integrator roles, and emotional check-ins can help build broad, welcoming, and persistent activist movements. We suggest future longitudinal research starting from the moment of entry, as well as quasi-experiments testing socialization tactics.",

Internal consistency across all subscales of both instruments was good. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that psychological flexibility and inflexibility were prospectively associated with well-being and mental health complaints, respectively.

          "authors": "Özge Bakay; Faruk Akkus; Brian Dillon",
          "abstract": "Real-time sentence comprehension relies on memory resources to establish long-distance syntactic dependencies. There is convincing evidence that formation of many dependencies is mediated by hierarchical constraints. However, it remains an open question how richly hierarchical information is represented and employed in memory processes. Here we ask whether hierarchical relations between noun phrases in a sentence as in x c-commands y (Reinhart, 1976) constrain antecedent retrieval for a local anaphor. We measure the real-time reactivation of c-commanding target antecedents and distractors in processing the Turkish reciprocal birbirleri via three visual world studies. Unlike existing studies that confounded multiple cues, we disentangled c-command from other structural information (clause-mateness, case, subjecthood) and linear order/recency. Experiment 1 compared the availability of c-commanding subjects and non-c-commanding, clause-mate, similarly case-marked distractors; and showed that c-commanding subjects were rapidly distinguished from distractors within the reciprocal window, irrespective of their linear order. Experiment 2 revealed that immediate availability of c-commanding subjects extends to c-commanding indirect objects. Experiment 3 was a pre-registered, high-power replication that yielded similar results. We found limited evidence for interference from distractors, which was not replicated. Overall, we find that hierarchical, item-to-item relations between noun phrases rapidly determine antecedent availability in retrieval beyond other cues. We suggest that hierarchical information may guide access to c-commanding items during retrieval if item representations include hierarchically informed features targeted by retrieval cues; alternatively, hierarchical information may shape the organization of items in memory, with c-commanding items represented in a privileged store allowing direct access during retrieval.",

          "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
          "abstract": "Scientific communication faces a dual crisis: exponential publication growth overwhelms human readers while fragmented research practices prevent automated knowledge synthesis. This crisis is exacerbated by AI-assisted writing—producing papers faster than they can be consumed. Behavioral and social sciences, in particular, suffer from incomparable stimulus databases, jingle–jangle measurement fallacies, and demographic blindness that conceals effect heterogeneity. While AI tools support comprehension and summary assistance, they cannot aggregate findings from incommensurable studies and risk amplifying biases when trained on unstructured, unverified text. We propose restructuring scientific papers for dual audiences: front-loaded narratives for time-pressed human readers, paired with machine-readable appendices containing executable code, standardized metadata, and ontologically-mapped constructs. This transforms papers into queryable research environments where readers can directly interrogate data and rerun analyses. Structured appendices enable automated verification of statistical methods and AI-assisted peer review grounded in executable rather than narrative claims. These restructured papers become nodes in continuously updating evidence networks. Each publication automatically contributes effect sizes to real-time meta-analyses, with corrections and retractions propagating instantly through dependent analyses. Widespread adoption requires institutional recognition of structured documentation as essential scholarly output and computational infrastructure that serves both human comprehension and machine analysis.",

          "abstract": "Spending time in natural environments benefits well-being. However, natural environments change by environmental crises, such as climate change. For example, droughts become more frequent and intense. Thus, the question arises, whether visible signs of climate change diminishes nature’s beneficial effects on humans. In an experimental online study, German participants (N = 239) experienced an audio-guided imagined walk either through intact nature, nature affected by a drought, or an indoor control condition. Results showed that the imagined walk through intact nature was more restorative than through the control environment. Most importantly, the walk through drought-affected nature led to less positive effects compared to intact nature—and was similar to the control condition. Signs of drought even led to higher negative affect compared to the control condition. However, neither current connectedness to nature nor predictors of climate action (i.e., environmental concern and pro-environmental behavioural intentions) were different between the experiences in intact and drought-affected nature. Overall, our study suggests that signs of drought diminish beneficial well-being effects of nature experiences, but do not affect actions leading to climate change mitigation.",

          "title": "How does semantic elaboration affect retrieval from episodic memory?",
          "authors": "Joscha Dutli; Klaus Oberauer; Lea Maria Bartsch",
          "abstract": "The semantic elaboration effect refers to the finding that semantic processing of words leads to better memory performance when the words are semantically congruent with the orienting questions with which they are studied. In Experiment 1, we were unable to replicate the congruency effect that motivated the concept of elaboration. We ran 8 follow-up experiments (Exp. S1–S8) that partially resolved our failed replication attempt: We found robust congruency effects in recognition tests, but not in free recall. This result can be explained by the hypothesis that elaboration improves memory by establishing effective retrieval cues, and elaboration is effective only inasmuch as these retrieval cues are available at test. To investigate the retrieval-cue hypothesis further, we asked whether participants are able to freely recall the orienting questions as retrieval cues. Recall of these questions was poor, providing a potential explanation for absent congruency effects in free recall. We formalized the retrieval-cue hypothesis in a simple computational model, applied it to Experiments 1 and S1–S8, and found that the model can account for the congruency effects we observed. In Experiment 3, we directly tested the models’ prediction that the size of the congruency effect is determined by the probability of recalling the orienting questions as cues by letting one group of participants learn the orienting questions before the experiment. We found a larger congruency effect in this group compared to a control group that did not learn the orienting questions, further supporting the retrieval-cue hypothesis of elaboration.",

          "abstract": "Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it: predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage, remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end, we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a meaningful addition to traditional methods.",

          "abstract": "While psychological science suffers from measurement proliferation and fragmentation (Anvari et al., 2025), some measures prosper: With over 3,000 citations since its publication approximately 20 years ago, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002) has become one of the most widely used measurement instruments of the behavioral and clinical sciences. Yet, despite its widespread adoption still little is known regarding the task’s psychometric properties in terms of meta-analytic evidence—which may be related to researcher degrees of freedom and flexibility during task implementation that hinder cumulative scientific progress. We thus conducted a robust Bayesian meta-analysis synthesizing 1,667 effect sizes from 220 studies comprising the data of 51,932 participants, to (i) take stock of the psychometric properties of the BART and (ii) quantify measurement flexibility and its impact on the task’s psychometric properties. Although the BART showed satisfactory levels of test–retest reliability (r = 0.54), there was low to no known–groups validity (d = 0.10), convergent validity with other risk-taking measures (r = 0.00), and external validity (r = 0.02). The task’s convergent validity with measures of impulsivity and sensation seeking (r = 0.07) and its divergent validity with measures of cognitive ability (r = 0.12) were also low. There was substantial variability in study characteristics that had an impact on the estimates of all psychometric properties. We make recommendations for future research on the BART and its use, and how psychological science more generally may profit from adopting similar approaches to become a more integrative and cumulative field.",

Our contribution is fourfold: (i) a structured state space (domains × stakeholders) with a symbolic G-scale; (ii) a formal model of structural satisfaction, happiness, and resilience; (iii) a temporal, volumetric extension to capture long-term evolution; and (iv) a concrete architecture for AI self-modeling, enabling artificial agents to maintain their own SRM for transparent, value-aligned interaction. Ultimately, SRM provides a computational grammar for the self-a language structured enough for machine implementation, yet expressive enough for lived experience, paving the way for a new symbiosis between human and artificial cognition.",

          "authors": "Michalina Dudziak; Mathijs Franssen; Bram Vervliet; Tom Beckers",
          "abstract": "Uncontrollable situations are often experienced as more challenging than those within our control. Recently, it has been proposed that threat (un)controllability also affects fear learning processes. Most studies compare two variants of threat control – lacking versus having control. However, losing control might cause more distress than lacking control and be clinically relevant. The current study investigated the impact of loss of control over threat on conditioned fear. We randomly assigned 80 participants to a Continuous Control (CC) or a Loss of Control (LC) group and administered a threat (un)controllability task integrated into a fear conditioning procedure. Participants were presented with two pictures, one of which was consistently paired with an electrical stimulus (US). Participants from the CC group could learn to terminate the US with a mouse click. Participants in the LC group could terminate the stimulus initially but then lost this possibility. During the extinction and renewal phases, the pictures were repeatedly presented without the US. A new background context was introduced in the renewal phase. US-expectancy ratings, skin-conductance responses, fear ratings, and control predictions were collected throughout the procedure. The LC group displayed higher cue-elicited fear and lower expected control than the CC group. A similar pattern persisted during the extinction and renewal phases (increased skin conductance responses and reduced expected control). A general sense of control and anhedonia partially moderated the relationship between threat (un)controllability and fear renewal. These findings present initial evidence for the impact of losing control over threat on fear formation and reduction.",

          "abstract": "Body representations arise from the integration of multiple sensory signals that provide information about the body’s size, posture, and internal states. Vision often plays a dominant role, calibrating and aligning signals from touch, proprioception, and interoception. Yet, individuals born without sight still construct coherent and functional body representations, suggesting that the role of vision in building these representations may be more flexible than previously thought. Here, we synthesize recent behavioral and neuroimaging findings on body representations in blind individuals. We argue that blindness offers a powerful case study in how body representations can emerge through non-visual pathways, revealing the brain’s capacity to flexibly reorganize the sensory inputs supporting its internal models of the body. In doing so, we highlight the broader relevance of visual loss for understanding the plastic and multisensory nature of body representation.",

          "abstract": "Emotion differentiation — the ability to precisely label emotions — reflects a nuanced understanding of one’s emotional experiences. Researchers posit this nuance may be associated with knowing how one can use their emotions. As a result, we hypothesize emotion differentiation may be linked with holding instrumental emotion regulation motives, which involve regulating emotions to attain their benefits beyond solely feeling better or worse. In this research, we tested whether trait emotion differentiation was associated with instrumental emotion regulation motives in daily life, (1) in general and (2) at times when people felt strong emotion. To test these links, we used two experience sampling datasets collected in 2020 in Australia (Study 1, N=173; 50.3% White), and in 2016 in Belgium (Study 2, N=104; 100% European). Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no direct association between trait emotion differentiation and instrumental motive use. However, as hypothesized, in both studies, trait emotion differentiation moderated the relationship between emotion intensity and instrumental motives, though only in the case of negative — not positive — emotion. This interaction was such that those higher in trait emotion differentiation endorsed fewer instrumental motives when emotion was less intense, but more instrumental motives when emotion was more intense. This pattern suggests that people high in trait emotion differentiation may endorse instrumental motives flexibly, by regulating their emotions instrumentally when they are more intense, but not when they are less intense. Our findings support the idea that trait negative emotion differentiation may help individuals channel their intense emotions in useful ways.",

In our study (N = 783), we examined whether people with higher feelings of anxiety and lack of control early in the COVID-19 pandemic endorse more conspiracy theories. Our results show that a higher perception of risk of COVID-19 and lower trust in institutions' response to the pandemic were related to feelings of anxiety and lack of control. Feeling the lack of control, but not anxiety, independently predicted COVID-19 conspiracy theory endorsement. Importantly, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were strongly correlated with generic conspiracy and pseudoscientific beliefs, which were likewise associated with the feeling of lack of control and lower trust in institutions. The results highlight that considering people's emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for our understanding of the spread of conspiracy and pseudoscientific beliefs.",

This study investigates the generation of false memories leveraging different data-driven computational models to independently quantify language-based and vision-based experiential knowledge, as extracted from large-scale databases consisting of 639 billion words and 15 million images, respectively. We then tested the effects of these knowledge sources in two false-memory experiments, one employing images and the other words as stimuli. Our findings unveil both modality-independent and modality-dependent processes in the formation of memory traces. Indeed, we observed a contribution of both prior visual and linguistic knowledge regardless of the types of stimuli to be memorised. However, the extent of this contribution differed as a function of the modality tested: visual prior knowledge is more influential in image-based tasks, while linguistic prior knowledge dominates in word-based tasks. This dual and modality-dependent contribution underscores the adaptive nature of memory processes, revealing the dynamic integration of diverse experiential traces in false memory formation.",

Therefore, it is important to understand the reasoning processes – such as lower analytic thinking and susceptibility to cognitive biases – that might lead to the adoption of such beliefs. In two studies, I constructed and tested a novel questionnaire on epistemically suspect beliefs (Study 1, N = 263), and used it to examine probabilistic reasoning biases and belief bias in syllogistic reasoning as predictors of the endorsement of those beliefs, while accounting for analytic thinking and worldview variables (Study 2, N = 397). Probabilistic reasoning biases, analytic thinking, religious faith, and political liberalism consistently predicted various epistemically suspect beliefs, whereas the effect of syllogistic belief bias was largely restricted to pseudoscientific beliefs. Further research will be needed to examine the role the biased evaluation of evidence plays in the endorsement of epistemically suspect beliefs.",

          "abstract": "Background: Fluoxetine is among the most used antidepressants for children and adolescents and\nfrequently recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment for pediatric depression. However,\nin contrast to earlier studies and reviews, a Cochrane network meta-analysis from 2021 concluded\nthat the estimated efficacy of fluoxetine was no longer clinically meaningful.\nStudy aim: To explain the discrepant findings between the recent Cochrane review and earlier\nreviews and to explore if this was acknowledged in guidelines and treatment recommendations\nappearing since then.\nMethods: Meta-analytical aggregation of trial results over time, exploring potential biases, and a\nnon-systematic search for recent treatment guidelines/recommendations from major medical\norganizations.\nResults: The estimated efficacy of fluoxetine in clinical trials declined over time into the range of\nclinical equivalence with placebo when more recent studies were included in analyses and when\nconsidering common thresholds of clinical significance. This remains unacknowledged in treatment\nguidelines and related publications, including some that continue to recommend fluoxetine as first-\nline pharmacological treatment. Finally, we find that the loss of efficacy over time is likely\nexplained by biases such as the novelty bias or by variations of expectancy effects.\nConclusions: The seeming lack of clinically meaningful efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of\npediatric depression needs to be considered by those who develop treatment recommendations as\nwell as by patients and clinicians.

          "abstract": "Reported perception can exhibit a repulsive bias away from a task-irrelevant prior stimulus. Previous research has suggested that this repulsive serial bias is driven by low-level adaptation, such that the prior stimulus repels the representation of the new stimulus during encoding. To test this account, the present study compared the repulsive serial bias with another perceptual bias that is known to be driven by an adaptation mechanism (e.g., the tilt aftereffect). We measured the repulsive serial bias using a common location delayed estimation task and the adaptation-driven bias using a location estimation task with an inducer stimulus. We predicted that if the two types of biases were driven by common mechanisms, then they should be positively correlated. However, no such correlation was observed. In addition, we found that only the repulsive serial bias was associated with a response time effect, where responses were slower when the bias was stronger. Moreover, mouse-tracking data for the repulsive serial bias exhibited a pattern that started with a stronger repulsion and ended with smaller repulsion, which cannot be explained solely by an adaptation mechanism. Taken together, our findings suggest that repulsive serial bias in continuous estimation tasks involves post-perceptual decisional processes that are not present in the adaptation-driven bias.",

          "authors": "Jinghan Zhao; Bruno Verschuere; Sera Wiechert",
          "abstract": "Whether people can actively suppress unwanted thoughts is highly controversial. Anderson and Green (2001) developed the Think/No-Think (TNT) task and found that suppressing a memory reduces later recall, referred to as the Suppression-Induced Forgetting (SIF) effect. While some studies replicate this effect, others do not. To better understand the factors influencing the SIF effect, we developed two TNT methodological quality checklists (a 12-item essential version and an extensive 25-item version) based on optimal test conditions proposed by Nardo and Anderson (2024). We then assessed whether following these optimal test conditions predicted SIF effects across 100 TNT studies (143 effects) conducted with non-clinical samples. We found that methodological quality significantly predicted SIF effect significance for the 25-item checklist, but not robustly for the 12-item checklist. Methodological quality did not predict the magnitude of the reported SIF effect. Because there remains considerable uncertainty on the optimal TNT test conditions, we recommend authors report their methods, using the checklists provided in this paper. Exploratory analyses further suggested that studies involving original TNT developer reported significant SIF effects more frequently (95%) than studies without developer involvement (68%). This authorship effect remained significant after controlling for higher methodological quality. More independent studies are thus needed to mitigate possible biases.",

          "authors": "ANGELICA JEANICE MARTINS ANDERSEN",
          "abstract": "This article develops a semantic-pragmatic analysis methodology for identifying linguistic manipulation strategies in media texts. Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.",

Here, we introduce a scalable method using large language models (LLMs) to analyze verbal reports and identify the articulated reasons for choices between monetary lotteries. We show that a validated LLM accurately identifies predefined decision reasons in participants' free-text reports, aligning with their actual choices in over 92\\% of trials. Our analysis reveals that reason usage varies systematically and is driven more by the choice problem's structure than by individual differences. A predictive model based on these problem-specific reason profiles outperforms prospect theory in out-of-sample prediction. This work demonstrates that verbal reports are a rich data source and that LLMs can unlock their potential, challenging foundational invariance assumptions and paving the way for more context-aware models of human decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has shown that dynamics in reward value is an important driver of the stability-flexibility tradeoff. However, these studies have only examined deterministic reward, while real-world reward is predominantly uncertain and volatile in nature. Therefore, this study aimed to test how reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the validity of reward cues through stochastic probabilistic reward schedules. Participants performed a voluntary task switching paradigm with performance-contingent monetary reward at two levels. We used linear mixed models in a large (n=616) undergraduate student sample that enabled us to examine individual differences in how gender and personality influence reward-guided task selection. In line with previous work, we observed a reliable effect of reward transition on flexibility, with more flexible task choices when rewards changed from trial-to-trial and more stability when rewards were stable. Critically, this effect decreased linearly with increasing reward uncertainty. Better than expected high reward outcomes were associated with even greater flexibility than expected high outcomes, however, the reverse was not observed for worse than expected outcomes. At higher levels of reward uncertainty, female participants relied more on recent reward outcomes than cues. Overall, males were more influenced by reward transition than females. Perhaps counterintuitively, reward transition effects on flexibility were most apparent in participants with low levels of reward responsiveness. Our findings suggest that reward uncertainty is a key context that tunes the translation of outcomes into future choices.",

          "abstract": "Temporal principal components analysis (tPCA) is widely used to identify and quantify event-related potentials (ERPs). Less commonly, it has been applied to single-trial EEG epochs, despite concerns about the low signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty about how single-trial components compare with those derived from averaged waveforms. Alternatively, averaged principal components (PCs) can be imposed on single trials via back-projection. The present study evaluated the fidelity of single-trial and back-projected single-trial tPCA (covariance-based, unrestricted Varimax rotation) in representing meaningful averaged PCs by systematically comparing factor loadings and factor scores in two existing ERP datasets (72-channel, N=152; 67-channel, N=98), using both surface-referenced (infinity, nose) and reference-free current source density (CSD) transformations. In the 72-channel dataset with four balanced conditions (emotional hemifield paradigm), single-trial PCs closely matched those from averaged data, whereas in the 67-channel dataset with three imbalanced conditions (novelty oddball task), they did not. In contrast, across datasets and transformations, back-projected single-trial PCs consistently reproduced virtually identical averaged PCs. All single-trial tPCA solutions enabled full reconstruction of the original data matrix, confirming the validity of back-projected decomposition, and all single-trial measures showed high or adequate internal consistency. These findings suggest that single-trial tPCA may approximate averaged solutions only when the variance structure is preserved, whereas back-projection provides a robust alternative: it quantifies single-trial epochs based on the variance structure of the averaged data, thereby maintaining component structure, integrity, and interpretability, and enabling confident linkage of trial-level component measures with other trial-level variables.",

This broader perspective allows power to serve two functions—planning studies with hypothetical effect sizes and evaluating completed studies with plausible effect size estimates. The broader concept is useful to evaluate single studies and to estimate publication bias. We conclude that power analysis of published research is an important tool for the credibility revolution of psychological research.",

          "abstract": "As an alternative to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, transdiagnostic approaches that identify latent dimensions of psychopathology through factor analysis have gained prominence in recent years. A key critique of these approaches, however, is that they are performed at the level of symptoms only. This begs the question: are these dimensions truly more valid predictors of external outcomes than existing alternatives? Are there other ways, that are more data-driven, which can allow us to refine our definitions of clinical phenotypes? We tested this idea empirically, conducting a large-scale meta-scientific comparison of thousands of competing factor solutions that allowed us to determine if the latent structure underlying the covariation of psychiatric symptoms has robust and specific cognitive correlates. In nine independent datasets, comprising N=7565 individuals including patients about to start mental health treatment, healthy individuals, paid and unpaid participants, a broad set of age ranges and cognitive task variants that measured model-based planning and metacognition, we found that factors with the best fit to cognition were those derived from a first-order factor analysis on the maximal number of theoretically informed self-report symptoms available. These factors (‘Compulsivity and Intrusive Thought’ and ‘Anxious-depression’) performed better than thousands of engineered alternatives and performed twice as well as traditional questionnaire total scores. Crucially, this unsupervised approached based on symptom correlation only performed on-par with a partial least squares analysis, a supervised approach to deriving factors based on cognition. These results provide evidence that unsupervised factor analysis of psychiatric symptoms is a viable method for rethinking how we define mental health and illness, affording clear opportunities for enhancing our understanding of specific underlying mechanistic processes.",

          "abstract": "Persuasion is a complex communicative process aiming at influencing others’ beliefs or behaviors. Imbuing everyday communication, persuasion is a crucial skill for children to manage social \ninteractions successfully. While theoretically persuasion has been linked with the mastery of figurative language and with pragmatics more broadly, there is a scarcity of empirical evidence exploring the relationship between persuasion and metaphor skills. Here we tackle this issue in early childhood by examining whether individual differences in metaphor skills are related to those in persuasion. A sample of 167 children (age 4-6 years) was assessed for persuasive abilities alongside metaphor comprehension and production, in addition to vocabulary and working memory skills as control variables. \nResults showed an improvement in persuasive skills at 5 years of age. Across ages, children preferred \nto use positive persuasive strategies (i.e., offering rewards) over negative ones (i.e., punishments), \nwhile psychological strategies relying on mitigation and modeling were rarely used. Regardless of the \ntype of strategy, persuasion correlated positively with vocabulary skills. Interestingly, greater use of \npsychological persuasive strategies was associated with better metaphor production skills (being con\nversely hampered by working memory), while no effect of metaphor comprehension was found. Over\nall, these findings suggest that some aspects of metaphor skills, within the broader set of pragmatic  competencies, might be a driving factor in achieving a high-level persuasive style. Such aspects possibly deal with the functions of metaphors to favor flexible conceptualization and social use of language.",

Concurrently, a mixed-method study was conducted to integrate teachers’ perspectives on predictors of wellbeing using Q-method and co-creation (n=38). Longitudinal analyses demonstrated developmental decreases in aggression and bullying/victimization and increases in behavioral activation and empathy. Wellbeing was positively predicted by reward sensitivity and prosocial behavior, and negatively by behavioral inhibition.

          "abstract": "Transparent and comprehensive statistical reporting is critical for ensuring the credibility, reproducibility, and interpretability of psychological research. This paper offers a structured set of guidelines for reporting statistical analyses in quantitative psychology, emphasizing clarity at both the planning and results stages. Drawing on established recommendations and emerging best practices, we outline key decisions related to hypothesis formulation, sample size justification, preregistration, outlier and missing data handling, statistical model specification, and the interpretation of inferential outcomes. We address considerations across frequentist and Bayesian frameworks and fixed as well as sequential research designs, including guidance on effect size reporting, equivalence testing, and the appropriate treatment of null results. To facilitate implementation of these recommendations, we provide the  Transparent Statistical Reporting in Psychology (TSRP) Checklist that researchers can use to systematically evaluate and improve their statistical reporting practices (https://osf.io/t2zpq/). In addition, we provide a curated list of freely available tools, packages, and functions that researchers can use to implement transparent reporting practices in their own analyses to bridge the gap between theory and practice. To illustrate the practical application of these principles, we provide a side-by-side comparison of insufficient versus best-practice reporting using a hypothetical cognitive psychology study. By adopting transparent reporting standards, researchers can improve the robustness of individual studies and facilitate cumulative scientific progress through more reliable meta-analyses and research syntheses.",

Analyzing 1,578,057 posts from U.S. members of Congress (2019–2023), we found that (1) Democrats and Republicans did not differ meaningfully in what kinds of moral language they used but that (2) they used moral language for different issues. For example, Republicans used language reflecting harm and care to criticize Democratic economic policies, whereas Democrats used it to criticize Trump’s immigration policies. These findings suggest that politicians on the right and left rhetorically invoke similar moral values but do so to highlight different issues.",

          "abstract": "Fertility rates have declined in industrialized nations, and an increasing number of adults expect\nto remain childless. Non-parenthood includes diverse subgroups with distinct motivations and\npsychosocial profiles. One under-researched subgroup is antinatalists, who view procreation as\nmorally wrong. This study examined psychological functioning among antinatalist, childfree,\nand childless individuals.\n\nThis cross-sectional study recruited 492 non-parent adults from the United Kingdom via\nProlific. Participants were categorized into three groups: childless (n=258; desire children or\nare undecided), childfree (n=199; do not desire children for personal/social/economic reasons),\nand antinatalist (n=35; do not desire children for moral/ethical reasons). Participants completed\nthe Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ),\nExperiences in Close Relationships–Revised (ECR-R), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ),\nand Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire–Revised (SBQ-R). Group differences were analyzed\nusing Kruskal-Wallis tests and quantile regression, adjusting for age, education, marital status,\nand ethnicity.\n\nSignificant demographic differences were found between the groups in age, education level,\nmarital status, and ethnicity. Unadjusted analyses showed that childless individuals reported\nsignificantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress, attachment anxiety, and search for\nmeaning compared to childfree individuals. After adjusting for demographic covariates, most\nof these group differences became non-significant. However, childfree individuals still showed\nsignificantly lower attachment anxiety (at the median), lower reported childhood physical abuse\n(at the upper quantile), and lower suicidal ideation (at the lower quantile) compared to childless\nindividuals. No evidence emerged that antinatalists experienced greater psychological distress\nthan the other groups.\n\nAfter accounting for demographic factors, psychological differences among antinatalist,\nchildfree, and childless individuals were minimal. Findings suggest that demographic factors,\nrather than reproductive stances alone, largely account for differences observed between non-\nparent groups. This challenges narratives that portray those who choose not to have children,\nparticularly antinatalists, as psychologically maladjusted. However, differences in relative\nrepresentation of these categories may pose a limitation.",

          "authors": "Zhang Qikai; 吴静岚",
          "abstract": "Efficiently perceiving social interactions is fundamental to human social cognition, yet the underlying mechanisms remain contested. Domain-specific theories propose specialized processing for social content, while domain-general accounts attribute perceptual advantages to low-level visual features. This debate has been critically hampered by an overreliance on static stimuli, which obscure crucial temporal dynamics and introduce configural confounds. The present study addressed these limitations using a dynamic visual search paradigm that differentiated physical-contingency interactions (defined by synchronized, perceptually coupled movements) from communicative-contingency interactions (defined by sequential, meaning-based exchanges). Experiment 1 revealed a sharp dissociation: physical-contingency interactions were detected more efficiently than both non-interactive dyads and communicative-contingency interactions, while communicative-contingency interactions showed no search advantages. Experiment 2 employed eye-tracking to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Physical-contingency interaction search showed overall search advantages through enhanced target recognition and efficient distractor rejection, despite equivalent attentional guidance compared to non-interaction search. Communicative-contingency interaction search exhibited enhanced target recognition and efficient distractor rejection but suffered from attentional guidance deficits that eliminated overall search benefits. Additionally, communicative-contingency interactions as distractors required the longest fixation durations, indicating strongest attentional stickiness. These findings challenge existing theoretical frameworks by demonstrating that social interaction search advantages cannot be explained by either domain-specific or domain-general mechanisms alone. We propose a dual-route processing model wherein physical-contingency interactions benefit primarily from domain-general perceptual mechanisms that efficiently process motion synchrony and gestalt properties, while communicative-contingency interactions rely on domain-specific social processing mechanisms that handle complex interpersonal meaning. This integrated framework reconciles competing theoretical perspectives and advances understanding of how different types of social information are prioritized in dynamic visual environments.",

          "abstract": "The present article offers an assessment of intra-individual variability in visual\nattention using the Theory of Visual Attention, which provides a formal framework for\nquantifying attentional components. We specifically investigated overall attentional\ncapacity – that is, the available processing speed – and its distribution, the relative\nattentional weight.\nBy reanalyzing a large existing dataset from Tünnermann and Scharlau (2021),\nwe found that across multiple testing days, participants either remained stable within a\n20 Hz margin or showed consistent improvements in capacity – in some cases tripling\ntheir initial capacity. The weights in response to salient stimuli were remarkably\nconsistent.\nTo determine whether increases in capacity reflect pure test-retest effects or are\nfacilitated by consolidation between days, and to quantify within-day variability, we\nconducted a second study in which participants completed five self-administered\nsessions within a single day. Capacities remained within the same magnitude and did\nnot show a consistent directional trend. The relative weights exhibited comparatively\nlittle variation in most participants, akin to the previously analyzed dataset. Further,\nestimation uncertainty increased with higher capacity values.\nThese results suggest that capacity may be subject to training effects, but that\nsuch improvements appear to depend on longer breaks between sessions. This has\nimportant implications for individualized assessment: A personal prior could be\nestimated from a single session to accelerate future estimations, as long as subsequent\nsessions occur on the same day. Participants with higher capacities may require tailored\nexperimentation methods when small to medium effects are of interest, due to increased\nuncertainty.",

While previous research has focused on psoriasis, the present study represents the first empirical test of the hypervigilance hypothesis in atopic dermatitis. Across a series of four pre-registered reaction time studies, we found no evidence that people with atopic dermatitis preferentially allocate their attention to words that are related to the sensory-affective or stigmatizing disease experience, relative to neutral control words. This was the case both during the early phase of stimulus disengagement, as well as during a later maintained attention phase dominated by controlled strategic processes. Overall, contrary to our expectations, results are incompatible with the hypervigilance hypothesis since the attention of people with atopic dermatitis was not biased towards the disease or stigma-related information.",

          "abstract": "Mental speed is a multidimensional construct that encompasses three distinct time-related measures: reaction time, processing speed, and tempo, the latter of which is defined as the rate at which individuals respond to items varying in difficulty. This study applies van der Linden’s (2007, 2009) hierarchical model to jointly analyze item responses and response times from 1,620 adults taking the nine core subtests of the Reasoning and Intelligence Online Test (RIOT; https://riotiq.com). Using Bayesian estimation of the van der Linden model, results showed strong model fit across subtests, with near-zero correlations between examinee ability and examinee tempo for verbal tasks (r = -.209 to .136) and stronger negative correlations for visuospatial tasks (r = -.467 to -.769), supporting predictions from dual process theory. Item intensity and sensitivity positively moderated response times with difficulty on most subtests, indicating that item characteristics were the cause of longer response times for more difficult items. Few examinees (2.5%) exhibited dual misfit in responses and times, but the Figure Weights subtest revealed anomalous slow responding. These findings demonstrate that tempo (i.e., examinee response times) are independent of cognitive ability level and that correlations between the two are spuriously caused by item characteristics. Implications for intelligence testing and future experimental validation are discussed.",

While experimental paradigms have yielded important insights into auditory processing, their constructs often rely on task-specific definitions that may not fully reflect how sounds are perceived and interpreted outside the laboratory. We argue that auditory evaluation is shaped by the interaction of acoustic properties, affective tone, task demands, and contextual framing. To account for this, we propose a multidimensional framework based on arousal, valence, and context, which enables a more flexible characterization of how sounds are judged in everyday listening. We also examine how different methodological approaches highlight distinct facets of this evaluative process. By focusing on the conditions under which sounds are experienced, this review contributes to a more integrative understanding of auditory attention across both controlled and naturalistic settings.",

          "authors": "Xiaolu Dai; Ling Li Leng; Yiyan Liu; Yu-Te Huang; Daniel Fu Keung Wong",
          "abstract": "Background: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models has sparked heated debate over whether Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots can serve as “digital therapists” capable of providing therapeutic support. While much of this discussion focuses on AI’s lack of agency, understood as the absence of mental states, consciousness, autonomy, and intentionality, empirical research on users’ real-world experiences remains limited.\nObjective: This study explores how individuals with mental distress engage with both generative AI and human psychotherapy in natural and unguided contexts, with a focus on how perceptions of agency shape these experiences. By drawing on participants’ dual exposure, the study seeks to contribute to the ongoing debate about “AI therapists” by clarifying the role of agency in therapeutic change.\nMethods: Sixteen adults who had sought mental health support from both human therapists and ChatGPT participated in semi-structured interviews, during which they shared and compared their experiences with each type of interaction. Transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nResults: Analysis revealed three themes and eight subthemes enabling comparison of what participants found helpful and challenging in their interactions with ChatGPT and human therapists: (1) encouraging open and authentic self-disclosure but limiting deep exploration; (2) the myth of relationship: caring, acceptance, and understanding; (3) fostering therapeutic change: the promise and pitfalls of data-driven solutions. Drawing on these comparative reflections, we propose a conceptual model that highlights how perceptions of agency carry both strengths and limitations for therapeutic engagement. The model also illustrates how the non-agential nature of AI chatbots shapes their capacity to support individuals with mental distress in ways that differ from human therapists.\nConclusion: The findings suggest that agency functions as a double-edged feature in therapeutic interactions. Rather than anthropomorphizing AI chatbots, their non-agential features—such as responsive behaviors, absence of intentions, objective stance, and disembodied state—should be used strategically to complement human-delivered psychotherapy. Meanwhile, practitioners should maximize the benefits of their agential qualities while remaining cautious of the potential inherent risks.",

Empirical studies on ER have increasingly focused on understanding the role of cognitive effort throughout ER processes. Cognitive effort is an essential component of various ER stages: from the identification of the need to regulate emotions, through the selection of ER strategies their implementation, to the monitoring of the regulatory behaviour. The review highlights substantial inter-individual variability in effort expenditure across eR stages and explores the impact of cognitive costs on regulatory outcomes. Findings suggest that high effort demands can increase the likelihood of regulatory failure, perpetuating negative emotional states and impairing well-being. Conversely, automatic ER processes, while less effortful, may limit adaptability to novel emotional challenges. Understanding the intertwined interplay between cognitive effort and ER is important for elucidating crucial components during ER processing and their implications for individual well-being.",

Therefore, diversity scholarship sometimes conflates these different components without acknowledging their conceptual distinctions and historical contexts. We integrate and distinguish the literatures on diversity definitions (who), cases (why), and ideologies (how), while also proposing a new typology for defining diversity that is sensitive to societal hierarchy. Finally, we highlight how these different belief systems about diversity may covertly promote identity-blindness, whereby people state a commitment to diversity despite holding beliefs that undermine it. In particular, we argue that broadened definitions of diversity, the business case for promoting diversity, and value-in-equality diversity ideologies can all covertly help maintain identity-blindness.",

Subsequently, the models developed in the Training dataset were tested again in the Test dataset and the complete dataset. The results indicated a better fit for the nine-item model across all tested datasets. Additionally, the instrument’s constructs demonstrated adequate reliability and measurement invariance between men and women. Finally, external validity was assessed by correlating Malicious Envy and Benign Envy with anxiety and depression constructs, with only Malicious Envy showing a relationship with these constructs.

          "abstract": "Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects receptive and expressive language skills. In contrast to the wealth of evidence on acquired language disorders, we understand relatively little about the neural underpinnings of DLD. A recent meta-analysis across different types of structural brain analyses in DLD highlighted consistent anatomical differences in the anterior striatum, with other subcortical structures relatively spared. These findings are consistent with predictions from the procedural circuit deficit hypothesis (PCDH), namely that the anterior neostriatum differs in structure and function in DLD, whereas medial temporal lobe structures are unaffected and may act in a compensatory manner. Here in a case-control study with a larger sample size than previous studies, we evaluated volume and microstructure of subcortical grey matter structures using T1-weighted images and diffusion imaging. Our predictions were partly in accord with those of the procedural circuit deficit hypothesis and the findings of the meta-analysis. Neuroimaging and behavioral measures were acquired in 156 children and adolescents (54 DLD; 74 typically developing; 28 with a history of language difficulties) aged 10:0–15:11 years. As predicted by the PCDH, there were significant differences in the DLD group in volume and microstructure of the neostriatum (caudate nucleus, putamen). However, in contrast to our prediction, there were also significantly smaller structures in the DLD group across other subcortical structures evaluated: globus pallidus, thalamus, and hippocampus. The hippocampal difference is of particular interest as it is hypothesized in the PCDH to be spared in DLD. Microstructural measures (diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging) revealed differences in the caudate nucleus, thalamus, and hippocampus. Multivariate machine learning analyses highlighted the relationship between the hippocampus and language skills, but only in the typically developing cohort. We conclude that the subcortical correlates of DLD are in fact not limited to the neostriatum and represent important areas of further inquiry.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we take an in-depth look at different ways of assessing emotions in daily life\nthrough experience sampling, ranging from more generalizable, nomothetic approaches (e.g.,\nasking all participants to rate their degree of sadness) to more specialized, idiographic\napproaches (e.g., asking participants to describe their emotions in their own words). We\nhighlight the benefits of these procedures and discuss ways of combining nomothetic and\nidiographic approaches to measuring emotions in daily life. We argue that integrative approaches\ncan be beneficial for gaining both generalizable insights into the antecedents and consequences\nof emotions across individuals as well as for predicting and intervening on person-specific\nemotional experiences. We then discuss implications for clinical interventions and treatments,\nsensitivity to cultural variations in emotion, as well as practical considerations for incorporating\nnomothetic and idiographic approaches into experience sampling surveys. We also highlight\nfuture research questions that can be addressed when using a combined nomothetic and\nidiographic approach to measuring emotions.",

In a seminal study, Marcus et al.\n(1999) reported that 7-month-old infants learned abstract rules over syllable sequences and were\nable to generalize those rules to novel syllable sequences. Dozens of studies have since replicated\nthat finding and extended it using different rules, modalities, stimuli, participants (human adults\nand non-human animals) and experimental procedures. Yet questions remain about the\ngeneralizability of Marcus et al.’s (1999) core findings, and sources of variation across these\nfindings. In the current study, we address this issue by testing 839 infants of a wide age range\n(5;0-12;0 months) in a multi-laboratory (30 laboratories, [31 samples]) conceptual replication of\nthe Marcus et al. (1999) study. This study and the analyses were submitted as a registered report.\nA mixed-model analysis of the looking times at consistent vs. inconsistent test trials indicated no\nsignificant effect. The current study therefore finds no evidence for rule-learning; to the contrary, a\nBayesian analysis of the data indicated strong evidence for a null effect. This was similarly the\ncase for the moderating factors that were part of the design: mono- vs. multilingualism, age, and\nexperimental paradigm; none of these factors showed significant effects. Robustness analyses\nindicated that the results were not different in the case of different choices in the (pre-)processing\nof the data. A follow-up analysis for single labs indicated that there was no evidence of\nrule-learning in 30 of the 31 contributed samples. The current finding raises fundamental issues\nabout rule-learning that are presented in Discussion.",

To address this complexity, all stages of the research process—from theory and measurement to study design, analysis, and interventions—must be aligned with a complex systems perspective. This alignment requires intensive interdisciplinary collaboration and an integration of basic and applied research beyond current research practices to create transdisciplinary solutions. We offer actionable insights that bridge the gap between abstract theoretical approaches (e.g., complex systems and attractor landscape frameworks of behavior change) and practical PA research, thereby laying a foundation for more effective behavior change interventions.",

An earlier paper showed\nhow, when it is treated as a probability distribution, the traditional\nsingle PMF based on binary-choice data can be decomposed into sensory\nand decision components, expressed as two independent random variables\nthat are summed to create the PMF.  Here we extend this development\nto the multiple-response procedure, and use it to elucidate the\nrelations among the spreads and shapes of the resulting family of\nPMFs, which can be described by their first four cumulants.  For\nexample, we determine conditions under which the PMFs can have the\nsame spread and shape, differing only by translation on the stimulus\naxis.  Whereas PMFs depend on both sensory and decision processes,\ndifferences among the PMFs in a family depend only on the decision\nprocesses.  Application of this \\fImultiple-PMF method \\fRto several\ndecision models, whose evaluations depend on the PMF cumulants, shows it to\nhave greater power than the single-PMF method for understanding the\nperceptual process.

          "abstract": "The combination of high life satisfaction and frequent experiences of pleasant feelings is\nsometimes called hedonic wellbeing (HWB). We argue that a good life comprises more than\nhedonia and that a taxonomy of wellbeing should also include a eudaimonic dimension\n(EWB). The paper challenges a fundamental premise in research on wellbeing, which states\nthat self-reported life satisfaction provides an unbiased, broad, and reflected evaluation of an\nindividual’s life “as-a-whole.” Countering this assumption, two studies showed that HWB\nindicators differ from indicators of EWB, indicating that HWB does not measure EWB. Using\nsurvey experiments, the paper further demonstrated that, upon reflection, participants\ntypically regard eudaimonic values as more important than hedonic values, proposing that\nliving eudaimonically is important in people’s lives. A third finding showed that gaps\nbetween ideal and actual hedonic values predicted life satisfaction, whereas eudaimonic\nvalues gaps did not. This suggests that life satisfaction is not an unbiased evaluation of all the\nimportant values in a person’s life. Thus, measures of life satisfaction appear invalid (not\nmeasuring what they intend to measure). To get more relevant data on how well people\nconsider their lives to be, both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions should be taken into\naccount.",

          "abstract": "In two pre-registered experiments (exp.1: n=44; exp.2: n=46), we investigated whether emotional inner speech influences heart rate. Participants were asked to engage in sessions of either: self-encouraging positive inner speech, self-degrading negative inner speech, or inner counting while their heart rate was monitored. Participants were lying on a bed and asked to remain still during the inner speech trials. Experiment 1 consisted of two negative, two positive and four counting trials. Experiment 2 had four trials of each type. Trials lasted 180 seconds in experiment 1 and had a mixed duration in experiment 2 (40-70 seconds) to limit predictability. Motion tracking was applied to control for body movement. Median heart rate across each inner speech session was analyzed and a significant difference was found between emotional inner speech and inner counting across both experiments. No difference between positive and negative inner speech was observed. Post-hoc analyses investigated the relationship between movement and heart rate increases and found an effect with a peak lag of approximately 14 seconds. Removing these effects did not change the effect that emotional inner speech had on heart rate. In line with previous literature, additional analyses showed that heart rate and respiration rate were linked. Including respiration rate as a variable in regression analyses did not alter the effect of emotion. The effect of emotional inner speech thus seems robust and demonstrates a causal effect on physiology. No correlations between heart rate effects and measures of depression and rumination were observed. We also discuss the results in relation to possible confounds, such as differences in cognitive effort and inner speech rate.",

          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, offer significant performance benefits across professional tasks. Yet, their adoption in work-related contexts is complicated by social disapproval and penalties, especially under conditions of mandated transparency. In three studies (one pre-registered; n = 1,678 applicants and n = 477 evaluators), we investigate how people navigate this augmentation-approval tradeoff in an incentivized mini-job application scenario. We find that mandatory disclosure substantially reduces visible AI adoption, but prompts a covert behavioral strategy we term shadow adoption, that is, using AI in ways that avoid detection and disclosure. Strikingly, these shadow AI users produce the highest-quality applications, as rated by HR professionals who are unaware that the outputs were AI-assisted. As the knowledge about the tradeoff spreads, shadow adoption becomes more prevalent, with nearly twice as many people choosing to use shadow AI. These results reveal a misalignment between well-intended transparency rules and user incentives in work-related contexts. Policies and technologies designed to enforce ethical AI use may inadvertently encourage covert behavior, rewarding concealment over compliance.",

The motivation for a post-school pathway (e.g., starting university or vocational training) was examined as a potential predictor of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 874 between ages 16 and 20; 69% female, 95% born in Germany) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway.a At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global than for daily assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations between the motivation for a post-school pathway and well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.",

          "authors": "Justin Angel",
          "abstract": "The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of AI psychotherapeutic tools (APTs) that are non-inferior to human therapists and hold the potential to dramatically expand access to mental healthcare worldwide. This paper proposes the ΔAPT framework, which forecasts APT clinical outcomes by linking architectural decisions to validated therapeutic metrics. Through an interdisciplinary AI and psychotherapy critical review, this paper establishes APT success criteria using conventional psychotherapy measurements including symptom reduction scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7), quality-of-life improvements, and therapeutic relationship indicators (WAI). A comparative analysis reveals that newer LLM- driven APTs achieve clinical outcomes non-inferior to human psychotherapists and significantly superior to earlier rules-based chatbots. The ΔAPT framework models how APTs' inherent structural advantages (24/7 availability, negligible cost) counterbalance current technical limitations (hallucinations, sycophancy, bias) and systemic risks (legal ambiguity, safety failures). Specific AI/ML architectural solutions are identified: context engineering techniques (retrieval-augmented generation, chain-of-thought prompting); fine-tuning on 1,000-10,000 hours of diverse therapy modalities beyond CBT; multi-agent architectures for cognitive task distribution; and integrated ML models for safety monitoring. This comprehensive roadmap guides APT developers and researchers in LLM architectural choices and therapeutic modality selection, with the goal of continuously improving clinical outcomes while addressing the global mental health crisis.\n\n\n**Contributions** \nThis paper presents four key contributions for AI/ML and psychotherapy research: First, the ΔAPT framework, which forecasts clinical outcomes by modeling the interplay between APTs'\nstructural advantages (zero-friction intake, extensive memory), technical limitations (LLM operational issues), and systemic risks (legal, ethical, safety concerns). Second, a prioritized analysis of limitations based on prevalence and mitigation feasibility, identifying sycophancy as the most critical unresolved challenge. Third, the first comprehensive taxonomy of hybrid APT architectures, detailing how context engineering, fine-tuning on ethically sourced therapy transcripts, multi-agent design, and ML safety models can be integrated to achieve clinical efficacy. Fourth, evidence that multimodal audio-video technologies are approaching readiness for emotionally attuned therapeutic interactions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Social anxiety and alcohol use disorders are often comorbid. Researchers have identified several psychosocial factors that often maintain social anxiety, such as fear of negative and positive evaluation, post-event processing, and difficulties with emotion regulation. Although evidence suggests that social anxiety disorder and alcohol-related risks are indirectly related via greater anxiety alcohol coping motives, the roles of maintaining psychosocial factors have not yet been tested in a comprehensive model. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study investigated the extent to which these psychosocial mechanisms were related to alcohol use and related problems through social anxiety and anxiety coping-motived drinking. Methods: 476 undergraduate students and community members completed an online survey measuring social anxiety symptoms, psychosocial mechanisms, and alcohol use problems. Results: We conducted a multivariate path analysis and examined eight indirect pathways within this model. Findings support that complex indirect relationships exist between psychosocial factors and alcohol outcomes via social anxiety and coping motives. While difficulties with emotion regulation only demonstrated partial mediation effects, all other psychosocial factors were differentially related to all alcohol-related risks through a combination of indirect-only and inconsistent mediation effects. Implications: These findings support self-medication and biopsychosocial models of social anxiety disorder and highlight the importance of considering the intricate underlying relationships between psychosocial factors, social anxiety symptoms, coping motives, and alcohol-related risks. Moreover, they can help inform evidence-based interventions for comorbid social anxiety and alcohol use disorders by identifying pertinent treatment targets.",

          "abstract": "Digital technologies now shape how people connect, work, relax, and avoid. Yet the psychological sciences lack a unified approach for explaining what sustains these behaviours over time. Existing frameworks are either too broad (e.g., “screen time”) or too narrow (e.g., app features) to capture the functions digital behaviours serve. Here we introduce technological behaviourism, a general theoretical approach grounded in operant conditioning that explains digital engagement through observable antecedents and consequences. Rather than focusing on what people do (e.g., scrolling), this approach is focused on why they do it, in terms of four functions: exploration, esteem, entertainment, and escape. By shifting the lens from form to function, technological behaviourism enables precise, testable analysis of digital engagement and guides the design of context-aware, functionally aligned interventions. It bridges behavioural science with digital environments, offering a scalable, mechanistically grounded approach to understanding and shaping digital behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Thought psychologists were slow to come to the topic of character, their recent efforts have been expedited in part by the introduction of the VIA Classification of Character Strengths and Virtues (Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004). This system, comprised of 24 character strengths attempting to provide a comprehensive set of character dimensions, has inspired a number of studies attempting to define a latent structure for the strengths. The most frequently replicated model across different measures of the strengths, populations, and analytic strategies is comprised of three factors that have been or can be called heart/will/mind, caring/self-control/inquisitiveness, or.morality/self-control/reasoning. Subsequent explorations has suggested this model has relevance beyond the context of character strengths to character in general. Summarizing additional research with the character strengths, research on persona perception, empirical research and theory in education, discussions in moral philosophy, and examples from entertainment, the case is made for considering these three dimensions a Big Three of Character, playing a similar role to the Big Five of Personality. Evidence from person perception and popular culture in particular suggest the model is intuitively appreciated even by youth.",

          "authors": "Jack Silcox; Karen Bennett; David Strayer; Sarah Hargus Ferguson; Brennan Payne",
          "abstract": "When listening to acoustically challenging speech, listeners may have to compensate by shifting their cognitive strategies such as how they use prior context. This shift may depend on the age and hearing acuity of the listener. In the current study, younger adults with normal hearing (N = 48; Exp 1) and older adults with varying hearing acuity (N = 80; Exp 2), listened in quiet and in noise to contextually constraining sentences that ended in an expected word, an unexpected word, or a morphosyntactic violation of the expected word. We recorded EEG and extracted event-related potentials (ERPs) to target words. For younger adults, we observed that the syntactic P600—a component linked to controlled integrative processes—was reduced when listening to speech in background noise. In contrast, an ERP response more strongly yoked to predictive processing, the late frontal response, was present in noise, suggesting that acoustic challenge did not impair predictive processing. For older adults with normal hearing, we observed a small prediction-related ERP response and a robust P600 response in quiet. In noise, the integration-related P600 response to syntactic violations was reduced while the increased syntactic N400 effect increased, suggesting a shift from an integrative mode to reliance on lexical predictions. In quiet, a similar shift towards reduced integration and increased prediction was observed with increasing hearing loss, but these prediction-related effects were severely reduced among older adults with hearing loss when speech was presented in noise, suggesting auditory limits to compensatory reliance on contextual prediction. Collectively, these results suggest that listeners show adaptive shifts between integrative and predictive processing modes as a function of age, acoustic challenge, and hearing acuity.",

Neither of these strategies can be detected in paradigms assessing habits in humans, which are usually conducted in disorder-irrelevant contexts, and this may explain inconsistent evidence for a goal-directed-to-habitual behavior shift in addiction. We tested whether individuals with high-risk drinking behavior rely more on (red)SR, particularly in alcohol-related contexts. Findings suggest that a (reduced) random-policy SR-like strategy contributes to human behavior, but that high-risk drinkers do not differ from low-risk drinkers in their use of this strategy. Instead, both groups rely less on (reduced) random-policy SR and more on model-free control in alcohol-related contexts. Results suggest that (reduced) random-policy SR supports adaptive, resource-efficient behavior and is selectively downregulated in substance-related contexts, highlighting the importance of contextual modulation in understanding decision strategies in mental health.",

We present empirical and computational evidence that resolves and explains this apparent inconsistency. We show how a practice testing instructional treatment supports memory learning processes needed for verbatim fact content whereas an example-integrated instructional treatment supports inductive learning processes needed for general skill content. In an experiment comparing both instructional treatments on both types of content, we observe a cross-over interaction such that participants learn verbatim facts better from pure practice testing but learn general skills better from example-integrated practice. We use a computational learning architecture, AL, to create an executable theory that explains and predicts these results. Simulated students developed in AL interactively learn from the materials provided in the same four conditions as human learners and reproduce the same cross-over interaction. We further demonstrate that the benefit of integrated examples for general skill learning are a result of, and thus explained by, AL’s inductive learning mechanisms whereas the benefit of practice for verbatim fact learning result from AL’s memory learning mechanisms.",

So far, insights have largely focused on controlled lab-based experimental studies while less is known about individual differences in infants’ curiosity in everyday life. Recently, the Infant and Toddler Curiosity Questionnaire (ITCQ) was developed to examine trait curiosity in infants between 5 to 24 months. Extending this novel tool to Dutch-speaking families, this preregistered study translated the ITCQ to Dutch and examined its psychometric properties in a sample of 316 Dutch-speaking caregivers of infants in The Netherlands (5 to 24 months, 47% female). The results indicated that the ITCQ-NL reliably measures infants’ general curiosity and their curiosity in three subdomains (Sensory, Investigative, and Interactive Curiosity). Furthermore, the ITCQ-NL showed moderate to good reliability over time (n = 218). Finally, we provide evidence of the questionnaire’s construct validity by relating the construct to established temperament measures. To conclude, this study demonstrates the reliability and validity of the ITCQ-NL for assessing individual differences in infants’ everyday trait curiosity in a Dutch population. Our instrument will also facilitate the exploration of cross-cultural differences and comparisons across methodological approaches.",

Here we report a study of how concepts of integer number combine with those of mindreading. We used tasks that require explicit thought and verbal responses, and examined children between 6-10 years of age. We designed four experiments to look at the intersection of quantification and mindreading in development using two combination tasks: (i) visual perspective taking and number; (ii) false belief and number. In both, children needed to coordinate between simple mathematical operations (counting and addition), and reconstructing an agent's visual or mental perspective. Although all senior kindergarteners were proficient in counting, and the majority of them passed the false-belief task, the false belief and number task has proven surprisingly difficult, and was not mastered before age 8. We offer a performance-based explanation of this difficulty.",

With ageing populations and increased individual responsibilities, understanding the impact of healthy cognitive ageing on decision-making is crucial. While the effect of ageing on basic cognitive abilities has been examined widely, its effects on decision-making remain underexplored. To address the latter, we conducted a large (n = 357), pre-registered online experiment comparing decision-making and basic cognitive functioning between younger (18-30) and older (65+) adults. Older adults made significantly lower quality decisions. The decline in decision-making capacity is primarily explained by lower performance on tasks of basic cognitive abilities and not age, education, or motivation. Despite investing more time, older adults explored fewer decision options and were more overconfident. These findings suggest that healthy cognitive ageing impairs decision-making capacity due to cognitive decline, with important implications for policy and choice architecture design, particularly in ageing populations.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers usually make sense of regression models by interpreting coefficient estimates directly. This works well enough for simple linear models, but is more challenging for more complex models with, for example, categorical variables, interactions, non-linearities, and hierarchical structures. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to making sense of statistical models. The central idea is to abstract away from the mechanics of estimation, and to treat models as “counterfactual prediction machines,” which are subsequently queried to estimate quantities and conduct tests that matter substantively. This workflow is model-agnostic; it can be applied in a consistent fashion to draw causal or descriptive inference from a wide range of models. We illustrate how to implement this workflow with the marginaleffects package, which supports over 100 different classes of models in R and Python, and present two worked examples. These examples show how the workflow can be applied across designs (e.g., observational study, randomized experiment) to answer different research questions (e.g., associations, causal effects, effect heterogeneity) while facing various challenges (e.g., controlling for confounders in a flexible manner, modelling ordinal outcomes, and interpreting non-linear models).",

In an online experiment testing pre-registered hypotheses, 3,371 participants from 13 societies made incentivized competition decisions in a contest game and cooperation decisions for coordination in a step-level public goods game. Perceived normative honour values were associated with greater competition and also greater cooperation at both societal and individual levels. Personally endorsing values tied to defence of family reputation was associated with greater coordinative efforts, whereas endorsing self-promotion and retaliation was associated with weaker engagement in coordination. These findings highlight the role of honour as a cultural logic (in its different forms) in shaping competition and cooperation across societies.",

We also used this measure to test the efficacy of a new computerized selective attention training called “The Botanist and the Animals” in 17 ABI patients. The training was hypothesized to help patients regain control over sensory experiences, without intending to restore cognitive functions. Both the measure and training involved multiple sensory modalities. Results showed variable psychometric properties of the adapted Bourdon-Wiersma test. Selective attention training in ABI patients showed near transfer effects on this measure, although only 35% of the patients showed reliable improvements. No far transfer effects to other cognitive measures were observed, yet exploratory analyses indicated improvements in self-reported rehabilitation participation, cognitive difficulties, and quality of life. Potentially, active engagement in the training helped ABI patients to boost their confidence in daily life, yet the specificity and long-term effects of the training need further assessment.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) are neural prostheses that restore some level of hearing capacity, albeit\nconveying a less fine-grained speech signal than normal hearing conditions. For example, CIs\nconvey altered fundamental frequency (F0) information, disrupting the perception of lexical stress\n(e.g., distinguishing between the noun CONtent and the adjective conTENT) in languages in which\nthis feature rests on F0 modulations. CI-users can compensate for the degraded nature of the\nacoustic input by exploiting the audiovisual affordances of human communication, weighing more\nheavily the visual information provided by the speaker (e.g., lip movements and gestures). Recent\nstudies showed that, in individuals with normal hearing, the timing of simple up-and-down\nmovements of the hand (i.e., beat gestures) biases lexical stress perception. The present study tested\nif the timing of beat gestures produced by an avatar can bias Dutch lexical stress perception in\nvocoded speech, which simulates CI-hearing conditions. The bias induced by beat gestures in\nvocoded speech was particularly pronounced when hearing an ambiguous or the least frequent\nstress pattern in Dutch. These results suggest that (even artificially generated) beat gestures can be\nused to support speech perception in CI-mediated speech, especially when processing words with\nprosodic features that are less frequent.",

This study examined associations between suicidal ideation and emotion-processing difficulties, coping strategies, resilience, and cognitive functioning after moderate-severe TBI.\n\nMethod: This was a secondary analysis of data from 106 individuals with moderate-severe TBI. Suicidal ideation and emotional distress were assessed using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. Participants also completed measures of emotional lability and detachment (Comprehensive Assessment of Traits Relevant to Personality Disorders [CAT-PD]), coping (Coping Scale for Adults), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), and cognitive functioning, including subjective (CAT-PD, Brief Rating of Executive Function) and objective measures (Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone). Spearman’s correlations and path models were used to examine psychological and cognitive correlates of suicidal ideation.\n\nResults: Suicidal ideation was positively associated with emotional lability, emotional detachment, non-productive coping, and self-reported cognitive problems, and negatively associated with resilience. Path models indicated that emotional distress accounted for 76–100% of these associations. Conversely, suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with adaptive coping or objective cognitive performance.\n\nConclusions: Emotion processing, non-productive coping strategies, low resilience, and self-reported cognitive problems are linked to suicidal ideation in individuals with moderate-severe TBI, primarily through their associations with emotional distress. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, and its underlying contributors in suicide prevention for this population.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Discrepancies have previously been observed between the numerical mathematics problem solving of autistic children and their solving of worded mathematics problems, with the latter perceived as an area of challenge. While there are many reasons why this challenge may exist (e.g., reading comprehension and executive function differences), one, as yet untapped, explanation is the specific mathematical concepts assessed which may confound comparisons across assessments. \n\nMethods: In this study, 43 autistic children (32 male, 11 female) aged 6- to 12-years completed four assessments of mathematics problems: WIAT-III subscales of Numerical Operation and Mathematical Problem Solving, and two bespoke subscales (numerical and worded) matched on mathematical concepts and difficulty across numerical and worded problem sets. \n\nResults: We found that while performance in the worded problems subscale of the WIAT-III was significantly lower than the numerical problem subscale, there was no significant difference between the two task types in the bespoke measures. \n\nConclusion: Our results suggest that differences in mathematical concepts assessed between worded and numerical problems may explain challenges experienced by autistic children in worded problems, rather than reading comprehension alone. As such, when drawing conclusions about the mathematics performance of autistic children, careful consideration of the mathematics concepts evaluated is needed. These findings also have implications for the development of formal school assessments and research on mathematics skills in autistic children.",

          "abstract": "The question of whether humans have free will or not is longstanding in the areas of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. While the issue has not been resolved, determinist and compatibilist frameworks have received support from the neuropsychological data. In both cases, decisions are made within a broader framework of causal determinism. If thoughts and behaviours are inevitable consequences of a continuous chain of cause-effect events, why do we feel free? Here, we propose a neuropsychological model for the experience of free will as a conditioned illusion – a misattribution of causality reinforced through operant learning. Drawing on classical findings such as the readiness potential preceding conscious intention and more recent work on active inference, we argue that the temporal contiguity of premotor and motor activations gives rise to superstitious conditioning, shaping an experience of – and belief in – free will that is compatible with determinism. Sustained by dopaminergic circuits and reinforced by sensorimotor feedback loops, our framework situates free will as an experiential phenomenon rooted in the functional neuroanatomy of learning. We discuss implications for medicine, ethics, law, and suggest conditions under which the experience of free will may be disrupted or restructured by disease, pharmacology, and reinforcement history.",

          "abstract": "Several prominent theories of eating disorders maintenance exist, with most corresponding to evidence-based treatments. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an ideal method for testing relationships between proposed maintenance factors and eating disorder symptoms given its ability to examine antecedents and consequences. A seminal systematic review and meta-analysis of EMA studies on affect and binge eating was published in 2011, but the literature since this time and beyond these variables has not been synthesized. We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Scopus (last search March 31, 2025) for articles using EMA to study psychological/contextual variables in relation to a core eating disorder symptom in people with an eating disorder or eating disorder symptom. After screening, 179 papers were included. The majority examined affect in relation to binge eating or loss of control (LOC) eating, although affect was also considered in relation to purging, restriction, exercise, and body checking. Whereas negative affect primarily drives binge eating/LOC eating and purging, positive affect appears more relevant for exercise and (perhaps) restriction. Surprisingly few studies have considered how ED-related cognitive, affective, or behavioral variables relate to eating disorder symptoms, despite these being primary associations in leading maintenance/treatment models of eating disorders. Most studies have investigated samples of exclusively women, with some having a small proportion of male participants, and only two samples were comprised of all or almost all men. Future EMA research on eating disorders should go beyond studying affect to test whether relationships proposed in established maintenance models can be observed in daily life.",

This study leverages computational text analysis of over 250,000 U.S. congressional speeches from 1880 to 2020 to examine the evolution of intentionality framing—rhetoric focusing on immigrants' motives, desires, and goals. Using GPT-4 to identify intentionality cues, we find a significant increase in intentionality framing since the mid-20th century, coinciding with growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans. Crucially, pro-immigration discourse increasingly emphasizes positive intentions, while anti-immigration rhetoric has become more behaviorist, focusing on external impacts rather than internal states. This rhetorical divergence intensifies during periods of heightened political polarization. Our findings highlight how political actors strategically mobilize psychological intuitions about intent to mobilize voter support and underscore the role of perceived intentionality in shaping social and moral evaluations of immigrant groups.",

Studies 2a (N = 1,506) and 2b (N = 1,255), conducted as one-week longitudinal studies during the 2024 European and French parliamentary elections, revealed that an information treatment emphasizing deservingness cues strongly reduced misperceptions about immigrants, modestly reduced opposition to immigration, and had an even smaller effect for anti-immigration voting.

          "abstract": "For many years the accepted wisdom in vision science has been that humans tend to underestimate the speed of an object when they pursue it with their gaze in comparison to when they fixate a spot in the visual scene and the object moves across the retina, an effect that is referred to as the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. However, experiments on the Aubert-Fleischl effect have generally employed a target moving in front of a blank background. For objects moving in the real world, relative motion between the object and the background provides additional cues, potentially allowing the visual system to compensate for the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we asked 50 participants to compare the speed of a single sphere to the speed of a sphere-cloud in a two-interval forced-choice task while they either followed the single sphere with their gaze or kept their eyes on a fixation cross. Stimuli were presented in virtual reality and the sphere’s movement could occur either in a completely black environment with no relative motion cues present, or against a visible, textured background behind the moving sphere. The probe sphere-cloud always moved in front of the same background as the target. In a large data set (n = 50), we found no evidence for an Aubert-Fleischl effect, i.e., no evidence for an underestimation of speed during pursuit relative to fixation, in either of the environments. Our results challenge the prevailing notion that object speed is underestimated when the object is pursued versus when fixation is maintained and highlights the necessity to take into account characteristics of the visual scene.",

          "abstract": "This study examined longitudinal changes in grit during adolescence by identifying heterogeneous developmental trajectories of its two dimensions: consistency of interest and perseverance of effort. We employed latent class growth analysis to model developmental trajectories of grit using four-wave data from the adolescent cohort (N = 2,590, first-year middle school students at Wave 1) of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey 2018. Additionally, we explored early precursors (i.e., parenting styles at Wave 1) of trajectory classes and examined how class membership was associated with psychological well-being (e.g., life satisfaction at Wave 4). Results revealed three distinctive grit trajectories over four years: Moderate-Decreasing (72.9%), Low-Stable (17.6%), and High-Decreasing (9.5%). Parenting styles characterized by rejection and chaos predicted class membership. Adolescents in the High-Decreasing class reported the highest levels of psychological well-being, followed by those in the Moderate-Decreasing and Low-Stable classes. Our findings underscore the importance of identifying developmental heterogeneity in grit trajectories.",

We compared human adults and pigeons in a category learning task, where we manipulated the category structure (dense vs. sparse) and the level of supervision by corrective feedback (low vs. high). Results showed a benefit of supervision across species, which was particularly strong in learning the sparse categories. Moreover, both species benefitted from category structures that had multiple category-relevant dimensions (i.e., dense categories). In addition, human adults, who have a more advanced ability to attend selectively, showed faster learning and better generalization overall. Finally, attention was optimized to the category-relevant dimension in the sparse category only in human adults. Subsequent computational simulation of the data indicated that these patterns were well explained by a parameter that controls the ability to flexibly switch attention to category-relevant dimensions.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge gaps elicit curiosity and increase people's willingness to invest resources in seeking information to close them. While previous research used confidence ratings to implicitly infer knowledge gaps, the impact of making these gaps explicitly salient to people on their information-seeking behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated this question across two preregistered experiments (Experiment 1: \\textit{n} = 501, Experiment 2: \\textit{n} = 511 participants). Participants first took a knowledge test on elephant conservation in Botswana. Subsequently, participants repeatedly decided to either read or skip a chapter of an article covering different subtopics on elephant conservation in Botswana, before they took the same test again. We manipulated the salience of knowledge gaps by illustrating pretest performance scores to the experimental group, while the control group received no such information. In Experiment 2, we instructed participants after the pretest that a posttest would follow at the end of the experiment and thereby intended to increase the utility of information seeking. Our results provide converging evidence that illustrating moderate knowledge gaps significantly increased participants' probability of seeking information by reading the chapters. In Experiment 2, illustrating moderate knowledge gaps was not only associated with increased information-seeking behavior, but also led to significantly greater gains in posttest performance compared to the control group. Altogether, our findings open new avenues for research on leveraging knowledge gap illustrations to deliberately stimulate curiosity, thereby increasing information-seeking behavior and knowledge acquisition.",

This article examines the differences and connections between the use of technological and traditional means, focusing on their effects on users’ perceptions and attitudes in different environments.\nMethod\nA series of quantitative studies was conducted using questionnaires. Participants were asked to evaluate their personal experiences when using technological means versus non-technological means across various contexts, including learning, work, navigation, and shopping.\nResults\nConsistent negative relationships were found between users' attitudes toward technological and traditional environments. For example, this was observed in comparisons such as digital versus classroom learning, remote versus office work, digital versus traditional navigation, and online versus physical shopping. However, positive relationships were also found between attitudes toward digital services and human services, as well as between experiences using technology within the organization and similar experiences in other settings. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the service experience in public transportation using traditional means and the service experience using technological means.\nDiscussion\nThe findings indicate that the service experience remains largely unchanged whether delivered within a specific organization or at a fixed location, irrespective of whether the service is provided through technological or traditional means. In contrast, in separate locations, the service experience changes substantially when the service is delivered through technological means compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the experience of using technological means remains consistent across different environments, both inside and outside the organization.\nThe article emphasizes the importance of understanding the contexts in which technology is used and their impact on users' attitudes and overall experience.",

          "authors": "Luca Blumhardt; Justin Harris",
          "abstract": "Research over the last decade has shown that the value associated with a perceptually salient stimulus enhances its ability to attract attention towards itself. This phenomenon, called value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC), has relevance to a wide variety of psychological matters. Thus, an understanding of the conditioning processes that are responsible for VMAC can provide further insight into these matters. Almost all the literature argues that a Pavlovian conditioning process and not an information-seeking process is responsible for VMAC. However, there are grounds to question whether this is always the case. The current article reviewed the empirical research that has been conducted, or could potentially be used, to investigate the learning processes that are responsible for VMAC. It established that much research has been too limited to determine what processes are responsible for VMAC, but much research has not. Specifically, research that has found VMAC arising in its entirety before awareness of the stimulus-value association is acquired and taking place regardless of whether reward information is devalued later in training provides evidence of Pavlovian conditioning. However, research that has found VMAC arising when points feedback is withheld and individuals are informed of the stimulus-value association, and only taking place when reward information is not devalued when information devaluation is manipulated from the start of training, provides evidence of information-seeking. Thus, the findings of the research suggest that either process may give rise to VMAC and that it is the conditions under which VMAC is established that determines what process is responsible for it – Pavlovian conditioning will be responsible for VMAC when information-seeking is precluded, and information-seeking will be responsible for VMAC when Pavlovian conditioning is precluded.",

This article presents a comprehensive critique of PP theory, arguing that despite its superficial elegance and broad appeal, the framework suffers from fundamental conceptual flaws, empirical inadequacies, and methodological problems that render it unsuitable as a general theory of brain function. Through systematic analysis of its core assumptions, empirical support, and explanatory scope, we demonstrate that PP represents not a revolutionary advance in neuroscience, but rather a sophisticated example of theoretical overreach that has diverted attention from more productive research directions.

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) research has long debated whether its storage operates via discrete slots or distributed resources. However, emerging neuroscientific evidence suggests that neither account alone fully captures the complexity of WM function. Here, I propose a context-content hierarchical framework that unifies these views. A capacity-limited “context” system maintains discrete spatiotemporal pointers that individuate and prioritize items, while a precision-limited “content” system encodes detailed sensory information in modality-specific population codes whose fidelity varies with task demands. These systems interact through predictive top-down feedback and rhythmic coordination to support “holographic” reconstruction, in which a low-dimensional pointer selectively reinstates high-dimensional content on demand. This architecture explains how stable capacity limits can coexist with graded precision, activity-silent states, and rapid cue-driven reinstatement, and clarifies when contextual retrieval protects performance from interference. The framework yields clear experimental predictions and motivates computational models in which pointer indexing is coupled to sensory reconstruction. By integrating discrete control signals with continuous sensory representations, the context–content framework reconceptualizes WM as a dynamic, generative system that balances sparse indexing with on-demand reconstruction to guide adaptive behavior.\nKeywords: working memory, binding, contextual pointers, sensory recruitment, discrete slots, continuous resources",

          "abstract": "There is considerable debate over whether and how social media contributes to polarization. Research suggests that a small number of hyperpartisan “influencers,” or highly followed accounts, produce the vast majority of misinformation and toxic content. Yet, little is known about the long-term causal effects of exposure to these influencers. In a correlational study (n1 = 1,447) and two digital field experiments (n2 = 494, n3 = 1,133), we examined whether (un)following hyperpartisan social media influencers contributes to polarization and misinformation sharing. We found that incentivizing Twitter/X users to unfollow hyperpartisan social media influencers improved their recent feelings toward the out-party by 23.5% compared to the control group, with effects persisting for at least six months. Unfollowing also led participants to engage with more accurate news accounts, increased satisfaction with their Twitter/X feeds, and reduced the amount of political content they reported seeing a full year later—without reducing engagement. By contrast, incentivizing users to follow accounts that tweeted about science improved well-being. Additionally, we found that, after Elon’s Musk purchased Twitter/X and made several platform changes, participants used Twitter/X less frequently, viewed their feeds as less reliable, and posted lower quality news. Our results demonstrate the long-term, causal impact of repeated exposure to hyper-partisan influencers on attitudes and behavior. They also illustrate that the behavior and experience of Twitter/X users changed substantially after Elon Musk’s purchase of the platform, revealing the potential impact of social media design changes. Our work has implications for interventions that can be made by platforms or by individuals seeking to curate their social media experience. Unlike other social media reduction interventions, unfollowing is a targeted approach: like a scalpel, it surgically removes a few harmful parts of one’s feed, allowing the beneficial aspects to remain.",

          "authors": "Liudmyla Yuzva; Piotr Długosz",
          "abstract": "This article explores the migration and settlement decisions of Ukrainian refugees in Germany following the 2022 Russian invasion. Applying Everett Lee’s push–pull theory, it focuses on women with children—the largest displaced group—and investigates whether access to children’s education emerges not only as a domain of integration but as a significant pull factor within a broader constellation of drivers shaping settlement intentions. The analysis draws on original survey data collected in late 2024 (n = 1075), using an SMS-recruited online questionnaire administered across several host countries. Findings indicate that while war-related threats (e.g., bombardments, destruction of housing) were the primary push factors prompting departure from Ukraine, the decision to settle in Germany was strongly influenced by pull factors such as safety, social support, and access to schooling. Respondents in Germany were more likely to cite long-term motives—such as improved living standards and educational prospects—than those in neighboring countries. Education emerges not only as a sphere of integration but also as a migration driver. Dual-schooling models (local and Ukrainian), parental assessments of system quality, and children’s adaptation shaped settlement choices. These dynamics underscore the role of education in refugee agency and family strategy. The article argues that Ukrainian migration to Germany illustrates the interplay between structural pressures and personal decision-making. Push factors triggered large-scale displacement; pull factors and individual evaluations shaped longer-term trajectories. These findings contribute to migration theory by demonstrating the centrality of education in forced migration contexts and by highlighting the heterogeneity of refugee profiles within a single national cohort.",

          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

Recent research highlights the importance of contextual factors in moderating mindset’s impact on student outcomes. The commonly-used original mindset measure is context-general. Recently, a mindset measure that is specific to science and math undergraduates was developed: the Undergraduate Lay Theories of Abilities (ULTrA) Survey. I hypothesized that a context-specific measure of mindset would associate more strongly with undergraduates’ outcomes than a context-general measure. I surveyed 1,537 undergraduates with Dweck’s 3-item original mindset measure, ULTrA, and measures of outcomes (sense of belonging, goal orientation, self-handicapping, evaluative concern and intent to persist in science) and collected course grades. Structural equation modeling indicated that the fixed factor of the ULTrA exhibited stronger and more consistent relationships with outcomes than the 3-item original mindset measure and predicted unique variance in outcomes above and beyond what the original mindset measure accounted for. The academic outcomes (intent to persist and course grade) were significantly related to ULTrA, but not the original mindset measure. Our results provide evidence that the context-specific ULTrA survey can detect relationships with undergraduate outcomes that the context-general original mindset measure can fail to detect.",

In Experiment 2, the blocked regime maintained higher \naccuracy across both learning and test phases. No sleep-related improvements in performance \nwere observed for the interleaved groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, recurrent neural \nnetworks trained on participant data did suggest an increase in task separation after sleep, but \nthis was not associated with improvements in task performance, nor was it specific to the \ninterleaved condition.

Free resources for data analysis provide researchers with greater freedom and make the research process more accessible and democratic. This is particularly crucial for researchers, students, and institutions in the Majority World (also called Global South), where a lack of access to expensive proprietary software often creates barriers to quality research and training. This article lists some free software that can perform basic and advanced statistical data analysis tasks. Some software that can perform other tasks, such as text mining and qualitative data analysis, is also introduced. It explores critical emerging trends, including the integration of AI into the research workflow. Ease of use and functionality are the major criteria for selecting these software packages.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that contingency instructions (CI), stating that the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) will not be presented anymore, can enhance extinction learning, and additional CI before extinction retrieval can reduce the return of fear. However, immediate pre-retrieval instructions are impractical in therapeutic settings. Thus, this study investigated the impact of CI before and/or after extinction training on extinction learning in 240 participants (120 patients with anxiety disorders (ADs), 120 healthy controls) using a three-day sequential conditioning paradigm. Electrical shocks and colored lamps served as UCS and conditioned stimuli (CS), with skin conductance responses (SCRs), CS valence, and UCS expectancy ratings as readout measures. CI before extinction training enhanced extinction learning for both patients with ADs and healthy controls across the physiological and subjective measures. Instructed healthy controls displayed even lower SCRs than instructed patients during early extinction. Furthermore, participants receiving post-extinction CI showed reduced CS differentiation in their SCRs during extinction retrieval. After a reinstatement, instruction timing differentially affected fear responses across contexts. Participants instructed before and after extinction, and uninstructed participants showed higher fear responses in the original conditioning context. Those instructed only before extinction exhibited increased fear responses in extinction and novel contexts, while participants instructed only after extinction showed heightened fear responses exclusively in the extinction context. The findings highlight how the timing of providing contingency information shapes fear learning and memory.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are no longer passive information filters but active participants in shaping human cognition. This paper introduces AI-Mediated Cognitive Distortions (AI-MCDs) and Digital Echo Delusions (DEDs) as emergent phenomena at the intersection of human biases and generative AI. We propose the Resonant Amplification Framework (RAF) to explain how small cognitive tendencies can be amplified into entrenched distortions of belief through four recursive phases: Anthropomorphic Priming, Confirmation Alignment, Linguistic Reinforcement, and Perceptual Displacement. Unlike traditional echo chambers, AI systems not only reflect but co-produce content, generating iterative resonance that is more powerful and self-sustaining.\n\nWe distinguish DEDs from clinical delusions by emphasizing their phenomenological similarity but contextual reversibility—AI-induced distortions weaken when interaction ceases, unlike pathological delusions. The paper outlines empirical pathways for testing RAF (e.g., trust and vigilance measures, dialogue analysis, repetition effects, resistance to correction) and proposes practical safeguards in the form of “cognitive circuit breakers”—design principles aimed at disrupting harmful feedback loops.\n\nBy naming and conceptualizing these phenomena, the study establishes a foundation for cognitive science, AI ethics, and human–AI interaction research. It urges interdisciplinary collaboration to preserve users’ affective and epistemic sovereignty, ensuring that AI serves as a constructive amplifier of knowledge rather than a distorting echo of illusion.\n\nKeywords: AI-Mediated Cognitive Distortions (AI-MCDs), Digital Echo Delusions (DEDs), Resonant Amplification Framework (RAF), cognitive bias, confirmation bias, illusory truth effect, anthropomorphism, echo chambers, epistemic vigilance, human-AI interaction, AI ethics, cognitive sovereignty.",

Alternatively, we argue that the feeling of control over one’s life could be rooted in conservative behavior and avoidance of risky agentic strategies. Using WVS cross-country data we show that the link between locus of control and conservative behavior has a U-shaped form, while the optimal level of locus of control depends on the degree of environmental uncertainty.",

Identity-based motivation theory makes three predictions that have not been directly tested: First, people make both inferences (ecological validity). Second, endorsement varies across people and situations (trait-state) and matters for self-perception and action (consequential). Third, unambiguous contexts (context) shift momentary endorsements. We address this gap using validated difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scales across five studies (N = 2,746), finding support for each prediction. Ecological validity: people recall making both inferences a few times a month (Study 1, N=986 undergraduates). Trait-state: difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scores differ between persons and fluctuate within-persons (Study 2, three time-points, N=733 middle schoolers and high schoolers; Study 4, N=260 undergraduates, n=2,789 two-week daily diaries). Consequential: trait difficulty-as-impossibility predicts later preference for easier tasks (Study 3, N=216 undergraduates); trait difficulty-as-importance predicts daily meaningful engagement with school (Study 4). Daily fluctuations in both are associated with daily self-esteem, self-compassion, and goal self-efficacy (Study 4).

          "abstract": "Background: Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to community resilience across the ASEAN region, with the Philippines serving as a critical case for investigating links between environmental stressors and community mental health. This meta-analysis and systematic review examine how community-based mental health interventions strengthen climate resilience within disaster risk reduction and resilient infrastructure frameworks.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched eight databases for literature published between 2010 and 2025. Quantitative synthesis used Review Manager (v5.4) and R (v4.4.3); qualitative analysis used MAXQDA (2020). GRADE assessment evaluated the certainty of evidence across primary outcomes.\n\nResults: Thirty-two studies (N=45,247) revealed substantial climate-related mental health impacts: pooled PTSD prevalence 35.2% (95% CI 28.6-42.1), depression 18.4% (95% CI 14.7-22.8), and anxiety 31.8% (95% CI 25.3-39.1). Meta-regression revealed that disaster type explained 45% of the heterogeneity variance (p &lt; 0.01). Protective community factors significantly reduced the mental health burden, including social networks (OR=0.43, 95% CI 0.35-0.52), collective efficacy (OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.29-0.49), and cultural practices (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.75). Infrastructure-integrated psychosocial support centers demonstrated 60% greater effectiveness in intervention compared to standalone programs (p &lt; 0.001). Women, children, and indigenous communities experienced disproportionate impacts, requiring targeted interventions.\n\nConclusions: Climate-induced mental health impacts require coordinated regional responses within integrated disaster risk reduction frameworks. Aligning with the Sendai Framework priorities, the findings support community-centered, culturally adapted interventions that combine immediate psychosocial support with resilient infrastructure development. ASEAN collaborative strategies are essential for strengthening community mental health systems and advancing Sustainable Development Goals through multi-hazard approaches.",

Our current understanding of \nIU in CHPCs is siloed within the literatures on specific CHPCs. However, IU is consistently \nidentified as a risk factor for anxiety and depressive disorders. In this exploratory study, we used \na mixed methods design to better understand the role of IU and anxiety in people’s (n = 139) \nlived experiences of their CHPCs and how they respond to uncertainty across health and \neveryday contexts.  \n\nPrimary Results:  \nHigher acceptance of illness and perceived social support were related to lower IU and anxiety \namong people with CHPCs. Higher IU and anxiety were also related to lower scores on many \ndomains of quality of life. Our reflexive thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes: 1) \ndistressing ambiguous contexts are not limited to health scenarios and require management in \ndiverse ways; 2) interference of CHPCs affects multiple domains of life beyond physical health; \n3) navigating uncertainty for a chronic period changes coping abilities and identity development; \nand 4) responsivity to uncertainty is a multifaceted cognitive-behavioural and emotional\nphysiological response that hinders or promotes coping.  \n\nConclusions:  \nIU significantly impacts the lives of those with CHPCs and holds potential as a transdiagnostic \ntarget for early prevention and intervention. By tailoring therapeutic approaches to acknowledge \nthe importance of health-related cues while increasing tolerance of uncertainty, people with \nCHPCs will likely experience improved prognosis, wellbeing, and fulfillment.  \n\nKeywords: intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, chronic health, chronic pain, transdiagnostic, \ncontext, mixed-methods",

Despite recent advances in the measurement of Mach, most Mach scales show limited content validity because they have not systematically integrated recurring Mach themes in the areas of affect (A), behavior (B), cognition (C), and desire (D). To overcome this and other issues, we developed a new Mach scale, the M4. We created the M4 by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select 16 items from a pool of 92 newly generated and expert-rated Mach items. In two studies with German-speaking participants (N1 = 765; N2 = 1,288), the M4 total score showed high reliability and high convergent validity with established Mach scales and M4 informant reports. Furthermore, the nomological network of the M4 aligned in several respects with the theoretical conceptualization of Mach. However, some unexpected associations suggested the need to refine the conceptualization of Mach regarding its relationship with certain forms of impulsivity and neuroticism. Commonality analyses further indicated that the M4 predicted incentivized cheating behavior better than five other recently developed Mach measures. Hence, the M4 holds promise for advancing the assessment of Mach.",

We collected data from a large sample of children (N = 3575, 3–14 year olds) and adults (N = 211 adults) and found gradual changes over developmental age ranges in participants’ ability to identify the image that a word referred to. When children made errors, younger children were more likely to choose unrelated distractors than older children; error patterns were best explained by combining linguistic and visual similarity.

          "abstract": "Dogs have ascended to core family members in American households. Across three studies, we show that modern dogs now occupy roles historically reserved for close human relationships and often receive greater moral concern than people. Approximately three out of four dog owners view their dogs as primary sources of emotional support and companionship, and this “soulmate” bond is associated with a tendency to prefer and prioritize dogs over people. Childless dog owners are especially likely to view their dog as a soulmate, and national and county-level analyses further reveal that declining birth rates are strongly associated with increased pet-related spending. This suggests that dogs may fulfill caregiving roles once reserved for children and close kin. To assess the implications of this shift, we presented dog owners with moral dilemmas pitting the welfare of dogs against humans. Owners who viewed their dogs as soulmates were more likely to feed, fund, and save the life of a dog over a person. More than half of dog owners chose to save their dog over a human stranger, one in five chose to save an unfamiliar puppy over a person, and one in four chose to give money to a puppy in need over a child in need. The moral elevation of dogs may reflect—and potentially contribute to—declines in human social connection.",

The goals of this study were to localize a region of the frontal-eye-field (FEF) involved in both reading and attention and examine its connectivity with regions in the reading and attention networks, given the known role of the FEF in attentional processes and theorized role in reading. In Experiment 1, we revisited the results of our previous hybrid reading and attention study (Ekstrand, Neudorf, Kress, &amp; Borowsky., 2019). We observed a significant reading × attention interaction in BOLD intensity in the FEF, specifically the ventrolateral portion of Brodmann’s Area 6 (A6vl). In Experiment 2, we used Human Connectome Project diffusion tensor imaging data to examine the connectivity profile of the FEF-A6vl. We observed high communicability between the A6vl and basal ganglia (which plays a role in rhythm during syllabic processing). These connections support tract clusters which terminated in the cerebellar Crus I/II (which play roles in eye movements and semantics) and cerebral superior parietal lobule (which plays a role in attentional orienting and phonetic decoding). The results of this study elucidate the reading × attention interaction in the FEF-A6vl, and may have implications for developing treatments to improve reading in individuals with dyslexia.",

However, people vary widely in who they mean when they discuss diversity and their beliefs about why and how to promote diversity. These diversity components have only been examined in separate literatures, lacking full integration. Therefore, diversity scholarship sometimes conflates these different components without acknowledging their conceptual distinctions and historical contexts. We integrate and distinguish the literatures on diversity definitions (who), cases (why), and ideologies (how), while also proposing a new typology for defining diversity that is sensitive to societal hierarchy. Finally, we highlight how these different belief systems about diversity may covertly promote identity-blindness, whereby people state a commitment to diversity despite holding beliefs that undermine it. In particular, we argue that broadened definitions of diversity, the business case for promoting diversity, and value-in-equality diversity ideologies can all covertly help maintain identity-blindness.",

          "abstract": "Elected officials are increasingly extreme. Research trying to understand this trend has tended to focus on structural factors, such as primary elections and changes in the supply of candidates. Less emphasis has been placed on psychological perspectives. The current research advances such a perspective. Leveraging research on attitudes, we investigate when and why people prefer extreme over moderate candidates from their own party. We posit that the identity relevance of people’s attitudes plays a key role. Specifically, we propose that identity relevance fosters attitude extremity, which in turn promotes a preference for extreme over moderate candidates. Across six main studies (N = 3,136) using a variety of political issues, operationalizations of identity relevance, instantiations of candidate extremity, and experimental paradigms (including two studies with human-LLM interactions), we find support for this hypothesis. Our findings suggest that as attitudes become more identity relevant, they become more extreme, leading individuals to prefer extreme over moderate candidates from their party. These results shed light on when and why people prefer extreme over moderate candidates, contribute to a nascent literature on the identity relevance of people’s attitudes, and advance our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of attitude extremity.",

The acoustic properties of vowels stem from a combination of multiple factors including the intended vowel quality, vocal tract length, coarticulation, and speech rate. However, most current vowel normalization approaches do not distinguish among the different determinants. Scale2fit uses mixed effects models to jointly evaluate multiple factors, avoiding their conflation in vowel normalization. Study 1 shows that the new method excels in a series of comparisons with other normalization methods. Study 2 shows that the proposed framework excels at preserving vowel space reduction that follows from short duration, and is therefore more appropriate for studying vowel space reduction. Finally, Study 3 shows that it is possible to establish variety norms and add speakers incrementally",

          "abstract": "The Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) method is a structured approach to theory development in which domain experts collaboratively identify causal relationships between variables. However, CLD construction is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and cognitively demanding. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their advanced text processing capabilities and extensive knowledge base, offer the potential to support theory construction and reduce workload. This paper presents theoraizer, an R package and Shiny app that enhances CLD construction by integrating LLMs as a digital extension of the expert group. Researchers can use theoraizer to define a list of putative variables, then query an LLM to evaluate candidate causal links between these variables and provide supporting literature. Rather than replacing expert judgment, theoraizer functions as a thinking partner, helping researchers assess causal relationships and construct proto-theories. We describe how LLMs can be used to automate key steps in CLD construction and demonstrate empirically that agreement between theoraizer and human experts is comparable to the agreement observed between experts themselves. This suggests that LLMs can reliably assist in identifying putative causal structures, making the theory-building process more efficient. In addition to improving efficiency by quickly generating an initial candidate CLD, theoraizer supports creativity in the modeling process by suggesting alternative perspectives and highlighting variables or relationships that may have been overlooked. By combining the CLD method with the generative capabilities of LLMs, theoraizer drastically reduces the work required to arrive at a candidate CLD and provides users with a standardized, multi-stage framework for constructing CLDs that support early-stage theory development.",

          "abstract": "We developed machine learning models to predict future alcohol lapses within 24-hour windows lagged 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. We engineered features from 4x daily ecological momentary assessment from individuals (N=151; 51% male; mean age=41; 87% non-Hispanic White) in early recovery over three months. We trained and evaluated models using nested cross-validation. Median posterior auROC was high (0.85–0.91) for all models but decreased modestly with increasing lag. Models performed worse for non-advantaged groups (non-White and/or Hispanic, below poverty, female). Past alcohol use, abstinence self-efficacy, and craving were the most important features, with the magnitude of importance varying meaningfully by lag. These findings demonstrate feasibility of predicting next-day lapses up to two weeks in advance. Embedding these models in a recovery monitoring support system could enable adaptive, personalized care. Improving model fairness and optimizing the delivery of model feedback to sustain engagement remain critical next steps.",

We examined the role of support givers’ vocal pitch in three dyadic datasets (N1 = 39; N2 = 39; N3 = 59; friend pairs) where participants recorded scripted reappraisals (i.e., reinterpretations) of aversive stimuli to support a friend with regulating emotion. Using Bayesian statistics, we found cumulative evidence that when support givers used higher pitch in delivering these reappraisals, targets of support experienced less negative affect. Targets of support also reported greater relationship satisfaction with support givers who used higher pitch during reappraisal. These data consisted primarily of women friend pairs, with preliminary results indicating that these associations may not hold in men friendships. These results highlight acoustic features of verbal communication as a promising frontier for strengthening social ties and emotional wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) has emerged as a promising intervention for conditions such as depression, PTSD, and substance use disorders by enhancing the therapeutic potential of psychedelics with structured psychological support during preparation, dosing, and integration phases. Despite encouraging trial results, evidence for therapeutic mechanisms and optimal frameworks for PAP remain in nascent stages. We explore candidate therapies and frameworks for PAP. Concurrently, clinical science is shifting toward process-based therapy (PBT; Hofmann &amp; Hayes, 2019), which targets core transdiagnostic processes rather than disorder-specific protocols. While previous reviews of multiple mechanisms (e.g., Yaden et al., 2022) and disorder-specific papers (e.g., Sloshower et al., 2020) have identified key processes to target in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, this review introduces PBT and situates candidate mechanisms—such as psychological flexibility, emotion regulation, and decentering—within its framework. We explore how PBT principles can inform each phase of PAP, providing an idiographic, process-driven approach. Treatment strategies are selected based on functional analyses, case conceptualization, patient preferences, and qualitative and quantitative data collected throughout the treatment process. By moving away from specific brands of treatment, and instead integrating a PBT approach within PAP, we propose a novel, empirically grounded paradigm for optimizing therapeutic outcomes in this emergent field.",

          "abstract": "Environmental factors can have profound influences on biological systems, particularly through their effects on epigenetic processes. Epigenetics provides a powerful framework for understanding the regulation of gene expression through the interplay between genetic predispositions, inherited epigenetic marks, and lifelong environmental influences. Drawing on the “butterfly effect” metaphor from chaos theory, this review proposes that even subtle epigenetic changes may initiate cascading effects on gene regulation and biological systems, ultimately contributing to significant phenotypic outcomes, including the modification of developmental trajectories, disease susceptibility, and adaptive responses. The reversible and adaptable nature of epigenetic modifications enables organisms to respond dynamically to a wide range of stimuli throughout their lifespan. Conversely, maladaptive epigenetic regulation can be associated with pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and adverse mental health outcomes. Thus, epigenetic markers represent a promising target for risk prediction, prevention and therapeutic intervention. In this review, we discuss the wide-ranging implications of epigenetic theories underlying gene-environment interactions. Furthermore, we examine the evolving expectations of the scientific community and the public regarding epigenetic theories, which may shape future research directions and drive therapeutic innovation in health and disease. Epigenetic concepts are poised to bridge the gap between genetic predispositions and environmental influences, offering novel insights into complex biological processes and their outcomes.",

          "abstract": "When an action does not yield the sensory action effect associated with it, prediction error (PE) signals are generated. The present study investigates auditory event-related potential (ERP) markers of PE for violations of strong action-effect couplings as a function of whether the participants’ intention focuses on a particular action or a particular action effect. Participants produced high- and low-pitched tones by left and right button presses according to a pattern of visual stimuli. While the instruction as well as the action and tone sequences produced by the participants were identical, the type of intention induced by the visual symbols differed (in a between-subject design): In the action-effect intention group, the pattern consisted of “notes” (for high/low pitch), in the action intention group it consisted of “letters” (for left/right button-press). Occasionally, a button-press did not produce the associated sensory action effect. These incongruent sounds elicited an enhanced auditory N1 compared to congruent sounds in the “notes” but not the “letters” group which we interpret as PE signal. Actions selected by the intended action effect in the “notes” group presumably induced a predictive sensory representation of the action outcome, its violation resulting in an early PE at the level of the auditory N1. N2b and P3 were elicited in both groups. This suggests that the respective action-effect couplings were represented, and their violation processed at a conceptual level also in the “letters” group. These results support theories postulating that event representations bind together features of stimuli, actions, and associated outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models are powerful tools that explain how representations in\nperception and memory are transformed into observed behavior—such as choice and response\ntime—at the level of individual participants and individual trials. Such models have been used\nacross domains in cognitive science to build integrative theories of phenomena like\ncategorization, recognition, and attentional learning. Many of these models, however, were\ndeveloped to account for data from visual tasks, so it remains unclear whether the same\nmechanisms apply in the auditory domain. Thus, theories of, for example, auditory memory have\nnot benefited from modeling techniques to the same extent as have theories of visual memory. To\naddress this gap, we illustrate how a cognitive model that was originally developed in the visual\ndomain, the Exemplar-Based Random Walk model (EBRW; Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997), can\nnonetheless account for choice and response time in recognition of novel auditory timbres. We\ndo so by using the EBRW to couple stimulus representations derived from multidimensional\nscaling to a process by which recognition decisions are made by accumulating evidence that\ndepends on similarity. This paper therefore offers a practical tutorial on addressing the unique\nchallenges of adapting computational cognitive models to psychoacoustic data, highlighting the\nutility of applying such models in revealing connections between seemingly disparate aspects of\nauditory cognition.",

          "abstract": "We present four experiments that examine perception and memory for a novel set of\nauditory stimuli, using multidimensional scaling and cognitive modeling to clarify how people\nperceive and recognize these items. The stimuli are auditory “textures” constructed by adjusting\nthe distribution of power across upper frequency bands. In Experiment 1, people rated similarity\nbetween pairs of stimuli; in Experiments 2 and 3, they also engaged in a recognition memory\ntask using the same stimuli. In Experiment 4, they did all the same tasks from the first three\nexperiments, and rated stimuli for distinctiveness. Multidimensional scaling suggested the\nstimuli were perceived along three dimensions, a result which replicated across all four\nexperiments. While recognition performance was affected by similarity, serial position, and list\nhomogeneity, it was not related to distinctiveness ratings. These effects were accommodated by\nthe Exemplar-Based Random Walk model (Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997), extending prior work\n(Visscher et al., 2007) to show that recognition memory and similarity perception for static\nstimuli in the auditory domain are fundamentally like those for static stimuli in the visual\ndomain—though particularly strong recency effects in the auditory domain suggest the influence\nof an additional sensory representation like echoic memory.

To succeed in this pursuit, people must make inferences about the structure of their social networks, monitor group norms, and adjust their behavior strategically. This study employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods in a sample of 92 college students belonging to 9 social groups to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these processes and their relationship to conformity in the context of alcohol use. When young adults passively looked at faces of their real-life social network peers, brain systems implicated in valuation and social cognition spontaneously represented information about the popularity and leadership status of the social target. Individual differences in these neural valuations were systematically associated with varying levels of conformity to group drinking norms in everyday life. Students who had stronger responses to faces of peers with relatively higher popularity and leadership status than themselves in one key valuation brain region, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), were more likely to align their behavior with their groups’ drinking norms in daily life. These results provide novel evidence for how brain systems involved in valuation and social cognition track multidimensional (popularity and leadership) information about real-life social networks and contribute to a growing literature on the neural mechanisms through which social comparison processes shape conformity (2). Our study highlights the vmPFC as a central hub that spontaneously tracks differences between the self and peers and uses this information to guide behavior to match group norms.",

          "abstract": "Social robots are increasingly integrated into everyday environments, yet effective human-robot interaction remains challenging as robots often fail to engage social cognition the same way human partners do. Here, we examined the degree to which physical features impact the degree to which robots are being perceived as agents ‘with a mind’. For that purpose, we took all robot stimuli currently contained in the Anthropomorphic Robot Database (ABOT; n = 251) and examined the degree to which they trigger mind perception (N = 300). Consistent with prior findings, robots were generally attributed more agency (capacity to act and plan) than experience (capacity to sense and feel). Body components significantly explained variance in the perception of agency, especially in interaction with facial features; for experience, on the other hand, variance was significantly explained by body components, face and surface details. Increasing human-likeness boosted perceptions of both dimensions, but the trajectories differed: experience followed a cubic function, plateauing at medium levels of human-likeness, while agency followed a quartic function with a dip around 75% human-likeness—a pattern resembling the un-canny valley. Our results indicate that in order to create specific levels of agency (e.g., for surgery robots) and experience (e.g., for companion robots), a general increase of human-likeness might not suffice; instead, targeted design of individual physical features is crucial for convey-ing specific mental capacities. Our ratings linking physical robot features to dimensions of mind perception are made available, offering a comprehensive and accessible resource for researchers to experimentally manipulate perceptions of agency and experience.",

          "abstract": "More than half of the children and adolescents worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity (e.g., abuse, neglect or bullying) whilst growing up. Childhood adversity is among the strongest predictors of mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood. Yet, some individuals show resilient functioning, meaning they have good mental health and well-being despite their exposure to childhood adversity. Childhood adversity is thought to affect mental health through its impact on neurocognitive functioning, for example through blunted social feedback learning and biased emotion and threat processing. The neurocognitive social transactional model suggests that such childhood adversity related neurocognitive functioning may ultimately lead to reductions in the quality and quantity of social relations and increases in stressful experiences with peers over time, increasing the risk for mental health problems. However, empirical evidence to support this theoretical framework is scarce. Therefore, the longitudinal Towards Health and Resilience in Volatile Environments (THRIVE) study is set out to investigate the dynamics of psychological, social, and neurobiological mechanisms underlying mental health functioning in adolescents aged 18-24 years with a history of childhood adversity.\n\nThe ongoing THRIVE study aims to recruit 288 participants aged 18-24 years who retrospectively self-report childhood adversity (current N=220). This longitudinal neuroimaging study consists of 6 sessions including an in-unit session, during which participants undergo extensive testing including salivary cortisol measures, emotion labelling measures, as well as functional neuroimaging (whilst completing the Montreal Imaging Stress Task and the Social Feedback Learning Task). In the longitudinal part of the study, participants fill out online questionnaires at 5 time points (i.e. every three months) to map the dynamics and associations of social support, mental health, and stressful events, over time. Using the data collected at the in-unit session, we aim to test whether childhood adversity is associated with biased emotion processing, blunted feedback learning and enhanced stress responses, while social support may moderate these effects (i.e. ‘social stress buffering’). The longitudinal component of the THRIVE study allows us to test our hypothesis that mental health problems arise because childhood adversity shapes neurocognitive functioning in a way that, over time, reduces social support and increases social stress. By unravelling how social functioning contributes to resilient functioning after childhood adversity, the THRIVE study will aid crucial knowledge and ultimately help intervention and prevention efforts.\n\nThe THRIVE study has been approved by The Medical Ethics Committee Leiden - The Hague - Delft (NL80017.058.21) on July 5th, 2022  and has been co-created with the Augeo Youth Task Force (a panel of young adults with childhood adversity, https://www.augeo.nl/jongerentaskforce). The Augeo Youth Task Force is involved in every step of the empirical cycle to make sure the perspective and knowledge of young people with childhood adversity are incorporated. The results of the THRIVE study will be disseminated through preprints, peer-reviewed scientific publications, scientific presentations, media and public outreach.",

Participants from Japan (n = 531, Mage = 20.6 ± 1.5 years) and the United States (n = 487, Mage = 20.8 ± 2.2 years) completed an online questionnaire survey. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis supported the partial metric and full scalar invariance of the HSP scale across the samples, suggesting that the measurement of sensitivity is largely consistent across countries. Sensitivity was negatively correlated with Conscientiousness only in the Japanese sample, while higher sensitivity was associated with lower Extraversion and higher Neuroticism in both samples. Similar trends were observed in both samples for the correlations between sensitivity and Negative/Positive Affect. These findings illuminate both cultural and ethnic differences, as well as similarities, in sensitivity. Such differences were discussed in light of the individualism–collectivism framework.",

However, insight into how to adequately measure engagement in these activities is a necessary precursor. \nA rapid scoping review was performed to search relevant articles on PubMed. The aim was to obtain an initial understanding of (a) how cognitive and social activities are measured in research that investigates protective activities against dementia and (b) to explore to what extent this aligns with the operationalization in preventive interventions. \nThe findings show that across 58 studies, questionnaires were mostly used to measure engagement in cognitive and social activities. A wide variety of items and themes was observed across studies, including: arts and crafts; clubs, groups, and communities; exercising; games and puzzles; going out; household tasks; learning and education; making music; multimedia usage; reading; socializing; work/volunteering; writing. There were considerable variations in the number and content of items, ulitized response scales, recall periods, and methods to compose scores. Additionally, preventive interventions stongly focused on psychoeducation and (computerized) cognitive training, which limitedly reflect the activities operationalized in questionnaires.\nMany researchers investigate the protective effects of cognitive or social activities against dementia but measure and promote these concepts completely differently. This results in fragmented insights into what activities are protective. Clarifying precisely what these concepts entail, and which aspects are relevant to measure would support the development of measurement instructions as well as interventions to promote relevant activities.\n\nKeywords: Dementia, Cognition, Social Participation, Cognitive Activities, Social Activities",

          "authors": "Basil Wahn; Khadija Bawari; Eva Wiese",
          "abstract": "Offloading tasks to artificial agents, such as ChatGPT, has become commonplace, yet little research examined offloading of attentionally demanding tasks. Prior work investigating how humans offload attentional demands to algorithms and humans found that people prefer an equal split of attentional demands when interacting with other humans but not when interacting with algorithms. The question arises how offloading decisions are made when interacting with embodied AI in form of a social robot with human-like characteristics: Would they treat it in the same way as a human or like an algorithm? To investigate this question, participants performed an attentionally demanding task (i.e., the multiple object tracking task, MOT), which they could (partially or fully) offload to the social robot MAKI, whose task accuracy was either known (Experiment 1) or unknown (Experiment 2) to the participants. In both experiments, participants offloaded a significant number of the tracking load to the robot, which improved the participants’ own tracking accuracy; knowing the robot’s task accuracy, on the other hand, did not impact offloading behavior or performance gains. Interestingly, participants did not split attentional demands equally with the robot –like they do with human interaction partners– aligning with results from previous studies when humans offloaded attentional demands to algorithms. Questionnaire data indicates that this might be due participants perceiving the robot as rather machine-like. In conclusion, our results indicate that when it comes to cognitive offloading behavior, a social robot is treated similarly to an algorithm rather than a human interaction partner.",

          "authors": "C Chinchu",
          "abstract": "India faces a profound mental health crisis, marked by the largest population in the world, a high prevalence of disorders and a severe shortage of qualified professionals. Recent policy initiatives, including the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Act 2021, aim to reform psychology education to address these challenges. This article critically examines the evolving landscape of psychology higher education in India, focusing on the curricula proposed by the NCAHP and the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). While the NCAHP’s B. Psy model curriculum represents a commendable step towards competency-based education, it faces implementation hurdles related to restrictive entry requirements, regulatory ambiguities, and infrastructural demands. Concurrently, the RCI’s introduction of a B.Sc. Clinical Psychology (Hons.) program, with its nomenclature and scope of practice, creates further discord and potential jurisdictional overlaps with the NCAHP and the University Grants Commission (UGC). This article analyses these competing frameworks, their alignment with existing legislation and international standards, and their implications for the standardisation and regulation of psychology professionals. It proposes recommendations for fostering synergy among regulatory bodies, clarifying professional roles, and enhancing the accessibility and quality of psychology education to build a robust mental health workforce. Strengthening psychology education and professional regulation is a national imperative and central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 on good health and well-being.",

          "authors": "Jhilik Das; Sonali Nag; Usha MN; SP Arun",
          "abstract": "Since learning to read involves associating letter shapes with how they sound, it is widely believed that children become familiar with letter shapes when they start learning their sounds or start writing them down. However, since printed letters are often available in the environment, it is possible that children are already familiar with letter shapes. Here, we provide evidence for this intriguing possibility. We tested 300 children at the beginning of formal reading instruction of the Indian language Kannada. Each child performed four tasks: (1) a letter familiarity task in which they saw upright and inverted versions of each letter, and had to identify the more familiar orientation; (2) a letter recognition task where they had to name letters shown sequentially; (3) a visual search task where they had to find an oddball letter among identical other letters, with letters either all upright or inverted; and (4) a rapid automatized naming task where they had to name digits. Our main finding is that, despite showing wide variation in letter naming, children were highly familiar with letter orientation. This effect was present even on letters that children did not recognize at all. This familiarity with letter orientation also gave them a letter processing advantage: children searched faster when letters were upright than when they were inverted. Our findings reveal a far deeper knowledge of print among early readers than previously observed, and provide empirical support for early exposure to print as a strategy to jump-start reading acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Background. Smartphones/social media have been hailed as offering educational benefits, but\ngrowing concerns highlight negative effects on learning and wellbeing. Some countries enforce\nschool phone bans, while others (e.g., England), have guidance promoting “phone-free\nenvironments” but no legal mandate. There is limited evidence on the benefits of such policies,\nincluding whether they promote safeguarding.\n\nMethods. We used Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to investigate the relationship\nbetween smartphone policies and digital safeguarding incidents in 114 schools in England\n(&gt;90,000 pupils). We examined the prevalence and content of phone policies during the\n2023/24 academic year and digital incident reporting.\n\nResults. Only 53% (60/114) of schools had a phone policy. Policy content varied significantly,\nwith inconsistent use of “ban” terminology. Digital safeguarding incidents made up only 4.9%\n(4183/85,540) of all incidents but varied substantially (&gt;10% in 36/114 schools; &gt;25% in 9),\nsuggesting inconsistent reporting. Schools with policies, regardless of restrictiveness, reported\nmore digital incidents. Schools with restrictive policies were more likely to refer incidents and\nreported more school-based incidents, although most still occurred outside school.\n\nConclusions. Safeguarding incidents involving smartphones or social media are occurring in\nschools throughout England. Schools with phone policies were more likely to report digital\nsafeguarding incidents, suggesting an association between policy presence and reporting. Vast\nvariation in policy content and inconsistent “ban” rhetoric undermine the potential for effective\nsafeguarding. These findings underscore the need for standardised definitions of digital risks,\nand consistent policy approaches.",

          "abstract": "Developmental amnesia (DA) is a rare memory disorder caused by early bilateral hippocampal damage, typically resulting from a hypoxic–ischaemic event in the perinatal period. Children with DA develop age-appropriate semantic knowledge, language, and general cognitive abilities, yet profound impairments in episodic memory, spatial navigation, and recall emerge in development. These deficits have significant consequences for education, frequently leading to academic underachievement despite strong intellectual potential. In this paper, we outline the distinctive challenges DA presents in education and highlight three effective strategies: spaced learning, repeated testing in multiple-choice formats, and errorless learning, which draw on preserved recognition memory. We also discuss approaches that have not proved effective, including fast-mapping, chunking, and memory training. We conclude by reflecting on how findings from neuropsychology can shape inclusive and effective educational practices, both for children with DA and for those with memory difficulties more generally.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how teachers' attitudes towards inclusive education and support from school management and community are related to their self-efficacy in the context of inclusive music education. Participants (n = 185) were teachers from Finnish comprehensive schools (Grades 1–9). They answered three questionnaires: the Teacher Efficacy for Inclusive Practice scale, the Attitudes towards Inclusion scale, and the School Climate for Inclusive Music Education scale. Using linear regression analysis, we found that the more positive the feelings towards inclusive music classes were, the stronger the teacher's self-efficacy was in inclusive instructions, collaboration, and managing behaviour. Moreover, the more substantial the experienced support from the school community was, the stronger the teachers’ self-efficacy was in collaboration. However, beliefs on inclusive education and perceived support from school management did not show significant effects on teacher self-efficacy in inclusive music education. These findings highlight the importance of music teachers gaining positive experience in inclusive education. This implies the crucial need for sufficient training for inclusive settings and ensuring that the environment and starting points are adequate for teaching and learning music in the classroom. Results also show the impact of the school community on success when implementing inclusive music education.",

          "abstract": "Episodic autobiographical memory retrieval (EAM) is characterized by the vivid sense of re-experiencing past events. While doing so, different viewpoints over the scene can be taken, often referred to as the field or observer perspectives. However, the precision with which individuals can accurately reconstruct their original viewpoint over an event, within the field perspective, has not yet been characterized. Here we developed a task and continuous implicit measure to quantify this ability (viewpoint retrieval accuracy, VRA) and study its association with explicit measures of re-experienced vividness. Twenty-five participants experienced lifelike events in mixed reality, with five controlled observer–object angles at encoding. After a 24 h delay, they retrieved each event, rated re-experiencing vividness, and indicated their original viewpoint (VRA). Mean VRA decreased with increasing encoding eccentricity (observer–object angles) and was consistently biased toward more central viewpoints. Moreover, VRA significantly explained re-experiencing vividness, with higher re-experiencing ratings being associated with smaller errors. These findings establish VRA as an implicit and continuous proxy for re-experiencing vividness, and a new tool for investigating the spatial and bodily foundations of EAM retrieval.",

          "abstract": "Individuals reliably differ in how they look at complex visual scenes, with the most prominent variation in their propensity to fixate faces and text. In 60 adults, we tested the hypothesis that these differences in gaze are tuned to representational properties of the individual visual system. Eye-tracking captured each observer’s characteristic gaze tendencies during naturalistic scene viewing, and functional magnetic resonance imaging recorded category-selective responses to faces, words, and other stimuli when participants were instructed to fixate centrally. We find that the propensity to fixate faces or text goes along with enhanced distinctiveness of corresponding categorical representations in the ventral stream, which in turn predicts performance on reading and face recognition tasks. Thus, active vision appears tuned to the precision of category-selective encoding in the individual brain.",

          "abstract": "“Urami” is the negative emotional state that one experiences when treated unfairly by others. While similar to anger, it differs in various ways, such as in its long-term persistence. Empirical studies on urami have suggested that it comprises factors such as feelings of injustice, unforgiveness, and helplessness. However, the generalizability of its factor structure is questionable because most previous studies were based on small sample sizes. In this study, free descriptive responses regarding urami and anger provided by 489 participants (aged 19–72 years) were quantified and analyzed using structural topic modeling, a type of natural language processing algorithm. The results revealed the topics that compose the conceptual structure and the situations in which urami occurs, as well as the relationships between some grouped situations and individual traits, such as narcissism. Furthermore, comparing the conceptual structure and situational occurrences of urami and anger based on quantitative criteria revealed unique elements of urami, such as persistence and feelings of victimization. These elements are particularly likely to occur when one is victimized by a close other.",

          "authors": "Piper Louise Rennerfeldt; Roberto A. Abreu-Mendoza; Miriam Rosenberg-Lee",
          "abstract": "When learning about decimals, whole number knowledge can be a detriment, leading children to incorrectly report, for example, that 0.26 is larger than 0.8. Two potential sources of whole number interference could lead to such errors. Digit length interference arises from the whole number rule that more digits = larger number, while whole referent magnitude interference arises from ignoring the decimal point and comparing the whole referents (26 &gt; 8). The independent effects of each interference type have been measured in adults, but we still do not know how these effects play out in early decimal learning. Further, inhibitory control has been linked to overcoming whole number interference, but it is unclear which specific type of interference is inhibited. Here, we used carefully designed decimal stimuli to examine these two interference effects in middle school students who are more susceptible to whole number interference than adults. Students in 2 U.S. school districts (grades 6-8, n = 178) completed computerized decimal comparison and inhibitory control tasks. We implemented cluster analysis to account for heterogeneous strategy use. The two most prominent groups, Whole Number Biased and High Performing, differed in their extent of digit length interference, but were equally susceptible to whole referent magnitude interference. Crucially, inhibitory control only related to overcoming digit length interference, not whole referent magnitude interference, in both groups. Taken together, whole referent magnitudes are a pervasive source of interference in decimal comparison, independent of overall task performance or individual differences in inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the infrastructuring of the European Union’s Entry/Exit System (EES) at the juxtaposed border controls of the United Kingdom and France. Drawing on expert interviews, industry conferences, and fieldwork conducted at the ports of Dover, Calais, and the Eurotunnel terminals, it traces the detours EES has taken on its journey from imaginary to implementation in response to material, political, and technical challenges. Requirements for the system such as capturing fingerprints to fulfil eu-LISA's interoperability objectives and enrolling biometrics within ‘line of sight’ of a European border guard have created thorny problems at the Channel ports where travellers arrive to the border in vehicles rather than on foot. Solving these problems has necessitated hard infrastructures and political compromises which have provided opportunities for other actors to influence the sociodigital future of EES through infrastructuring their preferred solutions. The fact that what EES is and will be has changed substantially before it has even entered into operation, shows the moment of suspension, between when work on a system starts and before it is complete, to be a decisive one for materially intervening in sociodigitial futures in the making.",

          "authors": "Samuel Coavoux; Abel Aussant",
          "abstract": "Do digital technologies affect diversity in cultural tastes? Digital sociologists have warned of “filter bubbles,” attributed to shifts in the way culture is accessed online, and of persisting digital inequalities, while sociologists of culture have shown that diversity in consumption is valued as a marker of upper-middle-class status. Few empirical studies have connected these findings. We estimate the effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption using survey data from France. We apply template matching to adjust for six sets of confounders. We find a significant, positive effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption, measured by the number of cultural genres declared to be consumed, across three domains (music, movies, and TV shows) as well as on cosmopolitanism, measured by the propensity to watch movies and TV shows in a foreign language. The magnitude of this effect is relatively low for music(0.1 sd, 0.2 genres), intermediate for movies (0.2 sd, 0.6 genres), but high for TV shows (0.46 sd, 1.2 genres). The study brings new evidence against the filter bubble thesis; it shows that platforms do reinforce cultural inequalities by increasing the gap in consumption diversity between the working classes and the elite. It further suggests that the effect of technology on cultural consumption might be mainly mediated through its impact on cultural markets rather than changes in cultural experience.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons, including a need to save time and a desire to reduce biases in outcomes, some funders of research have started to use partial randomisation in their funding decision processes. The effect that randomisation interventions have on the reliability of those processes should, it is argued, be a consideration in their use, but this key aspect of their implementation remains under-appreciated. Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations. The simple yet apparently effective specification of the simulation of reviewer scores implemented here may also provide insights into the distribution of merit across research funding proposals, and of assessment of them.",

From the first sharpened stick to contemporary algorithms, functional artifacts accumulate meaning until the symbol eclipses the tool. Digital platforms accelerate this dynamic, manufacturing personalized illusions at planetary scale. Combining historical genealogy with three case studies: gamification, cryptocurrency, and the metaverse, I map a tri-phasic transformation: (1) pre-modern myths and rituals coordinated collective action; (2) modern promises of progress and control legitimated industrial rationalization; (3) digital engagement engines harvest behavioral data while posing as free, authentic connection. Drawing on Baudrillard, Debord, and Zuboff, I reveal the political economy that converts attention into profit yet sustains the appearance of choice. Contradictions remain: outages, opt-out movements, and open-source platforms expose cracks in the spectacle. I argue that symbolic beings cannot escape illusion; they can only inhabit it wisely. Four practices: illusion literacy, strategic inhabitation, temporal sovereignty, and creative misuse, outline how phronesis might redistribute agency within the fictions that make cooperation possible.",

          "authors": "ANGELICA JEANICE MARTINS ANDERSEN",
          "abstract": "This article develops a semantic-pragmatic analysis methodology for identifying linguistic manipulation strategies in media texts. Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.",

          "abstract": "Metropolitan areas in the United States are undergoing rapid diversification, significantly reshaping the demographics of local leadership. This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

          "authors": "martina mchenga",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: Corporal punishment by teachers remains one of the most pervasive forms of school-based violence in sub-Saharan Africa, undermining adolescent wellbeing and educational attainment despite statutory prohibitions. While most research has focused on prevalence, teacher behaviours, or household risk factors, little is known about how adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative environments shape their vulnerability to teacher violence.\n\nMethods: This study analysed nationally representative Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) from five countries: Eswatini (2021), Mozambique (2019), Kenya (2019), Namibia (2019), and Lesotho (2018), focusing on 10,904 school-going adolescents aged 13-17 years. Logistic regression models estimated associations between individual endorsement of corporal punishment, peer-level attitudes (measured using leave-one-out peer endorsement), and reported experience of teacher violence. Results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\n\nFindings: show that 13.6% of adolescents reported teacher corporal punishment in the past year. More than half (52.8%) endorsed corporal punishment, with peer endorsement averaging 53%. Adolescents who endorsed corporal punishment had twice the odds of experiencing teacher violence (aOR=2.1, 95% CI:1.6-2.7). Each 10-percentage-point increase in peer endorsement was associated with a 10% increase in odds (aOR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Gender moderated these associations: while boys were generally more exposed, girls who endorsed corporal punishment in pro-corporal peer contexts faced sharply elevated risks. Associations varied across countries, with the strongest effects in Kenya.\n\nConclusion: The findings highlight adolescents and peers as overlooked but critical drivers of school violence. Prevention strategies must therefore extend beyond legal bans and teacher training to also shift adolescent attitudes, peer climates, and home–school linkages. Evidence from interventions such as the Good School Toolkit (Uganda), Green Dot bystander program (U.S.), and SASA! (Uganda) demonstrates that norms change is possible. Adapting such models to address corporal punishment could provide a sustainable pathway to safer schools across Africa.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the challenges and strategies of agricultural e-commerce platforms in enhancing digital visibility, with a focus on the case of Nông Sản Bán Buôn in Vietnam. Using a case study approach, the research highlights how early adoption of search engine optimization (SEO) enabled rapid growth, but also how structural vulnerabilities, shifting digital algorithms, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted platform stability. The findings show that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture face unique barriers to sustaining online presence, including limited resources, technological dependence, and competitive asymmetries compared to larger players. By situating these experiences within broader academic debates on digital marketing, platform economies, and rural development, the study contributes to understanding the systemic inequalities embedded in digital commerce. The paper concludes with practical recommendations for SMEs to diversify marketing strategies, balance SEO with multi-channel engagement, and strengthen resilience in rapidly changing digital environments.",

Unlike most research on digital trade which focuses on large platforms or macroeconomic policy, this study examines the practical barriers facing small, mission-driven ventures operating under resource constraints. Drawing on firsthand experience and qualitative documentation from 2017 to 2024, the paper identifies six core challenges: digital visibility, buyer trust, regulatory compliance, logistics infrastructure, access to capital, and pandemic-induced market shocks. The findings illustrate that technical innovation alone is insufficient for sustainability in emerging market contexts. Long-term success in agri-tech requires trust-building, inclusive infrastructure, and ecosystem-level coordination. This study contributes grounded insights to the literature on agricultural digital transformation and highlights policy directions to support small platforms in the Global South.",

          "abstract": "Aims: Hazardous alcohol consumption represents a substantial threat to public health, particularly for older adults (aged 55 and above), who are more vulnerable to alcohol-related harm. Healthcare professionals play a key role in addressing alcohol consumption, yet little is known about older adults’ attitudes towards these conversations. This study aimed to: 1) examine older adults’ attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations with GPs, practice nurses, district nurses and volunteers; and 2) explore associations between these attitudes and older adults’ socio-demographic characteristics and alcohol consumption.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional survey (N = 424) was conducted to collect data on socio-demographics, alcohol consumption and attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between personal characteristics and attitudes. \n\nResults: Support for routinely asking about alcohol consumption was highest for GPs (60.4%), followed by practice nurses (55.0%), district nurses (46.7%) and volunteers (17.5%). Older adults aged 75 and older were more likely to view alcohol use as a personal matter and were less likely to initiate conversations with GPs (OR 0.66, CI 0.43–1.00) or district nurses (OR 0.60, CI 0.38–0.94), compared to those younger than 75. High-risk drinkers were more likely to have negative attitudes towards district nurses routinely addressing alcohol consumption (OR 0.54, CI 0.29–0.99). \n\nConclusions: Attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations differ across healthcare professionals, with GPs viewed most favourably and volunteers least. These findings highlight the need for healthcare systems to avoid treating healthcare professionals as interchangeable when addressing alcohol consumption.",

          "authors": "Mateo Hoyos",
          "abstract": "This paper provides novel empirical evidence that the medium-term relationship between trade liberalization and growth varies substantially with countries’ economic structure. Using a multi-method strategy, I examine per capita income dynamics after tariff reductions in a panel of 161 countries from 1960 to 2019. Baseline local projections reveal a sharp divergence: GDP per capita rises in manufacturer countries following tariff reductions, and notably falls in nonmanufacturers. A local projections difference-in-differences framework strengthens the analysis by accounting for treatment effect heterogeneity and variation in treatment timing. Finally, I study tariff reductions during the WTO-era reform period (1986 to 1994), a policy episode that historical evidence supports as plausibly exogenous, providing complementary evidence that confirms the observed heterogeneity. An exploration of mechanisms using local projections links these patterns to shifts in productivity, capital stocks, and manufacturing shares in GDP, consistent with theoretical expectations. The findings suggest that rising protectionism in manufacturer countries may be harmful, while further liberalization in nonmanufacturers could have unintended consequences.",

          "abstract": "Peer review has long been regarded as a cornerstone of scholarly communication, ensuring high quality and credibility of published research. Although academic journals trace their origins back three centuries, the procedures for evaluating submissions, particularly peer review, have undergone continuous evolvement. Peer review’s formal institutionalization in the mid-20th century represents a significant, yet natural, phase in this ongoing transformation of scholarly communication. By the early 21st century, there emerged an opinion that the conventional model of peer review faces systematic challenges, including inefficiency, bias, and institutional inertia. The study aims to synthesize the evolution, practices, and outcomes of both conventional and innovative peer review models in scholarly publishing. Through a mixed-methods approach combining interpretative literature review and process modeling (Business Process Model and Notation –BPMN), it identifies four frameworks: pre-publication peer review, registered reports, modular publishing, and the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. While the PRC model, which integrates preprints with post-publication review, demonstrates advantages in transparency and accessibility, no single approach emerges as universally ideal. The choice of model depends on disciplinary context, resource availability, and institutional priorities. The analysis underscores the need for adaptable platforms that enable hybrid workflows, balancing rigor with inclusivity. Future research must address empirical gaps in evaluating these innovations, particularly their long-term impact on equity and epistemic norms.",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood overweight and obesity remain global public health concerns, yet caregiver engagement with prevention and support services is often limited. Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake.\n\nMethods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours.\n\nResults: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits.\n\nConclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.",

Most segregation metrics, however, rely on aggregate data with arbitrary spatial boundaries. The sensitivity of segregation measures to those boundaries is well theorized but rarely measured. Leveraging modern redistricting software, we simulate millions of alternative Census tract maps that satisfy Census guidelines, compute segregation for each, and recover the full probabilistic distribution of common indices. These simulations yield new estimates of racial segregation across U.S. cities and, crucially, measure the aggregation‑induced variability hidden in conventional estimates. Encouragingly, values calculated with official tract definitions closely track the mean of the simulated distribution, exhibiting only a slight upward bias, and segregation metrics shift modestly across maps—though variability grows in smaller cities. While our findings confirm the practical robustness of Census tracts, our data and software provide a general framework for diagnosing and correcting spatial‑aggregation error in other contexts.",

This paper contributes to the research on the politics of expertise by presenting the results of an innovative multi-level mini-public approach, in which citizens from five European countries – France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland – were asked to discuss and deliberate on questions relating to the place and role of experts in policymaking, scientific information, and communication. The results of these discus- sions not only yield more fine-grained and nuanced evidence on citizens’ attitudes on these topics than currently available via survey research but also allow for the formulation of actionable advice that will be of interest to policymakers at the national as well as EU level.",

While larger platforms such as YouTube and Meta have moderators in many languages, we find that millions of EU-based users on smaller platforms, including Twitter/X, post in languages without any human oversight. Even when languages have at least one moderator, moderator allocation varies widely and disproportionately to content volume, with Twitter/X mainly prioritizing English while YouTube invests proportionally more in other European languages. Across platforms, languages primarily spoken in the ‘Global South’—such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic—consistently receive proportionally fewer moderators than English, ranging from an average of 55% of English’s allocation on YouTube to only 7.5% on Twitter/X. These findings highlight the need for more meaningful and globally inclusive transparency in platform moderation, to ensure that social media users everywhere receive equitable protection from online harms.",

Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. \nIn this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse.\nCluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests.\nFunded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.",

Political science has long studied the politics of carbon dioxide mitigation, but we know less about the political logic of climate impacts. As adaptation lies at the intersection of environmental, social, and disaster policy, its electoral effects are puzzling from a theoretical perspective. We address this gap by studying a program to improve the ability of households to withstand episodes of water scarcity in Mexico City, implemented between presidential cycles. In contrast to conventional forms of social policy, this intervention prioritizes building future resilience instead of immediate material benefits. We take advantage of the means-tested nature of the program to reduce imbalances between treated and control neighbors and estimate a difference-in-differences to evaluate its impact on electoral outcomes. We find that neighborhoods receiving this adaptation policy had, on average, higher levels of support for the party in charge of its implementation at the presidential and gubernatorial levels, compared to similar neighborhoods that did not receive the program. We also posit that reductions in reliance on inadequate water sources are a mechanism that explains this result. Our findings suggest that climate adaptation may be less contentious than mitigation, therefore giving politicians strong incentives to implement them. Moreover, we contribute to the climate politics literature by providing a theoretical framework to understand the political logic of adaptation action, regardless of its specific form or domain.",

This scoping review addresses this gap by systematically mapping published empirical research on elite philanthropy to answer a core question: what is actually known, where is evidence strong or weak, and how can future research be better directed? \n\nDrawing on 182 empirical studies identified through comprehensive database searches and citation analysis, this review shows that existing research is geographically skewed towards the United States and the United Kingdom. The findings reveal patterns in research themes, theoretical perspectives, and methodological choices - alongside major gaps, including limited studies in non-Western contexts, consequently failing to explore differing cultural and religious dimensions, and highlights the sparsity of empirical support for widely held critical assumptions. \n\nBy describing what the empirical literature does and does not show, this paper argues for a more globally inclusive, theoretically diverse, and methodologically rigorous research agenda. The review provides scholars and practitioners with an evidence-based foundation to challenge untested claims, develop new theory, and inform more effective philanthropic practice in an era of growing economic inequality and global wealth concentration.\n\nThe paper calls for more research into topics such as the philanthropy of younger entrepreneurs, gender dynamics, the influence of effective altruism, and recent global phenomena - including the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and technological innovation.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the historical and spatial conditions that necessitated Black ecclesial autonomy in the United States, beginning with Absalom Jones’s appointment as the first Black pastor of a mainstream Christian denomination and culminating in the rise of contemporary Black mega churches. Using the framework of land-use enforcement and religious zoning as outlined in The Evolution of Land-Use Enforcement Related to The Religious Storefront Church Movement (Williams-Peyton, 2019), the article traces how exclusionary zoning, denominational gatekeeping, and intra-racial class tensions shaped the road from Black mainstream denominations to the emergence of storefront churches and their architectural successors. Through historical analysis and visual typology—including Table 2’s storefront church models—this study argues that Black religious space has always been a site of resistance, creativity, and contested legitimacy.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the article applies Wilson’s Evolution of Information Behavior Modeling (1999) to interpret these spatial and theological adaptations as dynamic responses to information needs. Congregants’ pursuit of sanctified space is framed as information-seeking behavior shaped by environmental, psychological, and social variables. The creation of sovereign pews emerges not only as architectural ingenuity but as informational agency rooted in trauma, resilience, and theological innovation. By situating these ecclesial strategies within a broader information behavior framework, the article bridges urban ministry, LIS theory, and cultural preservation.",

Specifically, it advocates for a linguistically and theoretically grounded approach to illness narratives that engages with the distinctive cultural and social background of Japan.\n\nIt examines how, in countries like Japan—where traditional patriarchal ideologies remain deeply rooted, and where women's speech and eloquence are often culturally devalued and suppressed—the theoretical framework of illness narratives, which centers on the act of \"telling\" as a form of self-expression, patient agency, and meaning-making, may not fully align with the cultural realities of Japanese society. Drawing on published Japanese illness narratives, this study highlights the discrepancies between these narrative theories—largely developed in Anglophone contexts—and the sociocultural conditions in Japan, where women have historically been valued more for their silence and obedience than for their ability to express or articulate their experiences.\n\nAnalysing illness narratives through published works, both fiction and nonfiction, has become a common methodological approach in the medical humanities. However, this practice often presumes that the texts being analysed are written in English. Examined in this study is how established methods of illness narrative analysis may encounter limitations when applied to a Japanese literary text: Mitomerarenu Yamai (1992) by Keiko Yanagisawa. The book is based on the author’s experience of living with an undiagnosed illness and feeling abandoned by the medical system, both as a woman and as a person. The interpretive dissonance that arises when theories developed in Anglophone contexts are applied to narratives shaped by different cultural and linguistic backgrounds is explored. Also reflected in the study is the discomfort that may emerge when researchers translate and present such illness narrative texts as though they were originally written in English without explaining how they were translated.\nUltimately, greater attention to the linguistic, gendered, and cultural dimensions of illness narratives is called for. The argument in this paper is for the inclusion of non-Anglophone perspectives, which have been largely overlooked, in the broader discourse of illness narratives, narrative medicine and the medical humanities.",

          "abstract": "Residential segregation in the United States is widespread, persistent, and threatens economic opportunity and social cohesion. Most segregation metrics, however, rely on aggregate data with arbitrary spatial boundaries. The sensitivity of segregation measures to those boundaries is well theorized but rarely measured. Leveraging modern redistricting software, we simulate millions of alternative Census tract maps that satisfy Census guidelines, compute segregation for each, and recover the full probabilistic distribution of common indices. These simulations yield new estimates of racial segregation across U.S. cities and, crucially, measure the aggregation‑induced variability hidden in conventional estimates. Encouragingly, values calculated with official tract definitions closely track the mean of the simulated distribution, exhibiting only a slight upward bias, and segregation metrics shift modestly across maps—though variability grows in smaller cities. While our findings confirm the practical robustness of Census tracts, our data and software provide a general framework for diagnosing and correcting spatial‑aggregation error in other contexts.",

          "abstract": "Over the last ten years, the broad field examining information disorder has generated a plethora of research by leveraging the strengths of its interdisciplinary nature. However, interdisciplinary fields also experience challenges including competing and incompatible theoretical orientations. This study uses two dominant orientations in the field that take technological (i.e., Shannon-Weaver model) or social (i.e., pragmatics) approaches to deception as guiding theories to inform theoretical codes for a deductive qualitative analysis and pattern matching approach. The thematic codes are applied to a systematic interdisciplinary sample of information disorder studies articles from 2010-2021 identified by Broda and Strömbäck’s meta-synthesis. The findings indicate that a significant proportion of the sample is moving towards an integrated consideration of intentional and unintentional deception by including both technological and social components. Specifically, techno-centric approaches are moving towards including contexts of message providers or receivers in their models. These combined approaches that consider both context of individuals and technological components of message transmission do not adhere to either of the theoretical perspectives examined. Future research should formally integrate the competing assumptions in technological and social models of information disorder to better align with the literature. These methods contribute to the assessment and refinement of the dominant approaches to information disorder as well as identifying gaps for future research. Specifically, there are many ways the sample operationalizes each model component. There is not a “correct” way to measure each component but future research is needed to assess if each operationalization is measuring the same construct. Further, there are model components that are underrepresented in the sample (i.e., neurocognitive and eco-temporal context) and should be addressed by future research.",

Instead, indirect evidence, like coefficients in multiple regression models, is typically used to indicate the presence or (more typically) absence of partisan segregation. The few methods that do approximate a direct measure require dichotomizing partisanship of people and sources, which is problematic in the United States and unworkable in many other democracies. I suggest using a method originally designed to measure residential segregation to quantify the amount of balkanization in media use at the country, party, and individual levels. To show the potential of the measure, I use data from a nationally representative survey to describe the amount of partisan segregation in media consumption in the United States.",

Using Growing Up in Scotland, a nationally representative longitudinal child cohort study of children born in 2004-05, we investigate social inequalities in social work contact for children living with parental domestic violence and abuse (working sample n:3216). Using logit models, we examine associations between self-reported maternal experiences of domestic violence and abuse (when children were aged 0-6 years old), and social work service contact for study-children (across ages 2-7 years old), controlling for socio-demographic factors, illicit substance use, alcohol consumption, parental separation, and maternal mental health. Maternal reports of domestic violence and abuse significantly increased the likelihood of social worker contact for the study-child. Social worker involvement was far more likely in low-income households. Where domestic violence and abuse had been reported, social worker contact was twice as likely for boys than for girls. Findings suggest significant socio-economic disparities and gender discrepancies in the social work service response in the context of domestic violence and abuse. These patterns raise concerns about the potential for social work engagement being stratified by socio-economic status and under-identification of girls’ needs in domestic violence and abuse contexts.",

This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a dynamic equilibrium framework that reinterprets persistent macroeconomic issues—global imbalances, long-run deflation or entrenched inequality—not as market failures, but as structural outcomes. Departing from standard nominal‑adjustment models, it incorporates asset‑side mechanisms and reconsiders the transversality condition (TVC), deriving:R_t-ρ=n+D_a-U_(θa)θ/U_c; This balance means the divergence between asset returns (R_t) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the balance of capital diffusion (D_a), population growth (n) and preference terms (U_(θa)θ/U_c). As result, equilibrium arises from structural and institutional interplay beyond a price‑clearing mechanism. The framework redefines the TVC as a structural condition on asset dissipation and valuation, explaining steady states with persistent differences in asset levels, allocation, or income distribution. By reframing disequilibrium as endogenous optimization outcomes, it offers a basis for analyzing macroeconomic dynamics and designing pragmatic policy tools—for example, Structural Selection of the Steady State, Policy Control of Capital Flows, Asset Dynamics–Based Policy Reconstruction and so on—. In this way, economics may better reflect the realities of economic societies and confront structural challenges.",

For example, a person deciding which of two immigrants is more worthy of admission to a country might weigh the prospective immigrants' education, age, country of origin, and employment history. Conjoint experiments have rapidly generated new insight into these multidimensional choices. By independently randomizing the attributes of a pair of fictitious profiles, researchers summarize the average contribution that each attribute makes to an overall choice. But what if the effect of one attribute depends on the values of other attributes? We present a method that uses data-adaptive experimentation to search for heterogeneity in the effect of one focal attribute as a function of all other attributes. Our empirical application of this method shows that U.S. adults weigh the education of an immigrant much more heavily for certain immigrants than for others. By targeting the heterogeneous effects of a focal attribute, our approach complements conjoint designs that target the average effects of all attributes.",

To date no research has explored the mechanisms that directly influence children’s cognitive and social-emotional development. Using data from the UK-based Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), we examine the relationship between maternal work schedules and children’s social-emotional development from ages three to seven, focusing on three potential mediators: the stability of children’s daily routines, the types of their daily activities, and maternal depression. We find that maternal NSWS is associated with increased social-emotional difficulties in children, particularly when mothers work at night. Among the three mechanisms, maternal depression emerges as the most significant mediator, followed by regular bedtime routines. These findings suggest that while daily routines and activities are important for child development, a substantial portion of the impact of maternal NSWS is mediated through maternal psychological well-being. Effective interventions to support children’s social-emotional development should consider the mental health and well-being of mothers working nonstandard hours.",

A key goal behind this work is to inform the design of \ninclusive spaces that foster intergroup contact and social cohesion. However, much of this \nresearch has focused on statistical diversity (typically measured through census data, \nmobility traces, or indices that capture the distribution and co-presence of social groups) \nwhile giving less consideration to how diversity is perceived by those who use these spaces.\nThis study bridges that gap by combining GIS-based mobility modeling with on-street survey \ndata. Using aggregated mobility data from ~90,000 mobile phone users in Auckland, New \nZealand, we estimated ethnic mobility flows and computed spatial diversity indices for \nresidents and visitors across six neighborhoods. In parallel, we conducted 249 on-street \nsurveys in those neighborhoods to capture perceptions of diversity.\nOur findings reveal only a weak correlation between statistical and perceived diversity, \nhighlighting that individuals do not simply mirror demographic compositions in their \nperceptions. Instead, perceived diversity is more strongly predicted by self-reported \nintergroup contact (both within the specific neighborhood and across the city) and by \naffective factors such as space affinity and attitudes toward outgroup members. These \nresults underscore the importance of integrating both statistical and perceptual data to \nunderstand diversity in urban environments.

Our results map buyers and sellers of data in the Dutch context, as well as the types of data sold and in which policy domains.

We propose a conceptual framework of ‘reproductive equity support’, defined as the sum of statutory permitted and resourced reproductive options, which varies across four ideal types: conservative, paternalistic, libertarian and comprehensive. Second, we operationalize permissiveness and generosity for contraception, abortion and medically assisted reproduction using policy indicators from the novel International Reproduction Policy Database. We find strong variation between countries, and substantive shifts over time: while most countries make a leap towards more permissive reproduction policy, increase in generosity is less pronounced and less wide-spread.",

In the policy debate much hope is placed on the potential of pre-schools to remedy this, by providing a learning and language environment that can compensate for the disadvantages that these children face. \n\nWe study inequalities in pre-school learning contexts by immigrant origin, using full population register data that matches all children to their families and pre-schools. Enrolment in pre-school is lower for children of immigrants, but this is – surprisingly – almost entirely driven by low enrolment of children in non-refugee families. Contrary to expectations, children from origin groups with larger school difficulties have high pre-school enrolment rates. Our results suggest that explanations for low enrolment should primarily be sought in intentions to remain long-term in the host country.\n\nIn pre-schools, immigrant background children have a somewhat higher teacher density, but a somewhat lower density of qualified teachers, and a somewhat higher turnover rate and sickness absence among teachers. These differences are however small. Where we see large differences is in the composition of the child and teacher group: Immigrant-background children go to pre-schools where a much higher proportion of teachers and children have immigrant background. \n\nWe conclude that hopes to equalize school outcomes through encouraging pre-school enrolment are misplaced, and equalizing structural indicators is unlikely to make a big difference. The compensatory potential of pre-schools lies primarily in a de-segregation of staff and children across pre-schools.",

It also examines the social reasons and identity concerns that result in variation in code-mixing practices among male and female students. The attitudes of students towards code-mixing and the perception of others’ use of it have also been examined. The research reveals that code-mixing practices vary significantly between males and females due to gender differences in identity and students’ responses to social pressure and opportunity at university. Female students mix languages more frequently and in more sophisticated ways because they aspire to be socially accepted and project a modern identity. Male students, on the other hand, employ code-mixing in a more functional way, using it to exhibit academic expertise and professional standing. Overall, the research reveals that mixing English and Bangla is not the same for all people; it is a finely tuned strategy that exhibits gender differences in identity and students’ negotiation with social pressure and opportunity at university.",

          "abstract": "Farmers increasingly use videos and other digital tools to access and share farming information. However, women in agriculture have commonly been excluded from influencing and accessing these digital tools. Rigorous evaluations have found that including women farmers in the creation and screening of farming videos can benefit women through improved productivity and decision-making power. But what is needed for extension workers to make these videos accessible to women farmers outside of carefully managed pilots? We implemented a randomized controlled trial testing how the gender of farmers featured in wheat farming advisory videos influenced how much, and with whom, 294 extension workers shared these videos in rural Bihar. We interpreted results through twenty follow-up interviews and the ‘Mechanisms and Conditions’ framework based in affordance theory. We found the extent to which extension workers shared videos with women farmers hinged on extension workers' perceptions, material resources, and cultural contexts, rather than the gender of farmers featured in videos. From a theoretical perspective, this core finding suggests the 'Mechanisms and Conditions' framework requires modification to account for material resource access when explaining technology use. From a practical perspective, the core finding prompts practitioners to ask ‘how might extension systems circulating digital tools be more inclusive?’, not just ‘how might we adapt digital tools to be more inclusive?’. This systems-level approach to empowering women in agricultural innovation systems could involve supporting inclusive person-to-person extension networks, and avoiding dependence on smartphone-based extension systems, like YouTube and chatbots.",

          "authors": "Panos FITSILIS",
          "abstract": "Academic department rankings often overlook the rich evidence in students’ open-ended comments, relying instead on questionnaires, reputation, and research metrics. This paper introduces the PULSE Index (Perceived University Learning &amp; Student Experience), a 0 - 100 composite score that converts student comments into department-level indicators using a transparent AI/NLP pipeline. The method is student-centered by design. Stage 1 defines a set of student-valued categories (e.g., teaching, infrastructure, services) and elicits their weights via a multi-criteria procedure. Stage 2 collects and de-identifies comments, assigns each comment to categories with aspect-based classification, and estimates neutral-aware sentiment using modern embeddings. Topic models (LDA/BERTopic) provide an empirical check on the category map and surface emergent themes. For each module and category, we compute conditional mean sentiment, coverage and intensity; apply empirical-Bayes shrinkage to stabilize small samples; and, optionally, fold salience and strength into a representativeness factor. Stage 3 normalizes indicators within peer groups, forms module composites via the elicited weights, and aggregates modules to departments using reliability- and volume-aware weights, before scaling to the 0 - 100 PULSE Index. Robustness is assessed through sensitivity analysis (weights, normalization), bootstrap confidence intervals and rank-stability; fairness diagnostics examine subgroup patterns (e.g., level, modality, language). The framework yields explainable, auditable scores with traceable contributions by category and exemplary comments, supporting both accountability and improvement. By operationalizing student voice with methodological safeguards, the PULSE Index offers a rigorous alternative to traditional department rankings and a practical blueprint for institutions seeking evidence-based, student-centered quality assurance. An illustrative worked example demonstrates implementation details and reporting.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists have developed dozens of measures for assessing partisan bias in redistricting. But these measures are not easily adapted to other groups, including groups defined by race, class, or geography. Nor are they applicable to single- or no-party contexts, such as local redistricting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework of harm for evaluating the impacts of a districting plan on individual voters and the groups to which they belong. We consider a voter harmed if their chosen candidate is not elected under the current plan, but would be under a different plan. Harm improves on existing measures by both focusing on the choices of individual voters and directly incorporating counterfactual plans. We discuss strategies for estimating harm, and demonstrate the utility of our framework through analyses of partisan gerrymandering in New Jersey, voting rights litigation in Alabama, and racial dynamics of Boston City Council elections.",

We first highlight the diverse and evolving usage of the concept of militarism over time and across different knowledge forms. From there we move on to examine key tensions within IR accounts, suggesting that ‘historical,’ ‘scientific,’ and ‘political’ approaches stand to gain from a more rigorous engagement with each other. We conclude with an appeal for sustained attention to militarism as concept and its historical and political dimensions in particular.",

This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

This paper proposes that political interest can in part be explained by the meaning that people find in politics. Evidence from six experiments (n=5,767) shows that appealing to meaning can increase political interest. In these studies, treated participants provide information about what they find meaningful in their lives, with their responses leveraged in on-the-fly treatments that connect their responses to politics. These treatments lead people otherwise disinterested in politics and policy to become more interested in both. The effects of meaning on interest are sizable, equivalent to 43.1% of the pre-treatment divide in political interest between strong and non-strong partisans and 61.1% of the divide between those with and without college degrees. These results offer a new way of understanding---and increasing---political interest.",

          "abstract": "Rough sets, rough set-theoretic definitions and axiomatic frameworks have been, for some time now, a mainstream mathematical approach from fuzzy mathematics to model and encode (un)certainty in traditional information systems across different domains. With the pervasive rise and shift from traditional information systems to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based intelligent information systems, however, the issue of representing and encoding (un)certain knowledge of different domains and at different levels of abstraction within such systems has emerged as an unsolved pivotal research problem in AI. The paper is interdisciplinary in nature, being positioned at the intersection of mathematics and AI research, and, to that end, will have two objectives. First, it will focus on critically reviewing key state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research literature on how rough sets and rough set-theoretic frameworks are being employed for (un)certain knowledge representation, e.g., via ontologies and Knowledge Graphs, in AI-based information systems across different domains. Second, based on the aforementioned critical review, it will elucidate research implications and potential research strategies which will inform future research towards developing an integrated mathematical philosophy and mathematico-logical formalism for (un)certain knowledge representation in AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Many countries develop through the increase of their economic resources, which naturally exist in most countries. On the other hand, some evidence shows that countries can develop through fiscal decentralisation, which promotes this growth through regional growth via significantly viable economic transformation. In Africa, for example, federalist countries such as Nigeria and South Africa show greater capacity for regional transformation through indicators of great relevance in themselves. Evidence also shows, for example, greater economic transformation through fiscal federalism. South Africa, for example, has less significant decentralisation but greater capacity to collect tax revenues. The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties. Although there is de facto fiscal decentralisation, particularly in Nigeria and Ethiopia, there is nevertheless a greater lack of economic development in all territories, with the exception, for example, of states with greater economic concentration such as Lagos and Abuja.",

Two third-party data scrapers on Apify were used to obtain a large sample of TikToks (n=3,506) scraped using contraception-related search terms and hashtags. These videos were screened for eligibility, and we used a hybrid deductive and inductive thematic approach to analyze eligible videos (n=712). A youth advisory committee was formed to guide and interpret the research. Central themes include contrasts between user experiences of side effects and clinical evidence, anti-hormonal sentiment, empowerment, and trust/mistrust in healthcare. This research provides a case study for analyzing TikTok videos to understand emerging population chatter about reproductive health experiences that can be applied to other research topics.

          "abstract": "While micro-level research shows that employed individuals are less likely to experience poverty, macro-level trends reveal disappointing poverty reduction despite substantial employment growth across European countries – constituting an employment-poverty paradox. This study addresses this paradox by examining the heterogeneous effects of employment on poverty across different family types, while rigorously accounting for selection processes and confounding through leveraging panel data, varying assumption about causal structure, simulations, and formal sensitivity analysis. We apply a multi-group Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to examine how employment prevalences and premiums contribute to poverty differences across varying family-types. Our results suggest that differences in employment prevalences contribute minimally to poverty gaps, while premium effects drive most observable effects. Part-time employment shows even weaker poverty reduction effects across all family types. Sensitivity analysis reveals vulnerability to unmeasured confounding, suggesting true causal effects may be smaller still. In sum, employment is not a panacea for poverty reduction across family types.",

While existing literature has documented a purported increasing trend of these themes, investigations that consider the social conditions during song production remain scarce. By analyzing 26,438 rap singles released in the United States from 1990 to 2015, we find that the prevalence of these lyrical themes does not show a consistent upward trajectory. Instead, they exhibit significant temporal fluctuations, with each following a distinct pattern. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong contemporaneous correlation between these lyrical fluctuations and their corresponding national social indicators, including rates for crime, sexual assault, poverty, and DEA arrests. Crucially, this correlation becomes significantly stronger when using social statistics specific to Black Americans. These findings provide large-scale empirical evidence that art is a sensitive reflection of the social and economic realities of the time, offering insights into how deep-seated social problems are depicted through artistic expression.",

          "authors": "Selçuk Bedük; Anna Yong",
          "abstract": "While any experience of child poverty can affect life chances, longer exposure is particularly concerning due to its lasting effects on education, health and earnings. This study adopts a life-course perspective, tracking poverty from birth to age 10 for cohorts born in Britain between 1991 and 2017. On average, 17% of children spent at least half of their childhood in poverty. Long-term poverty affected 25% of those born in the early 1990s, markedly declined to 13-14% for cohorts born after the 1997 welfare reforms, and substantially increased again to 23% for children born following the 2013 austerity reforms. Decomposition analysis shows that cross-cohort changes are driven more by shifts in the penalties associated with work and family risk factors than by changes in their prevalence. These shifts in penalties reflect broader changes in redistribution and predistribution. The early decline in long-term poverty was largely due to rising employment and earnings in low-income households, while the post-austerity increase stems mainly from reduced redistribution. For cohorts born in the 2000s, social transfers played a substantial role in containing long-term poverty despite worsening predistribution. Overall, the findings show that long-term childhood poverty remains a significant challenge in Britain and highlight the need for both stronger redistribution and improved predistribution to address it.",

Informed by a dualistic understanding of scale as both fixed and socially constructed, the commentary firstly argues for comparing and contrasting the influence of different national research evaluation systems on geographical knowledge production. Secondly, the contribution conceives of research evaluation systems as a form of scalar politics which enables a view of the actors and networks contesting current evaluation systems and promoting alternatives.

The present study is a descriptive-analytical \ninvestigation of the selected speeches of political discourse given by the two most \ninfluential speakers of Animal Farm (Old Major and Squealer), a novel written by \nOrwell (1945). To investigate and uncover the ways in which ideology and power \nrelations are subtly reproduced in discourse, we have examined what makes Old Major \nand Squealer persuasive in the expression of their ideologies. The analysis is grounded \non the main tenets and principles of Critical Discourse Analysis. Unlike any other forms \nof linguistic analysis, the main purpose of CDA is explicitly socio-political, since it \nseeks to better represent the role of discourse in the reproduction of dominance and \npower struggle. Therefore, we have adopted Fairclough’s three-dimensional framework: \ndescription, interpretation and explanation. In addition, we have capitalized on \nAristotle’s approach of persuasion (ethos, pathos and logos) to be as a supporting \nanalytical tool of linguistic and rhetorical devices. Thus, the analytical part of this \nresearch work has analyzed the possible interrelatedness of textual properties and their \nconveyance of a particular ideology by giving it an eclectic treatment as far as the \napplication of framework is concerned. The findings of this investigation uncover the \nlinguistic and rhetorical techniques that contribute to the overall process of persuasion, \nwhich have different ideological attachments. The study concludes that the analysis of \nFairclough’s three dimensional framework and three modes of persuasion under the \nmain tenets of CDA has shown that politicians – even in a fictional political world – \ndepend significantly on linguistic manipulation to demonstrate ideologies, steer people’s \nthoughts, manufacture consent and rise to power.",

          "authors": "martina mchenga",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: Corporal punishment in schools remains pervasive across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite legal prohibitions. While research has examined prevalence and teacher attitudes, little is known about how adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative environments influence their vulnerability to teacher violence.\nMethods: The study analysed nationally representative Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) from five SSA countries (Eswatini 2021, Mozambique 2019, Kenya 2019, Namibia 2019, Lesotho 2018), focusing on school-going adolescents aged 13-17 years (N=10,904). Logistic regression models estimated associations between adolescents’ individual endorsement of corporal punishment, peer-level attitudes and self-reported experience of teacher corporal punishment in the past year. Models were adjusted for socio-demographic and household covariates. Country-specific estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\nResults: Overall, 13.6% of adolescents reported teacher physical punishment in the past year. More than half (52.8%) endorsed corporal punishment, and peer endorsement averaged 53%. In pooled models, adolescents who endorsed corporal punishment had twice the odds of reporting teacher violence (aOR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.7). Each 10-percentage-point increase in peer endorsement was associated with a 10% increase in odds (aOR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Girls and adolescents in secondary school were less likely to report teacher punishment, while those exposed to corporal punishment at home were over three times more likely to also report it at school (aOR=3.4, 95% CI: 2.5-4.7). Heterogeneity across countries was high, with strongest associations observed in Kenya.\nConclusions: Adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative climates significantly shape their risk of teacher violence. Prevention strategies must extend beyond legal bans and teacher training to also target adolescent attitudes, peer environments, and home-school linkages. Interventions combining school-wide norms change, peer engagement, and parenting support may offer the most sustainable pathway to eliminating corporal punishment in schools",

This study examines student perceptions at a private high school that implemented a zero-access phone ban during the 2024–2025 school year. Two anonymous surveys were fielded at policy launch (October 2024) and three months later (January 2025), yielding a combined N = 494. Primary outcomes were perceived changes in in-person interaction frequency and quality, perceived connectedness, perceived classroom focus, perceived productivity during school, and self-reported academic performance. Most respondents perceived social benefits, including more frequent face-to-face conversations, while a minority reported diminished connectedness. Nearly half perceived higher productivity during school, yet most perceived no change in academic performance. Over half reported increased phone use during homework, which may offset in-school gains. Findings underscore heterogeneity in responses and suggest that bans, without complementary supports, can improve opportunities for in-person interaction for many students but may disadvantage students who rely on digital scaffolds for social engagement.",

          "abstract": "This deliverable set out to analyse the context-specificity of financial support policies for families with children and (out-of-pocket fees for) childcare services, two policy areas that feature prominently in rEUsilience recommendations (Daly et al., 2025). Our first question was to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services at different income levels. Based on our newly introduced compensation ratio measure, we showed that the combination of child contingent benefits and out-of-pocket costs tends to be low-income targeted, in the sense that lower-income families pay lower fees for childcare and/or receive higher benefits. In Poland and Sweden, the out-of-pocket expenses for childcare tended to be lower (on average) across the income distribution than child-contingent benefits, whereas high-income families in Belgium and Spain paid more for childcare than they received as financial support. Secondly, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services for different family types. Here, we found that generally (with the exception of Spain) families with more children receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to families with fewer children. In all the four countries studied here, single-parent families receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to two-parent families. Finally, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services when families transition into work. Here, we found that, generally, the compensation ratio was higher for families on social assistance or employment at low wages, compared to families working at higher wages. This holds for single-parent families (with the exception of Poland) as well as two-parent families. Moreover, the extent to which the compensation rate was lowered with employment and at higher wage levels differed between countries, with the drop particularly notable in Belgium and moderate to absent in Poland. For average wage employees, the compensation ratio was lowest in Belgium compared to the other countries included here.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the potential impact of large language models (LLMs) on tourist flow using scenario-based projection models. We simulate one million US residents’ domestic travel decisions using two different LLMs, Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT 4.1 Nano. The LLM-based projections are compared to the null model and empirical-based simulations to assess characteristics of tourist flows generated by LLMs. LLMs generate tourist flows that are more seasonal, more concentrated in a few popular destinations, and less reciprocal than empirical-based simulations. Other patterns, like the mean resilience index and the mean travel distance, vary by LLM used. These findings show that the widespread adoption of LLMs can undermine the sustainability and resilience of tourism systems. As such, we urge tourism scholars and practitioners to proactively assess the consequences of adopting LLMs in tourism to ensure the sustainability and resilience of tourism systems.",

          "abstract": "U.S. higher education operates as a mechanism of economic control, organized around the dynamics of replacement, credential inflation, and indenture. This paper revisits and updates the 2000 “Indentured Replacement Theory of Credential Inflation” that first argued this case, adding a 2024 lens on endowment capture. A descriptive synthesis of public data series reveals the scale of this control: student-loan balances stand at roughly $1.64 trillion with 90+ day delinquency near 10.2% (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2025); meanwhile, institutional endowments total $873.7 billion\nwith $30 billion in annual spending (NACUBO/Commonfund, 2025). Evidence on “degree reset” is mixed, and post-pause repayment frictions elevate delinquency risk. Policy developments in 2023–2025 increase scrutiny of institutional finances while providing limited direct borrower relief. The paper concludes by proposing structural, cultural, and market-facing remedies, evaluated by a simple test: does a given policy loosen—or tighten—the binding effects of debt on life chances?",

We develop a language-based measure of curveball questions and apply it to a corpus of quarterly earnings calls. After validating this question-level measure, we next demonstrate that a call-level curveball measure predicts absolute returns, absolute abnormal returns, and changes in a firm’s average analyst rating. Finally, we identify the types of analysts who are most likely to pose curveball\nquestions, the types of firms that are most likely to receive them, and the conditions under which they tend to arise.",

To adjudicate between these two perspectives I \nintroduce the use of pseudo items into culture research, and integrate their usage with \nBourdieu’s observations about “competence” and the “right to speak.” I find evidence \nfor a dispositional openness account to claimed cultural knowledge, in addition to a \nknown gender effect that is likely also rooted in dispositions.

Despite established research on the positive effects of using therapeutic sensory environments, access is often limited or unreachable due to cost (the average room can cost over $30,000). This research aims to bridge the gap by designing a low-cost, scalable sensory room model suitable for public spaces. We included a qualitative interview process with key stakeholders, caregivers of people with NDD, Applied Behavior Analysts, and Title I special education teachers to gain their perspectives and experiences in order to identify barriers to access and determine the components of a sensory room for the proposed model. We created a cost-effective sensory room. Overall, the model has been implemented in multiple diverse environments (community center, public school, pediatric clinic, refugee aid center, etc.). This low-cost model offers the possibility of being adapted as a viable sensory room intervention to improve access to a therapeutic sensory space in areas with scarce resources.",

          "authors": "Juan Mendoza-Collazos",
          "abstract": "This chapter proposes a classification of artifacts based on an agentive approach—that is, on the actions performed by human agents rather than on the artifacts' functions or features. The agentive approach adheres to the thesis that cognition is not reduced to brain functions but is coextensive with the capacity to act. If there is action, then there is cognition, and therefore, meaning emerges from an agent's relationship with its environment (enaction). It is argued that the notion of Enhanced Agency—the incorporation of artifacts to enhance the performance of actions—is a distinctive feature of the human species, and that the ability to design artifacts is distinct from the creation of natural objects by other animals. Therefore, the definition of artifact is limited to an object created by human beings for a specific purpose. Consequently, after critically assessing other proposals, the classification of artifacts is addressed under three criteria: according to the type of incorporation; according to the type of engagement; and according to the type of action performed by the agents. This typology allows us to resolve ambivalent categories such as cognitive/pragmatic and to be consistent with the material and embodied commitment of cognition, which constitutes a contribution to the understanding of the essentially enhanced nature of human agency.",

Drawing on research that connects political trust to democratic legitimacy, highlights its attitudinal and behavioral consequences, and underscores its contextual character as a form of political support, we hypothesize that political trust exerts a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already reached some level of democracy. We test this hypothesis with cross-lagged models fit to political trust estimates from 62 countries over 30 years, combined with democratic quality scores from the Varieties of Democracy project. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a conditional effect: based on our results, political trust has a positive effect on democracy, but only in countries that have already achieved high quality of democracy.",

          "abstract": "Under the threat window of ‘interception first, decryption later’ in quantum computing, national security and industrial sovereignty face new systemic challenges. This paper proposes a dual-track approach of ‘PQC baseline + QKD enhancement’ to comprehensively compare the standard systems, governance models, and engineering progress of China and the United States in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD). The study employs a three-tier evidence integration framework of ‘policy-standards-engineering,’ combining authoritative documents from NIST, OMB, CISA, and other sources with China's national standard platform and industry announcements. It constructs an analysis model of ‘standard hierarchy-migration ecosystem-international interoperability’ and evaluates the feasibility of the scheme through gap-risk mapping, roadmap design, and KPI matrix assessment. The results show that the United States has established a closed-loop system of ‘primary standards + redundancy’ based on FIPS 203/204/205 and HQC backup algorithms, and has entered an auditable implementation phase driven by mandatory migration and toolchain initiatives from OMB and CISA; China maintains an advantage in QKD engineering and standardisation, but national standards for PQC have not yet been solidified, and the migration governance system lags behind, resulting in a structural shortfall of ‘engineering leading the way while algorithm standards lag behind.’ Based on this, this paper proposes a ‘three-year-five-year-ten-year’ national roadmap: establish a standardised baseline within three years, achieve large-scale migration and verification within five years, and complete consolidation and internationalisation within ten years. This will be supplemented by protocols, PKI/certificates, key lifecycle management, testing and certification, and algorithm switching mechanisms, in conjunction with a five-tier governance structure led by the State Cryptography Administration, with TC260/TC485 as the technical focal points, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology/ the Cyberspace Administration of China/People's Bank of China, operator and critical infrastructure implementation, and research institutes. The conclusion states that PQC must be established as the ‘basic defence line’ in the quantum era, while QKD should serve as the ‘enhanced defence line’ for critical links; China must complete the construction of PQC national standards and migration governance capabilities within a three-year standardisation, five-year consolidation, and ten-year internationalisation timeline, and achieve dual-track integration and international interoperability with the QKD standard suite, thereby safeguarding national security, consolidating industrial resilience, and enhancing international influence.",

          "abstract": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of a pilot transit credit program launched by Waymo in the San Francisco Bay Area, which offered riders a $3 incentive to use an AV rideshare service in conjunction with nearby public transit stations. Using a mixed-methods approach, including structured surveys and qualitative interviews, we explore how the incentive influenced travel behavior, mode substitution, and public transit connectivity. Results indicate that 69% of participants connected to transit, while 50% of these riders would have otherwise used privately paid rideshare and 6% would have used their private vehicle, and another 6% would have walked or cycled. The remaining 38% of participants would have used transit to reach the public transit station. The study offers critical insights for transit agencies and mobility providers aiming to design integrated AV-transit systems that serve the public good. While there is a risk of misallocating funds to individuals already willing and able to pay for rideshare services, these findings underscore that targeted subsidies can yield meaningful reductions in private vehicle use and promote multimodal travel.",

          "abstract": "Computational text analysis has grown in popularity among social scientists due to the massive influx of digitized data available to study. However, much of this research disconnects patterns observed in text from information about the original authors. Eliding authorship considerations from sociological analysis of text can potentially lead to claims and assertions of trends that are independent from the social actors, conditions, interactions, and contexts which the text was produced. While text analysis without authorship information can yield reasonable inferences about society, complementing that approach with research that explicitly considers the people producing the text could expand the theoretical and empirical scope of work in this area. In this paper, we adapt perspectives from sociolinguistics and explicitly consider categorical identity markers of authors and geography as foundational axes of variation in textual data. We explore these dimensions in a large corpus of college admissions essays (n = 254,820 essays submitted by 83,538 applicants) and metadata about applicant identity, including the ZIP code of their high school. After generating features of the essays using computational methods, we find that author identity markers, such as gender, parental education, and socioeconomic status are highly salient. We also find that ZIP code level socioeconomic measures are extremely correlated with the writing style and content of local applicants. We also find that individuals whose personal identities are spatially unique–that is, demographically different from others in their immediate content–were most likely to be misclassified by our models, indicating that writing is influenced both socially and spatially. This work clarifies how authorship characteristics, like identity and spatial context, constrain the breadth of what we write and how we write by showing strong alignment between text and authors that is observable through machine reading of text.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the archetypal figures of Sköll and Hati, the mythic wolves of Norse cosmology, as embodiments of cosmic shadow, destruction, and renewal within Jungian analytical psychology. Rooted in Viking-era Germanic myth and anchored in Danish cultural artifacts such as the Trundholm Sun Chariot and Nordic winter rituals, the study explores how these wolves symbolize the cyclical tension between psychic dissolution and rebirth. Drawing on primary Jungian concepts alongside contemporary psychoanalytic and mythopoetic scholarship, the analysis positions Sköll and Hati as necessary forces that disrupt egoic sovereignty and reveal the shadow aspect of time and consciousness. The wolves’ pursuit and devouring of the sun and moon reflect psychic upheavals commonly experienced during midlife crises, cultural collapse, and spiritual transformation. The archetypes discussed here do not represent pathology or nihilism but serve as initiatory figures that require surrender to chaos for psychological growth. The integration of Nordic cultural context deepens the understanding of these archetypes and provides a unique contribution to the field of archetypal psychology. This paper encourages clinicians and scholars to consider the paradox of destruction and renewal inherent in the archetypal shadow, thus advancing the discourse on collective and individual processes of transformation.",

While Johnson et al. highlight four key principles—harm prevention, public interest, paternalism, and the duty of easy rescue—the present analysis contends that these ethical frameworks are insufficient unless safety, efficacy, proportionality, and necessity of the intervention are established beforehand. Drawing on examples from COVID-19 policies, including social distancing, surveillance measures, and vaccine mandates, the article demonstrates how weak or uncertain empirical evidence undermined ethical justifications for coercion. Cases such as low efficacy against transmission, underappreciated adverse events, and proportionality concerns reveal the dangers of treating empirical validity as an afterthought. The article concludes that coercive public health policies cannot be ethically defensible without robust prior evidence of effectiveness and safety. Ethical reasoning must therefore be grounded in empirical reality, with context-sensitive, localized approaches that ensure transparency, autonomy, and trust.",

Approaches to analyzing news dissemination on social media\nneed to take stock of the broader information sharing environment that news sharing is part of.\nThis study presents a general approach for analyzing large-scale information flows on social\nmedia in a cross-platform context by tracing URLs. Using a selection of alternative news media\noutlets from Germany, Austria, Sweden and Denmark as a starting point for operationalizing\nthe broader news sharing environment that alternative news content is shared within, this study\ntraces URL sharing across Facebook, Twitter (X), Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram,\nVkontakte, Gab and 4Chan in multiple iterations of snowball sampling. A total of ~900 million\nposts are collected, followed by a two-pronged analysis of 1) general cross-platform flows and\nplatform outflow/inflow dynamics and 2) cross-platform characteristics of networks based on\nrepeated mutual URL sharing among actors. Each part of the analysis considers both URLs\nthat simply appear on multiple platforms as well as those that are shared directly from one\nplatform to another.\nResults show that one third of all URLs that appear in more than one post are cross-platform,\nwith 17% being shared directly from one platform to another. Modelling mutual URL sharing\nbehavior as a network shows that only 16 – 24% of the network is strictly single platform.\nAdditional specific platform dynamics are presented and discussed in relation to previous\nfindings on cross-platform content sharing.",

Last but not the least, we review existing approaches to \ninnovative and creative techniques, and drive home a very crucial and a critical point: the entire field of \ncreative and innovative techniques is apparently in its infancy yet, and more innovative and creative \ntechniques need to be conceptualized and gestated in the years and decades to come including those \nspecific to scientific theorization.",

          "authors": "Sujay Rao Mandavilli",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the creation of Anthropological Pedagogy as a distinct field of study within \nthe framework of Anthropology, interfacing traditional Anthropology and Pedagogy with some \npre-defined principles and objectives, chiefly designed to promote Anthropological goals and \nobjectives through the medium of education. This paper proposes to lay the groundwork for \nwhat we believe will be an exciting and promising field, and we hope other researchers, \nscholars, Anthropologists and Pedagogists will take the concepts presented herein to their\nlogical conclusion. This is based on the premise that there can be no quick fixes to complex and \nseemingly intractable issues, but that the ball must be set in motion nonetheless to replace \nsuperannuated axioms. This proposed field of study is distinct from the field of Educational \npsychology which deals with the psychology of learning, is much broader in scope than \n‘Anthropology of Education’, and the relatively less-known field of Pedagogical Anthropology \nwhich was created over a century ago by Maria Montessori and others, even though there may \nbe varying levels of overlap between them. This sub-discipline is proposed to be created with \nthe fond hope that by combining the two crucial disciplines of Anthropology and Pedagogy, a \nnew platform will be created for the wholesome furtherance of human welfare and interests, \nparticularly long-term and global welfare through more scientifically structured education \nsystems, which are designed to merge short-term local considerations with long-term global \nobjectives. This approach includes within its ambit topics such as content fixation for societal \nbenefit, long-term societal benefit, individual benefit and maximum psychological impact. \nNeedless to say, it is integrated with the Theory of Mindspace, the Theory of Mind-orientation, \nSocietal orientation and Cultural remediation. It also deals with the collection and analysis of \nmeaningful metrics, consensus-building and mobilization of international opinion for the \nrealization of the goals, and implementation of the principles of Anthropological Pedagogy.",

          "authors": "Sujay Rao Mandavilli",
          "abstract": "This paper attempts to merge the concepts and theoretical frameworks of the disciplines of \nAnthropology and Economics, and attempts to create a new sub-field in Economics called \n‘Anthropological Economics’ which is mired in Anthropological concepts and principles and \nseeks to maximize not only human welfare and happiness but also wealth maximization across \ncultures, while considering both the psychic unity of man, universal human needs and culture?specific factors. Thus, Anthropological Economics is expected to be inter-related to other \ndisciplines of Economics, but remain complementary to them i.e., it is not expected that it will \nintrude into other sub-fields of economics, replace them, or override their principles in any \nway. It will therefore draw upon other aspects of economic theory, and enrich them suitably. It \nis therefore expected that all aspects of Economic theory will be taken into consideration for \npolicy formulation and decision-making, including those of Anthropological economics, and \nindependent, context-specific judgment will always be applied. The new proposed field of \nAnthropological Economics proposes to take the idea of Human Welfare to its logical conclusion \nby extending the work already carried out in various sub-disciplines of economics, and \nintegrating it more tightly with various concepts in Anthropology. Many new tools and \ntechniques are therefore, proposed as a part of this paper, and we believe these will suitably \nenrich the field of Economics as well. While many attempts have been made in the past to \nintegrate the fields of Anthropology and Economics, we hope this endeavour will take this \nexercise to a much higher level, by creating a new generation of “Anthroeconomists”. We also \nhope it will eventually help move mainstream economics away from Neo-classical approaches \nto Anthropological and human-centric approaches.",

          "authors": "Sujay Rao Mandavilli",
          "abstract": "This paper is the last in our trilogy on Twenty-First Century Historiography. It attempts to bring all our \nendeavours to their logical culmination and as such may be construed to be our apotheosis in this \nregard. The first paper proposed a basic approach for Historiography in the Twenty-first Century and laid \nout the basic objectives of Twenty-first Century Historiography. The second paper laid out the core \nprinciples of Twenty-first Century Historiography, and these were seen a necessary adjunct for the \naccomplishment of the objectives of Twenty-first Century Historiography as defined in the first paper. In \nthis paper, we introduce Anthropological Historiography as an integral, though not core component of \nTwenty-first Century Historiography and lay down is basic tenets and objectives. We also delineate the \nrole that we expect will be played by Anthropological Historiography in the attainment of long-term \nAnthropological goals and objectives, and in promoting human welfare and well-being in general. \nAnthropological Historiography, with its myriad and multiple interfaces with other sciences is also \nexpected to play a major role in promoting a scientific temper among the laity and the general public \nand trigger shifts in individual and societal orientations in due course by countering popular perceptions \non many issues that impact their daily lives and making outdated and popular paradigms and ideologies\nredundant. We expect that Anthropological Historiography will play a major role in marginalizing fringe \nmovements besides leading to an enhanced understanding of various aspects of science, history and \nethnology among the population and ushering in intellectual movements where such movements are \nlong overdue, and very indirectly leading to a quantum increase in scientific endeavours. We also \nbelieve that Anthropological Historiography should be taught as a specialized sub-discipline chiefly \ntargeted towards higher grade students, or students pursuing advanced courses, and should be pursued \nnot by general historians, but by specialized Anthropological Historians.",

          "abstract": "The article concerns the ethnographic documentary film Hopa lide, which stems from the author’s ten years of ethnographic research among Romani musicians in Slovakia. The film is based on documenting the collaborative making of music videos. Firstly, the article critically reflects on Romani representation in contemporary documentary films, arguing that it is often distorted due to tendencies towards exoticisation, the monopoly of non-Romani gaze, challenges in the representation of poverty and story-driven approaches in contemporary documentary practice. Then, it justifies the film’s main methodological and ideological standpoints by evaluating the process of pre-production, production and distribution. In conclusion, the article highlights the importance of ethnographic film as a counterpoint to market-driven story-telling and as a valuable way of representing underrepresented groups of people.",

          "abstract": "The rapid rise of China’s electric vehicle industry - especially its booming exports - has drawn global attention. This study provides a distinctive analysis of the industry’s political economy from a domestic Chinese perspective. Although the electric vehicle sector contributes only modestly to China’s overall economy, it remains one of the few dynamic areas in an otherwise sluggish post-COVID landscape. Drawing on Baidu Index data as of 30 June 2025, the study shows how the Chinese government showcases the electric vehicle industry as a flagship of industrial upgrading and New Quality Productive Forces, using it to boost national confidence. However, its impact varies depending on the target audience and specific events.",

This study focuses on a niche area that has yet to be thoroughly examined: automotive finance. First, it explores the evolution of automotive finance in China within the context of the broader automotive market. Second, it reviews key policy initiatives from Chinese authorities related to the automotive industry, automotive finance companies, and automotive consumption. Third, it analyzes recent regulations on automotive finance companies, concluding that these measures are designed to mitigate systemic risks within China's financial system while supporting the new energy vehicle sector.",

          "authors": "Sujay Rao Mandavilli",
          "abstract": "The core objective of this paper is to show why academic Marxism, the intellectual arm of Marxism and Marxist thought has hit an intellectual road block, and is staring at a dead end. Our prognosis is that it is barely likely to survive in its present form for another decade or two. We begin this paper by defining what Marxism is and tracing its thought over the past one and a half centuries or so including varieties and regional variants of Marxism and its common criticisms. The success and failures of Marxism and communism are also likewise probed and investigated. The sphere of influence of Marxism is also probed on fields such as art, architecture, archeology, historiography, religious studies, and cultural studies. We also go on to show why Marxist thought is greatly fossilized and steeped in a mid?nineteenth century mindset, and is unlikely to work in different contexts and situations as it has limited validity and applicability. Many of the failures of mainstream Marxism and Marxist thought also overflow and cascade into academic Marxism too, and it is time to reassess all facets and aspects of Marxism from their bootstraps. We also propose and examine alternative approaches to replace various concepts and components of academic Marxism, and link all our concepts with our previously published papers in a seamless, integrated chain. As such we expect this paper to be an integral component of our globalization movement, and it would not be difficult to understand or figure out why.",

          "authors": "Ruihan Shi",
          "abstract": "The presidential election, as the most significant election in the United States, has numerous socio-economic impacts. The real estate market, one of the most closely watched sectors in recent years, has generally shown an upward trend in prices. This paper examines the county-level voting results in two presidential elections which are 2016 and 2020 and the corresponding changes in county housing prices, finding that when a county's presidential election voting results are inconsistent with the final election outcome, the county's housing market is affected, leading to a downward trend in prices.  Additionally, counties with a preference for the Republican Party are more sensitive to fluctuations in the real estate market when they experience electoral defeat. Other factors as races and income status also exhibit heterogeneity in response to policy shocks. This study's analysis of the relationship between presidential elections and the real estate market provides guidance for strategic decision-making in the real estate industry and contributes to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the impact of presidential elections on socio-economic life.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Framework of Opportunity Resistance and Curvature Economics (FORCE)—a field-theoretic model for analyzing how economic behavior emerges within a dynamically evolving topography of opportunity and constraint. Rather than treating agents as isolated optimizers within equilibrium-based systems, FORCE embeds them in a fluid field shaped by resistance, influence, and differential access—where capital, policy, and social signals distort the flow of opportunity itself.\n\nBy conceptualizing emergent effort, asymmetrical opportunity, and systemic strain as geometric features of a socioeconomic field, FORCE enables new formulations of economic behavior that account for both agency and structural impedance. Constructs such as economic curvature, opportunity resistance, nexus distortion, and emergence coefficients provide a tensorial language for describing how tension accumulates and resolves across uneven social terrain.",
