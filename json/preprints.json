          "title": "Phonetic and Semantic Radical Priming in Chinese Character Amnesia",
          "authors": "Zebo Xu; Yichi ZHANG; Zhenguang Garry Cai",
          "abstract": "The shift from handwriting to digital typing as the dominant form of written communication has led to a decrease in handwriting proficiency. This trend is particularly evident in opaque writing systems, such as Chinese, where speakers increasingly experience “character amnesia”, the inability to (fully) handwrite a character despite being able to recognise it. In this study, we investigated whether prior exposure to a phonetic or semantic radical of a character helps to subsequently alleviate amnesia in handwriting the character. In three online experiments, participants were first exposed to a prime character that shares a phonetic radical, a semantic radical, or no radical with a target character (or, in Experiment 2, exposed to a stand-alone radical); then they handwrote the target character according to a dictation prompt. Participants reported less character amnesia in handwriting the target character if they had previously been exposed to a phonetic or semantic radical, either as part of a prime character or as a stand-alone radical. Furthermore, the priming effect of the semantic radical was similar regardless of whether the prime had a semantic radical with high or low semantic transparency. These findings suggest that character amnesia in Chinese is caused by the incomplete orthographic activation in semantic and phonetic radicals.",

          "authors": "Sofia Abrevaya; Constanza Cerana; Sofia Stancanelli",
          "abstract": "Lack of access to appropriate clothing sizes can negatively impact body image and self-esteem. This study aimed to assess the relationship between clothing access, body image, and self-esteem. 443 participants (42 male) completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, a clothing access scale, the Body Appreciation Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Eating Attitudes Test, and the Body Esteem Questionnaire. Data analysis focused on women without eating disorder risk, with comparisons made between those at risk of eating disor-ders and between men and women using a matched sub-sample (in BMI, age, and size). Sig-nificant correlations between all variables were found for women, and a regression model indicated that body esteem was a significant predictor, while general self-esteem was not. Those aware of the new Size Law (58%) reported lower clothing access and higher BMI. Women at risk for eating disorders (N=68) had lower body appreciation and both general and body self-esteem. Gender differences revealed that men had higher values for all meas-ured variables. The findings suggest that the lack of clothing size access and the associated societal beauty ideals contribute to body image issues, particularly for women. This study underscores the need to address size discrimination within the fashion industry and high-lights the importance of implementing the Size Law to promote inclusion and gender equity.",

          "authors": "Tadeg Quillien; Neil R Bramley; Christopher G. Lucas",
          "abstract": "According to counterfactual theories of causal judgment, people judge causation by evaluating the consequences of counterfactual interventions on their representations of the world. What is the format of these representations? Research on causal generalization suggests that people hold `invariant' representations of causal relationships that can be flexibly composed together. We suggest that people can compute counterfactuals on the basis of these invariant representations, and in particular they can imagine `disconnecting' the causal link between two variables. Importantly, this hypothesis implies that causal judgment is supported by richer representations than the Structural Causal Models (SCMs) used in most counterfactual theories. We argue that this gap can explain the shortcomings of existing counterfactual theories, for example why these theories struggle to explain the distinction between `productive’ and non-productive causation. In a series of simple experiments, we find that the consequences of variable-disconnection counterfactuals systematically affect people’s causal judgments, even holding constant the structural causal model describing the situation. Overall, the counterfactual framework might provide a unifying account of human causal judgment, provided we correctly understand the mental representations people use to imagine counterfactual scenarios.",

          "authors": "Yu-Fang Yang; Michael Niedeggen; Xu Fang",
          "abstract": "Social exclusion is a negative experience in social interaction which can be modulated by the perceived eye gaze. In our Cyberball study, we asked how gaze direction – direct versus averted – affects the processing of social exclusion by using electroencephalogram (EEG) methods. Participants encountered neutral gazes in the inclusion phase (Block1) and then either direct or averted gazes during the exclusion phase (Block2). We measured self-reports on Need-Threat Questionnaires (belonging, control, meaningful existence, self-esteem) and negative mood, along with event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically the P3 component (P300) - an indicator of expectation violation. Findings demonstrated that the P3 amplitude showed differential changes between gaze conditions during the transition from inclusion to exclusion, with direct gaze eliciting stronger neural responses. This difference signals that direct gaze enhances the expected participation, thus sensitizing participants for exclusionary signals. Simultaneously, self-reports indicated that the transition evoked weaker negative emotions in the direct gaze group and stronger negative emotions in the averted gaze group, signalling that direct gaze also serves as an affiliative signal. These results illuminate how gaze directions shape cognitive and emotional reactions to social exclusion. However, further research is necessary to unravel these effects amidst other non-verbal cues and fully comprehend their impact on neural and behavioural responses to social exclusion.",

          "authors": "Sophie Wilhelmina Berkhout; Noémi Katalin Schuurman; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Ambulatory assessment has gained widespread popularity among researchers who study the dynamics of everyday experiences and behaviors, such as sleep patterns or emotional states. In this paper, we focus on the challenge that arises when we want to investigate the dynamic relations between variables that were measured at different frequencies. As a running example, we use a sleep quality variable measured once every morning and a mood variable measured multiple times during the day for multiple days. We propose two N=1 models that imply different processes; the first focuses on dynamic relations from day to day between sleep quality and a daily factor of the mood variable, and the second focuses on dynamic relations from one measurement occasion to the next, which prioritizes when the variables affect each other. Additionally, we introduce a combination of these two models and demonstrate their accuracy with a simulation study. An empirical N=1 example of daily sleep quality and momentary self-doubt demonstrates that dynamic relations exist between sleep quality and self-doubt at certain moments in the day and the daily factor of self-doubt. Researchers may adjust the proposed dynamic models to align with their own theories and to accommodate different data or research interests.",

          "abstract": "Automatic evaluation has emerged as a central concept in contemporary thinking about prejudice. The \npresent research tested the quintessential aspect of prejudice: Does group affiliation dominate \nautomatic evaluation of individual group members even when diagnostic evaluative information about \nthe individuals is available? Participants read about the behaviors of two individuals: one from a \ntypically liked group and one from a typically disliked group, portraying one individual as more \npositive than the other, and manipulating the extremity and direction of that difference. We conducted \nsix studies (Total N = 11,572, with samples consisting of adults residing in the U.S.), across different \ngroup types (age, gender, or race), and indirect measures that purportedly measure automatic evaluation \n(the Implicit Association Test [IAT] and the Evaluative Priming Task [EPT]). Group affiliation \n(relatively to personal characteristics) influenced the IAT and the EPT more than it influenced the self-\nreported evaluation. These results may suggest that automatic evaluation of individuals is more \nprejudiced than nonautomatic evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Esports is a rapidly growing global industry with millions of participants, yet there are no standardised mental health frameworks to support players, coaches, and organisations. This study aimed to identify key priorities for developing international mental health guidelines tailored to esports, defining their scope and outlining the roles of key stakeholders. Using a modified Delphi approach, an expert panel of 18 professionals specialising in esports and mental health participated in a two-round consensus process. In Round One, qualitative responses identified five key areas of focus, leading to the development of 13 statements on mental health promotion, prevention, and care. In Round Two, panel members rated their agreement and the perceived importance of these statements using a 4-point Likert scale, with statements reaching 80% consensus included in the final recommendations. Of the 13 statements, 12 achieved consensus, emphasising the need for mental health literacy programs, safe and healthy environments, and structured mental health first aid training for coaches and community leaders. The expert panel also highlighted the responsibility of game publishers, tournament organisers, and governing bodies in promoting mental health resources and policies. This study provides a foundation for evidence-based esports mental health guidelines, which can inform future policy development, industry practices, and player support systems.",

          "authors": "Hannah De Laet; Jan R. Wiersema; Annabel. D. Nijhof",
          "abstract": "While prevailing theories suggest social interaction difficulties are inherent to individuals with autism, the theory of the double empathy problem (Milton, 2012) proposes that these difficulties result from a mismatch between neurologically different interaction partners. This theory also predicts less difficulty during interaction between individuals with autism. Existing studies are limited, warranting further investigation. In 2022, adults with autism completed an online mixed-method questionnaire, which included demographic questions, a question regarding language preference, 14 statements (N = 407) comparing various aspects of interaction between individuals with and without autism and six open-ended questions (N = 337). The sample includes adults spanning a range of ages and educational backgrounds. The results from the statements revealed that adults with autism experienced all, except for one, aspects of communication to be better and easier with others who also have autism than with others who do not. The only aspect of communication they did not experience to be better with others with autism was body language. The results from the open-ended questions mainly support the findings from the statements, but also provide additional nuance. Themes highlighted easier interactions between individuals with autism, characterized by mutual understanding and the absence of judgment. Additionally, when they know someone else also has autism, they feel less need to camouflage. However, some interaction difficulties were also noted. In conclusion, the experiences of adults with autism in our study align with the theory of the double empathy problem, however further systematic research is warranted to test this theory.",

          "authors": "Gabrielle Rowles; Joseph Keenan; Nicola Wright; Karen Hughes; Rebecca Pearson; Hannah Fawcett; Elizabeth Braithwaite",
          "abstract": "Purpose. Many women want to breastfeed, but experience breastfeeding difficulties (such as latching problems, perceived low milk supply, nipple pain) with associated consequences for poor mental health. The aim of the current study was to investigate mother’s perceptions of how breastfeeding difficulties have impacted their mental health, couched within a behaviour change model, to identify intervention targets.\nMethods. Data were collected in October 2023 via an online cross-sectional survey. Participants provided qualitative open-ended responses to describe how they felt that breastfeeding difficulties may have impacted their mental health (N=1141).  This qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis and themes were mapped deductively on to the COM-B model of behaviour change.\nResults. In general, mothers were highly motivated to breastfeed, but experienced challenges with psychological capability, physical capability, and social opportunity. Analyses resulted in the identification of the following targets for intervention: 1) education around the realities of what to expect when breastfeeding, including breastfeeding difficulties, 2) support for technical challenges and pain management when experiencing breastfeeding difficulties, and 3) education for healthcare professionals, families and wider society on the importance of supporting breastfeeding mothers who are experiencing breastfeeding difficulties.\nConclusion. Interventions targeted at breastfeeding mothers who are experiencing breastfeeding difficulties with associated mental health consequences have the potential to reduce rates of both early breastfeeding cessation and poor maternal mental health in the postnatal period. Here, we extend existing knowledge by identifying potential intervention targets to enable mothers to better cope with the challenges of breastfeeding.",

          "title": "Why Does Positive Feedback Undermine Performance? Introducing the Decoupling Hypothesis",
          "authors": "Nils Jostmann; Eddie Brummelman",
          "abstract": "Positive feedback is often given in an attempt to boost people’s performance. In many cases, however, positive feedback undermines performance. Why? A common explanation is recipients interpret positive feedback as evidence that they are making more progress toward their goal than expected, leading them to coast. Here, we propose an alternative explanation: Receiving positive feedback is a pleasurable experience that decouples the grip of attention from the task, which undermines performance. If so, performance drops after positive feedback could be prevented by delaying the positive feedback until individuals have started preparing for their next task. Doing so may even transform the positive feedback into a motivational reward that allows individuals to utilize the rewarding experience of receiving positive feedback to energize their on-task behavior, thereby improving performance. We tested the decoupling hypothesis in three well-powered experiments (total N = 395), including a preregistered replication. Across experiments, we found that when positive feedback was delivered before participants started preparing for their next task, it impaired subsequent performance. Supporting the decoupling hypothesis, when positive feedback was delivered after participants started preparing for their next task, it did not impair subsequent performance; in fact, it boosted performance. These findings shed new light on the cognitive-affective mechanisms that underlie performance drops after positive feedback and identify unique ways to alleviate them. Also, the findings show that individuals do not invariably coast after positive feedback. This has broad implications for motivation theory and feedback interventions.",

          "authors": "Yu-Fang Yang; Matthias Gamer",
          "abstract": "Facial features transmit emotions but their effect on visual orienting and explicit emotion recognition is debated. Here we examined whether fixating on diagnostic features of emotional expressions — such as eye region for fear and the mouth for happiness — affects saccadic targeting and improves recognition accuracy. Across two pre-registered experiments, participants viewed fearful, happy, and neutral faces for short intervals (50ms or 150ms) while the initial fixation location was manipulated. Although such brief stimulation does not allow for visual exploration, the faces triggered a substantial number of saccades that occurred after stimulus offset. These reflexive saccades were modulated by the emotional expressions indicating a consistent preferential saccadic orienting towards diagnostic features, even with limited exposure. As this effect disappeared for inverted faces, it can be attributed to an extrafoveal processing of facial features instead of an attentional orienting towards physically salient image regions. Participants' recognition accuracy was unaffected by the foveated facial feature, but this observation might also be due to ceiling effects in performance. Collectively, these findings contribute to understanding the attentional mechanisms of feature-based processing in the perception of emotional facial expressions.",

          "abstract": "Consumers often feel disgusted toward products that have been touched by others, a phenomenon known as the negative contagion effect (NCE). While prior research has explored NCE through biological and cultural lenses, the role of interpersonal factors remains underexamined. This study investigates how the toucher’s gender and social role influence NCE and psychological ownership. Study 1 revealed that male touchers elicited stronger NCE compared to female touchers, and products touched by stranger customers were more negatively perceived than those touched by store staff. Study 2 demonstrated that psychological ownership was higher for products touched by stranger customers than by store staff, suggesting a close relationship between ownership perceptions and NCE. These findings highlight the interplay of social and psychological factors in shaping consumer disgust. Practical implications include strategies for optimizing product handling in retail and online contexts. Future research should explore cultural and product-specific variations to further refine our understanding of NCE dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The objective of this systematic review was to (1) identify existing digital interventions for adolescent depression and anxiety, (2) assess the promise of those interventions, and (3) identify characteristics of promising interventions. Six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar) were used to conduct searches between September and October 2023. The searches were rerun in June 2024. Twenty studies met the criteria for inclusion, leading to the identification of 17 distinct interventions for analysis. The promise of the interventions was assessed through their effectiveness, the RE-AIM Framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) dimensions, and risk of bias. The evaluation of interventions’ promise deemed three studies as ‘Quite Promising’, six as ‘Slightly Promising’, and eleven as ‘Not Promising’. All promising interventions somewhat met the RE-AIM dimensions. Variability was observed in TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) characteristics, including Rationale, Intervention provider, Length and frequency of intervention, and Retention. Factors that potentially contribute to the success or limitation of digital mental health interventions among adolescents are discussed. The review underscores the need to enhance the methodological rigor and to evaluate and report the real-world impact of interventions to ensure they benefit a broader demographic of young people.",

          "abstract": "Research on music-evoked autobiographical memories has grown rapidly in recent years, suggesting that music can be an effective stimulus for cueing memories from one’s life. One challenging aspect of this type of research is creating a stimulus set that is effective at cueing autobiographical memories in a wide range of individuals. The present work sought to address this issue by creating a normed stimulus set of popular music and popular movie cues. In addition to this methodological aim, we had an empirical aim to identify differences between autobiographical memories cued by music and movies. Participants (N=248) either listened to excerpts of popular music or viewed clips of popular movies. After each stimulus, participants rated it on several dimensions, including emotional valence, emotional arousal, familiarity, and autobiographical salience. Results indicated that certain songs and movies are autobiographically salient across a wide age range of participants. Additionally, we identified that musical cues show a significantly more pronounced reminiscence bump than movie cues, suggesting that music from the reminiscence bump period of life is more effective at triggering memories. Overall, these data provide an important resource for researchers wishing to use popular media to cue autobiographical memories, as well as indicating differences between memories cued by music and movies.",

          "authors": "Marco Marini; Sebastiano Munini; Stefano Paravani; Fabio Paglieri",
          "abstract": "The attraction effect refers to the impact of an asymmetrically dominated irrelevant option (decoy) in shifting preferences towards its dominant option (target), with respect to another, non-dominant alternative (competitor). This context effect has been observed in multiple studies, yet its practical relevance in real-life situations has recently been questioned, since various factors can modulate, nullify, or even reverse the attraction effect. In this study, we investigate the impact of presentation order and presentation modality (simultaneous or sequential) on the elicitation of the effect in a value-based choice task. Previous studies documented the relevance of these variables in modulating the effect, yet they used perceptual discrimination tasks, raising the question of whether these factors would have the same impact on value-based choice. Our findings confirm that spatial proximity between target and decoy is necessary for eliciting attraction effects in value-based choice (as it is in perceptual discrimination) when options are presented simultaneously; however, when options are presented sequentially, temporal proximity is showed to be irrelevant for the attraction effect, which is observed across all presentation orders (contrary to what was reported in previous studies using perceptual discrimination tasks). These results provide further insight on the importance of both visual arrangement, task demands, and cognitive processing in modulating context effects in decision-making.",

          "authors": "Douglas Macfarlane; Alys Griffiths; Joash Ding; Louis Stokes; Joshua Choma; Ikran Dahir; Clive Ballard; John Dennis; William Henley; Christoph Mueller",
          "abstract": "Risperidone is an antipsychotic used to treat behavioural symptoms of dementia such as agitation. Guidance stipulates it be used as a last resort and in these cases there is evidence of benefit, however it carries a number of severe side effects, including stroke. Prescribing data suggest regular use outside of this guidance but the reasons for this are unclear. We currently know very little about the first-hand experiences of people involved in prescribing decisions within care homes. This study aimed to understand perceptions around the risks and benefits of risperidone, preferences on how side effect risks are communicated, and how people feel about being able to better predict these risks. Semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted with care home residents, relatives, and staff. A focus group was conducted with external healthcare professionals. Using framework analysis, five main themes were identified: 1) the interplay between the person and their symptoms; 2) balancing voices in decision making; 3) what happens before prescription?; 4) bringing together information to make the right decision; 5) what happens after prescription?. Care home staff and relatives of people with dementia were generally uncertain of the risks of risperidone, and the potential side effects were often not explained adequately. Person-centred care was preferred by participants, but there is often no alternative to risperidone as a last resort. While it continues to be prescribed, efforts to minimise harm are required. Specifically, improved education around the risks of risperidone is needed. Relatives wish to be involved in the decision-making process alongside care staff, and their involvement should be optimised with the use of a decision-aid.  Accessible dementia-specific guidance on monitoring risperidone after prescription should also be developed.",

          "abstract": "While negative risk-taking behavior in adolescents is a classic topic, extant research has long spent little attention to the positive aspects of adolescents’ development. One topic that started to gain more research focus is prosocial risk-taking behavior – defined as behavior where an individual takes a risk to help someone else. However, validated measures are still limitedly available. The goal of the study is to construct and validate a multifaceted measure to assess prosocial risk-taking in adolescents. A sample of 234 Dutch adolescents (149 girls) aged 14-17 filled in the unvalidated prosocial adolescent risk-taking questionnaire (PAR-Q) to perform an exploratory factor analysis to indicate initial factor structure. A separate data sample of 357 Dutch adolescents (208 girls) aged 14-17 filled in the PAR-Q to confirm this factor structure with a confirmatory factor analysis and additional questionnaires for convergent validity. In this sample, also test-retest reliability was assessed. The final two-factor structure, which represented Social and Material prosocial risk subscales, exhibited acceptable internal consistency and excellent test-retest reliability. The PAR-Q correlated positively with prosocial behaviors and empathy. The PAR-Q is a newly validated measure with good psychometric properties that can be used to gain more information on prosocial risk-taking, behavior in adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Medication adherence is influenced by both psychological and medical factors, including risk communication and numeracy skills. The way side-effect information is presented—whether in a positive or negative frame, and whether numerical data is conveyed in frequencies or percentages—can impact adherence. These effects may be more pronounced for individuals with lower numeracy.\nMaterial and Methods: Participants (N = 332) were asked to read a medication description with varying side-effect information based on experimental conditions. They were randomly assigned to a 3 (frame: positive, negative, combined) x 2 (numerical format: percentages, frequencies) between-subjects design. The study assessed risk perception, medication intention, and emotional responses while considering participants’ numeracy levels. \nResults and Discussion: Framing and numerical format significantly influenced risk perception and medication intention. Negative framing and frequency-based formats resulted in higher risk perception and lower medication intention. Moreover, numeracy interacted with the numerical format: individuals with lower numeracy showed higher medication intention in the percentage format and reported more negative emotions in the frequency format.\nConclusions: The way information is framed and presented numerically plays a significant role in shaping risk perception and medication intention. Negative framing and frequency formats tend to increase perceived risk and decrease medication intention. Tailoring communication based on numeracy levels could improve medication adherence.",

          "abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) has been positively associated with relationship quality in romantic couples, but few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying this association. The current study examines the mediating role of extrinsic emotion regulation (regulating your partner’s emotions) on the associations between EI and relationship quality. Specifically, we studied the mediating effects of three extrinsic regulation strategies involving high engagement with the partner’s emotions (cognitive reframing, receptive listening, and valuing). Heterosexual couples (N = 175) completed three waves of surveys across 14 weeks from August to October 2021. EI, extrinsic emotion regulation strategies, and relationship quality were measured at three time points. Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Models (APIMeMs) were applied to analyse the dyadic data. Results showed that valuing one’s partner was the only significant mediator linking EI to relationship quality. For both men and women, individuals' EI is associated with better relationship quality for themselves and their partners, through their extrinsic emotion regulation behaviours of valuing their partners. These findings underscore the importance of fostering EI and mutual valuing within couples, which relates to healthier and more successful romantic relationships.",

          "abstract": "The literature presents two contrasting accounts on the influence of cognitive reflection (tendency to override intuition by engaging in deliberation or analytical thinking) on susceptibility to misinformation. According to the classical reasoning account, rooted in research on evaluation of mainly soft news (sensational, human-interest stories), cognitive reflection improves truth discernment. According to the motivated reasoning account, rooted in research on argument construction about hard (policy-related) issues, cognitive reflection enhances political bias. We integrate these two accounts by examining how the distinction between soft and hard news interacts with individuals’ reasoning style to shape their capacity for truth discernment and susceptibility to political bias. Initially, we conducted an integrative data analysis (IDA) by synthesizing data from existing misinformation studies and incorporating independent ratings of news items along a hard-soft news dimension. We also conducted two experiments—one in the U.S., one in Greece—where participants viewed soft or hard political news. Across the IDA and experiments, participants higher on cognitive reflection were more prone to political bias, but only when evaluating hard news. Cognitive reflection was associated with improved truth discernment for both soft and hard news in the IDA, but not consistently so in the experiments. The findings reconcile discrepancies in the misinformation literature by demonstrating that cognitive reflection is not a one-size-fits-all solution to misinformation: although it is associated with improvement in truth discernment, it is also linked to exacerbated political bias in the case of hard news. We discuss implications of news softening for what qualifies as misinformation.",

          "abstract": "The influential model of sentence production developed by Bock and Levelt (1994) posits two stages of grammatical encoding: functional processing and positional processing. This model is sometimes referred to as the \"consensus model\" of grammatical encoding, given its wide support within psycholinguistic research. However, most research in the cognitive neuroscience of syntax does not align well with this two-stage consensus model. We will review recent research on the neurobiology of syntax, focusing on lesion-symptom mapping in people with aphasia, and in particular on the agrammatism-paragrammatism distinction. We will illustrate how a two-stage model of grammatical encoding aligns well with this distinction but does not precisely match the processing levels of functional and positional processing proposed by Bock and Levelt. We will illustrate how this consensus model can be revised in order to better accommodate the data. Finally, we will evaluate extant models of syntax and the brain, illustrating their respective adequacy and inadequacy with respect to accounting for these phenomena as well as their poor alignment with the consensus psycholinguistic model. We argue that models which involve two stages of grammatical encoding are more fruitful for pursuing relationships between psycholinguistics, aphasiology, and neuroscience.",

Anecdotal observations\nsuggest that mainstream U.S. audiences respond favorably when high-status perpetrators express\nless atonement, such as telling stories that minimize harm, or place responsibility on the victim.\nHowever, empirically, little is known about how perpetrator status and atonement influence\naudience responses. Informed by system justification theory, this vignette-based experiment\ntested the hypothesis that the more audiences are psychologically invested in an unequal status\nquo (i.e., the greater their system justification beliefs), the more they will favor perpetrators (vs.\nvictims), especially when high-status perpetrators atone less, and low-status perpetrators atone\nmore. In a pre-registered 2(perpetrator status: low, high) x 3(perpetrator narrative atonement:\nlow, medium, high) x continuous(participant system justification) between-subjects design, U.S.\nadults (N=895) were randomly assigned to read 1 of 6 first-person stories by a white male who\nhas been accused of sexual assault by a female acquaintance. Dependent measures included\nperceived severity of and relative responsibility for the assault, empathy toward perpetrator and\nvictim, and ratings of their likeability and positive personality traits. Hierarchical regression\nanalysis revealed that, instead of the hypothesized interactive effects, there were consistent main\neffects of system justification and atonement across perpetrator status levels. The greater their\nsystem justification beliefs, the more participants favored perpetrators, the less severe they rated\nthe assault, and the less they favored victims. Greater perpetrator atonement boosted favorability\nratings for him and the victim. Conversely, less perpetrator atonement diminished his\nfavorability ratings, but also made the assault appear less severe and less his (vs. the victim’s)\nresponsibility. Findings underscore the strong influences that perpetrator stories and\npsychological investment in an unequal status quo have on perceptions of sexual violence.",

          "authors": "Danielle Fahey; Jeremy Yeaton",
          "abstract": "Syntactic impairments in aphasia can provide a powerful window into the neurobiology of language. Considerable research has focused on agrammatism in nonfluent aphasia, driving a strong association between frontal brain systems and syntax. However, the syndrome of paragrammatism, typically characterized by grammatical errors in fluent aphasia, has recieved far less attention. Recent work has suggested that paragrammatism is primarily associated with posterior temporal-parietal lesions, converging with functional neuroimaging evidence that these regions support hierarchical syntax. However, the holistic perceptual approaches to paragrammatism used in this work suffer from limited inter-rater reliability as well as conflating factors such as speech rate. To remedy these issues, this study reports a system to classify agrammatic and paragrammatic symptoms at the level of the utterance using an objective coding scheme, building on previous analyses by Matchin et al. (2020). Trained speech-pathology students rated transcriptions of 88 retellings of the story of Cinderella from persons with aphasia alongside transcriptions from 53 age-matched healthy controls. Each utterance was classified by the presence of errors corresponding to functional processing (i.e., hierarchical processing) or positional processing (i.e., linearization), along with non-grammatical errors. We found that patients defined holistically using the perceptual approach as agrammatic or paragrammatic doubly dissociated in rates of functional and positional processing, and that qualitative behavioral variables distinguish healthy speech from agrammatic and paragrammatic samples. We suggest that agrammatism and paragrammatism result from distinct breakdowns in syntactic structure building during speech, resulting from damage to distinct syntactic subsystems of the brain.",

However, the establishment of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as an individual difference that also links to deception remains underexplored. To this end, the present study (N = 784 students) investigated the relationship between ACEs and deception in adulthood. Results indicated that individuals with more (versus less) adverse childhood experiences, particularly those involving maltreatment and victimization, reported more white and big lies, independent of aversive personality traits like narcissism and Machiavellianism. Together, these findings support the dispositional honesty hypothesis, indicating that foundational childhood experience and events can shape or signal deceptive behavior. Generally, the study contributes to our underexamined knowledge base of the developmental antecedents of lying, emphasizing the role that adversity plays during childhood to influence deceptive behavior beyond commonly studied personality traits.",

AI performed best (57.5%) when detecting truths and lies involving feelings about friends, although it was notably truth-biased (71.7%). However, in assessing cheating interrogations, AI was lie-biased by judging more than three-quarters of interviewees as cheating liars. In assessing interviews where humans perform at rates over 70%, AI performed below chance, and accuracy plummeted to 15.9% with an ecological base-rate. AI yielded results different than prior human studies and exhibited a strong guilt bias in transgression denials.

However, it was associated with lower perceived stress (β = -0.44, p &lt; .001) and fewer depressive symptoms (β = -0.21, p = .041). Autobiographical memory specificity showed no relationship with perceived stress or depressive symptoms. Furthermore, more severe CA (β = 0.21, p = .002) and higher perceived stress (β = 0.56, p &lt; .001) were both associated with more depressive symptoms.\n\nConclusions: These findings point towards a model where friendship support exerts its protective mental health effects possibly through reducing perceived stress in young people with CA, rather than through influencing the specificity of positive or negative autobiographical memories.",

However, individual differences in response to exposure indicate that many patients do not fully benefit from therapy. Examining individual changes over time in threat expectancy likelihood, a theorized working mechanism of exposure as proposed by the Inhibitory Retrieval Theory, may help optimize individual treatment success. This study aimed to examine the dynamics of learning during one exposure exercise for fear of public speaking and the retention of learning in daily life. Participants with elevated fear of public speaking (70 women, M age = 23.10) completed an exposure exercise designed to violate an idiosyncratic threat expectancy. They gave two, three, or four presentations to at least halve threat expectancy likelihood. Ecological momentary assessments were used to measure threat expectancy likelihood eight times a day for four days before and four days after the exposure exercise. Results showed individual differences in how fast threat expectancy likelihood decreased during the exposure exercise. Furthermore, there were individual differences in how much this translated to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood in daily life and how long participants retained the decrease. Additionally, after the exposure exercise, we found a decrease in threat expectancy severity, anticipatory anxiety, avoidance tendency, and an increase in willingness to give a presentation in daily life. Future research could examine whether individual differences in the dynamics of learning and retention in daily life following an exposure exercise are clinically relevant as predictor of overall treatment success.",

Yet, DCISs possess characteristics that make them promising avenues for well-being promotion because of their accessibility, ability to scale up, and the potential for personalization.

Previous studies suggest that framing effects arise only when option descriptions are mismatched across frames. Using online and student samples (Ns = 906 and 521), we investigated 81 framing-effect variants created from matched and mismatched pairs of 18 option descriptions (nine in each frame). Description valence or gist explained substantial variation in risk preferences (prospect theory does not predict such variation), but a considerable framing effect remained in our balanced design.

          "abstract": "Cross-linguistically, lexicons tend to be more phonetically clustered than required by the phonotactics of the language; that is, words within a language are more similar to each other than they need to be. In this study, we investigate how this property evolves under the influence of competing communicative pressures: a production-side pressure to re-use more easily articulated sounds, and a comprehension-side pressure for distinctiveness of wordforms. In an exemplar-based computational model and a communication experiment using a miniature artificial language, we show that natural-language-like levels of clustering emerge from a trade-off between these pressures. With only one pressure at work, the resulting lexicons tend to inhabit an extreme region of the possible design space: production pressures alone give rise to maximally clustered lexicons, while comprehension pressures alone give rise to maximally disperse lexicons. We also test whether clustering emerges more strongly for high-frequency items, but our results lend support only to a weak relationship between frequency and clustering. Overall, this study adds to a growing body of evidence showing that mechanisms operating at the level of individual language users and individual episodes of communication can give rise to emergent structural properties of language.",

          "abstract": "Cybersickness remains a significant challenge for virtual reality (VR) applications, particularly in highly immersive environments. This study examined the effects of immersion, task performance, and individual differences on cybersickness symptoms across multiple stages of VR exposure. Forty-seven participants aged 18–45 completed a within-subjects design that involved the Cybersickness in Virtual Reality Questionnaire (CSQ-VR) and the Deary–Liewald Reaction Time (DLRT) task. Cybersickness symptoms were assessed across four stages: before and after VR immersion, and before and after a 12 min rollercoaster ride designed to induce cybersickness. The results showed significant increases in symptoms following the rollercoaster ride, with partial recovery during the post-ride tasks. Eye–hand coordination tasks, performed after the ride and VR immersion, mitigated nausea, as well as vestibular, and oculomotor symptoms, suggesting that task engagement plays a key role in alleviating cybersickness. The key predictors of symptom severity included a susceptibility to motion sickness and gaming experience, particularly proficiency in first-person shooter (FPS) games, which was associated with a reduced cybersickness intensity. While task engagement reduced symptoms in the later stages, particularly nausea and vestibular discomfort, overall cybersickness levels remained elevated post-immersion. These findings underscore the importance of task timing, individual differences, and immersive experience design in developing strategies to mitigate cybersickness and enhance user experiences in VR environments.",

This study employs the Gaming Skill Questionnaire (GSQ) to evaluate participants’ gaming skills across six genres and overall proficiency. A total of 88 individuals aged 20–40 participated, completing assessments of empathy and six cognitive abilities: verbal short-term memory, verbal working memory, visuospatial short-term memory, visuospatial working memory, psychomotor speed (hand–eye coordination), and attention. Participants’ cognitive abilities were examined using the Digit Span Test, Corsi Block Test, and Deary–Liewald Reaction Time Task, while empathy was assessed using the Empathy Quotient Questionnaire. Findings indicate that higher levels of videogaming proficiency are linked to improvements in visuospatial short-term and working memory, psychomotor speed, and attention. Specific genres enhanced particular skills: RPGs were positively associated with both verbal working memory and visuospatial short-term memory, but were negatively associated with empathy; action games improved psychomotor speed and attention; and puzzle games showed a positive relationship with visuospatial working memory. These results add to ongoing research on the cognitive and affective effects of video games, suggesting their potential to enhance specific cognitive functions. They also highlight the complex relationship between video games and empathy. Future research should explore the long-term impacts and genre-specific effects.",

          "abstract": "Given the widespread popularity of videogames, research attempted to assess their effects on cognitive and affective abilities, especially in children and adolescents. Despite numerous correlational studies, robust evidence on the causal relationship between videogames and cognition remains scarce, hindered by the absence of a comprehensive assessment tool for gaming skills across various genres. In a sample of 347 adolescents, this study aimed to develop and validate the Gaming Skill Questionnaire (GSQ) and assess the impact of gaming skills in six different genres (sport, first-person shooters, role-playing games, action-adventure, strategy, and puzzle games) on cognitive and affective abilities of adolescents. The GSQ exhibited strong reliability and validity, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool. Gaming skills positively affected executive function, memory, overall cognition, cognitive flexibility, and emotion recognition, except for empathy. Various game genres had different effects on cognitive and affective abilities, with verbal fluency influenced mainly by sports, executive functions by action, strategy, and puzzle, and emotion recognition positively impacted by action and puzzle but negatively by sports and strategy games. Both age and gaming skills influenced cognitive flexibility, with gaming having a greater effect. These intriguing genre-specific effects on cognitive and affective functioning postulate further research with GSQ’s contribution.",

This study aimed to explore the predictors of cybersickness and its interplay with cognitive and motor skills. Methods: 30 participants, 20–45 years old, completed the MSSQ and the CSQ-VR, and were immersed in VR. During immersion, they were exposed to a roller coaster ride. Before and after the ride, participants responded to the CSQ-VR and performed VR-based cognitive and psychomotor tasks. After the VR session, participants completed the CSQ-VR again. Results: Motion sickness susceptibility, during adulthood, was the most prominent predictor of cybersickness. Pupil dilation emerged as a significant predictor of cybersickness. Experience with videogaming was a significant predictor of cybersickness and cognitive/motor functions. Cybersickness negatively affected visuospatial working memory and psychomotor skills. Overall the intensity of cybersickness’s nausea and vestibular symptoms significantly decreased after removing the VR headset. Conclusions: In order of importance, motion sickness susceptibility and gaming experience are significant predictors of cybersickness. Pupil dilation appears to be a cybersickness biomarker. Cybersickness affects visuospatial working memory and psychomotor skills. Concerning user experience, cybersickness and its effects on performance should be examined during and not after immersion.",

          "abstract": "This scoping review examines the broad applications, risks, and ethical challenges associated with Extended Reality (XR) technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), within the context of Metaverse. XR is revolutionizing fields such as immersive learning in education, medical and professional training, neuropsychological assessment, therapeutic interventions, arts, entertainment, retail, e-commerce, remote work, sports, architecture, urban planning, and cultural heritage preservation. The integration of multimodal technologies—haptics, eye-, face-, and body tracking, and brain–computer interfaces—enhances user engagement and interactivity, playing a key role in shaping the immersive experiences in the Metaverse. However, XR’s expansion raises serious concerns, including data privacy risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, cybersickness, addiction, dissociation, harassment, bullying, and misinformation. These psychological, social, and security challenges are further complicated by intense advertising, manipulation of public opinion, and social inequality, which could disproportionately affect vulnerable individuals and social groups. This review emphasizes the urgent need for robust ethical frameworks and regulatory guidelines to address these risks while promoting equitable access, privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being. As XR technologies increasingly integrate with artificial intelligence, responsible governance is essential to ensure the safe and beneficial development of the Metaverse and the broader application of XR in enhancing human development.",

Indeed, some even see 'sparks of artificial general intelligence' in their apparently boundless faculty for conversation and reasoning, Their sophisticated emergent faculties, which were not initially anticipated by their designers, has ignited an urgent debate about whether and under which circumstances we should attribute consciousness to artificial entities in general and  LLMs in particular. The current consensus, rooted in computational functionalism, proposes that consciousness should be ascribed based on a principle of computational equivalence. The objective of this opinion piece is to criticize this current approach and argue in favor of an alternative “behavioral inference principle”.

          "abstract": "Safety management in organizations takes too little account of the cultural heritage of workers. In France, the significant presence of workers of African origin in the workplace, due to globalization and the migration of populations, illustrates the internationalization of work in the country. This study analyzed the relationships between African cultural beliefs, attitudes to safety rules, and perceived safety climate in workers of African origin in France. Specifically, referring to the existing literature on these three dimensions  (Ngueutsa et al., 2021; Auzoult and Ngueutsa, 2019; Zohar, 2010, respectively), we hypothesized that both reasoned acceptance of the rules and acceptance of the rules based on collective experience, mediate the effect of three dimensions of cultural beliefs - namely, beliefs related to the protection and celebration of life, to group identification and belonging, and to manifestations  of joy - on perceived safety climate in these workers. The study was conducted by questionnaire on 219 workers from sub-Saharan Africa origin, living in France. Although preliminary analyses did not enable us to test our mediation hypothesis, results revealed that cultural beliefs relating to the protection and celebration of life and those related to group identification and belonging predicted reasoned acceptance of the rules. Similarly, reasoned acceptance of the rules determined the perceived safety climate. Reasoned acceptance of the rules, cultural beliefs related to safety issues and to cultural identities appears to be determinants of safety climate. In a multicultural professional context, cultural heritage of workers should be taken into account when designing safety management practices.",

Specifically, we hypothesized that the type and intensity of Facebook use can predict aggressive behavior among this population. Five hundred and sixteen university students in Cameroon answered a questionnaire comprising four scales regarding Facebook use which measured: i) the intensity of use, ii) active and passive use, iii) problematic use, and iv) aggressive behavior. The analyses highlighted two interaction effects linked to aggressive behavior; the first was between passive use and the intensity of use on aggressive behavior, and the second between problematic use and passive use.

          "abstract": "Research has largely examined how climate change is seen to have an impact on eating practices, namely the promotion of a vegetarian diet in the Euro-American and other WEIRD contexts. Here, we examine these issues in India, where championing vegetarianism closely intersects with casteism. Social psychologists have argued that preference for a meat or plant-only diet is negotiated in the face of concerns over animal harm. We then examine another dilemma where promoting vegetarianism is seen as advocating for marginalization and oppression of caste groups. Using discursive and rhetorical psychology we examined interactions on Reddit where promoting vegetarianism was challenged for its casteism, creating a dilemma. Findings show that, first, users constructed and negotiated the uniqueness of the Indian context for promoting vegetarianism, and second, those promoting vegetarianism did not consider casteism as problematic and endorsed the marginalization of meat-eaters. Users’ constructions of the context were made in ways to negotiate responsibility for the climate crisis in challenging the imposition of vegetarianism. The findings then show that the salience of context in which specific forms of diet are promoted as a response to the climate crisis is central to how these forms of promotion are taken-up. These findings are discussed in relation to research on promoting vegetarianism and management of prejudice in contemporary social psychology.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims 1) to assess the psychometric properties of the APACS-Fr, a comprehensive test of pragmatic abilities for French speaking adolescents and adults, and 2) to use it to study lifespan variations in pragmatic abilities, to determine when pragmatic abilities peak. \nMethods: The APACS-Fr was adapted from the original Italian APACS and then used in a cross-sectional design to assess the pragmatic abilities of 184 participants with no known disorder, aged between 14 and 88 years old. The psychometric properties of the test were analyzed from these data and age effects were assessed through LOESS regression and multiple linear regressions. \nResults: The APACS-Fr was characterized by a good overall internal consistency, a good to excellent inter-rater reliability and a good structural validity with a unifactorial structure. Age analysis revealed that accuracy consistently improves between 14 and approximately 25-30 years old. A decline in performance was also visible in some tasks after 70 years-old. Multiple regressions revealed that SES was an additional supporting factor on most tasks; in contrast, gender never resulted as a relevant predictor of performance. \nConclusions: Pragmatic alibies keep improving during late adolescence and early adulthood, before reaching a plateau around 25-30 years old, and they may decline after 70 years old. Taking this pattern into account should make research as well as clinical practice with adolescents and adults more accurate. The APACS-Fr embraces such a life-span perspective. Thanks to its good psychometric properties, this freely distributed tool appears suitable to assess pragmatic abilities in French speaking adolescents and adults.",

Colors and temperatures are seemingly unrelated concepts, yet our brains have created ways of linking them. According to the literature, primarily from Western cultures, colors such as red and yellow are typically associated with warmth, whereas blue is associated with coolness. However, the universality, cultural specificity, and developmental trajectory of this association remain poorly understood. To explore whether the association between color and temperature is a phenomenon limited to certain cultures or a collectively shared mechanism among many cultures, we conducted an online survey using a set of 20 colors comprising five hues and four tones. Children and adults from various regions of the world were asked to choose a color that felt warmer during pairwise comparisons. The results demonstrate universality in hues and cultural specificity, particularly in tones (lightness and saturation elements of colors). In addition, age-specific comparisons between cultures revealed different trajectories of this association during development, highlighting cultural influences.",

          "abstract": "Since the turn of the 20th century, empirical studies using music stimuli to test key theories in music affects have mushroomed, in which selecting or designing music stimuli became a common practice. However, the majority of the studies didn’t justify the selecting methods of the music stimuli within a consistent framework. More than half of the research rely on a modest amount of familiar music stimuli from the past, targeting a narrow range of discrete emotions, raising concerns on comparability, and reproducibility across studies. In this article, I designed a novel diagrammatic method named Abstraction-Measure Diagram (AMD), inspired by Juslin's ICINAS-BRECVEMAC framework to address the current issues. I also illustrated how to draw AMD with understudied affects in previous research and recommended a few selected repertoire as new music stimuli. The goal is to initiate a study of “musi-metrics” (which I term) for music stimuli best practice aiming to promote consistency, comparability, and reproducibility in the field, and enhance research rigor for the future. An additional wish through this article is to raise more awareness for the timeless aesthetic legacy throughout music history.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the early development of cultural variations in audiovisual speech perception in infancy. Focusing on the McGurk effect, we examined the audiovisual speech integration in 6- to 12-month-old infants from Canadian (N = 55) and Chinese (N = 80) cultural contexts. Infants were presented with auditory syllables paired with videos of a female face articulating syllables in a \"moving-still-moving-still\" pattern, designed to elicit alternating auditory percepts should the integration occurred. We recorded infants’ looking time to index their auditory perception and found robust audiovisual integration in Canadian infants from 6 months. By contrast, Chinese infants exhibited a more protracted developmental pattern, showing developmental changes in integration capacity over the same age range. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that the presentation of other-race faces differentially impacted the integration performance across cultures. These findings coincided with notable differences in caregiving practices, where Canadian infants predominantly experienced nuclear family care, whereas Chinese infants received more extended family care. These findings suggest that cultural variations in audiovisual integration emerge early in infancy and may be influenced by early social experiences, particularly caregiving styles. The observed divergence aligns with previous research on older populations, indicating that cultural differences in audiovisual speech perception manifest early and persist into adulthood. This study highlights the importance of cultural context in understanding the development of multisensory speech perception, with implications for theories of language acquisition, early identification of atypical development, and the design of culturally sensitive language education programs.",

One route through which formidability inferences emerge is facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR), a facial structure heuristically associated with physical prowess. We conducted four experiments across demographically diverse samples to determine how fWHR informs perceptions of men’s parental abilities and motives. Perceivers ascribed more effectiveness in protecting offspring in high-fWHR men (Study 1). Perceptions of their strength underpinned this ascription (Study 2). Inferences of men’s paternal ability tracked both configural and featural processing (Study 3) and expected motivations for protection (Study 4). Results contribute to a functional perspective of fWHR to understand inferences of the motivational costs and benefits in parenting in men.",

          "abstract": "The pupil response has long been considered a robust marker of cognitive load. In the context of semantic processing, research has demonstrated that the pupil dilates in response to stimuli which violate contextual expectations (e.g. events presented out of chronological order). However, the scope of this relationship has yet to be fully elucidated. For example, incongruent object-scene relationships, while comprehensively explored by eye-tracking and electrophysiology research, have yet to be investigated via pupillometry. In this study, we measured pupil size in response to an object-scene congruency task. Participants were presented with a photorealistic background scene and instructed to fixate their gaze on a cued point within the scene. Upon recovery of pupil size to baseline, a congruent object (i.e. an object which fit into the overall meaning of the scene) or an incongruent object appeared at the cued fixation point for the remainder of each trial. We hypothesized that incongruent objects would result in greater mean pupil dilation from baseline than congruent objects, due to the increase in cognitive effort required for semantic processing of incongruent objects within a scene. Yet, in opposition to our hypothesis, the results of a time course analysis revealed that pupil size was significantly greater for the congruent condition than the incongruent condition. The resulting implications for understanding pupil dilation as a physiological marker for high-level cognitive processes such as semantic integration are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Communication is ubiquitous in human social life. There are many possible modes of human communication but language use is plainly of special interest: because language plays a critical role in culture and society; and because languages are important cultural products in their own right, with their own distinctive properties, in particular grammatical structure. However, we do not presently have any compelling synthesis of our understanding of communication and our understanding of grammar. This problem is important because synthesizing knowledge across neighboring domains considerably deepens understanding in its own right, and can bring new perspectives to bear on old issues. Mature syntheses are major scientific breakthroughs. Here I present a synthesis of communication and grammar. I argue in particular that contextualist theories of communication, and constructionist approaches to the description of grammars, together provide a cohesive picture. Both bodies of work have proved enormously influential in their respective subfields, but their synthesis provides a unified picture of considerable clarity. Linguistic communication is a coordination problem on the speaker’s informative intentions; and grammars are networks of micro-conventions for ostensive communication, that enable language users to resolve this coordination problem far more easily than they otherwise would. I identify precisely what makes languages, languages; and what language users are doing when they ‘use language’. This synthesis in turn provides fresh perspectives on many classical issues in the language sciences. I sketch three examples: literal meaning and construction modulation; language learning; and the evolutionary emergence of language in our species.",

Specifically, the research examines the association between mindfulness and mental well-being within this community and investigates how Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) might be adapted to meet their cultural needs.\nMethods: Two complementary studies were conducted. The first was a cross-sectional quantitative study involving 181 Arab-Bedouin participants who completed validated scales measuring trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and key mental health indicators, including well-being, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress. The second study employed qualitative methods, with in-depth interviews of 8 Arab-Bedouin mental health professionals who completed an adapted MBSR program. Thematic analysis was applied to explore their perspectives on necessary cultural adaptations for effective implementation.\nResults: Quantitative analysis showed strong positive associations between mindfulness, self-compassion, and mental well-being, with higher mindfulness and self-compassion linked to lower anxiety, depression, and stress. Qualitative findings emphasized essential cultural adaptations, including delivering MBSR in Arabic, integrating Islamic values, and providing gender-sensitive practices, all of which fostered cultural alignment and increased participant engagement. Participants highlighted the value of the instructor’s cultural background and the use of relatable examples. \nConclusions: Mindfulness practices are associated with improved mental health outcomes in the Arab-Bedouin community. Culturally adapting MBSR to address language, gender norms, and Islamic teachings enhances its relevance and effectiveness, highlighting the potential of tailored MBIs in promoting well-being in marginalized communities.",

These divergent findings suggest that it is premature to assume an increasing effect of social media addiction on aggression and the suggestion by Lin et al. in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Lin et al. We recommend researchers to triangulate by fitting complementary models to their data in order to evaluate if observed effects may be due to true causal effects or if they appear to be spurious.",

          "authors": "Angarika Deb; Christophe Heintz",
          "abstract": "Gendered division of household labour is marked by its pervasive inequality, in that women routinely do more housework across the world. But still, most women continue to find it fair, even if they are systematically contributing more. How can evolutionary accounts of fairness explain that fact? We review three major accounts focusing on their psychological claims, discussing what evidence in support of their account and how well they can explain perceptions of fairness about gendered division of household labour. These are three distinct accounts which describe fairness judgements a) arising from the following of local social norms (Henrich and colleagues), b) a sense of equity which evolved in a partner choice ecology (André, Baumard and colleagues) and c) as a sense of egalitarianism, which evolved in response to human coordination problems (Binmore). We find that none of these accounts are fully compatible with observations of gender inequalities in households, though each contain important insights, which can be integrated into a more comprehensive theory. We end our review by providing an outline of what such a comprehensive theory might look like and provide a tool for researchers to enable seamless exploration of multiple factors underlying fairness judgements.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13-30 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach: In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, High-Definition Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual’s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech; TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb; TtL). All participants completed a 25-minute sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main Results: Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. \nSignificance: Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, instead of beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain’s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

Until now, psychological research has treated reclamation as a uniform concept in terms of the motivations of minorities, despite theoretical perspectives suggesting otherwise.

We reported the process of creating a new scale to measure these three motivations. The three-dimensional structure of the Motivation for Language Reclamation Scale (MLRS) was validated in two studies (N = 362; N = 141) among gay people in Poland. We also showed that the motivations have various implications for collective action. The MLRS provides researchers and practitioners with a reliable tool for exploring the psychological processes involved in language reclamation and its effects on minority group members.",

          "authors": "Ryoko Uno; Shu Imaizumi",
          "abstract": "The contribution of language to the narrative self is well-known, but does language play a role in creating the sense of minimal self? In this paper, we investigated whether variations in sentence structure affected the speaker's sense of minimal self. We examined whether expressing the first-person subject's actions and perceptions in sentences influenced the speaker's sense of agency and ownership, which are key components of the minimal self. Previous studies explored the influence of expressing a third-person subject’s actions on the interpretation of agency, but not that of the first-person subject. To ensure consistent sentence structures across various expressions, we used Japanese example sentences. We found that the sense of agency of the first-person subject was significantly lower in the absence of actions or perceptions compared to when they were present. With regard to the sense of ownership, we found that it was significantly lower when both action and perception were absent (e.g., “I saw a star” vs. “A star was out”). Interestingly, when the action was absent but perception was present (e.g., “I saw a star” vs. “A star was visible to me”), the sense of ownership varied significantly depending on the context. These results suggested that variations in linguistic structures within utterances could distinctly impact the senses of agency and ownership. In cognitive linguistics it is argued that the concept of “subjectivity” is essential for understanding various linguistic phenomena. By applying the experimental methods developed in this paper, we aim not only to clarify what is implied by “subjectivity” in a broader context through the study of the self but also to introduce a method for measuring subjectivity. Furthermore, we believe that this understanding can facilitate the establishment of a connection between the linguistic narrative self and the embodied minimal self.",

          "authors": "Sharice Clough; Melissa J Evans; Melissa Collins Duff; Sarah Brown-Schmidt",
          "abstract": "Narrative discourse impairments are well documented in individuals with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Studies of narrative discourse (i.e., story generation or story retelling) in this population have frequently focused on impairment of semantic relations across utterances and the larger discourse context (e.g., cohesion, coherence, story grammar). Less attention has been given to the temporal organization of narrative retelling in TBI. We applied temporal contiguity analyses, a technique traditionally used to characterize temporal organization of free recall of wordlists, to quantify the temporal organization of participants’ story retellings with respect to the order in which the narrator originally presented the story details. We also conducted a parallel analysis of temporal contiguity of wordlist recall using data from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test. Both participants with moderate-severe TBI and non-injured peers demonstrated above chance temporal organization and a tendency to make short transitions in the forward direction when recalling items in both the narrative recall and wordlist recall task. However, these effects were significantly reduced in the TBI group. This suggests that overall, their free recall performance was less temporally ordered, and they were more likely to make larger jumps between story details (or words in the wordlist recall task) than their non-injured peers when recalling stories. Examining free recall at multiple timepoints revealed that while repetition (i.e., multiple presentations of the word list) increased temporal organization of recall, long delays (i.e., one week) decreased temporal organization for both the TBI and non-injured groups. We propose that reduced temporal organization of narrative recall in individuals with moderate-severe TBI is linked to impairments in the declarative relational memory system. In line with retrieved-context models of free recall, memory disruption not only impacts the total number of story details recalled, but also the ability to use temporal context to encode and retrieve items in a sequentially organized way.",

          "abstract": "The pretesting effect refers to the finding that guessing the answers to test questions before learning the correct answers improves memory relative to studying (or reading) without prior guessing. Although the pretesting effect is robust and has been demonstrated across multiple studies, its magnitude varies across individuals. Two studies investigated whether individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC), episodic memory ability (EM), and/or fluid intelligence (gF) help explain that variation. In Study 1, lower gF scores were associated with a larger pretesting effect among undergraduate students, stemming from lower performance on read items. In Study 2, involving adult online participants, observed patterns were less consistent, but lower WMC scores were associated with larger pretesting effects, again due to lower performance on read items. Together, these patterns suggest that pretesting can homologize memory ability across individuals, although to an extent that may vary across learner populations and cognitive abilities. That conclusion and other findings are interpreted in the context of relevant individual differences research and theories related to pretesting and memory phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal touch plays an essential role in emotional regulation. However, the mechanisms underpinning emotional regulation via interpersonal touch remain obscure. This study investigated inter-brain synchrony (IBS) during the evaluation of affective images in the context of interpersonal touch, and examined the role of IBS in alleviating negative emotional responses. We recruited 47 dyads (N=94) female participants. Each dyads participant viewed affective images (negative and neutral valence) and evaluated their valence and arousal during touch and no touch. During the task, their neural activities in the prefrontal regions were recorded using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyper-scanning. Our results demonstrated that interpersonal touch buffers individuals’ experience of negative emotions and increases IBS. Furthermore, the IBS mediated the association between interpersonal touch and the arousal scores of negative stimuli. Thus, we concluded that IBS may represent an underlying neural mechanism of the regulation of negative emotion between the touch sender and receiver. Notably, in friend, IBS was a positive predictor of friendship quality. Future studies may uncover whether inter-brain synchrony can serve as a neurobiological marker of the dyad's emotional regulation, and can be modified by touch interventions.",

          "abstract": "Although several studies have suggested acute adversity can stimulate improved functioning, very few have used prospective designs, counterfactual models, and instrumental variables to establish potential causal links. Using a theoretical framework of psychosocial gains from adversity, two natural experiments, and causal inference techniques, we investigated the impact of acute adversity on adaptive functioning and its mediation through social and prosocial factors. Study 1 (n = 250 bereaved spouses; n = 83 married controls) used a prospective investigation of late life bereavement with pre- and post-loss assessments to examine these questions. At 6-months post-loss, bereaved participants, compared to married controls, reported increased ordinary social interaction, improved instrumental support, reduced hassles with friends and relatives, and an increase in formal social meetings. Average causal mediational analyses found that increased ordinary social interactions and perceptions of support mediated a reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms, relative to pre-loss levels. Study 2 used a similar prospective natural experiment but of severe hurricane exposure (n = 1182 flooded participants; n = 3162 non-flooded controls). An instrumental variable analysis revealed that flood had causal effects on increased social support and prosocial volunteering. As with bereavement, average causal mediation analyses supported a favorable effect of flood on increased life satisfaction and health perceptions through social support and prosocial volunteering. Consistent with evolutionary accounts of reciprocal altruism, these effects were stronger when social cohesion was perceived as higher. Findings support a more expansive account of the effects of acute adversity that includes positive effects through adaptive social and prosocial processes.",

          "abstract": "Perseverative thought (PT), a multi-dimensional thought process, robustly predicts internalizing psychopathology. PT also predicts general emotion regulation (ER) deficits, which may be due to problematic selection of ER strategies, including engagement (i.e., reappraisal, acceptance, and problem-solving) and disengagement strategies (i.e., experiential avoidance, distraction, expressive suppression). This study investigates how different PT dimensions, captured through written language, predict subsequent ER strategy selection. Participants included 413 college students who completed an experimental paradigm once a day for ten days. Each night, they underwent a PT induction writing task, were instructed to regulate their emotions, and reported on their ER strategy use. We used multilevel logistic regression to examine the associations between seven PT dimensions (i.e., valence, self-focus, interpersonal, discrepancy, situational certainty, temporal orientation, and repetitiveness) and six ER strategies. At the within-individual level, five PT dimensions predicted an increased likelihood of disengagement strategies and a decreased likelihood of selecting engagement strategies, whereas one dimension predicted the opposite pattern. Individuals may respond to PT episodes by selecting ER strategies to avoid negative thoughts or experiences rather than processing them. Most PT dimensions predicted momentary ER selections in a pattern that, if becoming habitual and indiscriminate, relates to higher psychopathology. Overall, this study supported PT dimensions as important contextual features for understanding ER processes. Additionally, language-based measures of PT yielded meaningful associations with emotional processes in daily life, highlighting the benefits of computational linguistics and a dimensional approach to risk factors for psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "This study evaluated the capability of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (a large language model, LLM) to generate quantitatively analyzable data. Two datasets were generated: biological measurements for 327 land animals and simulated questionnaire responses for 202 famous people. For the biological data, Claude estimated 29 characteristics (e.g., size, speed, aggressiveness) as z-scores relative to all land animals. For the psychometric data, Claude provided predicted responses to 60 Likert-style questions from PhillyMatch.org for each famous person. Validation of biological estimates against the AnAge database showed strong correlations for animal size (r=0.85) and metabolic rate (r=-0.74). Network analysis of the biological data revealed meaningful taxonomic clustering, with mammals distinctly separated from other classes and interpretable exceptions (e.g., golden poison frog clustering with reptiles due to toxin resistance). Factor analysis of the psychometric data yielded four interpretable factors: Conservative Traditionalism, Impulsive Escapism, Pro-Family Orientation, and Sport-Focused Conventionalism. Network analysis of famous individuals showed meaningful clustering beyond simple professional categories, such as grouping individuals with violent histories regardless of their primary occupation. Notably, Claude's direct prediction of factor structure without quantitative data differed from the analysis of its generated data, suggesting distinct implicit and explicit knowledge representations. While these results demonstrate LLMs' potential for generating analyzable quantitative data, further validation against real-world data is needed before application in high-stakes domains",

          "authors": "Tyler Giallanza; Jonathan D. Cohen; Timothy Thomas Rogers",
          "abstract": "Semantic similarity plays an ambiguous role in models of human cognition. On the one hand, it is often viewed as a foundational construct that shapes how we categorize, learn, and make inferences about objects and their properties. On the other hand, a host of behavioral evidence suggests that similarity is too rigid to explain the flexibility of inductive inference. We present the Integrated Semantics and Control — Context Inference (ISC-CI) model to resolve this tension, proposing that flexible inference emerges within a system that dynamically reshapes represented semantic similarities amongst stimuli depending upon the immediate context. The ISC-CI model builds on prior models of semantics and control that learn how to build and flexibly access semantic knowledge from observing the statistical relationships between objects, their properties, and the contexts in which these occur. Critically, it introduces a new mechanism that infers a suitable representation of context for both familiar and novel scenarios, without any direct labeling in the environment. The inferred context allows the system to selectively weight different dimensions within its representational space depending on the items being processed. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that the ISC-CI model provides a coherent account of performance across inductive inference and semantic similarity tasks, including classic tasks that have long challenges theories of induction, offering a unified account of these cognitive processes that highlights the importance of context. We conclude by considering the implications of these findings for broader questions in cognitive science and artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how students' beliefs about their ability to learn (mindset) relate to their grades in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. We looked at two types of mindset beliefs: general beliefs about intelligence and specific beliefs about math ability. The study included 1,250 middle and high school students who completed surveys about their mindset beliefs. We also collected their grades in math, science, and engineering courses. Using multiple regression analysis, we found that students' mindset beliefs significantly predicted their grades in math and science, but not in engineering. For math grades, both general mindset and math-specific mindset were important predictors, explaining 3.7% of differences in grades beyond what demographic factors (gender, race, and grade level) explained. For science grades, general mindset was a significant predictor, explaining 5.4% of grade differences. We found no significant relationship between mindset and engineering grades, possibly because we had fewer students taking engineering courses. These findings suggest that students who believe their abilities can grow tend to perform better in math and science. The results can help teachers and school leaders develop better ways to support students in STEM subjects. Future research should study these relationships over time and include more students taking engineering courses to understand better how mindset affects learning across all STEM subjects.",

          "abstract": "Measurement invariance (MI) is often treated as a statistical prerequisite for meaningful comparisons of constructs across groups or time points. However, this perspective overlooks the substantive implications (a lack of) MI can have for psychological theories of constructs. In this paper, we frame MI as a causal concept with theoretical significance. We present a causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that allows researchers to reason about potential causes of non-invariance and include them in their modeling strategy. We argue that non-invariance should not be seen as prohibitive for further exploration and analyses but as an opportunity to generate new insights about constructs and their measurement. That is, under non-invariance, data need a different treatment than simply comparing constructs between groups and causal reasoning can guide researchers in this regard. We demonstrate the causal framework through an application to the study of acquiescent response style. We further discuss an extension of the causal framework to longitudinal designs. When investigating the invariance of measurements over time, the framework can help to take into account expected or desired non-invariance; for example, when constructs evolve over time or certain interventions might change measurement models. By presenting MI as a substantive finding with theoretical implications, we aim to bridge the gap between methodological rigor and applied research reality.",

These egalitarian shifts provide the ideal context to examine the boundary conditions of the motivators of group-based inequality. Accordingly, we investigate the possibility that rising gender equality over the last 14 years has attenuated the relationship between group-based (anti-)egalitarianism (namely, social dominance orientation) and system justification. Multi-level analysis of longitudinal data from 43,924 women shows that anti-egalitarian beliefs predicted increases in system justification. But as hypothesized, increases in gender equality attenuated the positive correlation between anti-egalitarian beliefs and justification of the status quo. These associations were particularly pronounced among women from majoritized groups who benefit most from gender equality. Results replicate across robustness checks and offer a critical update to our understanding of egalitarianism by showing that egalitarians may engage in system justification when the status quo becomes more equal.",

          "authors": "Simon Skau; James Steele; Kristoffer Sundberg",
          "abstract": "When defining concepts for scientific work, researchers consider various desiderata (desired characteristics) that are derived from higher level meta-desiderata regarding accepted goals of scientific work and how to act towards achieving them. Although these desiderata are often implicit, they significantly impact researchers' processes of defining and selecting concepts, ultimately influencing research outcomes, communication, and knowledge production. We evaluate the selection and application of desiderata for defining cross-disciplinary concepts dependent upon higher level meta-desiderata working from the example that if one believes that science ought to strive for providing systematic knowledge about the world (level 1), and if one believes that the ease of communication will positively affect the process of attaining that kind of knowledge (level 2), then one ought to strive for definitions of concepts that provide as much as possible of the list of features we argue for (level 3). Using psychological concepts as our examples we offer a proposed list of six desiderata: precision, specificity, theory-neutrality, explanation- neutrality, operational ease, folk-level understanding. The goal is to facilitate researchers' consideration of appropriate desiderata and, where their meta-desiderata match the example provided, promote the adoption and utilization of these desiderata in their work. Given the backdrop of conceptual change and conceptual creep, this aspect, though less discussed, plays a crucial role in shaping our research and knowledge production.",

          "authors": "Peida Zhan; Zhimou Wang; Gaohong Chu; Haixin Qiao",
          "abstract": "Teamwork involves the collaboration of individuals to achieve shared goals that surpass individual capabilities. As a team-level construct, team cognition underpins effective teamwork by integrating individual expertise and shared understanding. Identifying the causes of inefficiencies or poor team performance is critical for implementing targeted interventions and fostering the development of team cognition. This study introduces and evaluates eight teamwork cognitive diagnostic models (TCDMs) designed to analyze teamwork response data, diagnose individual cognitive attributes, and assess teamwork quality. The models can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in team cognition and determine whether poor performance arises from cognitive deficiencies or collaborative issues. Two simulation studies were conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the models under diverse conditions, followed by a teamwork reasoning task to demonstrate their application. The results showed that TCDMs achieve robust parameter estimation, effectively diagnose individual attributes, and assess teamwork quality while pinpointing the causes of poor performance. These findings underscore the utility of TCDMs in understanding, diagnosing, and improving team cognition, offering a foundation for future research and practical applications in teamwork-based assessments.",

          "authors": "Zebo Xu; Yang Yang; Tai Yuan; Gangyi Feng; Zhenguang Garry Cai",
          "abstract": "Chinese speakers have long suffered from character amnesia in handwriting, failing to handwrite a character despite being able to recognize it. The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying character amnesia remain unclear. The current study employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore brain regions that are associated with character amnesia; in particular, we tested whether character amnesia is associated with deactivation in the fusiform gyrus (FG), the superior parietal gyrus (SPG), or the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which have been shown to respectively associated with the orthographic lexicon, graphemic buffer, and phonology-orthography conversion. In a handwriting-to-dictation task, twenty-three Cantonese-speaking adults handwrote a character according to a dictation prompt and then reported whether they correctly handwrote the character or suffered from character amnesia. fNIRS results showed that, compared to correct handwriting, character amnesia elicited significantly reduced neural activation in the bilateral FG, the SPG, and the SMG. Parametric analyses showed that character frequency and number of strokes positively correlated with activation of the FG and the SPG respectively. Functional connectivity analyses further demonstrated that, compared to correct handwriting, character amnesia was associated with significantly decreased connectivity between the left FG and the left SMG, the right FG and the right SMG, the right FG and the right SPG, the right FG and the left SMG, the right FG and the left SPG, but with increased connectivity between the left SPG and the left SMG. Together, these results suggested that character amnesia is associated with the decayed orthographic representations (in the orthographic lexicon) and failure in phonology-orthography conversion, resulting in reduced orthographic information being retrieved (into the graphemic buffer) for handwriting execution.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale socio-economic panel studies aim to document societal trends and public opinions using representative population samples. Despite the profound impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on public and private life across diverse contexts, these studies have rarely addressed the use and evaluation of AI for individual respondents. Therefore, a standardized assessment instrument is introduced that was designed for the needs of large-scale social surveys. The Artificial Intelligence Experience and Attitude Survey (AIEAS) is a novel self-report instrument measuring awareness, experience, attitude, and usage intention regarding AI in the work, healthcare, and education domains. The scenario-based items describe different AI applications in different contexts and are administered in a planned missingness design to meet the brevity requirements of large-scale studies. A qualitative interview study (N = 30) confirmed the comprehensibility of the items, while a quantitative web-based study (N = 1084) with a German sample demonstrated a satisfactory measurement structure and precision. These findings attest to good psychometric properties of the AIEAS that allow for a multidimensional measurement of AI experiences and evaluations. Integrating the instrument in socio-economic panel studies will support examining societal trends over time to inform the scientific community and policies in different domains.",

Consequently, written behavioral stimuli are frequently deployed in psychological research in domains such as social cognition, impression formation, and moral psychology. That said, existing behavioral stimulus sets are somewhat limited in size and scope, and moreover, tend to lack characterization. We collected behaviors from several widely used sets, and then expanded on them by writing hundreds of new behaviors. Ultimately, this yielded a database of 2375 behaviors that is larger, broader in scope, and considerably more diverse than the previous sets that inspired this work. We then recruited a large set of participants (total N = 4792) to evaluate these behaviors across 18 dimensions central to person perception. It is our hope that this resource can support more rigorous, replicable research into the psychological and neural underpinnings of social learning.",

          "authors": "Michael L DeKay; Nataliya Rubinchik; Paul De Boeck; Zhaojun Li",
          "abstract": "A metastudy is a set of many tiny studies (microstudies) created from a much larger collection of possibilities. Metastudies can yield many of the benefits of time-consuming replications and meta-analyses, but more efficiently and with greater attention to generalizability and the causal effects of moderators. Statistical precision and power are higher than in studies with the same total sample size but with fewer conditions and more participants per condition. In this article, we describe metastudies and their benefits, demonstrate how to conduct a metastudy using the well-known risky-choice framing effect as an example, and report on the generalizability of that effect. In three metastudies (total N = 2338), the framing effect generalized well across most of the potential moderators tested, as was expected. Surprisingly, however, the effect was up to twice as large when the certain option was replaced with a slightly risky option; prospect theory predicts the opposite and fuzzy-trace theory predicts no difference. Metastudies provide a relatively quick and not-so-painful way to examine an effect’s generalizability, without waiting for a meta-analysis. Both individual labs and multi-lab networks are encouraged to shift from traditional studies to metastudies.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Necka; Titilola Akintola; Qingbao Yu; Carolyn Amir; Olga Oretsky; Lauren Yvette Atlas",
          "abstract": "Clinical trials, laboratory experiments, and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that pain is highly sensitive to expectations, whether based on the psychosocial context surrounding treatment (e.g., placebo analgesia) or transient cues that provide information about painful events (e.g., pain-predictive cues). We asked whether placebo analgesia and pain-predictive cues modulate pain through the same mechanisms or dissociable brain pathways. Forty healthy volunteers rated pain in response to noxious heat during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We crossed pain-predictive cues, which induce expectations for high or low pain on a trial-by-trial basis, with administration of an inert placebo cream or a control cream. Behavioral analyses revealed a significant interaction, such that predictive cues had weaker effects on pain during placebo blocks than control blocks. This interaction was accompanied by interactions in the insula, pons, and other brain regions. We also observed distinct neural substrates when we compared pure cue effects with pure placebo effects, and only predictive cues modulated responses in nociceptive regions and the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS; (Wager et al., 2013). The only regions that were influenced similarly by both types of expectations were the rostral anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that cue-based expectations about stimulus intensity and placebo-based expectations about treatment outcomes are distinct, and that pain researchers should differentiate between sources of expectations. Furthermore, cue-based expectations were associated with more consistent effects than treatment-based expectations, suggesting that clinicians should be particularly mindful of how they present information about impending pain.",

          "authors": "Michael L DeKay; Prachiti Garge",
          "abstract": "In the risky-choice framing effect, most people prefer a certain option over a risky one when the options are framed as gains, but this preference is typically reversed when the options are framed as losses. Past research has largely neglected how the size of this effect varies as a function of the probabilities in the risky option. DeKay et al. (2022) recently reported an inverted-U pattern in which the effect is smaller for extreme probabilities (e.g., .01, .99) than for moderate probabilities. This pattern is predicted by some theories but not others. We report a replication of the inverted-U pattern and other results involving varieties of risk comparisons (certain vs. risky, somewhat risky vs. risky, and certain vs. somewhat risky) in a preregistered online experiment (N = 807). Results indicate that the framing effect is significantly smaller but still sizeable at extreme probabilities. An internal meta-analysis (N = 2,518) confirms the reliability of the inverted-U pattern and its moderation by risk comparison. We also assess how well 5 theories (prospect theory, transfer-of-attention-exchange theory, fuzzy-trace theory, fuzzy-trace theory with rounding of extreme probabilities to 0 or 1, and the priority heuristic) account for 7 features of the data. None of these theories accounts for all of the results, though transfer-of-attention-exchange theory edges out prospect theory, which edges out the others. These results highlight the value of assessing an effect’s generalizability over variations in experimental materials.",

          "authors": "Øystein Sørensen; Ethan M. McCormick",
          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data with a large number of timepoints per individual are becoming increasingly common. Such data allow going beyond the classical growth model situation and studying population effects and individual variability not only in trends over time but also in autoregressive effects, cross-lagged effects, and the noise term. Dynamic structural equation models (DSEMs) have become very popular for analyzing intensive longitudinal data. However, when the data contain trends, cycles, or time-varying predictors which have nonlinear effects on the outcome, DSEMs require the practitioner to specify the correct parametric form of the effects, which may be challenging in practice. In this paper we show how to alleviate this issue by introducing regression splines which are able to flexibly learn the underlying function shapes. Our main contribution is thus a building block to the DSEM modeler's toolkit, and we discuss smoothing priors and hierarchical smooth terms using the special cases of two-level lag-1 autoregressive and vector autoregressive models as examples. We illustrate in simulation studies how ignoring nonlinear trends may lead to biased parameter estimates, and then show how to use the proposed framework to model weekly cycles and long-term trends in diary data on alcohol consumption and perceived stress.",

          "authors": "Sarah Oh; Anne Collins",
          "abstract": "Habits are an essential part of everyday decision-making. However, the mechanisms underlying habit formation and expression in humans are difficult to study in the laboratory, owing to a dearth of convenient experimental paradigms that reliably exhibit a key marker of habits – training-induced inflexibility – under ecologically valid conditions. This difficulty is often attributed to the fact that habits are identified in contrast to goal-directed (GD) control, which research participants typically engage strongly in laboratory experiments. To address this gap, we develop a new, short habit learning paradigm that incorporates several features we hypothesized would encourage participants to disengage GD control, enabling habits to exert greater influence over behavior: a hierarchical multi-step trial structure, opportunities for self-correction, and frequent switches between extensively and moderately practiced behaviors. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that overtraining amplifies habitual control, as evidenced by errors biased toward the overtrained context and away from the moderately-trained context at early response times, while later responses remain dominated by GD control. The reliability of this overtraining effect depended on the inclusion of task features designed to dampen GD control. In addition to providing a practical, robust, and flexible tool for studying the cognitive processes underlying habit formation and habitual control, our paradigm moves us beyond the traditional stimulus-response conception of habits, expanding the definition to include more complex, hierarchical behaviors that better reflect naturalistic human habits.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the conditional dependencies among items in Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM), a non-verbal measure of cognitive ability and fluid intelligence, within a sample of school-aged children. To this aim, we applied Bayesian networks (BNs), to data obtained from 255 participants, aged 4 to 11 years. We evaluated a variety of models, starting from the complete independence model and progressing to sequential, data-informed structures. The results highlighted that inter-item dependencies were particularly significant among kindergarten-aged children, suggesting that their problem-solving approaches may be influenced by their previous responses. The Sequential Data-Driven model consistently outperformed traditional human-driven hypothesis models, indicating the presence of complex interrelationships that could challenge the assumption of local independence in psychometric assessments. Cross-validation analyses revealed developmental differences in model fit, with optimal performance in kindergarten and increased variability as children transition to primary school. These findings advocate for the development of refined scoring methodologies that incorporate item interdependencies and prompt further investigation into the cognitive processes underlying these dependencies. Our study has implications for the psychometric validation of cognitive assessments, underscoring the importance of integrating complex item relationships in test design and analysis to enhance measurement accuracy and validity.",

          "abstract": "Previous research indicates that readers may construct a location-invariant letter string representation before associating it with a lexical representation. In neural network modeling, this is achieved with a two-stack model in which a hidden layer first learns to map location-specific letter representations into word-centered positions. Then, another stack is trained to map them into lexical representations. However, the model has been validated only in one language (French). In this study, we replicated the model with a Finnish language corpus having substantially more resembling words (KISSAA, KISSAN, KISSAT) and with modern and accessible programming tools. To gain insight into the model’s coding principles, we also trained the model with random letter strings, analyzed the model’s hidden layer activation patterns, and conducted an error analysis. The results indicated that random letter string training leads to superior letter identity and position coding. However, the natural corpus with many close words leads to a more fine-grained mapping from word-centered letter string representations to lexical representations. Finally, bigram coding may emerge in weights connecting hidden to output nodes. We conclude that the one- or two-stack model seems a potent candidate for developing a universal and comprehensive connectionist model of reading.",

Chapter 4 argues for the primacy of cognition in divinatory practices, emphasizing the role of universal cognitive mechanisms and culturally specific worldviews in shaping their plausibility and persistence. Expanding on these ideas, Chapter 5 investigates the interplay between individual cognition and societal processes, highlighting socio-cultural factors such as the preferential reporting of successful outcomes that bolster divination’s perceived efficacy. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by summarizing the Element’s key arguments and identifying open questions for future research on the cognitive dimension of divination.",

          "abstract": "Disturbances of emotion are a core feature of psychological disorders generally, and of mood and anxiety disorders in particular. However, it remains unclear what specific patterns of affective disturbance are shared across different symptom domains. Here we examined correlations between emotional disorder symptom severity (anxiety, depression, hypomania, and anhedonia) and affective reactivity to gain and loss outcomes within a decision-making task with embedded sampling of emotional valence (Experiment 1: N = 329; preregistered replication in Experiment 2: N = 524). Using hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling of emotion self-reports, we found that greater affective reactivity to gains and losses within the task was associated with more severe symptoms of both anxiety and hypomania. This suggest that heightened reactivity to both appetitive and aversive outcomes indexes emotional disorder severity across multiple symptom domains of psychopathology, in line with theoretical frameworks that conceptualize affective disturbance as a generalized risk factor for psychopathology.",

In this systematic review, we examined different conceptualisations of curiosity—including stretching and embracing curiosity, state-trait curiosity, five-dimensional curiosity, and curiosity as a feeling of deprivation. This preregistered review includes 22 studies on wellbeing and mental health indicators in the context of curiosity. Our findings indicate that curiosity predominantly exhibits positive associations with wellbeing outcomes such as life satisfaction and positivism, and a negative association with depression indicators. Additionally, some types of curiosity revealed inconsistent associations with wellbeing, linking positively with mental health indicators and negatively with positive wellbeing measures. We discuss the research gaps, particularly the need to investigate the mixed impacts of different curiosity types and to develop more nuanced frameworks for future research on the relationship between curiosity and wellbeing.",

Although previous studies identified experimental conditions under which humans and non-human animals show increased variable decision-making, we have only a limited understanding of its underlying cognitive mechanisms. Using a reinforcement learning model, we simulate the use of three different theorized strategies in an adversarial reward learning environment that requires very high variability. Model simulations with a policy-gradient meta-learning algorithm show that agents could respond more optimally in such environments by (1) relying on a stochastic generator, (2) increasing one’s learning rate to allow for faster interactions between reinforcement learning and extinction, or (3) strategically upvalue unchosen actions using a frequency-based memory. After demonstrating the theoretical benefit of each of these strategies, we fitted our model on existing datasets of human-, pigeons- and rat behavior in adversarial environments. We show that, while all three species can engage in highly variable behavior, only humans strategically upvalue unchosen actions as a strategy to achieve variability.",

          "abstract": "Defense attorneys for autistic criminal defendants sometimes argue that difficulties inferring others’ intentions and motivations—often referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM)—considered to characterize autistic people render them vulnerable to exploitation. In this chapter we examine the empirical evidence for such claims. Current evidence derives primarily from studies of autistic and non-autistic adults’ responding in traditional deception detection paradigms and in several novel paradigms used to probe autistic adults’ ability to detect and respond adaptively to others’ criminal intent during interactions. This evidence does not support the perspective that autistic adults are inherently vulnerable to criminal exploitation, although it does indicate that ToM difficulties and low verbal ability are independent risk factors, regardless of autism diagnostic status. Although marked ToM difficulties are more prevalent in autistic adult samples, they are not ubiquitous, thereby highlighting the importance of basing legal defense arguments on measured rather than assumed ToM characteristics. Despite the recent emergence of methodologies for exploring criminal vulnerability, further significant empirical advances will likely depend on the development of paradigms which assess autistic adults’ ability to respond appropriately when confronted with problematic situations that capture the complexities of real-life interactions.",

Participants completed the TMT-VR using three interaction modes as follows: eye-tracking, head movement, and controller. Performance metrics included task completion time and accuracy. User experience, usability, and acceptability of TMT-VR were also examined. Results showed that both eye tracking and head movement modes significantly outperformed the controller in terms of task completion time and accuracy. No significant differences were found between eye tracking and head movement modes. Gaming skills did not significantly influence task performance using any interaction mode. The TMT-VR demonstrates high usability, acceptability, and user experience among participants.

Un total de 450 participants résidant en France et au Cameroun ont été invités à répondre à une question ouverte portant sur l’explication causale des contaminations, notamment les facteurs susceptibles de les empêcher ou de les favoriser. Les discours des participants ont fait l’objet d’une analyse thématique mixte (déductive et inductive). Les résultats de l'analyse déductive révèlent une proportion significativement plus élevée d'explications externes des contaminations (comportements inadaptés d’autrui, mesures gouvernementales inadéquates, manque de contrôle et laxisme dans l’application des mesures, environnement propice à la contamination) par rapport aux explications internes (non-respect des mesures barrières par soi, sous-estimation du risque pour soi). L'analyse inductive confirme cette tendance à privilégier les causes externes pour expliquer les contaminations, comparativement aux causes internes. Les explications externes sont prédominantes en tant que facteurs aussi bien favorisant qu’empêchant les contaminations. En outre, lorsque les participants identifient un facteur comme une cause de contamination, ils ont tendance à proposer une mesure de prévention ciblant cette cause. Ces résultats sont discutés à la lumière de l’approche de l’explication causale naïve de l’accident et de la théorie des systèmes de pensées. Ils suggèrent de prendre en compte le niveau d'implication personnelle des individus dans la conception des messages et des dispositifs transparents et cohérents avec les croyances causales de la population lors des campagnes de prévention.",

Although difficulty falling asleep and pre-sleep arousal is assumed to cause bedtime procrastination, the relationship has not been directly examined.

Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that included bedtime procrastination, difficulty falling asleep, and pre-sleep arousal measures. The random intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to test the hypothesis that difficulty falling asleep and pre-sleep arousal increased bedtime procrastination. \n\nResults: No significant cross-lagged path was observed from difficulty falling asleep to bedtime procrastination, and a significant positive path from pre-sleep arousal to bedtime procrastination was observed between Times 2 and 3.\n\nConclusion: Although difficulty falling asleep did not lead to bedtime procrastination, pre-sleep arousal partially led to bedtime procrastination. We examined the association between pre-sleep arousal and bedtime procrastination using a more rigorous method than that in previous studies, implying that decreasing pre-sleep arousal is effective in relieving bedtime procrastination.",

          "abstract": "The past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum theory methodologies and quantum-like modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena — such as order, conjunction, disjunction, and response replicability effects — there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach.\nIn this paper, we develop a quantum-like representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on {\\it generalized probability theory} (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework. Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect-observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments — a critical aspect of this model. This GPT-based approach successfully reproduces key quantum-like effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects (commonly associated with decision interference). Moreover, this framework supports quantum-like modeling in medical diagnostics for neurological conditions such as depression and epilepsy.\nWhile this paper focuses primarily on cognition and neuronal networks, the proposed formalism and methodology can be directly applied to a wide range of biological and social networks.",

Here, in a pre-registered study, we investigated how the reliability of an external resource (i.e., whether the information will be available when needed) affects young children’s use of it. In our tablet-based Shopping Game, children picked items from a store based on a shopping list. Importantly, the store and the list were not visible simultaneously, but children could toggle between them. In the reliable condition, the list was always available. In the unreliable condition, children were led to believe that the list might disappear. We found that 5-6-year-old children (N = 37) relied more on the list – referring back to it more often and more briefly, and remembering fewer items – when they perceived the list as reliably available (and vice versa, reducing trips to the list by studying it longer, and remembering more, when it was perceived as unreliably available). Nearly all children also identified the reliable condition as easier and preferred. In short, young children not only recognize the opportunity provided by reliably available external resources, but adapt their cognitive effort accordingly.",

This study acoustically examines the acquisition of emphatic consonants in Saudi-Hijazi-Arabic-speaking children aged 3 to 6 years. Children performed a real-word repetition task, after which consonantal and vocalic cues to the plain-emphatic contrast were measured. The results show that children produce both types of acoustic cues, with an age-related increase in the acoustic plain-emphatic contrast and an overall alignment with adult patterns. Larger acoustic contrasts were found in vowels preceding rather than following consonants in word-medial positions, with no evidence observed for a difference between word-initial and word-final positions. The plain-emphatic contrast was greater for stops than fricatives and larger for female than male children. These findings are discussed in relation to the development of coarticulated consonants.",

          "abstract": "Specific phobia (SP) is a prevalent mental disorder. Exposure-based treatments are the most effective therapy. Surprisingly, little is known about the intrinsic functional connectivity of SP and its modification by treatment, possibly due to a strong focus on a presumed fear network. Hypothesis-driven a priori selection of brain regions does not allow the full extent of potential changes in SP and the modulating effects of therapy to be captured. Therefore, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with hypothesis-free, data-driven functional connectivity multivariate pattern analysis (fc-MVPA), which takes into account the entire functional connectome, to identify differences between N=72 individuals with SP and a non-phobic control group (CG, N=82). The SP group then received a one-session exposure treatment and was scanned again after 16 weeks.\nFc-MVPA showed the largest differences between SP and CG in somatomotor regions with higher connectivity to temporal nodes of the default network and anti-correlations to the frontoparietal network. Stronger connectivity values in the pre- compared to the post-treatment condition was evident in visual regions. while anti-correlations to the frontoparietal network were reduced. Post-hoc comparisons showed that the connectivity patterns of the SP after treatment between almost all identified nodes of both contrasts ('SP vs. CG' and 'pre vs. post') were comparable to those of the control group. Given the known functions of the identified networks, the results suggest that exposure treatment may improve the control of perceptual and action regions, leading to better environmental prediction of mentally constructed scenes and improved action control.",

          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on a defendant’s psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility - including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Mental health professionals’ approach to settled insanity cases will map well onto the relevant body of clinical psychological science. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, M_age=37.66, M_experience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often use circular reasoning to disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and unnecessarily complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

This paper considers whether the root of the problem is simply that we have been looking for the wrong thing. \n\nIn contrast to most theories of the mind and consciousness, the B-Man Stra/Tac model proposes that consciousness has a very limited functional scope, a conclusion consistent with the Orch OR theory of consciousness. This limited scope opens the possibility that consciousness could be implemented within a single cell. A cell that has been highly adapted for consciousness by millions of years of evolution.\n\nThis paper firstly considers the current search for the neural correlates of consciousness and identifies weaknesses in the approach; secondly looks at the argument for a single cell consciousness; and finally defines indicators that may lead to its discovery.\n\nThe localization of a single cell in the brain would of course be a difficult task, however the brain structures supporting that cell may be readily identifiable. It is interesting to consider that such structures may have already been found by neurologists, but their significance overlooked, and that following the ideas given in this paper the neural correlates of consciousness could be finally located.",

          "abstract": "Preregistration is the act of formally documenting a research plan before collecting (or at least before analysing) the data. It allows those reading a final research report to know which aspects of a study were decided before sight of the data, and which were added later. This enables informed evaluation of the severity with which scientific claims have been tested. We, as the British Neuropsychological Society Open Science Group, conducted a survey to explore awareness and adoption of open science practices within our field. Neuropsychology involves the study of relatively rare or hard-to-access participants, creating practical challenges that, according to our survey, are perceived as barriers to preregistration. We survey the available routes to preregistration, and suggest that the barriers are all surmountable in one way or another. However, there is a tension, in that higher levels of bias control require greater restriction over the flexibility of preregistered studies, but such flexibility is often essential for neuropsychological research. Researchers must therefore consider which route provides the right balance of rigour and pragmatic flexibility to render a preregistered project viable for them. By mapping out the issues and potential solutions, and by signposting relevant resources and publication routes, we hope to facilitate well-reasoned decision-making and empower neuropsychologists to enhance the transparency and rigour of their research.",

          "abstract": "The interleaving effect refers to the finding that repeatedly switching between categories during study or practice enhances learning relative to focusing on only one category at a time. Two studies investigated whether this effect is moderated by individual differences in fluid intelligence (gF), episodic memory (EM) ability, and/or working memory capacity (WMC). In Study 1 (undergraduate students) and Study 2 (adult online participants), higher gF scores were associated with larger interleaving effects for perceptual categories (artists’ painting styles). Additionally, higher EM ability was associated with larger interleaving effects for perceptual categories in Study 1, whereas an analogous pattern was observed for WMC in Study 2. There were no indications that the investigated cognitive abilities moderated the interleaving effect for text-based categories (psychological disorders). Overall, these findings suggest that higher-ability learners benefit especially from interleaving in the case of perceptual category learning, with attendant theoretical and pedagogical implications.",

          "abstract": "The adaptive staircase method, frequently employed in tasks like the Stop-Signal Task (SST), dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on participant performance. We introduce Staircase Segment Length (SSL) as a metric to quantify participant adaptability, measuring the consecutive stop trials during which the Stop-Signal Delay (SSD) remains stable. Short SSLs may reflect quick adaptability and stable performance, while longer SSLs could indicate slower adjustments, potentially linked to cognitive fatigue or fluctuations in engagement. Developed in the context of response inhibition, SSL may also serve as a complementary metric to accuracy or fatigue in various adaptive tasks utilizing staircase methods, offering insights into participant dynamics.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the role of domain-general cognitive processes, specifically inhibitory\ncontrol, verbal working memory (WM), and nonverbal reasoning, on children’s productive\ngrammar skills, focusing on Turkish past tense (e.g., fırçala-DI brush-PAST.3sg) and causative\nsuffix (e.g., fırçala-t-TI brush-CAUSE.3sg), representing the broader categories of inflectional\nversus derivational morphology, respectively. We tested 84 5-year-old Turkish-learning children\nfrom a densely populated district in Istanbul, Türkiye on a sentence completion task to assess the\nuse of morphology. Children were more successful in producing the correct suffix for the past\ntense than causative suffix, when using both familiar and pseudo verbs. Zero-order correlations\nshowed significant relations between correct suffix use and all cognitive assessments. However,\nregression analyses revealed that only nonverbal reasoning predicted children’s overall correct\nsuffix use and inhibition predicted it only for the past tense with pseudo verbs. Hence, children\nwho have better reasoning abilities may have more robustly abstracted the grammar rules of their\nnative language. Children with better inhibitory control can more effectively suppress the primed\npresent tense verb and correctly use the past tense. This ability is particularly evident when\ndealing with pseudo verbs, which make the task more abstract. These findings imply the\nconsideration of domain-general cognition in the development of abstract grammar in childhood.",

          "abstract": "The cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) model is a version of the classic cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). The CLPN can be used to model a large number of cross-lagged effects between nodes (such as symptoms of ill health) across two waves of measurement. In spite of a robust debate about the pitfalls of using correlational data to infer causality, researchers using the CLPN often interpret findings in causal terms. We show with simulations that CLPN can indicate cross-lagged effects even if data have been generated without any direct effects between nodes/symptoms. Hence, findings from CLPN:s may be spurious and should not be interpreted in causal terms if used to model non-experimental data. We have previously proposed a method of triangulation to scrutinize findings from the CLPM. Triangulation can also be used to reduce the false-positive risk when using the CLPN. We show by reanalysis of data from a previous study how triangulation can be applied, finding that positive cross-lagged effects between some symptoms of depression and anxiety probably were spurious, rather than due to genuine increasing effects, as alternative models indicated simultaneous and paradoxical increasing and decreasing effects.",

Mindfulness-based real-time fMRI neurofeedback (mbNF), which guides mindfulness practice with feedback to train the downregulation of the default mode network (DMN), is an intervention targeting such negative self-referential thoughts. This study builds on a registered NIMH-supported trial testing the optimal dosing of mbNF on downregulating DMN activation among depressed adolescents. Adolescents (N=90), ages 13-18-years-old, with major depressive disorder will be randomized to receive either a 15- or 30-minute mbNF session. Before and after mbNF, participants will complete a self-referential encoding fMRI task, wherein they categorize whether trait adjectives describe themselves or a friend. It is hypothesized that a 30-minute versus 15-minute mbNF dose will relate to: (1) larger decreases in behavioral negative self-referential biases and (2) larger decreases in DMN activation during self-referential processing.",

          "abstract": "Background: Stressful life events (SLEs) are associated with increased risk of depression or anxiety. Coping mechanisms may moderate this relationship but little is known on this topic in young people or in Latin America. \n\nAim: To investigate whether coping strategies predict odds of depression and/or anxiety and moderate the relationship between SLEs and depression and/or anxiety in young people in Peru, Lima, and Bogotá. \n\nMethod: Using case-control data from people aged 15-24, we used logistic regression to examine associations between coping mechanism, SLEs, and caseness for depression or anxiety, adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. We included interaction terms to model whether this association varied depending on coping mechanisms (positive cognitive restructuring, problem-focused, support-seeking, distraction, avoidant). \n\nResults: We included 1437 cases and 965 controls. Cases reported less use of positive cognitive restructuring (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.57-0.75) and problem-focused coping (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.93), and more use of avoidance than controls (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.19-1.50) in adjusted models. They had greater odds of reporting lifetime (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04-1.10) and past-year (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.10) SLEs than controls. We found weak, but consistent evidence of effect modification; the association between lifetime SLEs and case-control status was stronger in those who used less support-seeking (p=.09), problem-focused coping (p=.08), or positive cognitive restructuring (p=.09). \n\nConclusions: Relationships between SLEs, coping mechanisms and depression/anxiety appear similar in these Latin American cities to other contexts. Active coping strategies may ameliorate the impact of SLEs on mental health of young people.",

          "abstract": "Three preregistered cross-cultural studies (N=6049 across India, Singapore, and the United States) tested how belief in karma shapes victim blaming and helping. Study 1 found that belief in karmic causality positively predicts a variety of system-justifying beliefs that legitimate social inequalities, but experimental reminders of karma also encouraged generosity towards others experiencing financial hardship.  Studies 2-3 tested whether karma framing had different effects on generosity towards different recipients, who varied in their level of need and reason for need. Thinking about karma changed the importance of recipient characteristics, with need being less predictive and external attributions more predictive of giving when thinking about karma. Overall, experimental reminders of karma only reliably increased generosity towards recipients whose financial need was no fault of their own, showing that karmic beliefs draw attention to the reasons for people’s bad fortune, and evoke responses to misfortune that are sensitive to naturalistic explanations.",

          "abstract": "In this examination of gender differences in financial expectations in academia, we used survey data (N = 11,315 scientists and scholars, 19 academic disciplines) integrated with individual-level bibliometric and demographic data from Scopus. We studied what Polish scientists and scholars with various demographic characteristics, academic attitudes, and bibliometric profiles considered their dream salary. Top dreamers were defined as the upper 10% of scientists in terms of self-reported level of their dream salary. Gender differences are much weaker than expected: Women generally tend to have almost equal dream salaries compared to men across age groups, academic positions, and disciplines. Although men are 56% overrepresented in the group of top dreamers, their financial expectations are similar compared to women. Among top dreamers, the median dream salary for men is only 5% higher than the median dream salary for women. Across all STEM disciplines combined, men on average expect salaries 19% higher than women (in non-STEM 15%, and in MED only 11%). Strongly research-oriented men expect higher median salaries than strongly research-oriented women; male top performers (the upper 10%) expect higher salaries than female top performers; and male internationalists in research expect higher salaries than female internationalists. Finally, as logistic regression shows, men with a strong research orientation, working in STEM disciplines, and with strong international research collaborations are most likely to be top dreamers.",

The review highlights current applications of AI in several journalistic areas, including content creation, audience engagement, and misinformation detection, whilst underscoring the ethical implications of AI. It identifies a notable scarcity of quantitative research and calls for a balanced methodological approach that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative methods, including large-scale surveys and qualitative techniques. Furthermore, the study highlights the lack of empirical research on AI regulation in journalism, advocating for studies that examine the value of regulatory frameworks for media ethics and journalism practice.

          "authors": "Nicolai T. Borgen; Henrik Daae Zachrisson; Astrid Marie Jorde Sandsør",
          "abstract": "Whether schools perpetuate or mitigate social inequality has been debated for decades. However, one crucial aspect that has remained unexplored is whether and to what extent inequalities manifest differently across schools. Using administrative data from Norway, our study uncovers that the link between parental income and academic achievement in 8th grade varies considerably across schools. In some schools, achievement gaps are more than twice as large as in others. This highlights that schools do not function as uniform entities; rather, some may exacerbate inequalities while others may play a more compensatory role. In fact, in some successful schools, family-level risk factors remain largely unmanifested. While the achievement gap variability is largely unrelated to the socioeconomic composition of schools, lower-quality schools tend to have a stronger income-achievement association than those of higher quality. Overall, our findings emphasize the necessity of a nuanced understanding of how inequalities manifest across diverse school contexts to fully grasp the role of schooling in social inequality and to devise effective strategies for reducing disparities.",

Systematic data were collected from the English language edition of Wikipedia’s “recent deaths” notices from January 2001 to December 2020 (N = 95,400). Statistical analyses performed on this dataset revealed several structures of inequality shaping the online encyclopedia’s section of “notable deaths”. The results indicate, first, a Western cultural hegemony in terms of the nationality of those whose deaths are remembered in Wikipedia’s necrology section. Second, the paper documented a prevailing hegemonic masculinity epitomized in a stark gender differential. Third, the paper examined the social gradient theory of mortality by comparing the life expectancy of Wikipedia’s notable deceased with the general population and found empirical support for this hypothesis only in non-Western countries characterized by lower levels of income.",

          "authors": "Mana Mohebbian",
          "abstract": "This report investigates the feasibility of developing a holistic indicator to assess and communicate the social sustainability and quality of life in Vancouver. Despite the availability of various specific metrics, there is a noted absence of a comprehensive framework that integrates these metrics to provide a singular, actionable view of the city's progress towards its social sustainability goals. The City of Vancouver currently employs 45 population-level indicators under its Healthy City Strategy, demonstrating the city's commitment to transparent and data-driven governance. However, these indicators, while effective individually, do not collectively provide a complete picture of the city's overall\nhealth across various dimensions such as public health, housing, education, and environmental sustainability. The aim of this research was to identify a holistic indicator that encompasses multiple dimensions of social sustainability to simplify assessments and improve strategic planning. Through a desktop review of 70 existing indicators and consultations with experts, two models were identified as particularly promising: the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure, and the City of Calgary's Equity Index (CEI). These models offer robust frameworks that prioritize equity, accessibility, and stakeholder involvement, aligning closely with Vancouver's urban development goals. This executive summary highlights the need for an overarching metric that reflects the interdependencies among various domains, ensuring that progress in one area does not undermine another. By leveraging insights from this research, Vancouver can enhance its policy implementation and community engagement, moving closer to achieving a balanced and sustainable urban environment. The proposed holistic indicator will also support the city in benchmarking against other urban centers and refining its strategic initiatives based on quantifiable metrics.",

          "authors": "Bela Janky",
          "abstract": "Since the mid-2010s, public discourse in Hungary has undergone significant changes, characterized by a shift in focus toward issues less relevant to voters’ daily lives and increased polarization of public attitudes along political lines. This paper explores the role of partisan identity in shaping attitude polarisation. It posits that, beyond material interests or stable moral values, partisan identity independently influences social attitudes. Using a series of survey experiments conducted between 2016 and 2018, the effect of the salience of political conflict on attitudes about politically salient issues, such as immigration policy and the regulation of foreign-funded NGOs is investigated. Results indicate that partisan identity independently contributes to the polarisation of attitudes, with respondents exposed to certain politicized issues aligning their views more closely with stereotypical partisan positions on other issues. The paper critiques existing experimental paradigms in political behavior research and highlights the importance of incorporating social psychological approaches to understand the interplay between partisan identity and public opinion formation.",

          "abstract": "Increasing media attention has led to greater support for queer and transgender people, but this attention has also led to scrutiny and some backlash against these identities. In this paper, I provide a simple analysis of one medium of social discourse: published books. Using a scrape of the website Goodreads, I examine some key metrics relating to the presence and popularity of books, with a focus on books about transgender people. I scraped the Goodreads page for over 1.6 million books, resulting in 263,597 records that were complete and had some user engagement. Of these, 343 related to transgender people. Books about transgender people were overwhelmingly positive and supportive of trans identities. According to automated classification by a large language model, the 343 books about transgender people were divided into 285 positive books and only 8 negative books (50 could not be classified). Books that were positive about transgender people received more user reviews and stronger average ratings than negative books. Overall, there were 170 times more user reviews of positive transgender books than there were about negative transgender books, which might suggest that Goodreads users are far more likely to interact with supportive books than skeptical or dismissive books about transgender people.",

This paper critically examines current lifelong learning (LLL) frameworks as articulated in policy documents from international organizations, identifying a disproportionate focus on environmental adaptation in the Global South and a technocentric emphasis in the Global North. To address these shortcomings, the paper turns to an alternative model of LLL: Japan’s food education program, which emphasizes shifting mindsets and behaviors as a strategy to confront environmental challenges in the Global North. While we do not propose Japan’s food education program as a universal solution, it serves as a valuable reference point for reimagining mainstream LLL frameworks.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Julia Hellstrand; Jessica Nisén; Mikko Myrskylä",
          "abstract": "In the Nordic countries, the total fertility rate (TFR) fell sharply in the 2010s, and increasing disparities in childbearing outcomes across different levels and fields of education have been documented in previous research. However, the role of economic uncertainty in shaping these fertility trends is not well understood. This study examines the male fertility decline in Finland during the 2010s, focusing on how fertility levels and trends vary by field of education and the economic uncertainty associated with these fields. Using full population register data, the analysis explores total fertility rates (TFR) and the expected shares of men having a first birth (TFRp1) across 122 detailed education groups. We find that fertility declines were stronger in fields with initially lower fertility levels, such as ICT, arts, and humanities, and weaker in fields like health, teaching, and agriculture. Weighted linear regression was used to analyse the association between characteristics reflecting uncertainty and the fertility decline. Fields with higher unemployment, lower income, and lower occupational match saw sharper fertility declines. Additionally, as unemployment decreased and income grew during the 2010s, fertility declines were less pronounced in fields that experienced stronger improvements in these areas. The predictive power of the uncertainty variables increased in the 2010s. The uncertainty model accounted for approximately half of the TFR decline and two-thirds of the TFRp1 decline across different fields. The study highlights the growing disparities in fertility patterns by educational field, underlining the increasing importance of economic security in shaping men’s fertility.",

          "abstract": "This study examines biologists leaving science in 38 OECD countries in the past two decades. We use publication metadata from a global bibliometric database (raw Scopus data at the micro-level of individual scientists). In a cohort-based and longitudinal fashion, we follow individual men and women scientists over time, from their first to their last publication (N=86,178). We examine four academic disciplines: AGRI (agricultural and biological sciences), BIO (biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology), IMMU (immunology and microbiology), and NEURO (neuroscience). We apply survival analysis, conceptualizing scientific life as a sequence of scholarly publishing events. Our Kaplan–Meier survival analysis shows how women disappear from science: in BIO, about 60% are still in science after 5 years, 40% after 10 years, and only 20% by the end of the period examined (i.e., after 19 years). The percentages are substantially higher for men: approximately 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier estimations indicate that women in the largest discipline (BIO) are 23.26% more likely to leave science after 10 years and 39.74% more likely to leave science at the end of the study period. Gender difference in attrition, slightly visible after 5 years, increase consistently in later career stages. The probability of surviving for women after 15 years varies considerably, from 47.8% in AGRI to 27.6% in IMMU; for men, the probability is about a fifth higher. Our data show that with the passage of time, women disappear from science in ever-larger proportions compared to men. Gender differences in attrition in the four disciplines have been and continue to be high, but comparing the 2000 and 2010 cohorts, have slightly decreased over time.",

The workshop was held in Trondheim on November 4-5, 2023 and involved 17 citizens from mid Norway. The good life was the broad theme, and we invited the participants to consider the themes of sustainable health and society within this frame. \nThe participants developed 4 different visions for a sustainable healthy future for Norway. We gave them a mid-term horizon (2070) to leave room for needs- and aspirations-based social imagination, not overly conditioned by the current institutional framework, and to challenge the short-termism of the dominant policy cycles and thinking.\nThe visions developed by the citizens are remarkably consistent in emphasizing the importance of good social integration and community life, interpersonal relations, individual development and an individual’s sense of meaning, contribution, and agency. Noteworthy is also their emphasis on the need to regulate new technologies, and to reduce information overload and unsustainable choices through trusted and transparent governance.\nThe report provides a discussion of the visions, the full text of the 4 visions and a concise background about the method and the project of which the workshop was part. The Sustainable Healthy Futures pilot was a collaboration between the Norwegian centre for responsible research and Innovation (AFINO) and NTNU Health. The main aim of the project was to rethink health in society in the attempt to imagine innovative and sustainable approaches to health in the future.",

          "authors": "Bela Janky",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a new modeling framework for the structural explanations of moral action. The framework relies on the approach of the new sociology of morality (Hitlin &amp; Vaisey 2010, 2013, Simpson &amp; Willer 2015) and uses game theory as an analytical tool (c.f. Binmore 1998, 2005, 2010, Gintis 2009, 2016, Guala 2016, Kandori 1992, Vaisey &amp; Valentino 2018). The key contribution of this approach to game theoretical analyses is related to the thesis of intersituationality (Abend 2011, Tavory 2011), according to which no moral dilemma can be investigated in isolation from the system of social life. We propose to reframe moral games in order to incorporate intersituationality. \nThe adoption of this sociological approach helps to solve puzzles that have inhibited the development of a comprehensive structural explanation of moral action in moral games. Moreover, by solving those puzzles, this approach opens up new opportunities for applying game theory to the study of such moral orders that foster injustice – an issue that is central to current sociological discourse but has attracted much less attention in game theoretical research.",

          "title": "Bringing Culture Back:  Laying the Ground for A New Social Theory",
          "authors": "Bela Janky",
          "abstract": "The starting premise of the following review essay is that recent research in cultural evolutionary theory has laid the ground for a new paradigm in social theory. The aim of the paper is to briefly present the basic tenets of this new paradigm, based on some recent monographs and other related publications. Followers of this new paradigm posit that cultural evolution has been dominated biological adaptations and individual rational optimisation in shaping individual behaviour and social structure throughout human history. This review first briefly outlines what economic theory and evolutionary psychology, perhaps the two most influential theoretical paradigms of the study of human behaviour in recent decades, think about human nature. Then it discusses recent empirical evidence related to the assumptions of these two paradigms, and offers an introduction to the basic tenets of the culture-based social theory currently under construction. The study also presents some specific conclusions of the new paradigm that could be relevant for the interpretation of contemporary social problems, and discusses a few points of concern, related to agency, direction of evolution and role of rationality in cultural changes.",

          "title": "The Bad Law as an obstacle to antitrust enforcement in Argentina (and Latin America?)",
          "authors": "Adriano Diaz",
          "abstract": "This article examines the phenomenon of \"Bad Law\" (\"Mal Derecho\") within Argentina's legal tradition, where laws are crafted based on idealistic conceptions of what the legal framework ought to be but lack the practical mechanisms necessary for effective enforcement. This disconnect between a law's design and its implementation fosters a dysfunctional legal system and widespread non-compliance. Rather than addressing the structural flaws within these laws, legal scholars often invoke the “Protective Hypothesis of Bad Law,” attributing non-compliance to a moral failure of the populace instead of recognizing the inherent deficiencies in the legal framework.\nThis issue is starkly illustrated by Law 27,442 on Antitrust. Although ostensibly designed to promote competition and prevent market distortions, the law suffers from critical design flaws that render enforcement—both public and private—ineffective. Public enforcement is undermined by a lack of political incentives to establish the necessary enforcement authority, a shortcoming embedded within the law itself. Meanwhile, private enforcement remains largely theoretical, as potential plaintiffs are discouraged by the prohibitive complexity and costs of litigation.\nAs a result, Argentina's competition law fails to achieve its intended objectives, leaving the country’s antitrust system largely ineffective and illusory.",

This article, grounded in extensive data collection, systematization, and analysis, explores the dynamics of this power and influence. It examines the economic and political value of companies in the sector, the conflicts between corporations and nations, the geopolitical role of the sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its capacity to shape domestic policies through intensive lobbying, financial contributions to lawmakers, and interactions with regulatory and oversight bodies.",

          "authors": "",
          "abstract": "Do the social networks of complex large-scale societies share fundamental structural and mathematical properties with the networks of small-scale societies? Can they also best be characterized as discrete, hierarchical, self-similar social networks? There is growing empirical evidence that the generic nature of human social organization may be described in terms of these complex social networks. This emergent form of human social organization has been documented in a wide array of human societies ranging from foraging groups to the urban and sociopolitical organization of the first states and empires. This paper contributes to this growing literature by using Horton--Strahler scaling and spectral analysis to demonstrate the complex structure of large-scale societies using the Coalescent Communities Database 2.0 and Seshat: Global History Databank. The analysis finds a discrete hierarchy of community sizes that approaches the well-known series 15, 50, 150, 500, 1500 and a scaling ratio of between 3 and 4. These properties of complex large-scale societies are remarkably consistent with previous empirical studies of small-scale societies. I suggest that these patterns can be understood in terms of a general recursive process that is responsible for the formation of increasingly larger-scale societies and the cognitive limitations inherent to human nature.",

          "abstract": "Heatwaves pose a growing global threat, yet little is known about how people adapt their daily activities to cope with extreme heat—an obstacle to effective policy design. This study characterizes heatwave adaptation internationally, combining ERA5 climate re-analysis, cell phone mobility, socio-economic, and physical-geographical data across Brazil, France, India, Nigeria, Turkey, the USA, and China during 2022/2023 summer heatwaves. Google Community Mobility Reports data is used in multi-level modelling for the first six countries to examine daily activity changes during heatwaves (home, work, transit, grocery/pharmacy, retail/recreation, parks). In China, Baidu data on intra-city activity levels is analyzed in a complementary multi-level model. The results show a widespread tendency to withdraw into homes but also highlight unequal substitutions of activities, and – under some circumstances – visits to potentially cooler locations away from home. This study highlights the global nature of heatwave adaptation and the value of considering adaptation alongside people’s everyday lives.",

          "title": "Measuring Norm Strength and Erosion in International Politics",
          "authors": "Anton Peez",
          "abstract": "This chapter reviews past and ongoing debates about how to measure the strength and erosion of norms in international politics. The operationalization and measurement of norm strength have long challenged norms researchers. However, contemporary conceptual and methodological work has achieved notable breakthroughs and emerging common understandings around these measurement issues. First, the chapter summarizes four longstanding challenges in measuring norm strength: differing levels of analysis, tautology, cross-case comparison, and the static nature of many potential measures contrasted with the dynamic nature of norms. It then outlines the emerging common approach of combining measures of rhetoric and practice relating to norm strength. Different traditions of empirical norms research study these dimensions of norm strength at the individual level, state level, or across the entire international system. The chapter combines these levels and actors on the one hand with rhetorical and practical dimensions on the other in a matrix for generating ideas about possible avenues for empirical research designs on norm strength. It concludes by summarizing which recent methodological innovations may be particularly promising for advancing our empirical insights on norm strength and erosion.",
