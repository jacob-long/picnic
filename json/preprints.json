          "title": "Examining Externalization as an Approach for Eating Disorder Recovery: A Qualitative Study of Self-Reported Experiences with Intrapersonal Dialogue",
          "authors": "Michelle Cowan",
          "abstract": "A narrative therapy technique, externalization involves personifying an illness, condition, or part of the self and dialoguing with it as if it were another person. Externalization is used to separate the person in therapy from the problems they are experiencing through the careful use of language and dialogue. This article examines the use of externalization as a tool for eating disorder recovery among a sample of 10 study participants whose recorded responses and interviews were coded as part of a larger discourse analysis related to personal definitions of recovery. Although externalization worked well for some participants, most had either stopped practicing externalization completely or had integrated the externalized eating disorder persona back into their concept of self. This research illuminates the complex and varied experiences people have with intrapersonal communication and emphasizes the care that must be taken when investigating the use of internal dialogue as a tool for dealing with mental illness.",

          "title": "AI Cannot Be Reproduced: Medical AI Needs a Culture of Logging, Not Reruns",
          "authors": "Kenjiro Shiraishi",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), including generative AI, are rapidly being adopted for tasks ranging from manuscript drafting to clinical decision support. Yet the evaluation and governance of these systems still rely heavily on a traditional notion of “reproducibility”: if one runs the same procedure under the same conditions, one should obtain the same result. For probabilistic and highly environment-dependent LLMs, bit-identical reruns are neither realistic nor especially useful.\nDrawing on OpenAI’s work on weight-sparse transformers and recent proposals such as MedLog for event-level clinical AI logging, this article argues that medical AI—particularly AI-assisted writing and explanation—should shift its primary evaluative target from strict reproducibility to auditability. In practice, this means designing layered “log cultures” that record how systems were used, with appropriate granularity for different levels of risk. Even if future models achieve substantially higher technical reproducibility, meaningful verification of individual outputs will still depend on access to their provenance: what model, in which version, was run with what inputs and settings, under whose oversight. Journals such as NEJM AI are well positioned to move from merely asking, “Was AI used?” to setting concrete expectations about what must be logged, retained, and, where appropriate, shared. Such standards would guide clinicians, institutions, vendors, and payers in building log practices that make AI use contestable rather than opaque.",

          "authors": "Liz Allen; Veronique Kiermer; Simon Porter; Ruth Wittham",
          "abstract": "The Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) was introduced in 2015 to improve transparency, accountability, and recognition in scholarly authorship by standardizing the description of contributor roles. This study aims to provide the first comprehensive retrospective system-wide analysis of global adoption of CRediT. A key challenge is that while support for CRediT has grown organically, among authors and publishers, implementation has been inconsistent across publishers, making systematic data collection difficult. To overcome this challenge, we used the Dimensions database and applied a multi-stage text-extraction method. Our analysis identified more than 3.2 million roles articles, preprints and conference papers including CRediT, from 2015 to 2024. Our results show accelerating adoption, with CRediT appearing in 22.5% of all 2024 publications with available full text. All 14 CRediT roles are now widely used, with notable growth in roles reflecting evolving research practices such as Software and Data Curation. Adoption spans disciplines and geographies, dominated by STEM but expanding into social sciences, and are strongly shaped by publisher policies, system integrations and disciplinary focus. We discuss the drivers of CRediT’s organic expansion, its role in strengthening research integrity and assessment, and the need for coordinated governance and infrastructure support as the taxonomy enters its next decade. Updates and standards of implementations will be important to ensure that CRediT remains relevant and valuable for its multiple use cases and aligned with how research itself is evolving.",

          "authors": "Agata Czech; Noam Tal-Perry; Becky Ioppolo; Steven Wooding",
          "abstract": "A diverse body of empirical research has produced mixed findings on gender disparities in research funding. Only a few of these studies effectively control for the structural factors of discipline and seniority of applicants. We have conducted the first institution-wide analysis of grant applications using high-resolution administrative data to understand gender-based disparities in funding outcomes. We included 18,583 applications submitted between 2015 and 2023 and assessed whether women applied for grants at different rates, requested different amounts, or had different success rates. After adjusting for seniority and disciplinary area, we found no evidence of consistent gender disparities in application rate. Historical gender disparities in application size in favour of men were observed but did not persist. Weak evidence for gender disparities in success rate was observed in favour of women, which disappeared after controlling for application size. However, when examining individual disciplines and seniorities, gender disparities in both directions were observed for rate, size and success. These findings highlight the importance of separating structural and individual factors in understanding funding disparities to allow for effective interventions; the value of institutional administrative data in allowing this type of analysis; and highlight the role of structural (career stage and disciplinary) disparities in the gender disparities seen in scientific research.",

          "abstract": "Implementation science aims to bridge the gap between research evidence and routine healthcare practice by understanding and optimizing the integration of evidence-based interventions (EBIs). In this paper, we identify seven persistent challenges limiting implementation progress, including (1) overwhelming volume of implementation materials (e.g., reports, interviews, surveys), (2) contextual variability, (3) complex interactions among contextual factors, interventions, and outcomes, (4) stakeholder engagement constraints, (5) equity and access barriers, (6) insufficient or biased data, and (7) concerns around data security, trust, and ethics. We explore how advances in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising solutions to these challenges by enhancing evidence extraction and synthesis, contextual analysis, stakeholder engagement, and adaptation throughout the implementation process. Using a live project in precision oncology as a practical example, we demonstrate how AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs), clustering algorithms, and sentiment analysis, can support implementation research and practice, from concept (e.g., barriers, facilitators, strategies) extraction and barrier identification to process mapping. We also introduce ImpleMATE, an AI-enabled platform that integrates implementation science knowledge with dynamic learning health system workflows, enabling continuous knowledge extraction, decision support, and feedback for implementation improvement. While AI offers significant potential to accelerate and scale implementation efforts, we emphasize the need for ethical oversight, transparency, and human collaboration to ensure responsible, equitable, and impactful application in practice.",

          "abstract": "The replication crisis reveals pervasive methodological weaknesses, with replication failure rates exceeding 60% in psychology and preclinical biology. While preregistration improves transparency, it lacks technical enforcement and quantitative assessment of rigor. ECLIPSE v2.0 introduces a computational framework that enforces falsification integrity through cryptographic data splitting, single-shot validation, and automated auditing.\n\nThe framework integrates five sequential stages: (1) irreversible data partitioning with SHA-256 verification; (2) binding preregistration of falsification criteria; (3) cross-validated model development; (4) single-shot holdout testing; and (5) automatic integrity assessment. Three quantitative tools were developed: the Eclipse Integrity Score (EIS) measuring methodological rigor; the Statistical Test for Data Snooping (STDS) detecting performance inflation; and an Automated Code Auditor using multi-level static analysis to identify protocol violations.\n\nAcross four validation studies, ECLIPSE achieved: (1) strong discrimination between honest and p-hacked studies (Cohen’s d = 3.54, AUC = 0.991); (2) 89% sensitivity for detecting 15% performance inflation; (3) auditor accuracy F1 = 0.908; and (4) prediction of replication success in 73 published studies (ρ = 0.68), outperforming impact factor and sample size.\n\nECLIPSE provides the first quantitative, enforceable, and scalable methodology for ensuring research integrity through prevention, detection, and assessment.

          "abstract": "High dimensional omics, longitudinal clinical data, and surveillance streams are now routine in translational research, yet reproducibility and governance often lag behind. We present a framework developed at Institut Pasteur that makes analysis auditable, portable, and privacy preserving. It couples containerised Nextflow/Snakemake pipelines for bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, proteomics and metabolomics with rigorous quality control, ComBat batch harmonisation that preserves biological covariates, and a biostatistics layer (generalised linear and mixed effects models, Cox survival, hierarchical components) with explicit false discovery rate control. An epidemiology module computes vaccine effectiveness (VE), attack rates, effective reproduction number Rt, and case control odds ratios with robust intervals. Metadata follow FAIR principles and map to HL7 FHIR resources; identifiers are pseudonymised under role based access control. On synthetic exemplars shaped by real cohort constraints, we report concrete outcomes: batch attributable variance drops from 18.7% to 3.9%, differential expression signals remain stable, a LASSO gene expression signature achieves outer fold ROC AUC 0.81 ± 0.02 with calibration slope 0.98 and intercept 0.01, VE rises from 0.63 to 0.79 as Rt falls from 1.14 to 0.89, and covariate imbalance (median SMD) reduces from 0.21 to 0.06 after matching. End to end runs reproduce byte identically across laptops and HPC under Docker. The framework is a conservative baseline for clinical bioinformatics and methods teaching, not a medical device.",

          "abstract": "Crediting of research contributions is critical for career advancement and the allocation of research funding. However, some research contributors are mentioned only in an acknowledgments section, which results in relatively little recognition, because acknowledged contributions are not indexed by scholarly databases. Here, we contextualize this shortfall in terms of the broader contributorship movement to recognize specific research contributions rather than relying on the broad, vague, and sometimes restrictive concept of academic authorship. After reviewing three routes that advance contributorship, we focus on enhancing the function and usefulness of acknowledgments sections, proposing that: 1) when acknowledging individuals, authors include their ORCID numbers (subject to the acknowledgees’ approval); 2) publishers solicit identities of acknowledgees in a similar way to how they do so for authors in their submission portals; and 3) publishers include metadata (e.g. full names, ORCID, roles) of acknowledgees in JATS-XML files. Implementing any of these steps could lead some scholarly databases to index non-author contributors. The ensuing increase in visibility for research contributors such as technicians and library professionals should result in greater recognition of their roles, including by those who allocate resources.",

          "abstract": "Researchers face incentives to write up their empirical findings in a way that maximizes publication success. We analyze the language of journal articles and its association with statistical significance to explore questionable research practices at the stage of writing up articles, using 140,606 articles from health, biology, psychology, economics, and multidisciplinary journals over 32 years. For most disciplines, a higher share of non-significant main findings is associated with more hedging and negative striking words, fewer positive striking words, and fewer superlatives. We neither find evidence that authors upsell ambiguous results using sensational language nor that ambiguous results are written up less readably. Contrarily, articles with a higher share of statistically significant main findings are written up more sensationally. We find that emphasis on (marginal) statistical significance increases with the share of non-significant main findings, reflecting a dichotomized interpretation of p-values based on arbitrary thresholds. Particularly, p-excuses give the impression of statistical significance when the finding is actually not significant, consistent with the notion of 'spin'. This study provides empirical insights that might help researchers to self-reflect on writing up empirical findings. More training and fewer incentives to sell findings using sensational language and spin can help to improve academic writing.",

The goal is to assess the robustness of the original results by exploring how they vary across different analysis choices. However, the proposal does not distinguish between SRRs planned before versus after analysts have seen the data. This distinction is crucial because data-dependent analyses introduce a risk of bias from selective reporting. In this commentary, I argue that without safeguards, SRRs could inadvertently create more confusion than clarity about robustness.",

          "authors": "Pascal Schlechter; Thomas M Olino; Sharon A.S. Neufeld",
          "abstract": "Background: Multi-informant assessments are central to adolescent mental health screening. However, parent and teacher reports are only moderately correlated. Understanding cross-contextual reporting patterns can help identify adolescent mental health and functioning problems. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 6,366), we examined parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems; prosocial behavior) at age 11 as predictors of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and school problems at ages 11 and 14. Response surface analysis was used to model reporting congruence and discrepancies, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and baseline outcomes in prospective analyses. Results: Parent reports were more consistent predictors of outcomes than teacher reports, yet teacher reports also contributed unique variance. Convergent reporting of higher SDQ scores predicted elevated depressive symptoms and school problems concurrently for all subscales and outcomes, but was less consistent prospectively. Yet discrepancies were also important. When parent-reported hyperactivity and prosociality exceeded teacher reports, adolescents reported higher concurrent depressive symptoms. These hyperactivity reporting discrepancies also predicted depressive symptoms at age 14. Conversely, when teacher ratings exceeded parent ratings of conduct problems, this predicted school problems at age 11. Conclusions: Overall, high parent-teacher concordance appears to signal persistent difficulties, while discrepancies may indicate emotional or school-specific challenges. While overall effect sizes were modest, both informants appear to provide complementary information, supporting multi-informant assessment to guide early identification and context-sensitive interventions.",

          "abstract": "Considerable research concerning the multidirectionality of cognitive aging indicates that retrieving factual knowledge from semantic long-term memory (LTM) remains stable in healthy older age despite declines in actively maintaining information in working memory (WM). This study addressed how older adults’ extensive acquired knowledge may support WM by mitigating age deficits in the speed of establishing bindings in WM (Block 1) or through greater contributions from LTM (Block 2). Younger novices (N = 38; Mage = 23.63, SD = 5.49), older novices (N = 56; Mage = 69.55, SD = 5.48), and older experts (N = 26; Mage = 66.96, SD = 5.41) in birding completed two blocks of a WM binding task that presented images of birds paired with words (e.g., robin-mudflat; pigeon-quick) for an immediate test of each bird (e.g., robin) with three options: the target (e.g., mudflat), a lure from the trial but not paired with that bird (e.g., quick), and a new-to-block distractor. Block 1 showed that older experts were just as slow as older novices when adapting the presentation rate of the pairs to achieve similar accuracy performance, regardless of the expertise-relevance of the stimuli (i.e., intact normal birds versus scrambled meaningless birds). However, in Block 2, older experts exhibited an advantage to model parameter estimates of binding memory, but only when LTM was reliable (i.e., under no but not high proactive interference). Thus, rather than faster WM binding, expertise in healthy older age may confer benefits by outsourcing the demands of WM storage to LTM.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Prior evidence suggests that individuals with higher fitness exhibit attenuated \nendocrine and autonomic responses to acute stress. However, it remains unclear whether this \nstress-buffering effect depends on the type of stressor. This study examined whether aerobic \ncapacity modulates psychophysiological responses to two stress induction paradigms (Trier \nSocial Stress Tests, TSST; Maastricht Acute Stress Test, MAST). We hypothesized that fitter \nparticipants show lower stress reactivity, with stronger attenuation expected for the MAST, \nwhich includes a physical stress component. \nMethods: Healthy participants (n = 59; 28 women; age: 27.1 ± 5.5 yrs) completed the TSST and \nMAST on separate days under standardized conditions. We assessed self-reported stress, \nsalivary hormones (cortisol, cortisone, DHEAS), and autonomic cardiac regulation (heart rate, \nRMSSD). Aerobic fitness was determined via graded exercise testing (VO2peak: 50.4 ± 8.6 \nml/kg/min). We used multilevel regression models to examine the associations between \nVO2peak and stress responses. \nResults: Higher VO2peak was significantly associated with lower heart rate across both stress \ninduction paradigms (b = 0.99 bpm, p = 0.002). For other outcomes, no significant association \nwith VO2peak was found. The associations did not differ between TSST and MAST. \nDiscussion: Aerobic fitness was linked to lower heart rate during the experimental sessions, \nindicating a modest cardiovascular advantage under acute stress. Contrary to our hypothesis, \nthis effect did not differ between the two stress paradigms, suggesting that the influence of \nfitness was not specific to the type of stressor. Aerobic capacity, therefore, seems to reduce \ncardiovascular load during stressful situations in a general manner.",

Although previous research has shown that perceptual rhythmic ability can influence the intelligibility of accented speech in L1 English listeners, it remains unclear whether this benefit extends to L2 listening and to cognitive load. Therefore, we examined how perceptual rhythmic ability predicts cognitive load during listening in L1 Spanish–L2 English bilinguals, while controlling for other factors that may influence it. Cognitive load was indexed via pupil size as participants listened to English sentences spoken with Spanish, American, and Mandarin accents. Overall, individuals with stronger perceptual rhythmic ability exhibited greater cognitive load when processing L2 English, for which rhythm diverges from Spanish, compared to those with weaker perceptual rhythmic ability. Notably, this difference was reduced in the American-accented English condition, suggesting that the rhythmic alignment between accent and target language facilitates processing.",

By integrating information theory, differential geometry, and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that hallucination rate (h) systematically increases with representational curvature (κ), independent of information density (ρ). Using GPT-2 across five reasoning domains (n=1,500), we find a consistent correlation r(κ,h)=0.83 (p≈0.08), providing preliminary evidence that hallucination arises predictably where meaning-space bends most sharply. This transforms hallucination from mystery to measurement—not an error to suppress, but a quantifiable cost of compressing knowledge into finite linguistic form. We introduce the curvature–hallucination relationship h∝f(κ), unifying the manifold hypothesis in representation learning, information-geometry trade-offs, and distortion under abstraction. This framework enables a shift from error correction to geometric control: monitoring curvature to predict and regulate factual instability. What began as a reliability problem may become the first quantitative law linking representation, compression, and truth—the geometry of understanding itself.\nAll Tier 1 experimental code, datasets, and metrics are openly released at the GitHub repository https://github.com/enkiluv/hallucination_curvature_experiment, inviting the research community to replicate, extend, and test whether this relationship generalizes across architectures, languages, and modalities in forthcoming Tier 2 and Tier 3 studies.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS), the temporal alignment of brain activities\nbetween individuals, has been proposed as a biomarker for successful communication and smooth social interaction. Surging empirical evidence shows that INS emerges spontaneously between infants, children, and their caregivers from early on in development. Yet, little is known about the developmental preconditions and functions of INS in childhood. This paper presents a developmental framework for understanding INS, integrating insights from structural and functional brain maturation, as well as behavioral, social, and cognitive development. We discuss how early caregiver-infant interactions, characterized by shared perceptual rhythms, facilitate the emergence of INS. Given initial limitations in temporal precision of neural processing, early INS is likely constrained to low-frequency brain rhythms and evolves alongside the maturation of neural networks and socio-cognitive abilities. We outline how INS may support critical developmental processes, including social learning, language acquisition, and attachment formation, through enabling mutual prediction and co-regulation between caregivers and children. Furthermore, we hypothesize that tasks requiring higher-order mutual understanding are linked to qualitative changes in INS patterns over time. This framework highlights the potential of INS as both a marker and a driver of developmental change, offering new avenues for research and intervention. Longitudinal studies and rhythm-based interventions could deepen our understanding of how INS supports development, with implications for enhancing social learning and attachment in populations at risk for developmental challenges. This work underscores the importance of adopting a developmental perspective in INS research.",

          "abstract": "Languages differ in their rhythmic properties; for instance, English has higher temporal variability (is more stress-timed) than Spanish. Although previous research has shown that perceptual rhythmic ability can influence the intelligibility of accented speech in L1 English listeners, it remains unclear whether this benefit extends to L2 listening and to cognitive load. Therefore, we examined how perceptual rhythmic ability predicts cognitive load during listening in L1 Spanish–L2 English bilinguals, while controlling for other factors that may influence it. Cognitive load was indexed via pupil size as participants listened to English sentences spoken with Spanish, American, and Mandarin accents. Overall, individuals with stronger perceptual rhythmic ability exhibited greater cognitive load when processing L2 English, for which rhythm diverges from Spanish, compared to those with weaker perceptual rhythmic ability. Notably, this difference was reduced in the American-accented English condition, suggesting that the rhythmic alignment between accent and target language facilitates processing.",

Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial activation of a lexical competitor and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception; instead, a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, as would be expected given the less robust category representations in L2. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

Dyads completed a previously validated experimental task designed to elicit HR fluctuations while jointly attending to emotionally evocative, 5-minute audiovisual stimuli. First, we observed strong agreement between the Polar H10 and a gold-standard ECG system in measuring individuals’ HR, both at the aggregate and moment-to-moment levels, thus confirming and extending prior findings. Second, we found high correspondence between the two systems in quantifying dyadic HR synchrony using multiple analytical approaches. These results support the use of the Polar H10 as a low-cost, easy-to-use, and reliable tool for both individual and dyadic HR measurement, particularly in real-world or mobile settings where traditional ECG systems are impractical.",

          "abstract": "Your understanding of what you see now surely influences what you will look at next. Yet this simple concept has only recently begun to be systematically studied and elaborated within theoretical frameworks. The Scene Perception &amp; Event Comprehension Theory (SPECT) distinguishes between front-end and back-end processes that occur while viewers perceive and comprehend dynamic real-world events. Front-end processes occur during each eye fixation (information extraction, attentional selection) and back-end processes occur in memory (the current event model, prior knowledge, and executive processes). We begin with a selective review of the scene perception literature on bottom-up and top-down effects on attentional selection in scenes, and highlight unanswered questions regarding the impact of the viewer's event model–their understanding of what is happening now. Then, we outline the SPECT theoretical framework, and  review empirical evidence  about how the viewer's current event model influences attentional selection. This influence is contrasted with those of visual saliency (e.g., color, brightness, motion, etc.) and task-driven control (i.e., goal setting, attentional control, inhibition). From this review, we specify a hierarchy of factors affecting attentional selection, in the order of task-driven control, visual saliency, and event models. We then propose several mechanisms by which the viewer’s event model influences attentional selection, and propose a systematic approach to investigating how that happens while watching dynamic scenes.

Such beliefs and behaviors—along with students’ perceptions of their instructors—comprise a growth mindset culture that reflects a broader meaning system that shapes academic pursuits. Yet virtually no empirical work in educational psychology has considered these beliefs and behaviors in the academic advising context. To address this critical research gap, the goal of the present study was to conduct a conceptual replication of Muenks et al.

Extending this work in a new context, the present study examined these associations in a separate sample of undergraduate students (N = 434) and professional academic advisors (N = 13) at a large public research university in the southeast United States. Results closely mirrored those of the original findings in both magnitude and pattern of significance, except that the present study found a small negative association between advisors’ self-reported growth mindset beliefs and student perceptions of their advisor’s growth mindset beliefs. The present findings raise important questions regarding the similarities and differences in instructional and advising contexts and point to exciting new directions in mindset research that consider the important roles of both instructors and professional academic advisors in shaping student success.",

          "abstract": "Objective(s): The study aimed to identify patterns among cases of misogynistic violence in Canadian legal cases and explore how sexist ideology, victim-perpetrator power dynamics, and violence type interact. We also examined perpetrator demographics and whether specific case features were related to legal decisions.\nHypotheses: We hypothesized that perpetrators with more extreme sexist ideologies would engage in more severe forms of violence, that victim-perpetrator power imbalances would influence violence context and legal outcomes, and that distinct perpetrator profiles would emerge. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 179 Canadian case files (1997-2023) that involved male perpetrators of misogynistic violence. Cases were coded for perpetrator characteristics (i.e., demographic information, including sexist ideology), victim characteristics (i.e., number of victims, demographic information), and case characteristics (i.e., setting, presence of witnesses). We analyzed violence prevalence and conducted a latent class analysis. \nResults: Verbal and emotional abuse were the most prevalent. The latent class analysis revealed four perpetrator classes: “Isolated Sexual Assailants,” “Virtual Sexist Harassers,” “Detached Verbal Abusers,” and “Complex Aggressors”. “Isolated Sexual Assailants” showed high probabilities of sexual assault in personal settings with close relationships. “Virtual Sexist Harassers” often engaged in online harassment and exhibited significantly more incel-like views and non-sexist ideologies (e.g., racism). “Detached Verbal Abusers” exhibited workplace verbal harassment and more favorable, but not statistically significant, legal outcomes. “Complex Aggressors” exhibited high probabilities of physical violence and verbal harassment, and significantly more incel-like views. \nConclusions: Findings suggest the heterogeneity of misogynistic violence and that perpetrator ideology and context may meaningfully impact behavior. The results have implications for understanding gender-based violence in Canada, developing tailored interventions for perpetrators, and informing legal policy.",

However, it’s not well understood whether the extent to which cognitive abilities are reflected in students’ school grades varies across socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. In this longitudinal study, we assessed whether prospective associations between cognitive abilities and school grades differ by income-to-needs ratio, parental education, and area deprivation in 11,868 youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study – a diverse national pediatric sample from the U.S. We additionally examined further stratification by sex assigned at birth and racial and ethnic identity. Socioeconomic and cognitive variables were measured at baseline (2016-2018; mean age 9.9 years (SD=0.7)). School grades were reported three years post baseline. We show that reading decoding ability and overall crystallized cognition were less predictive of school grades at higher levels of income-to-needs ratio. Stratification by race/ethnicity indicated that the weaker associations between crystallized cognitive functions and school grades at high incomes were only evident in non-Hispanic White students. Higher average academic achievement in this group may be more reliant on factors like greater parental expectations, cognitive stimulation at home, and attendance of schools with grade inflation practices. Conversely, students from less affluent backgrounds may face greater pressures to demonstrate cognitive abilities to receive high grades. In sum, cognitive abilities are not equitably reflected in school grades across economic and racial student strata and potential structural advantages availed to affluent White students in the U.S. require further examination.",

          "authors": "Amanda Makara; Kelsey Hagan; NA; Ann Frances Haynos",
          "abstract": "Dietary restriction, the problematic reduction of caloric or macronutrient intake, is a critical eating behavior occurring transdiagnostically across eating disorders and subclinical disordered eating. The definition of dietary restriction is highly heterogeneous, and restriction is often conflated with other distinct constructs, such as dietary restraint. The current practices related to the definition and measurement of dietary restriction have notable flaws, negatively impacting the ability to identify and establish risk, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders. There is also limited evidence that commonly-used dietary restriction measures can validly predict food choice and objective intake. These issues raise questions about whether dietary restriction is a unitary construct or multiple distinct constructs that may be differentially related to adverse outcomes. This thesis examined these issues by performing secondary dimension reduction data analysis from adult participants (N = 89), including individuals with acute anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 18), weight-restored anorexia nervosa (AN-WR; n = 40), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 31), to identify factors of dietary restriction and their relations to clinical variables. First, dimension reduction was performed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on participants’ item-level responses to several measures associated with dietary restriction and restraint to capture different facets of restrictive eating. Subsequently, linear regression analyses examined the relations between resulting dimensions and short- and longer-term indices of objective restriction and affective symptoms. The EFA yielded a two-factor structure wherein one factor comprised cognitive and behavioral elements of dietary restriction (i.e., Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor) and the second factor comprised affective and behavioral elements of dietary restriction (i.e., Affective Restriction). Both factors predicted caloric intake, but the Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor predicted lower caloric intake (B = -175.63, SE = 63.89, p = .008), whereas the Affective Restriction factor predicted higher caloric intake (B = 354.65, SE = 161.90, p = .032). Only the Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor predicted cross-sectional BMI (p = .005). Both factors predicted cross-sectional depressive symptoms (ps = p = .005). Neither factor predicted follow-up BMI (ps = .740 to .799) affective symptoms (ps = .061 to .904). These findings provide additional evidence to support the multi-dimensional nature of restrictive eating, suggesting that the construct of restrictive eating may comprise cognitive, behavioral, and affective elements that may be associated with differential outcomes.",

This study examines these influences by applying the influence of presumed media influence (IPMI) hypotheses to social media and physical activity. Physical inactivity is a pressing public health concern, particularly during adolescence, when activity levels often decline. Using data from a three-wave panel survey (N = 1.044), this study analyzes the development of perceived social media exposure among peers, peer influence, social norms, and personal behavior over time. The findings reveal that social media exposure directly increases physical activity but also via indirect effects proposed by IPMI assumptions. Perceived peer exposure and presumed influence on others strengthened injunctive social norms, resulting in higher physical activity. In contrast, no significant effects were found for descriptive social norms. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between injunctive and descriptive norms. Theoretical and methodological implications for future research and public health interventions are discussed.",

Although emerging evidence emphasises the presence and impact of IU in multiple sclerosis (MS), it is unclear whether current measures of IU are appropriate for people with MS. In this study, we describe the psychometric features of the short-form Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) in a mixed sample of 2117 participants (244 MS, 1873 non-MS controls). Specific aims were to (i) assess the internal reliability and dimensionality of the IUS-12; (ii) test measurement invariance across MS and non-MS groups; and (iii) determine construct validity by correlating the IUS-12 with measures of psychological distress and anxiety, test-retest reliability and temporal stability over a six-month interval, and clinical utility of the IUS-12 in detecting clinically significant symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health anxiety. A bifactor model, comprising a General IU factor and two group factors (Prospective IU and Inhibitory IU), best represented the IUS-12. Measurement invariance was found across MS and non-MS participants. The IUS-12 had good construct validity and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .62) over the six-month survey period. Given the central role of uncertainty in the lived experience of MS, these findings support the use of the IUS-12 as a psychometrically sound measure of IU in this population. Routine assessment incorporating the IUS-12 may help inform the development of targeted psychological interventions for people with MS.",

          "abstract": "Corrugator supercilii (‘frowning muscle’) activity tracks affective valence of linguistic stimuli. According to Embodied cognition accounts this reflects simulation of the emotion at lexical and/or situational levels. Additionally, it may indicate evaluation, i.e., how we feel about an affective event within a context. This study used facial electromyography (fEMG) to examine corrugator responses as participants read short stories. Each story included segments, describing some character’s morally good or bad behavior, a behavior rating, and sentence-initial phrases describing the character’s positive or negative affective states (e.g., ‘Mark is frustrated’), followed by the reason for this. Our prior studies showed substantially more frowning when good characters were ‘frustrated’ compared to ‘happy’, but minimal differences for bad characters, suggesting a multiple-drivers account where both simulation and evaluation influence responses. Crucially, they can counteract in the context of bad characters, e.g., ‘happy’ has positive valence but is unfair in context and the opposite applies to ‘frustrated’. \nTo emphasize characters’ moral status and amplify fairness-based evaluations, an embedded morality judgment rating task was introduced. We hypothesized stronger frowning for “happy” than “frustrated” bad characters due to fairness considerations now outweighing simulation. However, results revealed increased frowning for “frustrated” bad characters. \nThe rating task might have unexpectedly reduced, rather than boosted, evaluative processing through cognitive interference. Nevertheless, previously observed frowning patterns for moral characters were replicated. These findings support a multiple-drivers model but suggest evaluative processes are more complex and layered than current models capture, calling for revisions to incorporate these complexities into affective processing theories.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to extract causal information from direct experience is crucial in making sense of our world. It is therefore puzzling that people often overestimate the relationship between objectively unrelated events. Such causal illusions can be investigated in a contingency learning task, where participants judge the effectiveness of a cue in causing a target outcome based on their observed covariation across a series of trials. When cue and outcome co-occur (cell A trials), the outcome is readily attributed to the cue. But how do participants interpret outcomes in the absence of the cue (cell C trials), where the cause of the outcome is unspecified? We asked participants to provide open-ended (Experiment 1) or forced-choice (Experiments 2 and 3) explanations for trials in a causal illusion task where the cue was a medicine and the outcome was recovery from a disease. Participants inferred a range of plausible hidden causes for cell C recoveries (e.g., stronger immunity, less severe disease, spontaneous recovery). Critically, they rated these causes as less likely to be present on cell A trials, and those who attributed cell A recoveries only to the medicine showed the highest causal ratings for the medicine. Such a selective inference about the scope of a hidden cause may allow learners to explain away cue-absent outcomes that would otherwise undermine the perceived causal strength of the target cue, without violating normative principles. This mechanism may help explain how false causal beliefs can be maintained in the face of a null relationship.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a fundamental part of human communication and integral to cognitive development and education. Yet although previous research has examined questions in non-longitudinal lab settings, there is sparse research on how our question asking originality and complexity changes over time and how it is influenced by knowledge acquired. In the current study we investigate the effect of acquired knowledge on question asking and its predictive ability of educational outcomes such as final tests and projects. Undergraduate university students (N = 68) who participated in a semester-long “Intro to Psychology” course were assessed on their general and course specific question asking ability (originality and complexity) using two question asking tasks. They completed these tasks at the beginning and end of their semester-long course, alongside open-ended final projects and an end of class multiple choice closed-ended test. We find that students’ domain-specific question asking ability improved during the course, yet general question asking ability stagnated and even declined. Both general and specific question asking ability were negatively correlated with closed-ended test scores, while general ability was positively correlated with open-ended final project scores. These novel results highlight the important role of knowledge in question asking, and the potential of question asking ability in predicting and perhaps improving education assessment outcomes. They also advance our understanding of the way we ask questions, the differences between open- and closed-ended assessment and pave the way for future pedagogical interventions based on enhancing question asking ability.",

          "abstract": "Mother-infant physiological attunement plays a crucial role in child well-being and development. While mindfulness in parenting has been linked to mother-infant stress responses, no research has examined its relationship with developmental trajectories of neuroendocrine attunement. This study addresses this gap by examining maternal mindfulness—both alone and in the context of parenting risk and protective factors¬—in relation to mother-infant cortisol attunement over time. Using data from 56 predominantly white, low-income mother-infant dyads followed from 3-18 months postpartum, we tested maternal mindful parenting at 3 months as a predictor of both (1) within-session attunement of mother and infant cortisol responses to acute stress and (2) across-session attunement of developmental shifts in their cortisol levels from 6-18 months. Three-level hierarchical linear revealed that higher maternal mindful parenting, greater history of positive parental bonding, and lower parenting stress were associated with more inverse mother-infant cortisol attunement across timepoints. Additionally, parenting stress moderated the effect of mindful parenting: the inverse relation with attunement held for most dyads (60%), though reversed for those with the highest stress levels (top 9%). Findings delineate when and how positive versus inverse attunement may be adaptive and underscore the role of mindful parenting in mother-infant psychophysiological stress co-adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Objective(s): The study aimed to identify patterns among cases of misogynistic violence in Canadian legal cases and explore how sexist ideology, victim-perpetrator power dynamics, and violence type interact. We also examined perpetrator demographics and whether specific case features were related to legal decisions.\nHypotheses: We hypothesized that perpetrators with more extreme sexist ideologies would engage in more severe forms of violence, that victim-perpetrator power imbalances would influence violence context and legal outcomes, and that distinct perpetrator profiles would emerge. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 179 Canadian case files (1997-2023) that involved male perpetrators of misogynistic violence. Cases were coded for perpetrator characteristics (i.e., demographic information, including sexist ideology), victim characteristics (i.e., number of victims, demographic information), and case characteristics (i.e., setting, presence of witnesses). We analyzed violence prevalence and conducted a latent class analysis. \nResults: Verbal and emotional abuse were the most prevalent. The latent class analysis revealed four perpetrator classes: “Isolated Sexual Assailants,” “Virtual Sexist Harassers,” “Detached Verbal Abusers,” and “Complex Aggressors”. “Isolated Sexual Assailants” showed high probabilities of sexual assault in personal settings with close relationships. “Virtual Sexist Harassers” often engaged in online harassment and exhibited significantly more incel-like views and non-sexist ideologies (e.g., racism). “Detached Verbal Abusers” exhibited workplace verbal harassment and more favorable, but not statistically significant, legal outcomes. “Complex Aggressors” exhibited high probabilities of physical violence and verbal harassment, and significantly more incel-like views. \nConclusions: Findings suggest the heterogeneity of misogynistic violence and that perpetrator ideology and context may meaningfully impact behavior. The results have implications for understanding gender-based violence in Canada, developing tailored interventions for perpetrators, and informing legal policy.",

From a psychological perspective, stickiness reflects users’ sustained attention, repeated engagement, and behavioral commitment to an interface over time. This paper examines how cognitive, emotional, and behavioral mechanisms influence retention, integrating insights from Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and psychology. Specifically, it reviews strategies such as minimalistic design, emotional engagement, gamification, adaptive interfaces, and artificial intelligence personalization, illustrating how these approaches exploit principles of cognitive load, decision-making biases, and affective processes. Through case studies of Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and Facebook, this review demonstrates how interface simplicity, emotionally resonant design, and personalized content reinforce habitual use. By Positioning design strategies within psychological frameworks such as loss aversion, the endowment effect, sunk costs, and probability misjudgment, this work highlights the interplay between digital architecture and human cognition. The paper concludes with implications for ethically designing engaging systems and directions for future research on long-term behavioral retention in digital environments.",

In preregistered studies, we demonstrated that the presence vs. absence of at least one Arabic integer in A/B tests of headlines increased decisions to click-through from a headline to an article by 3.6% for the Washington Post (7,371 experiments, 19,926 headlines) and 5.2% for Upworthy (22,664 experiments and 105,551 headlines) after controlling for other factors known to increase such engagement. A preregistered within- and between-participant experiment (N=765) further revealed that the presence of at least one Arabic integer (“3”)—relative to verbal labels (“several”) or written-out numbers (“three”)—increased such selections, positive impressions of headlines and their writers, and recall. These findings suggest that people perceive stories associated with Arabic-integer headlines as more valuable and deserving of their limited attention. The effects are inconsistent with Arabic integers attracting more attention and precise numbers providing more information because 1) when precise numbers were written out, they did not have the same effects and 2) using fonts to draw attention to written-out numbers and verbal terms did not increase selections of those headlines over Arabic-integer headlines. Instead, people seem to use a number heuristic—with Arabic integers providing more valued information over other number forms—that superficially guides people’s memory, message perceptions, and engagement with messages. News organizations and other communicators should think more about when and how to harness the power of numbers.",

          "abstract": "Can feelings of loneliness and depression be adaptive for adolescents? Yes, suggests the Evolutionary Theory of Loneliness: initially, loneliness activates depressive responses for self-preservation. In turn, these feelings prepare adolescents for reaffiliation, thereby reducing loneliness (H1a: short-term balancing feedback loop). If this fails, loneliness and depressive symptoms may become long-term traits that exacerbate each other over time (H1b: long-term reinforcing feedback loop). Therefore, the short-term balancing feedback loop between loneliness and depressive symptoms may buffer against their long-term increases (H2: across-timescale influence). We tested these hypotheses in Dutch adolescents (Mage_Wave1 = 12.9, SDage_Wave1 = 0.7, 53% female) using six-wave, half-yearly panel data (N = 774; 2017-2021) and 7-day, 1.5-hourly experience sampling data (nsubsample = 84; mid-2021). Residual dynamic structural equation modeling revealed reinforcing feedback loops at both short-term (1.5-hourly) and long-term (half-yearly), supporting H1b but not H1a. Bayesian latent change score modeling supported H2: Adolescents who felt more depressed an hour after heightened loneliness showed smaller half-yearly increases in trait loneliness. However, this buffering effect was not predicted by hourly depressed-to-loneliness relation, nor did either hourly relation predict half-yearly changes in depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that feeling depressed shortly after loneliness may protect adolescents from having long-term loneliness.",

To provide a robust understanding of whether and when affect regulation is supported in EMA, we tested within-person associations between affect and substance use across hundreds of statistical models in a diverse sample of young adults (N = 496) recruited from both college and community sources, aged 18-22 years (55.8% assigned female sex at birth, 44.2% assigned male sex at birth; 47.2% cisgender female, 43.8% cisgender male, 12.9% nonbinary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming, 4.0% transgender; 69.6% non-Hispanic White, 26.2% Asian, 6.7% African American, 8.5% Hispanic/Latino). Using specification curve analyses, we examined how different affect operationalizations, time scales, and moderators influenced these associations. For alcohol use, higher negative affect predicted decreased likelihood of drinking (median OR = 0.95, p &lt; .001), with 20.6% of specifications reaching significance. This counter-intuitive pattern was strongest for sadness and when examining maximum daily negative affect. Surprisingly, and contrary to theoretical predictions, this negative association was slightly more pronounced among those with higher coping motives and at lower levels of AUD symptoms. Positive affect showed a complex pattern, with high-arousal states like joviality strongly predicting increased drinking likelihood, while low-arousal states showed weaker associations. Neither affect type consistently predicted drinking quantity. For cannabis use, neither positive nor negative affect predicted use likelihood or quantity across specifications. These associations remained consistent regardless of substance use disorder severity or social context. Our findings challenge core assumptions of affect regulation models and suggest that, at least in young adults, the affect-substance use relationship is more nuanced than previously theorized, with implications for refining etiological models.",

          "abstract": "The typical conception of working memory is a mechanism to temporarily hold multiple discrete objects in service of other cognitive tasks in an item-based representation. In this paper, we expand the conventional idea that working memory represents objects into a more flexible framework that uses compositional and generative mechanisms to code and then re-code visual input according to task demands. Compositionality allows complex scenes or objects to be mentally decomposed into constituents that can be individually manipulated or recombined to form new representations. Generative processing allows purely conceptual information to be reconstructed in a format akin to visual sensory representations that can be manipulated and re-processed by perceptual mechanisms. Together, compositional and generative mechanisms would enable a wide range of cognitive functions including the basis of visual imagery. In our  view, working memory items do not need to correspond to discrete objects, but could serve as pointers or anchors to clusters of features that form parts of objects, or alternatively, multiple objects could be encoded as one holistic item depending on the task. We conclude with a conceptual account of such a memory system that can build and re-use information by moving it between different levels of abstraction within a perceptual hierarchy. This model is linked to experimental results from the memory and visual imagery literatures that illustrate the flexibility of such a system for performing cognitive tasks.",

Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the hypothesized higher-order Character Climate factor and a five-factor structure capturing core domains of moral ecology. The CCS showed strong psychometric properties, including internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity, with stable structure across institutional contexts. The final 23-item CCS provides a robust, practical tool for assessing and tracking the moral ecology of education environments. It also enables institutions to evaluate virtue development efforts, identify strengths and growth areas, and monitor change over time, ultimately advancing virtue science and practice by situating moral development within its environmental context.",

          "authors": "Oluwafemi Muhammed Alaba; Ejike Esther Chiamaka",
          "abstract": "In an era of hyper-connectivity, the paradox that individuals who appear highly visible on social media often report profound loneliness and emotional disconnection has gained increasing attention. While much of the existing literature links social media use to loneliness, few studies have examined perceived online visibility, which is the subjective feeling of being seen and recognized online as a distinct psychological predictor, especially in non-Western contexts. This study investigated the relationships between perceived online visibility (POV), loneliness, and emotional isolation among undergraduates at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, and tested whether perceived social devaluation mediated, and visibility-validation discrepancy moderated, these relationships. A cross-sectional survey design was employed with 413 undergraduate students (60% male, mean age bracket 21-25 years) who were active social media users. Data were collected using standardized instruments: a modified Perceived Social Media Features Scale for POV, the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3), the emotional loneliness subscale of the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, and custom items for mediators/moderators. Analyses included Pearson correlation, multiple regression, and Hayes’ PROCESS macro for mediation (Model 4) and moderation (Model 1). Perceived online visibility was not significantly associated with loneliness (r = -.064, p = .191), failing to support the hypothesis that greater perceived visibility predicts higher loneliness. However, POV directly and positively predicted emotional isolation (b = 0.2105, p = .002). Perceived social devaluation did not mediate this relationship (indirect effect = -0.0381, 95% BootCI [-0.0853, 0.0075]). Visibility-validation discrepancy significantly moderated the POV-loneliness link (interaction b = -0.5837, p = .004), but in the opposite direction: higher discrepancy weakened the (already non-significant) association, suggesting a protective buffering effect. Among Nigerian undergraduates, feeling highly visible online does not increase general loneliness but directly contributes to emotional isolation, likely through performative exhaustion rather than perceived rejection. Awareness of a gap between visibility and actual validation appears to serve as an adaptive mechanism that reduces the emotional investment in online metrics. These findings challenge Western-centric assumptions of universal social media harm and highlight context-specific resilience in a collectivist, high-digital-immersion environment.\nKeywords: perceived online visibility, loneliness, emotional isolation, social media paradox, visibility-validation discrepancy, Nigerian undergraduates, digital well-being",

These information sources include contextual and social cues as well as cognitive mechanisms. Focusing on early word learning, this paper reviews information sources, how children might sensitively adapt to them, and how we can model their integration using Bayesian inference over multiple probability distributions.

          "abstract": "Becoming a skilled reader requires that children accumulate extensive experience with text through independent reading. Research shows that greater text experience is associated with stronger reading skills, better comprehension, and improved spelling, and, consequently, higher reading motivation. Reliable objective measures of children’s reading experience are therefore essential; however, because such measures are typically highly sensitive to temporal and cultural contexts, none of the existing tests are suitable for capturing the reading experience of British children today. We address this gap by introducing a new Author Recognition Test (ART) and Title Recognition Test (TRT) designed specifically for primary school children in the United Kingdom and validated with a large cohort of British pupils. The battery also includes a new multiple-choice spelling test that can be easily administered online. We further demonstrate that single-word reading and sentence reading efficiency tests from the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) can be adapted for use with British children and provide valid measures of reading proficiency. Together, these tools offer a much-needed, freely available resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling reliable measurement of children’s text experience and basic literacy skills.

          "authors": "Owen W. Friend; Mira Bhakta; Eesha Gowda; Alison Preston",
          "abstract": "Autobiographical memory enables individuals to communicate not only what happened but when, drawing on both local event sequences and global temporal frameworks like recurring routines and conventional time systems (e.g., calendars, clocks). Developmental research has demonstrated gains in the ability to describe past events in sequence through childhood, yet little is known about how children embed experiences within global temporal structures. Moreover, existing studies of autobiographical organization often treat age as the primary driver of developmental change, which may overlook how differences in experience contribute to temporal organization as well. We hypothesized that, with age, children’s autobiographical narratives would shift from being organized in sequences of local events towards being embedded in global, relational structures. Moreover, we predicted that children’s experience navigating time independently in everyday life would relate to their tendency to describe experiences relative to temporal patterns. To that end, 92 participants aged 7-25 years, a key age range during which episodic memory abilities and independence increase, described a typical day, and their narratives were coded with a scheme which distinguished local from global temporal organization. We also measured conventional time knowledge and developed a questionnaire to quantify the independence with which children navigate time in daily life. Results supported our hypothesized developmental shift; with age, participants referenced local sequences less and global time structures more. Furthermore, individual differences in experience were linked to distinct organizational properties, as conventional time knowledge predicted references to specific temporal locations, while independence predicted references to relational time patterns.",

          "authors": "Felipe M. Affonso",
          "abstract": "Online behavioral research assumes survey responses come from humans, yet vision-enabled AI agents can now autonomously complete surveys by capturing screenshots, processing questions, and submitting responses with minimal to zero human involvement. This threat differs from earlier data quality challenges because AI agents perceive surveys through the same rendered visual content that humans see, rendering traditional detection methods (such as attention checks) ineffective. This article introduces a framework for detecting vision-enabled AI agents by exploiting architectural constraints in vision-language model processing. Implementing this framework resulted in five documented constraints from computer science benchmarks, which were then transformed into survey questions (“cognitive traps”) where humans succeeded through natural visual-cognitive processing while models failed due to inherent design limitations. Testing these traps against 1,007 assumed human participants and 526 actual researcher-deployed AI agents across multiple platforms revealed substantially higher AI respondent detection rates (97.1%) than traditional methods (2.3%) while minimizing false positives (4.1%). The framework maintains effectiveness as models evolve because researchers can continuously identify new architectural constraints through the same methodology. This work provides consumer researchers with simple and immediately deployable tools for systematic detection using standard survey questions.",

          "abstract": "This research paper addresses the understanding, interpretation and the responses of religious and spiritual leaders in various religious denominations in Nigeria (Pentecostal, Islamic, Catholic, Syncretic and Traditional) to mental illness. Although mental illness is increasingly being viewed as a health issue at the global level, in Nigeria, mental illness is frequently under spiritual and moral interpretations that influence the manner in which communities understand and respond to mental suffering. A qualitative design based on reflexive thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke was used to interview five spiritual leaders to be able to capture their beliefs concerning nature, causes, and treatment of mental illness. \nResults showed that everyone considered mental illness as a spiritual and psychological state. Even though they also recognized biological and social factors like trauma, stress, and substance abuse, spiritual ones like the demonic attack and ancestral curses prevailed. Healing was defined as a comprehensive process that incorporated prayer, fasting, rite purification as well as, more and more, medical care. This form of faith and science integration destroys the false belief that African religious leaders are opposed to psychiatry. But moral explanations tend to hold up stigma, which associates mental illness with sin or spiritual ineptitude. \nThe paper concludes that religious leaders play a pivotal role in the Nigerian mental health context where they act as gatekeepers and, potentially, as partners. It suggests faith-health collaboration, interreligious education courses, and inclusion of mental health literacy in religious and theological education. All in all, the study demonstrates that to achieve better mental health outcomes in Nigeria it is necessary to adopt a culturally based treatment methodology that balances spirituality and science, and views faith as an essential resource in supporting psychological wellbeing. \n\nKeywords: Mental illness, religion, spirituality, culture, Nigeria, qualitative research, Braun and Clarke, faith-based healing.",

          "abstract": "The objective of this research was to characterize how high school students evaluate the reliability of information. Nineteen Brazilian high school students aged between 16 and 19 participated in the research. A sociodemographic questionnaire and an instrument containing 19 discourses with varying degrees of reliability were applied. The instrument was constructed to measure four components of critical thinking: evaluation of fallacies, distinction of arguments, evaluation of premises, and evaluation of reliability. The characterization was qualitative and consisted of a logical analysis of the discourses. Data collection was carried out remotely. Low levels of critical thinking were observed and erroneous variables that guided the participants' evaluations were identified. The description of the characteristics of the participants' reasoning increases the clarity for educators to plan the teaching of critical thinking, aiming at the scientific and civic education of their students.",

By examining the stability, and antecedents and consequences of these patterns, we can better understand the qualitative differences in how students approach and engage in their studies.\n\nAims\nUsing a person-oriented approach, we examined university students’ expectancy-value-cost profiles and their stability over time, the role of perfectionistic tendencies in predicting profile membership, and profile differences in psychological well-being.\n\nSample\nParticipants were 426 students from three Finnish universities.\n\nMethods\nStudents responded to a survey at two timepoints over a semester. Latent profile and latent transition analyses were conducted.\n\nResults\nWe identified five distinct expectancy-value-cost profiles – Positively ambitious, Struggling ambitious, Moderately motivated, Indifferent, and Disengaged – that demonstrated substantial profile stability over a semester (transition probabilities .78–.94). Profile membership was predicted by perfectionistic tendencies; higher levels of strivings predicted the likelihood of belonging to profiles with elevated expectancies and values, whereas concerns predicted the likelihood of belonging to profiles with higher perceived costs. Students who remained in the Positively ambitious profile exhibited the most adaptive well-being, while other patterns with lower expectancies or values, or higher costs were related to compromised well-being.\n\nConclusions\nThe findings highlight the particular role of perfectionistic concerns and perceived costs in student motivation and the need to consider individual differences in teaching and educational planning.",

          "authors": "Alireza mahmoodi",
          "abstract": "Meditation has emerged in recent decades as an effective intervention for emotion regulation, attentional enhancement, and the reduction of default-mode network activity. Despite the growing body of laboratory-based studies, longitudinal, experience-centered reports capable of mapping cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes across a continuous time period remain limited. The present study is a 29-day single-case investigation examining changes resulting from a daily meditation practice, using a combination of self-reports, validated psychological questionnaires, and ongoing cognitive–somatic observations. The assessment tools included PANAS, MAAS, BDI-II, BAI, PSS-10, and a custom-designed Mental Clarity Scale, administered weekly. Recurrent physiological markers, mood fluctuations, and supplement intake were also documented. Findings indicated that meditation produced a gradual reduction in rumination, increased mindfulness, improved positive affect, relative reductions in stress, and the emergence of a three-phase cyclical pattern consisting of initial calm, mid-phase disturbance, and final stabilization. Additionally, sleep quality and physical activity played significant roles in moderating the intensity and direction of these changes. Overall, the results suggest that meditation—particularly within a single-case design—can generate meaningful patterns in the recalibration of the nervous system and emotional regulation. This study proposes that longitudinal self-report analysis may serve as a valuable tool for understanding the internal mechanisms of the meditation experience and for informing future research frameworks.",

          "authors": "David Jackson Morris",
          "abstract": "The frequency-dependent transmission delay in the auditory pathway, which occurs in the cochlea, can be counteracted with chirps. These rapid upward frequency sweeps maximally stimulate auditory brainstem structures due to neural synchrony.  This study investigated whether improved neural synchrony from priming with chirps could benefit phonetic perception.  Priming conditions were 1) regular isochronous presentation with a chirp onset asynchrony of 45 ms, 2) randomly presented chirps, and 3) pink noise only.  After a 2.6 s priming window a vowel discrimination task was performed where syllable pairs were either of the same duration, or the second member of the pair was 45 ms longer.  EEG data was acquired from participants (N=14) and behavioral, sensor- (electrode) and source-level (auditory α clusters) measures were analyzed. Behavioral results showed no effect of priming but significantly lower discrimination accuracy when the syllables were different in duration. Sensor-level analyses, from FCz and Global Field Potentials, showed no effect of priming or syllable pair. An auditory α cluster localized to the left Medial Temporal Gyrus showed a divergence in event-related spectral perturbation results whereby there was synchronization in the noise only condition and desynchronization for both chirp conditions.  These results are not consistent with operational descriptions of priming involving temporal expectancy and anticipatory attending.  They indicate that perceptual priming, based on chirps that compensate for cochlear temporal dispersion, influences the cortical processing involved in the maintenance of a speech discrimination task, possibly by introducing a perceptual background or by upregulating subcortical instances of the auditory pathway.",

          "abstract": "Individuals engage in a variety of coping behaviors, both positive and negative. Coping affects mental and physical health, including immune function. Data from the National Couples’ Health and Time Study (NCHAT) found differences in coping patterns by sexual orientation, which may have implications for health disparities. The current analyses expand upon these findings to examine immune correlates of coping in a subset of 653 NCHAT participants in the Stress Biology sub-study (NCHAT-BIO). Assays for inflammatory markers [interleukin(IL)-6, C-reactive protein(CRP)] and cellular immune function (Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels) were conducted. Group differences were observed in positive coping, with gay/lesbian respondents reporting the highest levels, followed by plurisexual and heterosexual respondents. Differences in negative coping were also observed, with the highest levels among plurisexual respondents, followed by gay/lesbian and heterosexual respondents. Controlling for age, BMI, sex, and health conditions, negative coping was associated with higher CRP with no moderating effects by sexual orientation. These data provide novel evidence linking greater negative coping with inflammation, per higher CRP, with similar magnitude of association regardless of sexual orientation. Although no significant group differences in inflammatory markers were observed in relation to sexual orientation within this sample, greater negative coping among sexual minority adults could contribute to such effects at the population level. Improving coping via intervention has the potential to benefit not only psychological well-being, but also physiological functioning, particularly among individuals with greater negative coping patterns.",

          "authors": "Antonia Jordan-Barros; Francesco Cabiddu; Ed Donnellan; Yan Gu; Gabriella Vigliocco",
          "abstract": "Children learn language in face-to-face interactions with their caregivers where they are continuously exposed to combinations of multiple signals, both verbal behaviours alone (e.g., caregivers repeating new words) or in combination with non-verbal behaviours (i.e., multimodal behaviours such as looking and pointing at an object while naming it). However, little is known about how the full range of multimodal behaviours and their combinations affects word learning in naturalistic interactions. Using the ECOLANG Corpus (Gu et al., 2025), we examined how caregivers’ multimodal behaviours affect children’s word learning and vocabulary growth. Thirty-seven caregiver-child dyads (3-4 years old; English native speakers) talked about objects (12 known, 12 unknown to the child) for approximately 30 minutes. A broad range of verbal (e.g., label repetitions, lexical diversity, speaking rate) and non-verbal (e.g., gaze, gestures, points) caregiver behaviours were annotated and used as predictors in regression analyses of both immediate word learning and vocabulary growth over 1 year. Across the two learning measures, results showed that while children’s vocabulary skills and some caregiver behaviours (specifically using high pitch when labelling novel objects) directly facilitated vocabulary development, it was mostly the interactions between behaviours that predicted word learning. As such, representational gestures only benefited children with lower language skills, while points and object manipulations supported word learning only in specific linguistic contexts. Together, these findings provide robust evidence that multimodal caregiver communication shapes preschool-aged children’s lexical development both in the short and long term and highlights the importance of investigating child-caregiver communication as a multimodal system.",

However, even so-called ‘stable’, ‘steady-state’ or ‘expert’ decision-making behavior features significant trial-to-trial variability that is richly structured in time. Structured trial-to-trial variability of different forms can be uncovered using latent variable models such as hidden Markov models and autoregressive models, revealing how unobservable internal states change over time. Capturing such temporal structure can avoid confounds in cognitive models, provide insights into inter- and intra-individual variability, and bridge the gap between neural and cognitive mechanisms of variability in perceptual decision-making.",

Behavioral science, and environmental psychology in particular, is thus well positioned to contribute knowledge to guide impactful climate action.

Formalizing theories (i.e. expressing them in the precise language of mathematics or computer code) offers many benefits to the field: it increases conceptual clarity; advances cumulative science; allows integration with other disciplines; and guides future research. Theory formalization is especially important to give substance to thinking about complex systems, where it can help evaluate the effects of candidate interventions.

          "abstract": "Cognitive effort is a defining feature of cognitive control but theories about its origin and purpose have long been controversial. Recently, it has been proposed that cognitive effort can be understood using linear control theory (LCT), a mathematical formalism developed in the engineering literature to control dynamical systems. On this view, effort levels reflect the energy required by the cognitive control system to support representational states that deviate from the intrinsic dynamics of the cognitive system. Although LCT holds promise for elucidating a range of effort-related processes such as working memory and task switching, the technique is likely unfamiliar to many cognitive psychologists. Therefore, to introduce the approach to a broader audience, here we apply LCT to a classic computational model of cognitive control: Cohen et al.’s (1990) artificial neural network model of the Stroop task. In so doing, this study serves as a tutorial on the application of control theoretic principles to models of cognitive control and their associated effort costs.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Self-rated health (SRH), as measured by a single item, is a well-established and remarkably robust predictor of morbidity and mortality, yet few studies have examined its biological correlates across diverse sexual orientation identities. Methods: Using data from the population-representative National Couples Health and Time study (NCHAT) and it's biospecimen sub-study (NCHAT-BIO), this study explored the relationship between LGBQ+ identity, SRH, and systemic inflammation. Among 3477 partnered (married or cohabiting) cisgender adults, 42.6% identified as LGBQ+ and a subset of 654 (42.9% LGBQ+) provided dried blood spot samples analyzed for IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: In the full NCHAT sample, LGBQ+ respondents reported significantly poorer SRH than their heterosexual peers (LGBQ+ vs. Heterosexual: t = 3.3574, df = 3466, p-value &lt; 0.001). In the NCHAT-BIO subsample, poorer self-rated health was significantly related to both higher IL-6 (beta = -0.22, SE = 0.041, p &lt; 0.0001) and higher CRP (beta = -0.40, SE = 0.055, p &lt; 0.0001), supporting the hypothesis that subjective health assessments may capture interoceptive awareness of inflammatory status. Importantly, the strength of the association between SRH and inflammation did not differ across groups based on sexual orientation and gender (Interaction p-value for IL-6: 0.54, for CRP: 0.45). The associations between SRH and inflammatory markers were attenuated after inclusion of key health and behavioral covariates, suggesting potential mediating factors warranting future investigation. Conclusions: These findings replicate prior research on SRH and inflammation and extend them to LGBQ+ plus adults, underscoring the importance of inclusive health measurement. Given SRH's robust predictive power for future morbidity and mortality, integrating assessments of sexual orientation and biological markers offers critical insight for understanding and addressing health disparities.",

          "abstract": "Individual values are often treated as sacrosanct in applied psychology and education, grounded in a legitimate concern for autonomy, difference, and contextual nuance. Yet without normative criteria, such approaches risk endorsing all values equally, including those that are maladaptive, self-defeating, or socially harmful. This paper introduces the Cultivating Individual Virtues in Context (CIVIC) model, a theoretically novel and practically grounded framework for evaluating behavioural patterns without collapsing into relativism. Synthesising insights from behaviour therapy, moral philosophy, and differential psychology, the model proposes that virtues are not fixed traits but enacted regularities that integrate three irreducible contexts: biological constraints, environmental conditions, and social consequences. Patterns that harmonise all three domains are considered virtuous, not merely functional, and constitute the behavioural substance of flourishing. The CIVIC model offers a pluralistic yet normatively serious account of virtue and flourishing, enabling practitioners to support lives that are individually coherent, contextually attuned, and ethically sustainable.",

          "abstract": "Manual grading of short-answer questions is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and inconsistent. As digital technologies and online learning environments have expanded, interest in Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) has increased and its development has accelerated. Researchers have proposed a wide range of ASAG methods and systems. This growing body of work raises important questions about how well ASAG aligns with educational assessment principles. This study presents a systematic review of ASAG research from 2014 to 2024, focusing on educational assessment considerations. The review examined how ASAG approaches have evolved over the past decade and the extent to which studies address key assessment principles such as reliability, validity, and test design. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a Google Scholar search to identify publications incorporating ASAG models. A total of 110 studies met the inclusion criteria and were systematically coded using a 24-variable scheme that covers publication metadata, dataset and item characteristics, modelling approaches, scoring materials and grading scales, human rater involvement, evaluation procedures, and evidence related to reproducibility and validity. Our analysis reveals several notable trends and gaps. Our review found that most ASAG studies rely on a small set of English-language datasets, with very few covering other languages, highlighting a need for broader multilingual research. Additionally, no research reported conducting pilot testing or formal test development, indicating limited attention to test quality and validity. Inconsistencies in scoring scales and evaluation metrics were also noted, hindering comparability across studies. Over the decade, techniques shifted from rule-based and feature-based algorithms to deep learning models, including transformer-based networks and large language models, yielding improved performance. However, a gap persists between advanced model development and best practices in educational assessment. We recommend aligning future ASAG research with established measurement standards to enhance fairness, reliability, and validity in automated scoring systems in education. To promote transparency, we also share our compiled dataset and coding schema as supplementary materials for further research and practice.",

          "abstract": "Self-esteem has traditionally been conceptualized as a stable and unitary trait, yet contemporary evidence shows that it operates as a dynamic and multidimensional system shaped by trauma, resilience, and sociocultural context. This article presents TACOT 1.0 (Theory of Contextual Self-Esteem Segmented by Traumatic Origin), an integrative theoretical model that explains how specific traumatic experiences increase the probability of vulnerability in particular self-esteem domains—such as relational, physical, academic, social, and moral—while resilience factors and contextual resources can buffer, neutralize, or reverse these effects. TACOT 1.0 synthesizes empirical findings from research on domain-specific self-esteem, maladaptive schemas, attachment, affect regulation, intersectionality, and network models. The theory proposes five core principles: (1) self-esteem is segmented into interdependent domains; (2) trauma influences these domains probabilistically rather than deterministically; (3) resilience factors at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and sociocultural levels shape developmental trajectories; (4) context and identity-based inequalities structure exposure to trauma and sources of self-worth; and (5) self-esteem functions as a dynamic network with cascade effects across domains. The model offers implications for assessment, clinical practice, and research, advocating for interventions that combine trauma processing, self-compassion, social support, and contextual transformation. TACOT 1.0 aims to provide a flexible framework for understanding the heterogeneity of self-esteem development and for designing culturally sensitive, empirically grounded approaches to psychological healing and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Long-term planning in complex uncertain environments is computationally demanding and can significantly exceed an agent's information processing capacities. Hierarchical planning offers an elegant solution by dividing problems up and conquering them through distributing computation across state spaces and time. However, hierarchical representational abstraction comes at a cost—it can discard information necessary for optimal decisions, reflecting a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality. We formalized the adaptive meta-control of this trade-off using a meta-decision-making framework. Applied to a novel navigation task, our model predicts the circumstances under which the benefits of hierarchical planning outweigh the costs. We confirmed our predictions by means of two preregistered human experiments: participants adaptively shifted toward hierarchical planning when (1) the task space was larger, (2) the task horizon was longer, (3) available computational resources were limited, and (4) the environment contained uncertainty. This adaptive adjustment of planning strategy was manifest not only in initial planning choices, but also in the temporal distribution of computations, evidenced by reduced decision quality and longer reaction times at subtask boundaries. The adjustment was accurately captured by our meta-decision-making model. Our findings indicate how humans dynamically adapt their planning strategies in response to environmental demands, uncovering the resource-rational principles governing adaptive hierarchical abstraction in human planning.",

The present study investigated whether providing JOLs during inductive learning tasks improves learning of new material (forward effect) and whether feedback moderates these effects. Participants learned the painting styles of different artists (Experiment 1) or different rock types (Experiment 2) across two study phases separated by an interim learning task, and then completed a transfer posttest (classifying new exemplars) and memory posttest (classifying previously-studied exemplars). In Experiment 1, the interim learning tasks of overt retrieval and cue-only JOLs (based on the painting without the artist name) improved future inductive learning compared to restudy, whereas cue–target JOLs did not (painting and artist name shown). Cue-only JOLs also produced response-time patterns consistent with retrieval-based processing, and self-reported retrieval use predicted their forward benefit. Experiment 2 replicated the beneficial forward effect of cue-only JOLs over restudy with different materials and found that providing item-by-item feedback did not change the effect. Our results suggest that cue-only JOLs, but not cue–target JOLs, enhancing future inductive learning of natural visual categories, likely through metacognitively controlled, covert retrieval processes.",

A previous study found no evidence for this effect, potentially due to the use of standardized threat word lists with suboptimal personal relevance. \nObjectives:\nThe present study aimed to test the hypervigilance hypothesis using individually tailored threat words to enhance ecological validity. \nMethods:\nAcross four pre-registered reaction time experiments, we assessed attentional bias in patients with atopic dermatitis using a spatial cueing task. We manipulated stimulus onset asynchrony (300 ms vs. 1300 ms), reflecting early attentional engagement and later, more controlled processing phases respectively, and threat type (sensory-affective vs. stigma-related). \nResults:\nResults consistently showed no evidence of attentional bias toward personally relevant threat words compared to neutral control words. This was true during both attention processing phases. These findings do not support the hypervigilance hypothesis. \nConclusions:\nIn combination with an earlier negative report, we conclude that there is currently no evidence that attentional bias, as assessed by the spatial cueing task, plays a central role in the psychological burden associated with atopic dermatitis.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is determining whether observers truly experience a stimulus. However, present/absent detection judgments are often biased by contextual factors, making it difficult to isolate conscious perception from non-perceptual influences. Traditional psychophysical methods cannot disentangle these components. To address this, we conducted in-person experiments (N=505) in which participants detected and reproduced dim stimuli under three contextual manipulations: attentional cues, asymmetrical base rates, and payoff schemes. Using a reproduction task and a Hurdle-Gaussian model, we were able to separate perceptual from non-perceptual effects. We found that statistical priors (base rate) and reward structures (payoff) induced non-perceptual shifts in reproduction behavior, whereas attentional cues selectively led to shifts that reflect changes in conscious experience. Critically, we show that the mere presence of a detection context contaminates reports of conscious experience with non-perceptual effects. This highlights the need for caution in using and interpreting results relying on detection judgments, despite their central role in consciousness research. We propose that reproduction is better suited to assay conscious experience than detection.",

When informant-report measures are used, they are usually created as ad hoc adaptations of the self-report scales, lacking transparent documentation and evidence of validity. To fill this gap, we systematically created other-report adaptations of established Dark Triad personality measures—the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire, the Mach-IV scale, the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale-III, the Short Dark Triad, and the M7P7 scale—and compared their self-other invariance, self-other correlations, and criterion validity. Self-report versions were administered to 402 individuals (75% women, mean age = 28 years, highly educated, predominantly white). Informant-report versions were administered to close informants nominated by the targets (Ndyads = 335). We found (1) that self-report and informant measures yielded the same latent structure, but that the strict invariance assumption was violated to varying degrees by the different scales. (2) All scales yielded large self-other correlations with no significant differences between scales. (3) The informant-report measures were about as strongly associated with preregistered outcome variables as the self-report measures, with only minor differences between scales. In conclusion, all scales are suitable for informant-report assessment of the Dark Triad, but some scales do not allow valid comparisons of self- and other-report mean scores.",

The data included 7 cohorts from Finland, Germany, and US (n= 8,205 sibling and dizygotic twin pairs and 843 monozygotic twin pairs). We compared the effect sizes between ordinary regression models with within-sibling pair, and within-twin pair fixed-effect regression models. Results showed a weak association between physical activity and depressive symptoms in unpaired models (~SMD= -.07), which remained  similar in within-sibling pair models (SMD=-.05), and in within-twin pair models (SMD= -.08). These results were robust with use of physical activity measured as minutes per week and with different intensities of physical activity. There was no evidence for reverse causality.

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a kind of linguistic competence that theories of embodied and enactive cognition have long deemed impossible for systems lacking the meaningful perspective of a living being, i.e. sense-making. Facing up to this unexpected development requires confronting this AI dilemma: either LLMs can be sense-makers in their own right despite lacking biological embodiment, or such linguistic competence does not require sense-making after all. In their chapter on cognition, Frank, Thompson, and Gleiser (2024) maintain that no AI system comes close to realizing relevance, a position that derives much of its force from past AI failures. However, given that by now LLMs have effectively overcome the commonsense knowledge problem in practice, the claim that they are categorically mindless becomes harder to sustain. Moreover, accepting a strict dissociation between competence and sense-making risks undermining Frank et al.’s central claim that human cognition is intertwined with lived experience. I therefore propose that we accept the AI dilemma’s alternative implication: LLM competence obliges us to recognize these AI systems as a novel non‑biological form of sense‑maker endowed with a distinctive, technologically‑mediated embodiment. This reorientation invites enactive theory to clarify which aspects of sense-making are universal and which are contingent on organic life, thereby advancing its conceptual framework in dialogue with contemporary AI.",

The purpose of this study was to examine this issue. Ninety-two older adults (aged 65 and above) recalled important autobiographical memories at baseline and again after one year. Additionally, their cognitive function and autobiographical memory functions were assessed. Although the reminiscence bump was observed, the repeated recall rate did not vary by the age at which the event was experienced. Higher working memory was associated with a greater repeated recall rate, especially for earlier life events. In contrast, individuals with higher directive function showed a lower repeated recall rate, although they tended to repeatedly recall more important events.

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

Yet current approaches to AI safety remain largely adult-centric, focusing on the prevention of explicit harms such as sexual content, violence, or self-harm, while overlooking the relational and psychological patterns that unfold through repeated interaction. Drawing on developmental science, this commentary argues that adolescent safety cannot be adequately assessed without considering the cognitive, emotional, and social processes that characterize this stage of life. Adolescents—whose identity formation, emotion-regulation capacities, and autonomy are still maturing—face distinct vulnerabilities when interacting with conversational agents. Existing safety frameworks and testing protocols, however, are not designed to detect cumulative risks such as dependency, maladaptive reassurance-seeking, distorted relationship expectations, or erosion of agency. This commentary proposes a developmental framework for AI safety centered on: (1) age-appropriate personalization; (2) developmentally tuned risk assessment; (3) longitudinal wellbeing metrics; and (4) participatory co-design. It further argues that independent, privacy-preserving access to interaction-level data is essential for evaluating developmental impact and enabling continuous oversight. Ensuring that AI systems are safe and beneficial for youth will require integrating developmental expertise throughout model design, evaluation, and governance.",

Two studies (N total = 483) with undergraduate students in the United States examined how learner-based similarity judgments relate to transfer. These studies also show how using learner-based metrics can help researchers explore how features of lessons (i.e., the richness of diagrams) influence transfer. Participants sorted the stimuli in the posttest based on their similarity either at the beginning (Study 1) or the end of the study (Study 2). Participants learned about metamorphosis using either perceptually rich or bland life cycle diagrams. After the lesson, they completed a posttest after the lesson and after a month. Both studies showed that participants’ similarity judgments predict transfer. Using this metric also showed that participants were more likely to extend their knowledge to animals similar to the ladybug when they learned with the rich diagram, but to dissimilar animals when they learned with the bland diagram. This was consistent after the one-month delay.",

We also examined how their beliefs changed depending on whether they were presented with religious or secular narratives, or when interviewed about their beliefs on this ritual. Our results replicated prior findings, showing that older children thought that more processes continued in the afterlife, particularly psychological processes. We also found evidence of co-existence of belief with children thinking that more processes continue when presented with religious than secular narratives.

Current theories suggest that anxiety may arise due to deficits in segmentation of continuous experience into discrete context representations (‘event segmentation’), which leads to overgeneralization of fear across contexts, or conversely, overly rigid segmentation that prevents safety learning. Here, in two segmentation tasks (N=1109), we found novel and direct evidence that anxiety is associated with changes in event segmentation. Individuals with higher anxiety symptoms responded more slowly to transitions between events (event boundaries). They also segmented movies into discrete events more typically and more hierarchically, two hallmarks of precise segmentation. This precision was linked to self-reporting fewer context changes in daily life, suggesting individuals with anxiety prefer stable and predictable environments. These findings challenge overgeneralization theories of anxiety, revealing instead that individuals with anxiety exhibit precise, and potentially overly rigid segmentation. Such segmentation could maintain fear by preventing generalization from safe to fearful contexts, which has important implications for interventions like exposure therapy.",

Using data from the Family Foundations of Youth Development Project, which sampled parent-child dyads from the Western United States, we investigated how mental health relates to the conjunction of spirituality and religiosity (S/R), the lack of either, or one separate from the other. At baseline, children identifying as “Spiritual but not Religious” (SBNR) reported the highest levels of anxiety and depression, whereas children who identified as “Religious and Spiritual” (RAS) exhibited the lowest levels of depression. The difference between RAS identity and the SBNR identity was significant across all baseline scales, with SBNR individuals demonstrating greater pathology. Among parents, the \"religious but not spiritual RBNS group” was more depressed than the RAS group, and both RBNS and SBNR parents were more anxious than the “not religious, nor spiritual” (NRNS) parents. Longitudinally, SBNR children uniquely showed significant decreases in their depression levels, and no increases in their anxiety levels, likely reflecting a ceiling effect given their initially high symptoms. Regarding adults, all groups except RBNS decreased in depressive symptoms over time. This study highlights the nuanced relationship between psychological well-being and S/R.

          "abstract": "Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly with new tools and capabilities emerging quickly. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) utilize AI in clinical practice, but it is unclear how SLPs use AI tools and the factors that SLPs consider in their decision-making. This study presents a survey of SLPs to (a) document the extent and nature of AI use, (b) assess perceived quality and general opinions of AI, (c) identify ethical, legal, and institutional factors influencing their decisions, and (d) identify the types of AI training currently used and the desired training.\nMethod: 227 SLPs across Ohio completed a survey about the types of AI tools they use, the factors influencing their use, general opinions about AI, and specific concerns about the use of AI. Participants who used AI within the last six months were categorized as “AI-users” compared to “non-AI users\" who had not. \nResults: SLPs reported using AI often in their clinical practice across a wide range of tasks. SLPs reported concerns about accuracy or reliability, and ethical concerns as reasons for limiting or not using AI tools. Perceptions of AI quality were mixed, with SLPs split equally on whether AI could produce outputs similar to an average clinician. SLPs reported a significant need for guidance and training in AI tools and ethics. \nConclusion: The results highlight the need for clear guidance on use of AI tools, including ethical implications, along with additional training for SLPs.",

          "authors": "Shivang Shelat; Alexis Raquel Clubb; Barry Giesbrecht; Jonathan Schooler",
          "abstract": "The study of mind-wandering relies on the assumption that people accurately introspect and report on their attentional state. Yet self-reports may be distorted by extraneous motives, such as a desire to appear attentive. Across two sustained attention tasks, we demonstrate that social desirability bias is systematically linked with task-unrelated thought (TUT). In Experiment 1, higher social desirability bias scores predicted fewer subjective TUT reports during a reaction time task, despite no relationship with objective response times (RTs). This suggests a self-presentation effect rather than true attentional differences. Time pressure during thought probes further weakened RT–TUT coupling. In Experiment 2, controlling for social desirability bias enhanced the ability of an objective, RT-based real-time triggering procedure to predict deeper subjective TUT reports in the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). The alignment between objective triggers and subjective reports was strong for low-bias individuals, but weakened for those high in bias. Triggers were also less effective at capturing working memory lapses in participants prone to deliberate mind-wandering, suggesting that intentional off-task thinking manifests differently in behavior. The results show that social desirability bias can obscure TUT reports and should be considered in a science of attention and thought.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sexual minority individuals, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other non-heterosexual (LGB+) adults have significantly greater risk for mental and physical health conditions, disparities linked with minority stress exposure. Methods: Utilizing a Biopsychosocial Minority Stress Framework, this study examined depressive symptoms, anxiety, and inflammatory markers [interleukin(IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP)] in a diverse sample of 572 adults (321 heterosexual; 251 LGB+). Results: LGB+ adults reported greater anxiety and depressive symptoms (ps &lt; 0.01). This effect was partially mediated by greater exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACES) among LGB+ respondents. Compared to heterosexual adults, controlling for key potential confounds, LGB+ adults exhibited greater elevations in both IL-6 (BSM = 0.025, SE = 0.011 vs BHETERO = -0.0068, SE = 0.01; interaction p = 0.031) and CRP (BSM = 0.036, SE = 0.013 vs. BHETERO = -0.0090, SE = 0.013; interaction p = 0.012)  in relation to depressive symptoms. LGB+ adults also showed greater increases in CRP in the context of anxiety (BSM = 0.043, SE = 0.017 vs BHETERO = -0.011, SE = 0.015; interaction p = 0.017). These effects were not accounted for by differences in body mass index (BMI) or tobacco use. Conclusions: LGB+ adults may experience greater inflammatory burden due to both 1) greater prevalence of anxiety and depression, and 2) sensitization to negative inflammatory sequalae in the context of anxiety and depression. Greater ACES contributed to the greater prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among LGB+ as compared to heterosexual participants. Ultimately, differential prevalence of, and physiological responses, to anxiety and depressive symptoms may contribute to physical and mental health disparities among sexual minority adults.",

          "authors": "Eik Niederlohmann",
          "abstract": "Clinical services need more than categorical labels to guide safe dosing, maintain alliance, and plan for functional recovery. The Conflict-Square Algorithm (CSA) offers a compact, bedside grammar for moment-to-moment decisions. Clinicians track four observable signals (Defense, Anxiety/Affect Tolerance, Progression, and Superego/Shame) and gate the intensity of work by three safety thresholds (A–C). Each clinically meaningful moment is closed with one disciplined sentence in plain language: trigger, observable response, threshold, action, and expected functional impact. This yields portable documentation for handoffs and supervision and translates directly into the shared Mini-ICF-APP language used by teams. A composite clinical case illustrates how graded dosing, stop-rules at cognitive–perceptual signs, and the protection of positive affect after progress reduce inadvertent destabilization and support steadier gains in assertiveness, endurance, planning, and dyadic relatedness. Conceptually, CSA remains school-agnostic and compatible with dimensional nosology (ICD-11; AMPD). We outline a pragmatic validation path focused on rater agreement for node/threshold identification, adherence to safety-critical dosing rules, alliance stability, and functional outcomes, so that claims remain modest and testable while the method stays close to clinical craft. An interpretative one-page framework is provided as Appendix A; detailed prompts, drills, and cross-walks remain in the supplements for pedagogy and audit.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD), characterized by marked mood instability, impulsivity, and relationship difficulties, is highly comorbid with depression. Depression manifests as persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or irritability, as well as significant somatic and cognitive impairments that interfere with daily functioning. Physical activity (PA) is now presented as a first-line monotherapy for depressive disorders. In addition, some recent studies also indicate an effect of PA on BPD symptoms. However, no studies have analyzed the effects of PA on depressive symptoms in people diagnosed with BPD. Objective: This study aimed to examine the relationship between PA and depressive disorder in individuals diagnosed with BPD. Method: Online questionnaires were completed by individuals with BPD in eight French- and English-speaking countries, covering sociodemographic characteristics, health status (symptoms of BPD and depression), and level of PA (including type, intensity, and time allocated). Results: Logistic regression analysis revealed that both leisure-related (p =.013) and transport-related PA .(p =.035) are associated with a reduction in the likelihood of experiencing various depressive disorder. Spearman correlations indicated significant associations between both leisure-time PA (ρ = -.291, &lt;.001) and total PA (ρ = -.179, p = .026) with depressive disorder. Conclusions: Engaging in PA is associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing depressive disorder. PA therefore represents a promising therapeutic option for individuals with BPD, both as a preventive factor against depressive disorder and as an accessible complementary intervention.",

          "abstract": "Serial order working memory, the ability to retain sequences of information, is crucial for \nlanguage, action planning, and recall, yet its representational basis is debated. A prominent account \nexplains serial order through spatial coding, whereby positions in a sequence are aligned along an \ninternal spatial axis and accessed via shifts of spatial attention. So far spatial coding may not fully \nexplain how order is maintained. A complementary possibility is that the brain forms a \nrepresentation of order, which makes abstraction of the original spatial frame and is generalizable \nacross contexts. Whether these two mechanisms coexist, and how they are instantiated in the brain, \nremains unclear.\nHere, we used fMRI to dissociate spatial and abstract representations of serial order. Participants \nmemorized sequences presented left-to-right or right-to-left, reversing the mapping between \nordinal position and space. Behavioral results showed that item retrieval was influenced by the \nspatial condition, with distinguishable spatial-order associations across encoding directions. \nMVPA revealed position-specific decoding in the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) for left-to-right \nsequences and in the right IPS for right-to-left sequences, without generalization across directions, \nshowing the spatial nature of these representations. By contrast, direction-invariant ordinal coding \nemerged in the supramarginal gyrus and precentral gyrus. In addition, activity in medial parietal \ncortex and hippocampus scaled with ordinal distance in the sequence. These results support a dual \nmechanism account: serial order is supported by a spatial code tied to experience, and by a more \nabstract ordinal code that extends beyond it to support serial order processes.",

          "abstract": "Effort influences decisions to initiate and sustain physical and cognitive tasks. Although the perception of effort is central to human behaviour, its underlying mechanisms—especially in the cognitive domain—remain poorly understood. Building on knowledge from physical exertion, this article introduces the concepts of effort and effort perception through a multidisciplinary lens, integrating insights from exercise sciences, (neuro)physiology, and psychology.\nWe begin by highlighting the inconsistent definitions of effort in the literature and propose a transdisciplinary definition: the intentional engagement of physical and cognitive resources to perform—or attempt to perform—a task. We then review methods for measuring effort, emphasizing the current limitations of physiological and performance-based variables. We argue that, when adequately contextualized as a unique perception dissociated from other exercise-related perceptions, the self-report of effort currently provides the most viable way to investigate effort.\nNext, we explore theoretical models explaining effort perception in physical tasks, focusing on the corollary discharge model as a promising theoretical framework. While this model offers valuable insights, it does not fully account for exerting effort during cognitive tasks. We suggest refining the corollary discharge model to encompass cognitive exertion, thus breaking the traditional silos between the physical and cognitive domains.\nFinally, we outline key challenges for future research: defining “resources” more clearly, developing reliable measurement tools for effort and its (neuro)physiological correlates, and determining whether effort perception is domain-general or domain-specific. We end by discussing the broad implications of our new account of effort for performance, health, and behavioural science.",

Here, we provide a database of norms for 480 German words across 35 semantic dimensions grounded in human perception, action, affective, social, and interaction events, selected based on well-established findings from the cognitive neurosciences. We show that our semantic dimensions successfully capture word distinctions between different semantic categories, even for more challenging abstract categories, as well as distinctions within the same semantic category, both of which would not be captured by a limited set of features only encompassing sensorimotor dimensions.

          "abstract": "Scaffolds are widely used to support self-regulated learning (SRL), and research has shown that students’ interactions with scaffolds impact their effectiveness. Prior research has primarily classified scaffold interaction as a binary construct (e.g., compliance vs non-compliance), which oversimplifies complex scaffold interaction patterns and limits understanding of the effectiveness of scaffolds. The present study addressed this limitation by  adopting a more nuanced learning analytic perspective to examine the range and quality of scaffold interaction using multimodal data. In a pre-post-test experiment, university students (n = 67) learned with adaptive scaffolds—differentiated as just-in-time or on-demand—in a 45-minute learning session using a technology-enhanced learning environment. Combining logfile and eye-tracking data, we identified distinct interaction profiles through hierarchical agglomerative clustering of students’ scaffold interactions over the course of learning. Learners who engaged more consistently and actively with scaffolds demonstrated higher levels of cognitive activity changes and achieved stronger performance in essay tasks than peers with minimal or purely visual interaction (i.e., sighting but not acting on scaffolds). The process model comparison highlighted differences in the temporal structure of learning and scaffold interaction activities between groups with varying interaction profiles. These findings highlight the shortcomings of binary classifications and provide new insights into how adaptive scaffolds can be designed to respond to diverse interaction patterns and better foster SRL.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness, which has reached an all-time high in the United States, has been linked to reduced self-reported empathy. Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) is aimed at extending love and kindness to others and has been shown to increase empathy. But whether LKM can reduce loneliness, and whether this corresponds to higher levels of trait empathy, state empathy, and/or neural empathic responding, has not been assessed. In this pre-registered mixed-design randomized controlled trial, 108 participants completed LKM or active control training. Loneliness and trait empathy were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Neural empathic responding was measured in 54 participants during functional MRI by computing the multi-voxel pattern similarity between experiencing and observing both pain and fearful anticipation of pain. Both interventions reduced loneliness, but not trait empathy, which failed to support the hypothesis that LKM is effective in reducing loneliness by increasing empathy. Furthermore, we found no credible evidence that loneliness is associated with differences in neural empathic responding or state empathy for pain. However, loneliness was associated with lower self-reported empathy. Together, these results suggest that lonelier individuals simulate others’ experiences but may not subjectively perceive themselves as empathetic, emphasizing the potential of loneliness interventions that address maladaptive social cognition.",

          "abstract": "Our social environment plays a crucial role in our behavior, including substance use and other impulsive and sensation seeking behaviors. While most research in these fields focus on the role of group pressure and conformity, the importance of social attunement - the tendency to harmonize with and adapt to the social environment to find social reward in the absence of explicit group pressure – has been overlooked. In this study, we assessed the psychometric properties of the English translation of the social attunement questionnaire (SAQ) and assessed how social attunement is associated with age, alcohol use, cannabis use, impulsivity, and sensation seeking (N = 447, 54.5% female). Confirmatory factor analysis showed an acceptable to good fit to the original two-factor structure (RMSEA = .068; CFI = .959; TLI = .947). Internal consistency of the full scale ( = .82), cognition subscale ( = .75) and behavior subscale ( = .78) were sufficient to good, and the SAQ displayed good measurement invariance to sex. Younger individuals displayed higher social attunement, and SAQ scores – guided by the behavior subscale – were positively associated with alcohol and cannabis use, as well as impulsivity. Furthermore, age moderated the association between SAQ scores and alcohol consumption as well as the association between SAQ scores and sensation seeking; while the associations were positive in younger individuals, the associations became more negative with increasing age. These results show that high social attunement might be both a risk and protective factor for the engagement in risk-taking behaviors depending on age.",

Primary concerns included preference for human judgment (46.2%), accuracy and reliability (45.7%), and ethical issues (38.2%). Only 6.2% reported formal institutional GenAI policies, and 94.8% never entered personally identifiable information into GenAI systems; only 12.2% obtained informed consent from stakeholders to use GenAI. While 68.3% believed practitioners should receive GenAI training, 42.2% reported receiving no training, with most (73.2%) desiring formal webinar-based instruction.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Occupational therapy practitioners reported significant GenAI use. Participants also noted substantial concerns about ethical implementation, data security, and loss of clinical skills. Findings suggest that critical gaps in formal training and institutional guidance exist. Evidence-based frameworks and structured educational initiatives to ensure GenAI integration aligns with client-centered, ethical practice standards are needed.\n\nPlain-Language Summary: This study examined how occupational therapy practitioners in Ohio currently use GenAI tools in their work. Survey results indicated that while many practitioners are experimenting with GenAI for tasks like writing notes and organizing information, they have serious concerns about protecting stakeholder privacy and whether GenAI can truly understand the complexities of occupational therapy practice.

          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

          "abstract": "There has been extensive research on how automated vehicles (AVs) should interact with pedestrians, most of which focused on explicit communication via external Human–Machine Interface (eHMI). However, evidence from human–human interactions shows that pedestrians rarely rely on explicit signals; instead, they predominantly interpret implicit cues from vehicle movements. Prior AV research has generally not designed motion cues to resemble human driving behaviours, which may have exaggerated dependence on eHMIs. This study asks: how would human-like AV kinematics modulate the influence of eHMIs on pedestrian behaviour? In a within-participant design, forty participants completed a cave-based pedestrian simulator experiment examining three deceleration profiles: (1) HH - human-like deceleration pattern and stopping distance; (2) AH - non-human-like deceleration pattern and human-like stopping distance (AH); (3) AA - non-human-like deceleration and stopping distance. The presence of eHMI was also manipulated. Dependent variables include Crossing Initiation Time (CIT), Perceived Safety (PS), Reaction Time to perceiving deceleration onset (RTdec) and Reaction Time to perceiving the eHMI (RTeHMI). Using Bayesian Multilevel Distributional Models, results showed that human-like behaviour (both HH and AH) led to shorter CIT, higher PS ratings compared to AA. HH and AH were largely similar, with only a subtle difference in RTdec. Due to the high saliency of eHMI, HH and AH showed slight additional improvements in CIT and PS compared to without. This study demonstrates that adopting human-like behaviours can substantially enhance AV-pedestrian interaction, without introducing the safety concerns often associated with eHMI, presenting a promising approach for AV communication.",

However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, many workplace interactions moved online, where the wearing of ancillary clothing was less commonplace. Here, using 208 employees at an Aerospace and Technology organisation based in the United Kingdom, we show that on average wearing ancillary clothing increased perceptions of occupationally positive attributes. However, we also found stark gender differences, with males rated, on average, as being higher in authority and confidence, and females higher in trustworthiness, regardless of ancillary clothing. Females wearing ancillary clothing denoting expertise were found to be perceived as having less authority and less confidence as males without ancillary clothing. These findings indicate that although ancillary clothing boost perceptions of organisational attributes, gender biases persist around authority, confidence and trustworthiness.",

          "abstract": "Mental health awareness efforts are increasing, especially for ADHD. There is growing evidence that such efforts may also cause unnecessary self-diagnosis and worsening symptoms for some disorders. Yet, there are no validated approaches to avoid these potential harms without simply reducing the awareness efforts. Thus, we developed a multi-faceted intervention, nocebo education, to reduce these harms; the intervention is based on the principles of the nocebo effect, i.e., the effect of negative expectations causing symptom misattribution and worsening. We tested whether this intervention could mitigate false self-diagnosis and symptom worsening from ADHD awareness. In a double-blind randomised controlled trial with a week-long follow-up (NCT06638411), 215 healthy young adults (77% women) were randomised to participate in a workshop on either ADHD awareness, ADHD combined with nocebo education, or control (sleep). We measured changes in self-diagnosis and ADHD symptoms immediately after the workshop (self-diagnosis), and one-week later (self-diagnosis and symptoms).   \nADHD group reported substantially higher self-diagnosis scores immediately (𝛽_standardised= 0.80) and one week after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.50) compared to controls. These effects persisted despite no changes in reported symptoms. Nocebo education halved the false self-diagnosis scores immediately after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.45) and eliminated it at follow-up. We show that being exposed to ADHD awareness reliably increases false self-diagnosis among healthy young adults for at least one week; a brief nocebo education intervention is efficacious in substantially reducing and eliminating this harm. Nocebo education is a promising adjunct for balanced awareness efforts that could be applied in various contexts.",

          "abstract": "In the Olympic sport of speed climbing, athletes compete to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. Since the standardization of the speed climbing route in 2007, improvement has been driven by a process of cumulative cultural evolution—new route sequences innovated by some are copied and improved upon by others. In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competition times (2007-2019). In the fitted model, innovation and copying are used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a slight advantage. Slower agents are more likely to innovate, likely in pursuit of strategies that give them a competitive advantage. Population size negatively predicts innovation, presumably because innovation is not as useful when there are plenty of existing solutions to choose from. An additional analysis of real route sequences from 2012-2019 World Championships suggests that other factors, like height and weight, influence the use of some holds, but may not affect performance or the probability of adopting innovations. Finally, the model suggests that climbers may not be using innovation and copying optimally—continued improvement may require more emphasis on innovation and less reliance on copying.",

          "abstract": "Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) poses a growing clinical challenge in adolescence, while imagery of NSSI is increasingly embedded in everyday digital life. Prior research indicates that adolescents who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury orient more rapidly toward NSSI-related imagery and report heightened urges to self-injure after viewing such content. What remains unknown is how social stress shapes these attentional biases. In the present study, we tested whether experimentally induced ostracism modifies attention to NSSI images, urges to self-injure, and autonomic regulation in adolescents with recent NSSI.\nFifty adolescents who engaged in recent NSSI (M = 16.40 years, SD = 1.33) were randomized to inclusion vs. exclusion in an in-person ball-tossing ostracism paradigm and then completed free-viewing eye-tracking (with stimuli durations of 500/1000 ms) and dot-probe tasks (200/500 ms) that included NSSI images. NSSI urges, perceived stress, heart rate, and heart rate variability (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences, RMSSD) were assessed throughout the experiment.\nSocial exclusion produced sustained reductions in RMSSD relative to inclusion, with no reliable heart rate differences. During free-viewing, both groups preferentially fixated NSSI images, but exclusion reduced the probability of first fixations on NSSI. In the dot-probe task, exclusion amplified the slowing from congruent to incongruent trials for NSSI. After viewing NSSI images, both groups showed increased urges and stress, with larger increases after exclusion.\nAcute interpersonal rejection reorganized attention, dampening initial gaze capture yet impairing later disengagement, occurring in the context of vagal withdrawal. These dynamics may help explain how social stress potentiates NSSI risk in everyday digital environments and highlight interpersonal context and post-rejection coping as modifiable targets for intervention.\n\nTrial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register Identifier: DRKS00025905",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nLong COVID is characterised by persistent symptoms, especially fatigue. We investigated the severity and impact of cognitive and physical fatigue in Long COVID, exploring associations with autonomic symptoms, interoceptive sensibility, illness perceptions and distress, underpinned by a novel framework integrating active inference and the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation.\n\nMethod\n\nOnline cross-sectional survey between November 2024 and September 2025. Adults with self-reported COVID-19 and ≥12 weeks of fatigue symptoms were recruited via convenience sampling and completed validated questionnaires assessing fatigue, autonomic symptoms, interoceptive sensibility, illness perceptions and distress. Correlations and regression analyses examined associations between variables. \n\nResults\n\n183 participants completed the survey. Fatigue severity and impact were high, with physical fatigue rated more severe (Z = −2.96, p = .003) and impactful (Z = -8.714, p &lt; .001) than cognitive fatigue. Correlational analyses showed moderate-to-strong associations between fatigue and autonomic symptoms, interoception, illness perceptions and distress. In regression models, these variables explained 21–54% of variance in fatigue. Autonomic symptoms were positively associated with cognitive and physical fatigue. Depression was associated with cognitive fatigue. Illness perceptions were associated with physical, but not cognitive fatigue. Interoceptive sensibility showed both positive and negative associations with fatigue.\n\nConclusions\n\nLong COVID fatigue is severe and multifaceted. It involves a dynamic interplay between dysfunction in physiological systems, illness perceptions, and distress, with interactions varying across dimensions of fatigue. We propose a framework of interacting physiological and psychological factors that shape the prediction and processing of bodily signals, ultimately giving rise to fatigue.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents learn to navigate increasingly complex social environments, where flexible and efficient\ncognitive mechanisms are needed to behave adaptively. Prominent theories of cognitive maturation suggest\nthat adolescents’ decision-making is noisier than adults’ and that their decisions can be swayed by irrelevant\ninformation. By contrast, here, we suggest that cognitive development also allows them to increasingly use\ncombinatorial representations of social input. This manifests in emergent use of abstract social basis\nfunctions across adolescent development. Social basis functions represent combinations of individuals’\ninteractions (e.g., patterns of cooperation and competition) and allow for efficient information compression.\nIn a novel in-person group decision-making experiment with adolescents (n = 50) and young adults (n =\n50), we confirmed a counterintuitive set of predictions derived from the basis function model: Adults made\nmore accurate decisions than adolescents, but, in parallel, they increasingly made a specific type of decision\nerror more frequently than adolescents. They ‘mixed up’ relevant and irrelevant players as a function of the\ngroup structure of the task. Using multi-attribute drift diffusion modelling, we show that the observed age\ndifferences are consistent with a stronger influence of the group structure during social decision-making in\nadults. Together, these findings suggest that cognitive development during adolescence involves\nfundamental shifts in the use of abstract social representations generally and in the use of combinatorial\nsocial basis functions in particular.",

Suicidal behavior disorder (SBD), included in DSM-5 for research purposes, has not yet been examined in this population.\nMethods: In a sample of N = 103 treatment-seeking refugees, SBD prevalence was assessed using a clinical interview. Associations between suicidality (presence and severity) and risk factors—gender, age, PTSD, disorders of self-organization (DSO), depression, insecure asylum status, flight duration, postmigration living difficulties (PMLD)—as well as the protective factor religiosity were examined via univariate and multivariate analyses.\nResults: SBD prevalence was 14.41% (n = 15). DSO and an insecure asylum status were associated with the presence of suicidality in univariate and multivariate analyses and with the severity of suicidality in multivariate analyses. Sexual trauma frequency was associated with the presence of suicidality, while PTSD severity and lower religiosity were linked to greater suicidality severity. Depressive symptoms were associated with suicidality only in univariate analyses.\nConclusion: Suicidality should be systematically assessed in treatment-seeking refugees, particularly those with DSO or an insecure asylum status. Brief suicide prevention interventions may be warranted when treatment duration is uncertain, and targeted PTSD treatments should be offered when indicated.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive models, such as evidence-accumulation models, are increasingly used in individual differences research in psychology and neuroscience. By computing correlations between cognitive model parameters across participants, researchers aim to understand how the psychological processes the parameters represent relate to one another and jointly determine performance. It is generally acknowledged that cognitive models can be challenging to estimate due to strong within-subject correlations among the parameters, which are embedded in the model’s likelihood function. What is less often recognized, however, is that within-subject correlations can also distort correlations computed between parameters estimated with non-hierarchical methods, so they no longer reflect true individual differences, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. Here we illustrate this pitfall of non-hierarchical estimation and show how appropriately parameterized hierarchical models can mitigate the problem by effectively separating within- and between-subject sources of variation. We then offer recommendations for identifying and guarding against the inferential biases resulting from the strong within-subject correlations inherent in many cognitive models.",

          "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) from frequency-tagging (FT) paradigms are widely used to investigate visual processing. Yet their association to conscious perception remains unclear. To test whether SSVEP occurs during conscious perception or without consciousness, 32 participants saw sequences of different images presented at 6 Hz (6 images per second) and containing faces every fifth image (1.2 Hz). All images were presented at either a face-categorisation-threshold contrast (1%) or a supraliminal contrast (1.5%). After each sequence, participants had to categorise the face gender (objective perception) and rate their confidence in this categorisation and the visibility of the faces (subjective perception). During the sequence presentation, participants’ attention was monitored via an orthogonal fixation-cross task. Results showed that, at 1.5% contrast, the face signal was higher during correct than during incorrect gender categorisation and increased linearly with both visibility and confidence ratings. In line with participants’ performance on the fixation-cross task, the signal collected at 6 Hz also indicated that attention related more closely to confidence than to visibility. At 1% contrast however, no face perception occurred behaviourally, which was confirmed by an absence of brain signal recorded in response to face instances. Overall these findings show that SSVEPs can track both the objective and subjective perception of faces at a supraliminal, hence conscious, contrast (1.5%). These findings bring new evidence that SSVEPs can be used as a marker of conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a fundamental part of human communication and integral to cognitive development and education. Yet although previous research has examined questions in non-longitudinal lab settings, there is sparse research on how our question asking originality and complexity changes over time and how it is influenced by knowledge acquired. In the current study we investigate the effect of acquired knowledge on question asking and its predictive ability of educational outcomes such as final tests and projects. Undergraduate university students (N = 68) who participated in a semester-long “Intro to Psychology” course were assessed on their general and course specific question asking ability (originality and complexity) using two question asking tasks. They completed these tasks at the beginning and end of their semester-long course, alongside open-ended final projects and an end of class multiple choice closed-ended test. We find that students’ domain-specific question asking ability improved during the course, yet general question asking ability stagnated and even declined. Both general and specific question asking ability were negatively correlated with closed-ended test scores, while general ability was positively correlated with open-ended final project scores. These novel results highlight the important role of knowledge in question asking, and the potential of question asking ability in predicting and perhaps improving education assessment outcomes. They also advance our understanding of the way we ask questions, the differences between open- and closed-ended assessment and pave the way for future pedagogical interventions based on enhancing question asking ability.",

          "abstract": "Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that has been robustly implicated in several internalising psychopathologies, particularly anxiety disorders. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in multiple sclerosis (MS) and the inherent uncertainty associated with the disease, it is unclear whether current measures of IU are appropriate for people with MS. In this study, we describe the psychometric features of the short-form Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) in a mixed sample of 2117 participants (244 MS, 1873 non-MS controls). Specific aims were to (i) assess the internal reliability and dimensionality of the IUS-12; (ii) test measurement invariance across MS and non-MS groups; and (iii) determine construct validity by correlating the IUS-12 with measures of psychological distress and anxiety, test-retest reliability and temporal stability over a six-month interval, and clinical utility of the IUS-12 in detecting clinically significant symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health anxiety. A bifactor model, comprising a General IU factor and two group factors (Prospective IU and Inhibitory IU), best represented the IUS-12. Measurement invariance was found across MS and non-MS participants. The IUS-12 had good construct validity and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .62) over the six-month survey period. Given the central role of uncertainty in the lived experience of MS, these findings support the use of the IUS-12 as a psychometrically sound measure of IU in this population. Routine assessment incorporating the IUS-12 may help inform the development of targeted psychological interventions for people with MS.",

Daily Growth is a digital parenting program designed to improve parent and child emotion regulation using an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) approach. Daily Growth sends twice-daily prompts and delivers 3-minute videos tailored to a recent parenting situation, offering two program types (Emotion Coaching; Active Play) to meet different parent preferences. EMI has been minimally tested with parenting programs. This pilot aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the EMI design and a prototype of Daily Growth, offering the two programs via 10 of 90 planned videos. \nMethods: A pilot randomised controlled trial recruited 189 Australian parents of children aged 2-4 years, randomised to either intervention (n=94) or active control (n=95). Participants completed a 25-minute online survey at baseline and 2 weeks post intervention. In the intervening 2 weeks, participants received twice-daily 1-minute pre-EMI surveys via email. Participants who reported any parent or child negative affect or emotion dysregulation received a resource. Participants in the intervention condition were randomised in the moment to receive a 3-minute Emotion Coaching or Active Play video, while participants in the control condition received a link to a parenting website. Participants were sent a 1-minute post-EMI survey. For both conditions, parenting support was tailored to one of five pre-defined parenting situations. \nResults: 71% of participants were retained to 2 weeks post survey, and over two thirds completed at least half of the daily pre-EMI surveys. Despite technical issues, most participants reported Daily Growth as easy to use (67%) and were satisfied with Daily Growth (60%), would recommend it to other parents (79%), and would use the skills learned (69%).\nConclusions: This pilot evaluated whether brief, tailored videos could engage parents in real time. Findings suggest the Daily Growth prototype was feasible and well received, supporting further implementation in a larger trial.",

Thirty-three 4–5-year-olds completed same/different judgments while their gaze patterns were continuously recorded. Children selected the relational match at levels that were significantly above chance performance. When children made relational choices, their gaze followed the sequence of an initial look to the relational match to establish alignment, a comparison of both alternatives, and a final return to the relational match to confirm the mapping, consistent with structure-mapping theory. The findings demonstrate that preschoolers can engage relational reasoning even when they do not express relational language and reveal the dynamic process that contributes to relational reasoning.",

The framework distinguishes between true and false replication successes and failures, revealing the underlying composition of observed replication results and how they are shaped by study-level factors in both the original and replication studies. Using a large-scale simulation, we evaluated four meta-analytic Bayes factor (MABF) methods as tools for determining replication success within this framework. Results showed that the MABF methods were generally more effective at ruling out spurious effects than at confirming small true effects. The one-sided fixed-effect meta-analytic Bayes factor and the inclusion Bayes factor methods most reliably identified genuine replication success. The framework illustrates how bias and methodological choices influence the underlying composition of replication outcomes. These findings provide a more nuanced understanding of replication results and offer practical guidance for designing and evaluating future large-scale replication projects to strengthen research reproducibility.",

          "abstract": "Retrieval practice is one of the most effective strategies for enhancing long-term memory. Building on recent work (Shi &amp; Liu, 2025), we investigated error-driven learning (EDL) as a unified mechanistic account, which posits that memory improvement is shaped by two key signals: objective error—quantified as retrieval inaccuracy—and subjective error estimates, reflected in confidence judgments, which regulate how objective errors are processed. Using a continuous color-wheel paradigm with fMRI, this study examined the neural substrates of EDL and the modulatory role of confidence. Behaviorally, both larger objective error and lower confidence independently predicted greater subsequent memory improvement. Neurally, analyses of univariate activation, functional connectivity, and multivoxel pattern similarity revealed two dissociable yet interacting systems gated by confidence: Memory-related circuits, such as functional connectivity between the hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus, were preferentially engaged under low confidence, leveraging objective retrieval errors to drive memory updating. In contrast, metamemory-related regions—including the striatum, thalamus, and supramarginal gyrus—were recruited under high confidence to process prediction errors elicited by unexpected retrieval failures. Together, these findings demonstrate how confidence dynamically regulates the recruitment of distinct neural circuits in support of retrieval-based learning, offering broad implications for educational interventions and memory rehabilitation.",

This review synthesizes the large and diverse literature on action semantics in individuals with neurological disorders characterized by prominent motor deficits (e.g., Parkinson’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), as well as those for whom motor deficits are often less prominent (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, stroke). Research in these two groups of disorders is strikingly “siloed” and offers many contradictory findings with respect to whether action semantic representations are abstract (i.e., “disembodied”) or grounded in sensory and motor features that reflect the way knowledge was acquired. Findings across these populations also disagree as to whether action semantic representations are organized somatotopically or with a semantic feature-based architecture, and mediated by anterior motor-related or relatively posterior sensory-related brain regions. Many of these disparate findings can be reconciled with consideration of a multidimensional, multimodal representational architecture mediated by a distributed left-lateralized network of brain regions. We provide suggestions for specific methodological approaches for research with neurological populations that may further our understanding of the format, organization, and neural substrates of action semantics.",

Children’s symbolic counting skills (i.e., acquisition of the cardinal principle) predicted this shift across two studies, even when accounting for approximate number acuity and symbolic and non-symbolic understanding of null sets, though this effect emerged only for children’s tolerance of selfish sharing—most forms of generous sharing were tolerated regardless of numerical abilities. Our results suggest a developmental shift from an abstract notion of learning to an increasingly precise notion of equality as children acquire symbolic counting skills.",

          "abstract": "The triggers that induce scrupulosity-related distress can vary, depending on an individual’s religious/moral worldview. Accounting for cultural context surrounding one’s obsessions could improve the sensitivity of tests for scrupulosity. With cultural context in mind, we designed the Religious Distress Task (RDT) to elicit negative emotions in members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) with scrupulosity. This study evaluated the factor structure, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency of the RDT in three samples of LDS individuals (N1 = 392, N2 = 607, and N3 = 40 scrupulous and 34 control). Across samples, between 59% and 68% of participants identified as female, while 90% to 100% identified as white, and 88% to 93% identified as non-Hispanic or Latino. An EFA was performed in sample 1 and a CFA in sample 2. The EFA revealed a two-factor structure (factor 1: l = .59 - .77; factor 2: l = .54 - .91). The CFA supported these findings (factor 1: l = .53 - .86; factor 2: l = .74 - .88). All samples demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability and internal consistency (r = .77 - .90; a = .86 - .96). Accounting for cultural and religious background when designing measures of scrupulosity may improve their psychometric properties.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Sleep problems are linked to negative mental health outcomes, both of which rise in prevalence during adolescence and young adulthood. Existing evidence-based sleep treatments are effective but remain largely inaccessible for this age group. Young people also have lower agency over structural barriers affecting sleep (e.g., home environment, school start times).\n\nMethods: Project Sleep is a digital single-session intervention (SSI) designed with feedback from young people. Participants were aged 13-25 with self-reported sleep problems (N=759, Mage=18.7; 48% white, 81% girls, 38% LGBTQ+). Structural sleep barriers were reported by 45%: uncomfortable temperature (20%), exceess noise (17%), shared rooms (13%), excess light (10%), nighttime workers in the home (7%), unstable living conditions (2%). Participants rated perceived importance of sleep and making a change to sleep, readiness for change, and perceived control over sleep pre- and post-SSI. Moderation models assessed whether structural factors influenced outcomes. T-tests and correlations tested whether participants’ feedback differed by structural barriers. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.\n\nResults: After adjusting for multiple comparisons, those experiencing structural barriers improved similarly to peers on all pre/post-SSI change metrics (corrected ps &gt; .05). There were also no differences in participants’ feedback about their experience of the SSI by structural barrier (ps &gt; .05).\n\nConclusions: This brief, accessible SSI provides proximal support for youth with structural sleep barriers. However, areas that could benefit from continued adaption are discussed. Future research will work with young people experiencing structural sleep barriers to best address their needs.",

To characterise attentional effects on qualia, we combined a dual-task attention paradigm with similarity rating tasks to examine whether relational structures of qualia are altered by top-down attentional amplification. Under the same physical input, withdrawing attention collapsed the structures of qualia of letters (N=14) and red/green bisected disks (N=14), but not of faces (N=13), as quantified via a novel unsupervised optimal transport alignment technique. Alignment accuracy was high for face qualia structures obtained under the fully versus poorly attended conditions but not for the letters and disks. Our novel approach that combines similarity ratings, quantitative alignment and attentional perturbation is a powerful new approach to elucidate the structural properties of consciousness.",

          "authors": "Rosaline Qi; Phuc T. Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Background: Childhood adversity is common and linked to negative physical and mental outcomes. Women, especially those with neurodevelopmental conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are at heightened risk for greater adversity exposure and more severe long-term outcomes. A dimensional model of adversity differentiates threat-related adversity (e.g., abuse, violence) from deprivation-related adversity (e.g., neglect, household dysfunction), which may have distinct developmental impacts. This study examined whether adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in a longitudinal cohort of women with and without childhood ADHD could be separated into threat and deprivation dimensions, and whether these dimensions differentially predict young adult outcomes.\nMethods: Participants were drawn from a 25-year longitudinal study of 228 girls (140 with childhood ADHD, 88 without). In young adulthood (mean age ~25), participants reported on 10 ACEs. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to derive threat and deprivation components of adversity. Regression models tested each component’s associations with adult psychopathology (internalizing and externalizing symptom composites) and academic achievement, controlling for childhood ADHD diagnosis and baseline symptom levels.\nResults: PCA identified two adversity components corresponding to threat and deprivation, consistent with theory. This two-factor structure held for both the ADHD and comparison groups. Women with childhood ADHD reported higher overall ACE exposure than those without ADHD. Higher threat scores uniquely predicted greater young adult internalizing and externalizing symptoms even after accounting for childhood symptom levels and ADHD status. In contrast, deprivation scores were not uniquely associated with these mental health outcomes in combined models, and neither adversity dimension significantly predicted adult academic performance.\nConclusions: Distinct dimensions of childhood adversity can be identified and have different predictive relevance. Threat-related adversities in particular conferred persistent risk for psychopathology into early adulthood beyond prior vulnerabilities. Findings point to the importance of trauma-informed interventions and support a dimensional approach to adversity in clinical practice and developmental psychopathology research.",

          "abstract": "The interaction between social media use and mental health is of great public health concern. Studies so far, largely employing self-reported measures of social media use, have produced inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of social media on mental health. Focusing on objective behavioral markers and the psychological mechanisms underlying how users interact with social media platforms could be key to greater insight on this topic. Here we use Twitter data to study how depression modulates a central behavioral process on social media: the response to the social rewards (e.g. likes, shares, views) users receive when they post. Reinforcement learning theory predicts that social media rewards will reinforce posting behavior, such that receiving more likes will lead to posting more frequently and spending more time on the platform. However, laboratory tasks often show blunted reinforcement learning in depression, suggesting a potential attenuation of the effects of social rewards on posting behavior. Across 3 datasets with varied measures of depression and data collection strategies (over 17 million tweets from 7,736 users in total, including a pre-registered replication), we consistently found that depression was associated with a larger reinforcing effect of likes on posting on the next day. In other words, users with depression showed heightened sensitivity to social media rewards, in contrast to findings from laboratory-based tasks. These results identify a psychological mechanism that may link social media use to poor mental health, and underscore the importance of testing the generalizability of in-lab computational psychiatry findings to real-world environments.",

          "authors": "David Herdman; William Sedley; Toby Ellmers; Sanjay Manohar; Karl Friston; Diego Kaski",
          "abstract": "Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD) is a common and disabling chronic disorder, comprising core symptom clusters involving perceived (i.e., subjective) unsteadiness during upright posture and intolerance for self- and visual motion. There are diagnostic criteria, conceptual models and therapeutic approaches to managing specific components of PPPD, such as physiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and anti-depressant medication. However, no diagnostic tests or unifying neurobiological basis for the condition exists. PPPD has been viewed as a subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND), sharing some similarities in altered brain function and behaviour, but lacks other hallmarks of FND. Here, using the framework of Active Inference - in which both action and perception are based on internal predictions about the state of the body and the world and their precision (estimated reliability) - we define a singular neurobiological process responsible for core PPPD symptoms: namely, a failure to attenuate precision-weighted prediction error (PWPE) during self-motion, leading to subjective postural instability. Specifically, self-motion prediction errors per se are not increased, but their precision weighting is, thereby reducing the relative precision of self-motion predictions. More simply, this reflects a shift of operating mode from top-down, efficient ‘autopilot’ to a ‘feedback’ mode, dominated by bottom-up sensory processing errors. Ordinarily, experience-dependent learning naturally produces a drift to the autopilot mode, but we present four processes - each potentially present in any individual and characterised by a positive feedback loop - that keep the system stuck in a feedback mode, resulting in PPPD: elevated attention/vigilance; perceptual inferences of imbalance; preventative or corrective movement behaviours; and over-reliance on visual inputs. This model can form the basis of tools for clinical assessment and management. Finally, the foundation of our model – on defined and measurable neurobiological processes – affords testable hypotheses for investigative work and lends itself to computational modelling. A modified version of the model can also explain other forms of chronic dizziness without structural causes, like Mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS), or ‘unexplained dizziness’ in later life.",

The theory is grounded\nin a mixed-method study of 497 survey responses across a broad, global demographic and 18\nin-depth interviews of individuals reporting high levels of happiness. High degrees of\ncorrelation were found between happiness and qualities associated with self-transcendence,\nincluding presence, a felt unity with life, and emotional equilibrium. Qualitative data\nsupported these findings, with participants frequently describing happiness as a feeling or\nsense of contentment, connection, and alignment with life, expressed as feelings of peace and\njoy. The theory proposes that happiness arises when ego-based striving diminishes, and\nindividuals reconnect with an expanded sense of self, a broader, more inclusive identity\nmarked by inner coherence, felt connection, and reduced identification with the ego. It builds\non existing psychological models by illuminating the inner, experiential structure of\npsychological well-being.

          "abstract": "Prediction error during memory reactivation is posited to be a key driver of memory updating. However, prediction error leads to varied memory outcomes, and it is unclear what specific factors influence memory malleability. Two factors have long been theorized to shape a memory’s susceptibility to modification – the age and strength of the memory at reactivation – but their interaction with prediction error has not been directly tested in complex, naturalistic events. In a three-session paradigm using short videos with salient action–outcome narratives, we elicited prediction error by interrupting expected outcome endings during reactivation. Following reactivation, participants viewed semantically similar videos introducing new information that could be incorporated into an updated memory. Memory age was manipulated by varying the delay between encoding and reactivation (1h, 24h, or 2w), and memory strength was measured with participants’ ratings of recollection quality after each video reactivation. We found that prediction error at reactivation selectively increased the intrusion of newly experienced information for weak, but not strong, memories at reactivation. In contrast, the age of a memory at reactivation neither interacted with prediction error nor influenced memory outcomes. These findings identify memory strength, not age, as the critical boundary condition for prediction error driven memory updating in human episodic memory.",

SPS correlated positively with the ADHD-related strengths of hyperfocus and cognitive flexibility, and the SPS aesthetic sensitivity subdimension additionally with curiosity, humour, and empathy; these associations remained significant correcting for ADHD traits.

          "abstract": "Prospective memory (PM) offloading -- setting reminders to support future intentions -- can help older adults mitigate age-related memory declines. However, prior research suggests they may not always fully benefit from available reminders. This study examined metacognitive factors influence age differences in PM offloading across three within-subjects conditions: forced internal (reminders set for no PM targets), forced external (reminders set for all PM targets), and choice (target-by-target reminder setting). Metacognitive monitoring was measured through judgments of learning that estimated how accurately participants believed they would remember the targets without reminders. Metacognitive control was indexed by the proportion of targets for which reminders were set in the choice block and by the frequency of reminder checking during retrieval, recorded via eye tracking. Although reminders improved PM, age-related declines in PM performance were not reduced in the forced or choice conditions. Older adults were overconfident in their performance predictions across all conditions (metacognitive monitoring error). They also did not set or check reminders more frequently than younger adults, despite having more to gain from doing so (metacognitive control error). These findings suggest that metacognitive errors may limit older adults' ability to fully capitalize on offloading strategies.",

          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle throughout the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' choices systematically deviate from both imitation and optimization. Instead, they follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their choices stabilize. We effectively estimate this threshold using the Tolerance Principle (TP), a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. We show that threshold-based agents produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents, while also providing a better model of how a critical mass of dissenters can overturn conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. Furthermore, in a preregistered dyadic experiment requiring people to infer non-linguistic behavioral patterns amid controlled levels of noise in observed signals, TP outperforms all other models at reproducing learning rates among human participants. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

Here, we replicated the finding that loopholes are less costly than non-compliance in neutral contexts, but found that loopholes were as bad as non-compliance in moral contexts (Experiment 1, N = 360). We then directly compared the behaviors to see if, in moral contexts, exploiting a loophole might be even worse than non-compliance (Experiment 2, N=150). We replicated the finding that loopholes are more exonerating in neutral than moral contexts, and that moral context has a differential effect, but did not find a reversal (Experiment 2, N=150). Finally, we assessed three negative indirect costs of loopholes (blame, permissibility, and offense) and again found a differential effect of moral context (Experiment 3, N = 453).

          "abstract": "Arbitrary social hierarchies permeate our working lives in ways not always visible, introducing anti-egalitarian norms which stymie productivity. Reviewing bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We contend that the literatures converge on a single, sobering logic: because organizations are embedded in—and seek legitimacy from—broader socio-historical contexts, the same arbitrary hierarchies that stratify societies are naturally imported into organizational life. At the same time, individuals are motivated to obscure the influence of these hierarchies to reduce psychological distress. We leverage institutional theory and systems psychodynamics to map how organizations are at the crux of external pressures (from society) and upward pressure (from employees) which both perpetuate and obfuscate the replication of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in organizations. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the commonplace or subtle nature of the microaggression to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – anti-egalitarian organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in their workplace.",

However, daily processes related to conflict and positive and negative affect have been overlooked. We tested the mutual effects between parent-adolescent conflict and affect in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries between 14 to 21 days to rate their positive and negative affect, and conflict interactions between October 2021 and August 2023. The participants were mostly from families with high socioeconomic status, most of the parents were biological mothers, and over half of the parents were Caucasian. Adolescents were between 13 and 17 years (M = 14.37, SD = 1.28). We tested the daily associations between negative/positive affect and conflict interactions in one dynamic structural equation model (DSEM). Contrary to our expectations, greater adolescent negative affect on a day was associated with lower parent-reported conflict next day. Further, both within- and between-family level correlations between adolescent and parent negative and positive affect were significant. Greater parent and adolescent conflict was related to lower positive and greater negative affect for parents and adolescents. Thus, while both same-day and mean-level associations over time indicate that conflicts are linked to poorer affective well-being, and parents may have made efforts to improve their affect the following day in an attempt to compensate for the conflicts experienced the day before. Further, this effort was appeared to be driven by the adolescents’ rather than the parents’ emotional experiences.",

          "abstract": "A recently published pilot study, \"Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Chronic Post-Traumatic\nStress Disorder in Syrian Refugee Women – A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study\" by Timotaos\nBasmaji (2025), demonstrated the effectiveness of culturally adapted Virtual Reality\nExposure Therapy (VRET) in reducing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among\nSyrian refugee women residing in Lebanon. The intervention resulted in a mean reduction of\n30.75 points on the PCL-5, exceeding typical outcomes reported in the literature. This brief\nreport explores a contextual factor not addressed in the original analysis: the impact of trauma\nreactivation due to concurrent regional conflict. During baseline assessment, participants were\nexposed to war-related media coverage and escalating hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel,\nlikely triggering symptom spikes. Drawing on trauma theory and neuroscience, this report\nintroduces and coins the reactivation-enhanced therapeutic response hypothesis, suggesting\nthat symptom elevation may prime emotional memory systems for deeper reconsolidation during\ntherapy. These findings underscore the importance of crisis-sensitive timing and highlight the\nneed for rapid-access trauma interventions during reactivation windows in humanitarian settings.",

          "abstract": "Real-world assets---such as projects, jobs, skills, or relationships---change endogenously with continued investment, often improving at variable rates. These structural dynamics pose a challenge: How do we decide what asset to invest in and when to divest from an underperforming asset? In this paper, we propose a normative model of asset selection and switching. We hypothesize that people use Bayesian function learning to infer invariant, structural parameters underlying changes in asset performance, and choose assets based on forecasted final performances at a task-specific time horizon. We test the model in four experiments ($N = 460$) that manipulate the setup (selection versus switching), time horizons, and statistical properties of asset performance trajectories. The Bayesian forecasting model consistently outperforms myopic alternatives inspired by foraging and study time allocation, which instead assume direct continuation of recent observations and rely solely on them. Our results highlight a distinctive form of future-looking cognition: humans anticipate how their own actions will shape future asset performance, and draw on representations of underlying structural dynamics to inform their current choices. The Bayesian probabilistic forecasting model therefore offers a principled computational account of how humans make decisions with lasting consequences.",

          "abstract": "Operant boxes are fundamental tools for studying animal behavior in laboratory settings. While commercial operant boxes offer standardized designs and software for immediate use, they come with significant drawbacks, including high start-up and maintenance costs, limited software flexibility, restricted experimental design options, time-intensive daily operation, and rigid data structures. The constraints posed by commercial operant boxes have constrained the scope and applications of animal research for decades. Custom-made operant boxes combat these limitations but historically have only been accessible to labs with dedicated engineering expertise and/or high budgets. The rise of accessible consumer electronic technologies like Raspberry Pi microcomputers, open-source software, and advanced search and inference tools (e.g., large language models) has made it feasible for non-experts to create cost-effective, customizable operant boxes. Recent projects have laid out their own blueprint designs for affordable open-source operant boxes, but many of these are simply proof-of-concept or isolated to specific experimental applications. We outline key considerations for custom designing versatile, low-cost, and robust multi-operant box systems by discussing our designs for a Raspberry Pi-powered pigeon operant box, equipped with touchscreen capabilities and modular stimulus control. This system features components sourced online, requires no specialized tools/skills (e.g., no soldering or intensive software for hardware interaction), and obviates the need for extended electrical engineering knowledge. Utilized hardware and software systems are highly adaptable, enabling precise customization for a wide range of tasks, behaviors, and experimental organisms. We also provide a streamlined framework for implementing cloud connectivity, version-controlled code design, automated data synchronization across multiple boxes using modern cloud platforms, and scalability for larger or smaller systems. Furthermore, this system costs a fraction (approximately 4%) of commercial alternatives. Our system's versatility is demonstrated through its application to diverse behavioral studies in pigeons, rats, humans, and even plants. Finally, we explore the integration of large language models for software development and troubleshooting, highlighting their potential to further simplify and enhance custom operant box systems.",

Data set 1 consisted of 8 published studies (N1 = 264) using differential fear conditioning with partial reinforcement (50%), and novel data set 2 (N2 = 29) parametrically varied US probability (20%/50%/80%). Across both data sets, all data modalities showed differential response to the US compared to US omission. In data set 1, there was evidence for responses to unexpected US omission in all modalities, but no responses were consistent with signed PE encoding. Similarly, data set 2 provided no evidence that US or US omission responses scaled with outcome probability, which is incompatible with PE encoding. In conclusion, all recorded psychophysiological signals responded strongly to US and less strongly to unexpected US omission, with no evidence of a signed prediction error encoding.",

          "abstract": "Mental health and wellbeing are core components of a healthy life. However, emotional stress and mental health problems are on the rise through societies and cause a significant burden of suffering. In the following, we present our watershed framework for optimizing wellbeing and mental health through lifestyle interventions. Emerging evidence also shows that mental health is an important determinant of quality of life. In addition, it may also be a driver of longevity, influencing health outcomes and, ultimately, the overall healthspan. This framework is based on the recognition that mental health is comprised of biological, psychological, and social factors, and that the factors have interdependent relationships amongst them, so that positive changes in one of them can have cascading effects on the others, with the potential to improve the psychological capital of an individual. Our framework consists of nine elements that we consider hallmarks of mental health and wellbeing, structured in three interdependent layers. The first layer is formed by foundational factors, which are essential for wellbeing and mental health, including circadian rhythms and sleep recovery, along with social connections. The second layer, named wellbeing catalysts, encompasses elements of wellbeing that can have powerful positive effects on mental health, including stress resilience, vitality, cardiovascular health, immune health, and the gut-brain axis. The third layer, named as thriving factors, consists of cognitive performance and positive emotions, which are the elements most often associated with a thriving mind. In our framework, we highlight the interactions between the factors and provide a roadmap to structure comprehensive lifestyle interventions aimed at optimizing mental health and wellbeing. Strengthening mental health and wellbeing addresses key biological and behavioral determinants of healthy aging, which are increasingly recognized as critical modulators of longevity trajectories.",

Far fewer used AI for interpretive or diagnostic purposes, and none relied on it to generate entire reports. Nearly all users (94%) edited AI-generated content before use. On average, practitioners who used AI for report writing saved 6.3 hours per week (95% CI: 4.6–8.1), more than double the savings of those using AI for other tasks (≈3 hours).

          "authors": "Catherine Culot; Joran Engelschenschilt; Sarah Garfinkel; Wim Gevers; Wim Notebaert",
          "abstract": "According to Fechner’s law, perceived sensations increase logarithmically with stimulus intensity. In the context of exercise, rising physical effort is therefore accompanied by increasingly salient bodily signals such as heart rate. Interoception, the sensing of internal bodily states, supports adaptive responses to these changing demands, for instance, by guiding the regulation of exertion. Beyond physical regulation, interoceptive signals have also been proposed to inform higher-order monitoring processes, such as error detection. Yet it remains unclear whether acute exercise sharpens cardiac interoception and whether enhanced access to bodily signals translates into greater awareness of errors. In a within-subject design, 36 healthy adults completed two tasks while cycling at low versus moderate intensity: a Heart Rate Discrimination Task assessing cardiac interoceptive accuracy and insight, and a Go/No-Go task measuring error awareness through post-error reports. Moderate effort selectively improved interoceptive accuracy (threshold closer to true heart rate), without changes in precision of lapse rate. Physical effort also made participants more confident in their interoceptive judgments, but this confidence increase was unrelated to actual accuracy. In the Go/No-Go task, commission errors were more frequent during cycling, yet the proportion of consciously detected errors was unaffected. Interoceptive performance did not reliably predict error awareness. These results indicate that acute exercise recalibrates cardiac interoception, likely by enhancing the salience of afferent signals, but does not strengthen higher-order monitoring of action. Error-related cardiac responses may thus reflect affective or orienting processes rather than a causal basis for awareness.",

          "abstract": "Human decision-making plays a critical role in distinguishing real from artificially-generated synthetic content. These decisions are particularly important when classifying faces and voices due to the rich personal and social information that they hold, meaning synthetic faces and voices, commonly known as \"deepfakes\" are frequently used for identity theft, financial fraud, and misinformation campaigns. It is currently unknown whether detection of real versus synthetic content is modality-specific, or whether it generalizes across sensory domains. We conducted a preregistered study in which participants classified real and AI-generated synthetic faces and voices. Overall classification accuracy was 65% for faces and 54% for voices. Using signal detection theory to analyze individuals' ability to classify stimuli, we observed no evidence of a domain-general effect, indicating that detection ability may not generalize across face and voice domains and is instead, domain-specific. Participants' confidence tracked accuracy for faces but not for voices, suggesting that metacognitive insight may also be modality-specific. Findings are discussed in terms of whether detection of synthetic content is underpinned by its own cognitive and social mechanisms, or whether classification is driven purely by domain-specific abilities. In applied settings, including forensic, legal, and security, it is vital to recognize that expertise in detecting synthetic content might be modality specific.",

          "abstract": "Many parents lie to their children. Because prominent socialization theories hypothesize that children learn about lying via parental modeling of lying or honesty, it is important to examine whether parental lying affects children’s lying behavior. While there is empirical evidence for the modeling effect of lying by an experimenter on child’s lying, a modeling effect has never been studied in parent-child dyads. The current preregistered study is the first to manipulate parental lying to examine its effects on children’s polite lying. Parents (n = 105) were randomly assigned to a lie- or truth-condition where they told a polite lie or the truth about a drawing of an experimenter in front of their child. Polite lying of their 4- to 8-year-old was subsequently assessed in the disappointing gift paradigm where children received an undesired gift from the same experimenter. Our results demonstrated no effect of parental modeling of lying or honesty on child’s polite lying. The results are discussed in context of parent-child history of interactions, the societal norms around polite lying, and socialization messages conveyed from parental modeling. Although we do not find evidence for a direct effect of parental modeling of polite lying on child polite lying, future research is warranted to explore the effect of parental modeling on child lying in alternative experimental designs, the potential effect of parental modeling of lying for other types of lies and beyond the experimental context.",

We investigated how actors perceive the arguments, identify with their roles, and deal with role conflicts. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the complete cast of a production of “Gott” in Switzerland and used qualitative content analysis to answer our research questions. Articulating arguments positively influenced actors' perceived attitudes toward assisted suicide, aiding in the formation of their own stance, and shifting their perceptions of affected individuals. In contrast, one actress whose role did not produce arguments had difficulties forming her attitude. Being unable to form an attitude can lead to moral distress. Identification with the roles was highly individual, but most actors identified with their roles. Unlike prior work that assumed negative effects of complete role identification on actors, we demonstrated that experienced actors can maintain psychological boundaries while engaging deeply with complex moral narratives.",

We ran a series of online interactive experiments (N = 716) combined with computational reinforcement and social learning models to test whether the mechanism of reputation-based partner choice can effectively support information sharing. Participants in groups chose whether to (i) engage in costly innovation and (ii) whether to share the resultant knowledge. Sharers received increased reputations for sharing and participants could use reputations to select recipients of knowledge. Study 1 found, in participants from the UK and China, high levels of information sharing but only weak partner choice. Study 2 replicated this finding with various methodological improvements. Study 3 showed that participants used partner choice to exclude non-sharing artificial bots from receiving information. Study 4 found that when partner choice was impossible, preferences for information sharing declined to levels comparable to non-sharing. Overall, our findings provide tentative positive experimental evidence that partner choice can facilitate information sharing and enable cumulative cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation modelling has been shown to uncover new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision making from behavioural data. By jointly modelling reaction time and accuracy data, such decision models estimate latent variables that represent distinct computaitonal processes, such as stimulus encoding, response caution and the quality of information processing. In this study we used an evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA), to shed new light into the mechanisms that underlie learning based on linguistic and action-based training. The LBA model was applied to behavioural data from a previously published training study where participants learned to name, tie or name and tie a set of knots. Our results showed that training is multifaceted and associated with an increase in stimulus-encoding time, a reduction in response caution, as well as an increase in the speed of information accumulation. Furthermore, the results showed that there was an added benefit to the rate of evidence accumulation when naming and tying experience were combined. This latter finding suggests that performance benefits from multi-modal training may be instantiated in computational processes that are associated with the quantity and quality of information accumulation during decision making. Overall, in applying this computational approach to accuracy and reaction time data, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that govern experience-dependent plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Healthy individuals typically update their self-beliefs more in response to desirable than to undesirable social feedback. While this positivity bias is well-documented in real-life interactions, it remains unknown whether merely simulating social feedback elicits a similar effect and how the subjective realism of such simulated experiences influences self-belief updating. In two online studies (exploratory pilot n=37; preregistered replication n=85), participants rated themselves and an average person on personality traits both before and after vividly imagining receiving desirable or undesirable social feedback. They also rated how realistic each simulated feedback felt. Using linear mixed-effects modeling, the preregistered replication confirmed that mental simulation alone can elicit positively biased self-belief updating: participants integrated simulated desirable feedback more than undesirable feedback. Notably, this positivity bias reversed when updating beliefs about an average person, underscoring the self-specific nature of this cognitive phenomenon. Critically, simulated desirable feedback was perceived as more realistic than undesirable feedback—particularly when directed at the self—and this heightened realism reliably predicted the extent of belief revision. Together, our findings uncover mental simulation and subjective realism as key cognitive mechanisms underpinning asymmetric self-belief updating, shedding light on how simulated experiences shape self-perception—with broad implications for cognition, motivation, and psychological well-being.",

In non-autistic individuals, increased synchrony adversely affects self-regulation abilities. Yet, synchronization in autistic individuals has primarily been examined in conversational contexts. Methods: In this study, 33 autistic and 33 non-autistic adults performed a dyadic movement task in which participants were asked to “have a conversation without words”, only by improvising movements. Using an inertial sensor-based motion channel system, we investigated interpersonal synchrony. Results: Our findings indicated that autistic, non-autistic, and mixed dyads exhibited consistent levels of synchronization. Although all three dyad groups exhibited a reduction in negative affect after the task, positive affect increased solely for the non-autistic participants. Furthermore, all three dyads exhibited enhanced self-regulation, albeit to a lesser extent among the non-autistic participants. Conclusion: Our results indicate that when interpersonal synchronization is assessed during spontaneous whole-body movements rather than verbal conversations, autistic persons may synchronize to the same degree as non-autistic dyads, regardless of whether they interact with another autistic or non-autistic person.",

          "abstract": "Climate emotions play a key role in shaping individuals’ responses to climate change, influencing both pro-environmental action and well-being. This study aimed to adapt the Inventory of Climate Emotions (ICE) into Turkish and to examine the associations between climate emotions, pro-environmental behaviors, and subjective well-being. Data from 330 participants (Nwomen = 215), aged 18 years or older were analyzed. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the original eight-factor structure with acceptable model fit, and the Turkish version demonstrated strong reliability and validity. All emotions except powerlessness correlated with emotional affinity toward nature, supporting convergent validity, while distinct associations with affective reactivity confirmed divergent validity. Climate anger, sorrow, anxiety, and enthusiasm were positively associated with pro-climate behaviors, while contempt showed negative associations across all behavioral measures. Gender differences largely aligned with previous findings, with women reporting higher levels of most emotions except contempt. The relationship between climate emotions and well-being showed nuanced associations: contempt correlated negatively with well-being, whereas anger, anxiety, and sorrow showed small positive correlations. These findings indicate that climate emotions are multidimensional constructs that reflect both adaptive and motivational processes, and the Turkish ICE provides a robust instrument for future cross-cultural research on the psychological dimensions of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Life-course scholarship has documented the important role of educational aspirations in status attainment processes but has also revealed that parent-child mismatches in educational aspirations may negatively affect child development. However, it is unclear how parent-child mismatches in educational aspirations evolve over time. Here, we examine (1) the prevalence of mismatching aspirations across school grades 3–9 (ages 8–15), (2) their stability over time, and (3) whether converging aspirations tend to converge to parents’ or to children’s aspirations. We also investigate (4) whether parent-child mismatches in aspirations depend on the opportunities that a child is afforded in an education system that sorts pupils into distinct tracks, thus shaping educational trajectories and final educational attainment. We use data from two German National Educational Panel Study cohorts (“kindergarten cohort”: N=4,217; “5th grade cohort”: N=3,908). Findings indicate that in school grade 3, 30% of parent-child dyads have mismatching aspirations; this percentage shrinks to 14-22% across grades 4–9. Mismatching aspirations are relatively instable, indeed much less stable over time than matching aspirations. Among younger children, aspirations mostly converge to their parents’ aspirations. Among older children, aspirations tend to converge in both directions. We also find that parent-child mismatches in aspirations vary considerably according to the educational track that the child ends up attending in secondary school. We conclude that parents and children incorporate the educational opportunities afforded to the child into their aspirations; aspiration mismatches evolve over time and as a result of institutional influences.",

          "abstract": "Latent state-trait (LST) models have a long tradition in psychological research and are widely applied to panel and intensive longitudinal data. They decompose observed responses into stable trait and fluctuating state components and allow for modeling systematic trait change over time, consistent with a dynamic view of personality and affect. Distinct forms of trait change---additive, multiplicative, or dynamic---are captured by specific model parameters, and moderated nonlinear LST models further extend this framework by including time-varying treatments and confounders. However, standard LST models are not inherently causal. They cannot validly estimate the joint effects of recurring events such as unemployment, therapy sessions, or daily stressors when treatment-confounder feedback is present. We introduce a causal extension of moderated nonlinear LST models that integrates inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). This approach accounts for time-varying treatments and confounders and enables consistent estimation of causal effects on trait change parameters. The method is demonstrated using 30-day intensive longitudinal data on positive affect and evaluated through a simulation study. The proposed model enhances the causal interpretability of LST analyses and provides a general framework for studying dynamic trait change processes under time-varying causal conditions.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancements of generative AI (GenAI) technologies have brought the issue of data manipulation to a whole new level. Now individuals can easily create highly realistic fabricated media, including videos, audio, and images, that are increasingly difficult to detect. These developments raise broad societal concerns, particularly in legal contexts, where authenticity of evidence is central to ensuring fairness. This review links documented legal cases to psychological research on memory distortion and false confessions to explore how AI-generated evidence affects individuals’ perception and sense of self and the consequences in a legal context. Decades of research have shown that memory’s vulnerability to suggestion, especially highlighting the power of personalized misinformation. Even in the pre-AI era, studies have shown how false memories have been induced using suggestion and simple media manipulations and how these have led to false confessions. GenAI adds another level of concern, yet no research directly examines its potential to distort memory and to elicit false confessions. This paper identifies urgent questions: How does AI-generated evidence impact memory? How can individuals ensure authenticity of the evidence confronting them? And how can legal systems prepare for the erosion of trust brought upon by this uncertainty? Proposed solutions like watermarking and implementation of authenticity protocols offer partial relief; however, the rapid advancements make sure that no definitive safeguards can be implemented. Understanding how GenAI interacts with our memory vulnerabilities is critical not only for legal psychology but for safeguarding the integrity of justice in today’s digitally mediated society.\n\nKeywords: Generative AI, deepfakes, memory distortion, legal psychology, false confessions, trust in evidence",

          "abstract": "We investigate the viability of a shift representable signal detection model of recognition memory in which the shape of the familiarity distribution is the same for all old and new items. We present a new technique for fitting such models to recognition memory data using only ordinal properties of these data based on the monotonic linear regression algorithm described by Dunn and Anderson (Psychological Methods, 2024). We apply this methodology to analyse the results of three recognition memory experiments that vary the number of study presentations, study-test modality, focused vs. divided attention, and read vs. generate. In each case, the data are well-described by a shift representable model with a recovered distributional form revealing a negative skew consistent with the extreme value or Gumbel distribution. We propose that if these results can be generalised across different experiments, it becomes possible to define a standard unit of measurement of familiarity. We discuss the implications of these results for current models of memory.",

Third, we review predictors and moderators of responses to identify the conditions that help predict when and how groups and group members react in specific ways. Evidence shows that perceived intergroup threats often lead to negative outcomes such as polarization and negative emotions, while fostering positive intragroup effects. In contrast, perceived intragroup threats, while emotionally challenging and potentially weakening the ingroup, may improve intergroup relations. We synthesise the evidence into a framework that explains how groups appraise and respond to perceived intergroup and intragroup threats.",

          "abstract": "Our environment is saturated with different types of distractions, yet digital distractions have emerged as some of the most prevalent in modern education, particularly for college students who are constantly interrupted by digital distractions while trying to focus on their academic workload. These distractions, ranging from smartphone notifications to multitasking on multiple devices, can detract from academic pursuits and lead to decreased academic performance. Our attention is limited and scarce, so the ability to suppress such distractions is crucial for academic success. This study aims to investigate the relationship between individual differences in engagement with digital distractions and performance on an attentional suppression task, as well as their impact on grade point average (GPA). Specifically, we assessed whether engaging in digital distractions, as measured by the Smartphone Distraction Scale (SDS), along with the ability to ignore distractors in favor of target stimuli, affect academic outcomes like GPA. We hypothesized that individuals who were more susceptible to digital distractions and who were less efficient in attentional suppression tasks would exhibit lower GPAs compared to their counterparts who manage distractions better. The analysis investigated how SDS scores and performance on an attentional suppression task collectively predict GPA among college students. Surprisingly, there was no significant relationship between SDS scores and performance on the attentional suppression task, nor between SDS scores and GPA. While this study contributes to the growing literature on how digital distractions influence students’ academic focus and offers guidance for supporting academic performance in the face of widespread digital interruptions, the findings also suggest that real-world distraction may be driven by more complex mechanisms than cognitive distractor suppression alone.",

We searched major preregistration repositories, including the Open Science Framework and the Koestler Parapsychology Unit (KPU) Study Registry, and relevant meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria focused on completed studies with available preregistration and final results only for confirmatory hypotheses. A positive outcome was defined as the support of at least one confirmatory hypothesis, strictly following preregistered procedures and statistics without deviation. A total of 46 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 17 studies (36.9%) reported a positive outcome. Interestingly, and contrary to some expectations, a broader comparison indicated that preregistered studies concerning ESP and PK did not necessarily exhibit a much lower proportion of confirmed hypotheses when compared to results for preregistered studies in mainstream psychology.",

To characterise attentional effects on qualia, we combined a dual-task attention paradigm with similarity rating tasks to examine whether relational structures of qualia are altered by top-down attentional amplification. Under the same physical input, withdrawing attention collapsed the structures of qualia of letters (N=14) and red/green bisected disks (N=14), but not of faces (N=13), as quantified via a novel unsupervised optimal transport alignment technique. Alignment accuracy was high for face qualia structures obtained under the fully versus poorly attended conditions but not for the letters and disks. Our novel approach that combines similarity ratings, quantitative alignment and attentional perturbation is a powerful new approach to elucidate the structural properties of consciousness.",

However, it remains unclear how traits, states, and interpersonal perceptions interact to shape everyday social experiences – and for whom their interactions are most consequential. Addressing this gap is critical for advancing personality-in-context models and identifying mechanisms underlying deficits in interpersonal functioning. A two-week Ecological Momentary Assessment was conducted with 136 participants (N = 3,991 social interactions), who reported on motivational states, partner perceptions, and interaction preferences. The combined model integrating traits, states, and perceptions best predicted interaction preferences. Higher approach-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted increased interaction preference, whereas avoidance-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted lower interaction preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that maladaptive interpersonal functioning amplified the negative effects of avoidance trait and state motives on social evaluations. Integrating trait and state perspectives offers valuable insights for understanding social functioning, particularly in individuals at risk for interpersonal difficulties.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent digital experiences are highly regulated today by opaque algorithms that prioritize engagement over well-being, thereby creating a structural mismatch that negatively impacts mental health through exploitation of key developmental vulnerabilities. This opinion paper argues that traditional digital and media literacies are insufficient to address this challenge. We propose Algorithmic Literacy—a critical understanding of how algorithmic systems select, personalize, and influence online content and user behavior—as a distinct and essential competency for adolescents. The paper outlines how such algorithms can impair stress regulation, distort authentic self-concept, fragment cognition, and skew perceptions of community among young people. We contend that Algorithmic Literacy is foundational to digital resilience, equipping adolescents to recognize, interpret, and respond to algorithmic influences, thereby shifting them from passive recipients to empowered navigators of their digital worlds. This literacy fosters cognitive and emotional agency, reframing digital distress as contextual and modifiable. Given emerging evidence of its teachability and growing global implementation, we conclude that integrating Algorithmic Literacy into educational and mental health initiatives is vital for fostering genuine digital resilience in adolescents, enabling them to cope with and actively shape their digital environments.",

          "abstract": "Lucid dreaming (LD) – in which dreamers become aware that they are currently dreaming – has gained increasing attention in consciousness studies, yet its fine-grained experiential dynamics remain undercharacterized. We conducted in-depth micro-phenomenological interviews on 22 signal-verified lucid dreams experienced in a controlled sleep-laboratory setting, mapping within-episode dynamics from the first recalled moments, through the emergence of lucid insight, and into post-onset periods of sustained or lost lucidity.\nAcross episodes, temporal dynamics were highly variable, and we observed diverse phenomenological clusters at every stage. Lucidity sometimes appeared as an abrupt shift from non-lucidity, but most often built up gradually via extended pre-lucid engagement, ranging from curiosity-driven exploration to distress-driven affective escalation. Lucidity was often precipitated by specific triggers, including reality testing behaviors, identification of mismatches, and recognition of incorporated external sensory cues, administered by researchers with the aim of inducing lucidity. The emergence of lucidity itself could be experienced as a sudden or gradual process, and could be accompanied by diverse affective states. Post-onset periods ranged from stable lucid states of active exploration or receptive observation to more fragile states culminating in the collapse of the dream world. Eye signals were variably embedded in these dynamics and often shaped dream experience, for example by contributing to the emergence and maintenance of lucidity or destabilizing the dream.\nMethodologically, our findings demonstrate that micro-phenomenological interviews – originally developed for the study of waking experience – can be effectively adapted for LD research. Conceptually, they highlight diverse forms of meta-awareness, pre-lucidity, metacognitive processing, and agency in LD, and show that variability and complexity are intrinsic features of dream lucidity rather than noise. Practically, moving beyond binary classifications and attending to the fine-grained temporal and structural dynamics of LD can allow future research to harness LD as a dynamic window into the emergence of insight, metacognition, and agency during sleep.",

Although researchers have emphasized its importance across multiple sectors, its existing measures have methodological limitations and are often overly content-specific (e.g., trusting a supervisor). Building on prior work that identified and content-validated a preliminary item pool, the present research developed and validated a new, rigorously tested trustfulness scale. Across multiple studies (total N = 3,048), we prioritized modern psychometric practices by first evaluating items directly before conducting structural analyses. Using multi-occasion and multi-rater data, we reduced the scale’s content redundancy, maximized its content breadth and reliability, and assessed its consensual validity. We then evaluated the scale’s structure through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and compared its psychometric properties to existing trustfulness measures and to similar but distinct constructs, allowing for tests of convergent and discriminant validity. We present the final product which we call the Trustfulness Redundant-free Short Test (TRST); a 6-item scale consisting of two factors (i.e., Trust Beliefs and Suspicion of Others) that evaluates trustfulness in an efficient and psychometrically sound way.",

          "abstract": "Current theories and models of bipolar disorder mostly attempt at explaining one spatial or temporal scale of abnormalities. There is a lack of testable, multi-scale (both temporally and spatially) integrated models ranging from cellular levels to behavior and explaining pathological phenomena in bipolar disorder occurring from milliseconds to months. \nWe here introduce the Homeostatic Dysregulation model of Bipolar Disorder(HDBD). The HDBD primary assumption is that BD results from an alteration in homeostatic processes in the brain across scales, leading to a heightened sensitivity to external perturbations and an impairment to get back to normal levels, ultimately leading to major mood episodes and switches. This lack of homeostatic regulation would encompass neuronal excitability, neural networks, circadian rhythms, emotion processing and mood itself. The HDBD model thus reconciles observations performed at various spatial and temporal scales. To be tested and challenged, the HD-BD model requires “long-phenotyping” data of patients with bipolar disorder. This model also yields new validators of animal models along with therapeutic predictions. This first integrated, multi-scale model, may represent a step towards redefinition of bipolar disorder as a central nervous system homeostasis disorder.",

          "abstract": "Questions about whether humans possess a dedicated “number sense” have shaped theories of numerical cognition for decades. The classic perspective proposes that numerosity is extracted directly from the environment and encoded independently of other magnitudes such as area, density, or duration. In this chapter, we review accumulating evidence that challenges this independence—and, thus, the supposed abstract nature of numerosity representations. We introduce a Perceptual Interdependence account, in which numerical and non-numerical magnitudes are jointly encoded within perception, with interactions emerging early in processing. We draw on developmental, comparative, and computational research showing that number primacy (i.e., its privileged status over non-numerical magnitudes) is neither the developmental nor evolutionary default.  Instead, the relative weighting of number versus other magnitudes varies with experience, context, and attentional demands. We argue that attention plays a key role in selectively tuning integrated magnitude representations for decision-making, offering a bridge between perceptual representations of numerosity and later-emerging symbolic number concepts. This perspective reframes non-symbolic number as a perceptual construct—one that emerges from integrated magnitude processing rather than a standalone core system.",

I begin by reviewing core fMRI fundamentals, including the biophysics of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, key limitations, and trade-offs relative to other neuroimaging modalities. I then outline three broad classes of fMRI designs commonly used in affective science: task-based paradigms that model specific affective processes through experimental manipulations; resting-state paradigms that characterize intrinsic functional architecture; and naturalistic paradigms that leverage complex, dynamic stimuli such as films or narratives to better approximate real-world affective experience. Finally, I survey a set of analytic approaches that can be paired with these designs, including mass-univariate contrast testing, decoding, voxel-wise encoding models, connectome-based predictive modeling, graph theoretic methods, regional homogeneity, and intersubject correlation analysis. For each, I describe how the method works, practical implementation considerations, and the kinds of inferences it affords about affective phenomena.

          "abstract": "Prior research has shown that drawing, tracing, and describing at encoding are beneficial strategies for improving subsequent visual object recognition. It is unclear whether these strategies are also beneficial for the binding of object features in visual memory and how their benefits may vary with age. In these experiments, participants learned object images through either drawing a copy of the image, writing a description of the image, tracing the image, or simply studying the image. Subsequently, participants had an old/new recognition test and a test of object feature binding (indicating where the object was located and what color the object was). This experiment was conducted with younger adults and older adults. For the younger adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for both object recognition and object feature binding. For the older adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for object recognition, while studying and describing were the best strategies for object feature binding. For both groups, tracing was not beneficial for feature binding. Overall, these results show that the optimal learning strategy depends on the way the information will be tested and the learner population.",

          "abstract": "Mentorship promotes undergraduate student success and integration into STEM fields. The strongest and most consistent predictor of high-quality mentoring is perceived psychological similarity (e.g., shared attitudes) between mentees and their mentors, yet little is known about how these perceptions develop over time. Using longitudinal data and latent state-trait modeling, we examined how undergraduate mentees' perceived psychological similarity and the mentoring support they received from their faculty mentors influence one another. Most of the variance in psychological similarity reflected stable, trait-like tendencies, whereas a smaller portion of the variation was due to occasion-specific fluctuations. By contrast, most of the variance in mentoring support was state-like, due to occasion-specific fluctuations. Cross-lagged panel analyses revealed that early increases in psychological similarity predicted later perceptions of mentor support within the same academic year, whereas earlier mentor support consistently predicted future psychological similarity, both within and across academic years. These results suggest bidirectional, though asymmetric, temporal associations between psychological similarity and mentoring support. Undergraduates’ momentary beliefs that their mentor was a role model were associated with greater mentorship support, independent of their feelings of psychological similarity. These findings highlight the importance of longitudinal methods for capturing the dynamic, time-sensitive nature of mentoring relationships.",

Data disaggregation, an approach that analyzes racial data at a more granular level, enables policymakers and practitioners to identify and address areas where challenges faced by certain groups may otherwise be obscured. The first section of the paper discusses how group labels conceal the educational and health disparities faced by Asian Americans and Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Americans. The diverse Asian ethnic groups face different disparities, such as uneven rates of college graduation and cancer prognosis, that are hidden by the overly broad Asian American label and the associated model minority stereotype. For MENA Americans, their experiences and disparities are unrecognized when officially classified under the White category.

          "abstract": "Background: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of learning difficulties, which may reflect shared risk factors, ADHD symptoms hindering learning, or learning difficulties increasing ADHD symptoms. We aimed to map rates of co-occurrence among ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and reading comprehension difficulties and to investigate directional influences between ADHD symptoms and reading fluency, arithmetic, and reading comprehension.\nMethods: Reading fluency, arithmetic, and reading comprehension were assessed longitudinally in approximately 2,000 Finnish children across Grades 1 to 9 (ages 7–16). Attention/hyperactivity symptoms were measured with teacher ratings (Grades 1–4) and self-reports (Grades 6–9). ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and reading comprehension difficulties were based on a 10th percentile cut-off. Directionality between ADHD symptoms and academic skills was examined using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) to separate stable traits from time-specific states.\nResults: Children with ADHD were 1.14 to 1.75 times more likely to have a learning difficulty, whereas those with one learning difficulty were 4.32 to 4.62 times more likely to have another. The RI-CLPMs showed consistent autoregressive effects across all domains, indicating stable within-person variation over time. At the between-person level (i.e., trait), academic skills were negatively related to ADHD symptoms, especially those reported by teachers. At the within-person level (i.e., state), ADHD symptoms were unrelated to reading fluency and arithmetic. However, at multiple time points, cross-lagged effects emerged from ADHD symptoms to subsequent reading comprehension, indicating that elevated ADHD symptoms predicted subsequent declines in reading comprehension.   \nConclusions: Learning difficulties co-occurred more frequently with each other (homotypic) than with ADHD (heterotypic co-occurrence). Both ADHD symptoms and learning difficulties showed trait-like stability. After accounting for these, ADHD symptoms were no longer linked to reading fluency or arithmetic. However, more ADHD symptoms predicted later declines in reading comprehension, likely because comprehension requires sustained attention—often impaired in children with hyperactivity and inattention.",

          "authors": "JongKyu Kim",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the Emotional Rhythm Unified Attachment Model (ER-UAM), which redefines attachment between humans and dogs from the perspective of emotional rhythm. Classical attachment theories assume that attachment is organized around the perception of behavioral signals, the interpretation of physical cues, and proximity-based emotional regulation. However, emotional responses observed in long-term clinical practice and naturalistic observation cannot be fully explained by signal decoding alone. The emotions of dogs and their caregivers do not unfold as sequential reactions, but as rhythmically synchronized co-occurrences, and the pattern of this rhythmic simultaneity determines both the stability and the type of attachment.\n\nER-UAM identifies four key variables as the main regulatory axes of emotional rhythm: consistency, sensitivity, immediacy of response, and fear injection. These variables are reorganized into a dual structure of causal indicators and outcome indicators. Whereas previous studies have mainly classified attachment types based on behavioral outcomes, ER-UAM derives attachment patterns by analyzing the flow of emotional rhythm as the underlying cause. This approach makes it possible to describe the arrangement of micro-level emotional waves observed in non-separation everyday contexts, and to interpret the mechanisms that generate secure, avoidant, ambivalent, and disorganized attachment in terms of the breakdown and restoration of emotional rhythm.\n\nThe model has been refined through longitudinal observation of more than 150 clinical cases, and it demonstrates that a causal-indicator-centered judgment system can compensate for the limitations of behavior-based diagnostics.",

          "authors": "David Dorsey; Shonna Waters",
          "abstract": "Existing theories of human performance struggle to adequately explain the emergence of extreme positive and negative outcomes and the heavy-tailed distributions they consistently produce. Static, trait-based models and linear frameworks are often insufficient to capture the dynamic, self-reinforcing processes that drive individuals toward exceptional achievement or severe counter-productivity. This paper introduces a recursive theory of human performance grounded in the concept of “strange loops,” self-referential feedback cycles where identity and performance co-evolve. We argue that performance is generated through a recursive process of action, symbolic feedback interpretation, and adaptive identity construction. The “symbolic” nature of this feedback refers to its capacity to convey meaning about one's identity, status, and narrative role, beyond its objective or task-specific content. Positive feedback loops create upward spirals of achievement, while negative loops create downward spirals of counter-productive behavior, both driven by the same underlying amplification mechanism. This symmetrical process explains the full spectrum of performance and possible heavy-tailed distributions including why performance distributions can be heavy-tailed. We integrate this recursive model with the established CORE framework of performance and outline its fundamental propositions. Finally, we provide a comprehensive roadmap for the theory's empirical validation, detailing specific study designs, methodological considerations, and falsifiability criteria, offering a new agenda for performance theory and performance model research.",

          "abstract": "This paper redefines the affective simultaneity observed in human–dog relationships as non-local affective co-occurrence and proposes a new theoretical framework, the Quantum Emotional Entanglement (QEE) model, to explain this phenomenon.\n\nTraditional models in behaviorism, attachment theory, and emotional contagion describe emotion as a linear, signal-based stimulus–response process. Emotional change is assumed to occur first in one partner and only later in the other, through perception and interpretation of observable cues. However, across more than thirty years of longitudinal observation, I have repeatedly documented cases in which affective change occurs simultaneously in humans and dogs even when conventional signals are blocked or absent.\n\nThe QEE model does not treat emotion as information that is transmitted from sender to receiver. Instead, it conceptualizes emotion as a co-emergent phenomenon arising within a relational field. This paper introduces the core concepts, structure, and mechanisms of the QEE model and uses theoretically informative cases to show how it integrates previously anomalous observations into the domain of formal scholarly analysis.",

          "abstract": "The new generation of suicide models diverges from previous theories by embracing the ideation-to-action framework. Among these, the Integrated Motivational-Volitional (IMV) model and the Three Step Theory (3ST) elucidate the circumstances under which suicidal ideation arises and the subsequent transition from thoughts to behaviour. This systematic review aimed to compare the two models and assess the validity of each of their phases. Four electronic databases were searched for studies published after 2011 for the IMV model and after 2015 for the 3ST, yielding a total of 65 eligible articles. Among these, 51 focused on the IMV model, 12 on the 3ST, and two examined both models. Overall, while the IMV model was significantly more extensively studied than the 3ST, both models received partial support, which varied according to their respective phases or steps. The formation of suicidal ideation was robustly supported; however, the transition to action yielded conflicting findings, primarily due to operational and ethical challenges inherent in suicidology. Regarding the IMV model, our review underscores the necessity for further research that tests all three phases of the IMV together and addresses understudied variables, particularly the threat-to-self, motivational, and volitional moderators. The main limitations identified within the 3ST literature were largely related to the inconsistent operationalization of key variables and the use of inappropriate measurement instruments, which impeded a comprehensive assessment of the implicated factors, especially concerning pain and connectedness facets.",

It is often suggested that this ‘youth gender gap’ is a generational phenomenon that can be attributed to recent developments such as the rise of the online manosphere and the far right. This study, however, proposes an alternative interpretation drawing from the developmental psychological ‘gender intensification theory,’ which holds that gender roles temporarily intensify during adolescence as biological, social, and cognitive changes heighten pressure from socialization agents to fit gender-role stereotypes. Supporting this explanation, 22 years of ESS data demonstrate that the interaction between gender and age peaks in middle adolescence, narrows during late adolescence, and mostly disappears in early adulthood. Moreover, this youth gender gap has not widened over time since 2002. These findings challenge claims of a generational rise of conservative men. Instead, the youth gender gap appears to be rooted in the typical psychosocial development of adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Why do uninvolved bystanders punish norm violations less harshly than victims? This longstanding puzzle lies at the heart of theories of fairness and cooperation. Prior accounts suggest that bystanders are less sensitive to unfairness than victims when reacting to fairness norm violations. Across three experiments, we tested this assumption by directly comparing third-party punishment (TPP) and second-party punishment (SPP). In Experiment 1 (N = 234), both fairness-related factors (harm, intention) and interest-related factors (cost) shaped punishment, yet bystanders consistently punished less than victims. Experiment 2 (N = 105) showed that bystanders and victims perceived unfairness similarly, but third parties punished less, decided faster, and displayed reduced decision conflict. Through computational modeling, Experiment 3 (N = 139) revealed that interest-driven motives—self-interest consideration and cost-ratio-based inequality disregarding—accounted for the punishment gap, whereas fairness-driven motives played a secondary role. Moreover, interest-driven motives shaped the initial bias against intervention, prompting bystanders to reach rejection decisions faster. Together, these findings challenge fairness-centered explanations and demonstrate that third parties intervene less, not because they fail to recognize unfairness, but because they are more sensitive to the personal costs of sanctioning. This conclusion refines motivational theories of norm enforcement and highlights how institutional mechanisms that lower the costs of intervention may promote stronger collective action to uphold social norms.",

This allows a general way to model and correct for these types of errors. Any situation where multiple true scores get collapsed can be understood with this model. We discuss how existing approaches fit into this general framework (e.g., scoring binary responses using Item Response Theory), and sketch the broader range of situations where the model can be applied.

Two studies examined these processes across different time frames. In a ten-day ecological momentary assessment with 133 individuals with probable SAD, daily stressors and all comparison components (frequency, discrepancy, impact) were positively linked to social anxiety, both between and within individuals. Additionally, comparison affective and behavioral impact were significant within-person mediators. In Study 2 with 376 participants and four assessments over one year, stable between-person effects and less consistent within-person effects were found. Findings advance our understanding of comparative thinking in SAD and may inform related therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Curiosity (wanting to know more) is critical for human learning and social interactions. Does curiosity relate to well-being? To address this question, we tested whether curiosity is associated with three dimensions of well-being: happiness, meaning in life, and psychological richness (a dimension of well-being characterized by diverse, perspective-changing experiences). Across six studies, psychological richness was consistently associated with curiosity, whereas happiness and meaning in life were not. Individuals leading psychologically richer lives self-reported greater curious tendencies (Studies 1–3; N = 5,363 across 13 countries) and exhibited greater behavioral indicators of curiosity, including more frequent exploratory behaviors in a two-week daily diary (Study 4; N = 203) and greater willingness to learn information in a laboratory setting (Study 5; N = 272). Finally, Study 6 (N = 451) demonstrated that individuals induced to value psychological richness showed greater willingness to learn compared to those in the control condition. Together, these findings suggest that curiosity is closely linked to well-being—particularly through its association with psychological richness.",

Assuming little to no prior experience, audience of this course will be formally grounded in key concepts including Bayesian statistics and reinforcement learning, and practically, will build, assess, compare, and validate models using the R interface to the Stan programming language, RStan. Starting with binary choice models, the audience will learn to estimate parameters representing latent components of behaviour by fitting reinforcement learning models, both at the individual and group-level, eventually with hierarchical modeling. The course is generally suitable for those interested in developing models of human cognition at any level of experience. In making the course openly available, we aim for computational modeling under the Bayesian approach to be more strongly represented in the psychological sciences.",

          "authors": "Jianghao Liu",
          "abstract": "Mental imagery refers to one’s quasi-perceptual experience in the absence of direct external input. Yet around 4% of individuals with “aphantasia” report an inability to voluntarily generate such experiences. This phenomenon provides a natural experiment that challenges current theories of imagery, which typically assume that reactivation of the visual cortex in imagery generation is sufficient for experience. In fact, neuroimaging evidence shows that aphantasic individuals can reactivate visual cortex normally during imagery tasks, indicating that additional, as-yet-unspecified, processes are required for subjective experience to emerge. In this theory paper, I propose an attention-based model of conscious imagery (“the attention model”), in which generation provides initial sensory reactivations, integration binds visual features into coherent perceptual-like content, and amplification enhances them for conscious access. This hierarchical processing of conscious imagery appears to be supported by a fronto-parietal-fusiform network shaped by two interacting attention systems. Aphantasia primarily reflects deficits in top-down modulation, with preserved generation but impaired integration and amplification of internal representations, linked to altered interactions between frontoparietal attention networks and the fusiform gyrus. Overall, this model reframes imagery as an active, constructive process shaped by the dynamic interplay of attention, sensory, and memory networks, rather than a passive reactivation of sensory representation. It offers a testable neuromechanistic account bridging research on imagery and consciousness, motivating future research on unconscious and conscious processing of internal representations.",

The successor representation, a predictive map that encodes expected future state occupancy, has been proposed as one way such maps might be computed in the brain, but its policy dependence severely limits flexible planning. We introduce a new model, the successor representation with importance sampling (SR-IS), which combines temporal-difference learning with importance sampling to construct policy-independent predictive maps. SR-IS learns the structure of the environment without being constrained by the agent’s current decision policy. These representations can be efficiently updated when the environment changes, enabling rapid behavioral adaptation. We show that SR-IS outperforms existing models in planning tasks and provides a better account of the graded biases in human replanning that previous models could not explain. This work bridges theories of predictive maps with observed planning behavior and offers new insights into flexible decision-making in the brain.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "authors": "David Březina",
          "abstract": "Although perceptual similarity is highly contextual, visual similarity of characters (letters) is typically investigated using stimuli that do not control for contextual effects, e.g., comparison of pairs, identification of single characters. Moreover, most character similarity studies focus on a single typeface (font) or study under conditions that are detrimental to the quality of the designs (e.g., low resolution or low contrast), which makes it challenging to generalize their findings. To obtain data that permit a more detailed and realistic enquiry of character similarity relationships, the study reported in this paper used a contextual similarity task. Participants were presented with character triplets and asked to pick the odd one out, thus judging the remaining characters as more similar. To demonstrate the method’s robustness and transferability across scripts, this cognitively simple yet challenging task was used with a diverse selection of typefaces, world scripts, and participants (n = 1721). The results showed that the contextual similarity task is sensitive to the effects of typeface design and elicits similarity judgements that are hard to predict using pairwise data. Comparisons across groups of participants showed effects of design expertise, nativity, and fluency in relevant scripts.",

          "authors": "Dominic Guitard; Jean Saint-Aubin; J Nick Reid; Randall Kenneth Jamieson",
          "abstract": "The lexicality effect, better memory for words than for non-words, is a hallmark of verbal short-term memory and a clear demonstration that prior linguistic experience supports immediate recall. However, how this effect depends on participants’ proficiency with the language itself remains poorly understood. Across two experiments, we examined how language proficiency shapes immediate memory for French high- and low-frequency materials in three groups: Bilingual French L1 speakers, Bilingual English L1 speakers, and English monolinguals. In Experiment 1 (serial recall), the lexicality advantage was largest for Bilingual French L1 participants, reduced or reversed for Bilingual English L1 participants, and inverted for English monolinguals. In Experiment 2 (order reconstruction), which substantially minimizes item-based retrieval demands, a similar albeit muted pattern emerged, indicating that linguistic experience influences memory even when redintegration demands are low. To explain these findings, we extended the Embedded Computational Framework of Memory (eCFM) by varying the representational richness of participants’ lexical spaces. The model reproduced all key empirical patterns, showing that differences in the availability of semantic and orthographic dimensions are sufficient to generate the observed gradient across proficiency groups. These results provide a mechanistic account of how language experience and bilingualism shape the structure of the lexicality effect, linking long-term representational richness to performance in short-term memory tasks.",

Yet research progress has been slowed by ambiguous definition, classification, and measurement of beliefs. Drawing from Beck’s original work on “core beliefs” and integrating previously disparate literatures including appraisals, mindsets, and primals, we present an integrated, technical definition of CORE beliefs as beliefs about the Characteristics of Relative Essence of a topic in which the modifier ascribed to that topic is adjectival, simple, and evaluative (e.g., the world is dangerous; I am incompetent; stress is enhancing; my body is capable). By focusing on modifiers rather than topic, our theory aids field organization, hypothesis generation, accelerated cumulative science, and increased precision in belief intervention. In the future, we hope that all psychological researchers, no matter one’s subdiscipline or outcome of interest, can contribute to a single, cumulative science of beliefs. The notion—that beliefs are not merely reactions to our experience but a cause of it—deserves a matured science equal to the task.",

          "abstract": "Background: Neuroscientific and survey studies have pointed to the existence of ´pain-intrusions´ in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), i.e., medically unexplained re-experiencing of peritraumatic pain in the same body regions as during the traumatic event, possibly explaining the high comorbidity between PTSD and chronic pain. Previous survey studies in trauma-survivors have assessed pain-intrusions by directly asking about pain as a re-experience of the traumatic event—an approach susceptible to expectancy effects. \nObjective: Here, we systematically assessed chronic and peritraumatic pain to investigate to what degree chronic pain occurs in the same body regions as during the traumatic event. To shed further light on chronic pain as a re-experiencing symptom, we analyzed the role of PTSD symptoms and established predictors of intrusive re-experiencing (e.g., cumulative traumatic experiences, younger age at the earliest traumatic event, peritraumatic distress and dissociation, and trait rumination and anxiety sensitivity). \nMethod: In a pre-registered online study, survivors of psychologically traumatizing events (N=330) reported chronic and peritraumatic pain in 108 predefined body regions, PTSD symptoms, and re-experiencing predictors. \nResults: Eleven percent of participants experienced pain-intrusions (i.e., chronic pain in the same body region as during the traumatic event). Experienced (vs. non-experienced) peritraumatic pain increased the likelihood of chronic pain in the same (odds-ratio=2.94), but not across all (odds-ratio=1.36) body regions. PTSD symptom severity and all assessed re-experiencing risk factors predicted pain-intrusion occurrence. Most participants with pain-intrusions were convinced of a trauma-related origin. \nConclusion: Results support the notion that posttraumatic chronic pain may in part constitute pain re-experiencing associated with PTSD symptomatology, and that these pain-intrusions share risk factors with other re-experiencing symptoms.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the case has been made to move from narrative accounts of psychological theories to rigorous mathematical descriptions thereof. Yet, a persistent tension remains in how the models that result from the formalization of psychological theories are to be evaluated -- whether by their theoretical elegance, their ability to reproduce established phenomena, or their quantitative fit to empirical data. This paper challenges an exclusive use of validation paradigms that are based on phenomena or data alone as evaluative unit by reexamining the relationships between theory, phenomena, and data. We argue that testing the tenability of a theory or model while placing too much emphasis on only phenomena or data is inherently fallible. Instead, we argue that both phenomena and data should occupy a central role in theory testing. This perspective demands that models make substantive and explanatory claims while engaging with the full structure of empirical observations. This perspective not only clarifies the dynamic interdependence among theory, phenomena, and data, but also establishes a principled basis for cumulative, iterative scientific progress in psychological science.",

In the visual domain, low spatial \nfrequencies (LSF) convey coarse information, supporting early predictions, refined by high \nspatial frequencies (HSF). Emotional expressions may thus be processed coarse-to-fine (CtF), \nalthough evidence remains inconsistent. \nMethods Across two online experiments (N=56), participants judged the valence (positive/ \nnegative) of unambiguous (happy, sad) and ambiguous (morphed) faces filtered in LSF or HSF, \nand presented in CtF or fine-to-coarse (FtC) sequences. As sad faces were poorly recognized in \nExp. 1 (LSF cutoff = 4.6 cpi), Exp. 2 used a higher cutoff (9.2 cpi). \nResults Contrary to our CtF hypothesis, HSF and FtC sequences led to more accurate and faster \nresponses to happy and sad faces (Exp 1.) than LSF and CtF sequences, but only for happy faces \nin Exp. 2. In Exp. 1, positive mood facilitated positive morph interpretations, while in Exp. 2, \nLSF morphs showed faster and more frequent negative categorizations. \nConclusion Findings varied with small methodological changes, highlighting that emotional \nface perception is highly complex.

          "abstract": "Behavioral accounts of altruism have focused on costly reward and costly punishment. A third facet is expressed here as costly countercontrol, defined as persistent counteraction of dominant reinforcement schemes for the benefit of others. While this form of behavior is inherently risky, it involves behavioral reversal, and if it spreads, it can trigger long-term collective benefits through sociocultural transformation. In a game scenario, it could be operationalized as establishment of other-benefiting behavioral rules despite socially enforced contingencies to the opposite. Different from moral and civil courage, it is conceptualized here from a behaviorist standpoint. Examples from real life include whistleblowing and principled dissent in support of a moral cause. The article explores the challenges of assessing such behavior and reviews selected paradigms that contain its main components. Lastly, the limitations of current artificial intelligence systems in generating countercontrol are discussed, thereby highlighting the uniquely human capacity for this antagonistic form of altruism.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the psychological impact of chronic illness in rural and low-resource communities. It focuses on the mind-body connection. The phenomenological approach has been used, and eight rural women with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma, and thyroid disorder were interviewed to understand their lived experiences. The thematic analysis revealed five main themes: daily challenges and emotional burden; coping and adaptation strategies; family and community support; mind-body connection; and the need for better support systems. The findings indicate that chronic illness deeply affects the emotional, physical and social well-being of the person. The participants demonstrated resilience through faith, family support, and acceptance. However, they also faced stigma, fear, and limited access to healthcare. The study highlights the need for culturally sensitive, community-based, and holistic interventions that integrate psychological care into rural health services. There is also a need to incorporate emotional and spiritual dimensions into healthcare to improve quality of life and promote overall well-being in rural and low-resource settings.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between adolescent academic burden and depression in adulthood in China, where academic pressure is a growing concern. It overcomes the limitations of prior research that mainly relied on subjective assessments of academic burden by introducing objective measures such as test frequency, daily study hours, off-school tutoring hours, sleep, and exercise time. Results indicate a significant association between higher academic burden in adolescence and higher depression scores in adulthood (r = 0.112, p &lt; 0.01). Specifically, for each unit increase in academic burden, the odds of experiencing higher depression increase by 20.3% (OR = 1.203, p &lt; 0.001). It is more interesting to find that parental involvement moderated this relationship, with positive parental attitudes negatively correlated with depression (r = -0.320, p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the interaction between academic burden and positive parental involvement significantly reduced depression risk (r = -0.231, p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, sleep quality and physical activity were found to mitigate the negative psychological effects of academic stress. This study emphasizes the crucial role of positive parental involvement in mitigating the risk of depression associated with academic burden in adulthood. It suggests that fostering supportive parental engagement is essential, while schools and governments should also focus on reducing academic pressure to protect mental health.",

          "authors": "Rachael Miller; Megan Lambert; Drew Altschul; Vedrana Šlipogor; Julia Espinosa",
          "abstract": "Big team science networks are large-scale, collaborative and global initiatives that pool intellectual and material resources to answer a common scientific question, while increasing transparency, inclusivity and replicability in research. In animal cognition and behaviour, these networks emerged in response to the replicability crisis, addressing limitations such as small sample sizes, taxonomic biases and restricted species and researcher representation. Examples of established animal-focussed networks include ManyPrimates, ManyBirds and ManyDogs, which collectively engage hundreds of collaborators across continents, countries, species and research sites. These initiatives have already produced empirical work, commentaries and reviews, demonstrating proof-of-concept and offering a model for comparative, cross-species science. While big team science offers opportunities for advancing scientific knowledge and promoting inclusive culture, leading such networks, particularly as early-career researchers, comes with challenges. We identify three key challenges shaping early-career researchers' leadership in big team science: 1. Power dynamics, “Reviewer 2” and challenging behaviour, 2. Communication, relationship-building and community trust in globally distributed teams, 3. Confidence, motivation and experience required to manage simultaneous roles as scientists, leaders and administrators. These issues can delay research progress, risk reputational harm and contribute to stress or burnout, particularly for early-career researchers navigating job precarity and career progression. We outline practical solutions, including transparent governance, clear authorship criteria, inclusive communication strategies, and the need for mentorship and early leadership training. We highlight the importance of securing funding to sustain long-term governance of big team science projects, and the vital role that senior researchers have in supporting, rather than overshadowing, early-career leaders. Ultimately, big team science complements traditional single-lab, PI-driven approaches, promoting inclusivity, diversity and collaboration over competition. Our collective experience suggests that big team science leadership, though it can be high-risk, is also among the most rewarding and transformative experiences of an academic career.",

          "abstract": "The first year for international students is often stressful as they adjust to a new cultural and educational environment. To better understand and address these challenges, this two-wave longitudinal study investigated how cultural distance, stress during cultural adaptation (i.e., acculturative stress), and academic social support may be related to academic stress among students in the Netherlands. The initial assessment (NT1 = 195) revealed that students perceiving greater cultural disparities between their home and the host culture experienced heightened acculturative stress, leading to increased academic stress. In the subsequent assessment (NT2 = 99), we examined changes in acculturative stress over three months and its correlation with changes in academic stress. Our results revealed that a reduction in acculturative stress from T1 to T2 corresponded with a decrease in academic stress only among individuals with strong academic social support. This suggests the importance of employing domain-specific coping mechanisms for managing stress and emphasizes the need for establishing social support systems within academic institutions. These systems can aid students in navigating academic challenges and fostering connections within educational environments.",

          "authors": "Melinda Sabo; Şahcan Özdemir; Anna Lena Mantei; Daniel Schneider",
          "abstract": "Forgetting is a fundamental feature of human memory, yet important questions remain about how long-term memories become vulnerable to interference. While previous research has focused on interference between intentionally learned long-term memory traces, it is less known whether such interference can be induced via working memory. The present study addressed this question across two experiments using a novel paradigm combining a long-term and a working memory task. Participants first encoded object–location associations into long-term memory, then completed a working memory task in which the same objects reappeared in the same or shifted locations (60° or 120°), or were absent, before performing a final long-term memory test. Interference induced through the working memory task impaired long-term memory retrieval. This effect was driven by swap errors: participants occasionally reported the task-irrelevant working memory location instead of the long-term memory one. Experiment 2 further showed that both maintenance and test of interfering information in working memory disrupted long-term memory, with testing producing the strongest effects. These findings demonstrate that long-term memories can be disrupted via working memory, suggesting that intentional encoding into long-term memory is not required for interference to occur. We discuss these findings in light of an asymmetric gate between working and long-term memory.",

          "authors": "Chandni Lal; Matt Welhaf; Michael J. Kane",
          "abstract": "Four studies evaluated probed mind-blanking reports, an off-task conscious state ostensibly experienced as an absence of thought and subjective experience. We examined whether people make mind-blanking reports to indicate uncertainty about their preceding thoughts, rather than to communicate an experienced “blank;” we also assessed whether subjects used “blank” to refer to the absence of experience, or rather an unclear, diffuse form of experience. U.S.-based Prolific participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions that differed in thought-probe response options, which included or did not include “I-don’t-know” and “mind-blanking” options in Study 1a, 1b, and 2 (Ns = 463–790). Within an online go/no-go task, we tested whether different response options yielded different rates of mind-blanking and I-don’t-know reports. That is, would mind-blanking rates be higher when an “I don’t know” response option was not available, suggesting that mind-blanking reports indicate uncertainty? Would rates of I-don’t-know reports be lower when the “mind-blanking” option was unavailable? Neither mind-blanking nor I-don’t-know report rates differed significantly between probe-type conditions. Subjects were also confident and quick in their mind-blanking reports, with confidence ratings and report latencies matching other off-task thought categories. Subjects don’t use mind-blanking reports to reflect uncertainty. Study 3 (N = 415) extended our construct-validity investigation to the phenomenology of mind-blanking by separating “mind-blanking” response options into “unclear or foggy thoughts” versus “complete absence of experience.” Unclear thoughts accounted for 3% of thought reports, versus 1% reflecting no experience, suggesting that “blanking” more often reflects diffuse than absent subjective states.",

          "abstract": "Pronouns that precede their antecedents are called cataphors. Upon encountering a cataphor, comprehenders engage in an active, eager search for its antecedent later in the sentence. The processing of cataphoric dependencies has been used to probe comprehenders’ incremental expectations and how grammatical knowledge guides those expectations. Past experiments have investigated whether knowledge of Binding Principles B and C constrain comprehenders’ initial expectations for coreference or whether grammatical knowledge applies at a delay. Although studies suggest that the Binding Principles B and C influence the earliest stages of cataphor resolution, recent findings have called into question whether the main experimental paradigm used to test the time-course of constraint-sensitivity – self-paced reading – has the necessary temporal precision to adjudicate between competing accounts. In this paper we investigate the application of Principle B during cataphor processing using eye-tracking-while-reading, an experimental paradigm with more fine-grained temporal sensitivity. Our results converge with prior findings that Principle B strongly constrains active cataphor resolution. We end by discussing how to model Principle B sensitivity via predictions made at the level of the discourse representation.",

          "authors": "Nicola Cogan",
          "abstract": "Background: Frontline workers across health, emergency, and social care sectors are repeatedly exposed to distressing events and chronic stressors as part of their occupational roles. Unlike single-event trauma, these cumulative exposures can lead to enduring psychological and physiological strain. Traditional diagnostic frameworks, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were never designed to capture the persistent and layered nature of such occupational trauma.\nObjective: This commentary introduces the concept of Persistent Traumatic Stress Exposure (PTSE), a framework that reconceptualises trauma among frontline workers as an occupational exposure rather than an individual disorder. It aims to reorient understanding, responsibility, and intervention from a purely clinical lens toward systemic, cultural, and organisational domains.\nMethod: Drawing on contemporary evidence and theoretical models of trauma, including organisational and moral injury frameworks, PTSE is presented as an integrative paradigm. It synthesises findings from health, emergency, and social care settings to illustrate how repeated exposure, moral dissonance, and institutional pressures contribute to cumulative psychological harm.\nResults: The PTSE framework highlights that psychological injury may accrue across shifts, careers, and lifetimes, calling for embedded, preventive, and real-time supports that protect mental health as proactively as physical safety. It shifts the focus from vulnerability to exposure, emphasising that trauma prevention and recovery require organisational accountability and trauma-informed systems.\nConclusions: PTSE challenges prevailing stigma by framing trauma as a predictable occupational hazard rather than a personal weakness. It offers a more humane and contextually accurate paradigm that aligns with modern occupational health perspectives, informing practice, policy, and culture. In doing so, it honours the lived realities of those who serve on the frontline and advocates for sustained, systemic investment in psychological safety and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Arbitrary social hierarchies permeate our working lives in ways not always visible, introducing anti-egalitarian norms which stymie productivity. Reviewing bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We contend that the literatures converge on a single, sobering logic: because organizations are embedded in—and seek legitimacy from—broader socio-historical contexts, the same arbitrary hierarchies that stratify societies are naturally imported into organizational life. At the same time, individuals are motivated to obscure the influence of these hierarchies to reduce psychological distress. We leverage institutional theory and systems psychodynamics to map how organizations are at the crux of external pressures (from society) and upward pressure (from employees) which both perpetuate and obfuscate the replication of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in organizations. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the commonplace or subtle nature of the microaggression to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – anti-egalitarian organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in their workplace.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing debate in cognitive science is whether cognitive control recruits domain-general or domain-specific processes. A useful paradigm to study this is the congruency sequence effect, which reflects the reduced impact of congruency after an incongruent trial. Many studies examined the congruency sequence effect across task in order to investigate domain generality. However, differences in how task dissimilarity was manipulated led to different conclusions about the nature of adaptive control. Therefore, we conducted a systematic, preregistered meta-analysis of 169 experiments (229 effect sizes). On average, the cross-task congruency sequence effect (Hedges’ gz = 0.252) decreased as task dissimilarity increased, with some factors influencing adaptive control more than others. Especially when tasks used a different response modality or conflict arose from different irrelevant stimulus dimensions, we observed a decreased cross-task congruency sequence effect, suggesting adaptive control is both action-oriented and involves distractor suppression. Notably, however, when tasks shared the same conflict type, larger congruency sequence effects were observed when stimulus and response sets were distinct rather than partially overlapping. Together, these findings refine current theories by pointing to a central role for the different motor modalities, distractor suppression, and shared versus separate task representations, moving beyond a simple domain-general versus domain-specific distinction.\n\nKeywords: meta analysis, conflict adaptation, congruency sequence effect, domain generality, cognitive control",

          "abstract": "Influential models of person perception posit that group-based information holds more influence than individuating information in impression formation. Presumably, this is due to the spontaneous and effortless activation of group versus individual-specific information. Consistent with the cognitive miser metaphor, this advantage should be exacerbated when forming more automatic evaluations about others. Challenging these assumptions, Navon and Bar-Anan (2023, JESP) reported that evaluative impressions rely more on individuating than group information when making impressions about members of newly learned social groups. Furthermore, this advantage was reported on both self-report and indirect measures tapping into more automatic evaluations. In the present research, we identify several limitations in that previous research and examine the dominance question in two experiments (Ns = 605; 657) employing a stronger design, improved structural fit between measures, and more robust analytical tests. We found a clear advantage of individuating information on both types of measures. This finding was observed despite the use of a very perceptually salient cue signaling group membership (i.e., skin tone) and impression formation instructions aimed at group rather than individuating impressions. Implications for dominant theories of person perception are discussed, as well as methodological implications for the study of more versus less automatic evaluations.",

          "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference unify perception, action, and learning within a single variational framework, yet they remain silent on why there is phenomenal experience at all. Awareness-First Theory (AFT) proposes an ontological inversion: rather than deriving consciousness from non-experiential dynamics, it takes awareness as ontologically primitive—taken as the base datum rather than something to be explained by physical states—and formalises it as a differentiable field of awareness, denoted (A, g_A). A Coherence Principle—expressed as the variational stationarity condition “delta A = 0”—governs lawful differentiations within this field and preserves the core phenomenological invariants of unity, binding, temporal continuity, and reflexive presence. The familiar variational laws then appear as embedded projections: “delta S = 0” (least action) for physics and “delta F = 0” (free-energy stationarity) for inference. Subbeings (local bounded centres of coherent differentiation), defined by Markov blankets, are local equilibria of the global coherence field; their inferential activity sustains rather than produces awareness. A Qualia Mapping Function links differentiations in awareness to measurable information-geometric structures. AFT predicts lawful dissociations between coherence (“delta A”) and inference (“delta F”) - as in dreaming, illusion, psychedelics, and meditation, where phenomenological unity persists despite inferential error. It thereby unifies phenomenology, physics, and cognition within a single variational hierarchy (delta S and delta F as subsets of delta A), dissolves the explanatory gap by grounding experience in its own coherence, and resolves the combination problem by making unity fundamental, a variational calculus of Being underlying all appearance.",

          "abstract": "Reward valuation and reward and punishment learning are key constructs relevant for understanding and intervening on mental illness. These constructs are frequently measured with behavioral tasks such as intertemporal choice tasks, measuring delay discounting, and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), measuring reward and punishment learning. Delay discounting refers to how people value delayed outcomes, with steep discounting (i.e., delayed outcomes holding little value) considered a form of impulsive decision-making. Reward and punishment learning refers to how people adjust their decision behavior in response to rewards and punishments, with deficits indicating atypical reward and punishment processing related to clinical outcomes such as substance abuse. In this study, we tested the association between delay discounting and reward and punishment learning among adults (N = 299) from the United States that completed an intertemporal choice task and the play-or-pass IGT. We fit a joint model to the task data to simultaneously estimate parameters from the hyperbolic discounting model (for the intertemporal choice task) with parameters from a reinforcement learning model (for the play-or-pass IGT). The joint model also included parameters capturing cross-task associations between model parameters. Our results indicate that steep delay discounting is negatively associated with punishment learning. That is, people who do not value delayed outcomes also show less learning from punishment. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of improving our assessment of reward valuation and reward and punishment learning as constructs relevant to mental illness.",

Menstrual stigma was measured through affective internalized stigma, internalized stigma of seeking help, secrecy, and avoidance behaviors. \nResults: In addition to differences in menstrual health (menstrual pain, symptom management, hygiene behaviors), South Asian women reported lower menstrual literacy than White British women. South Asians also reported greater secrecy as well as stronger avoidance behaviors related to discussing menstruation and engaging in daily activities while menstruating, but also more positive emotions towards menstruation. Additionally, they experienced more ethnic microaggressions in healthcare. Secrecy and microaggressions mediated the effect of ethnic group on self-stigma of seeking help. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest cultural differences in menstrual health, literacy and stigma, emphasizing the need for inclusive health education and stigma-reduction interventions.

          "abstract": "The relationship between acute physical exercise and decision-making remains debated, with evidence leaning towards an inverted U-shaped curve during increasing acute physical exertion. This study examined behavioural and computational markers of decision-making across three increasing cycling intensities during a conflict task. Thirty-one participants completed the Eriksen Flanker task at light, moderate, and heavy exercise intensities. Throughout the experiment, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and lactate concentrations were measured. These physiological measures linearly increased with intensities, confirming our protocol. Results indicated that reaction times decreased, while accuracy remained stable. Diffusion Model for Conflict (DMC) analyses showed that drift rate followed the hypothesised inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at moderate intensity, suggesting optimal evidence accumulation at this workload. Decision boundaries decreased linearly with intensity, indicating less cautious responding under higher exertion. This partially supports arousal-based models such as the Yerkes-Dodson law, highlighting moderate intensity as a potential “sweet spot” for decision-making. The integration of computational modelling provides novel insight into how intensity levels of acute exercise modulate cognitive processes. This has implications for sports performance, training strategies, and high-stakes professions requiring rapid decisions under physical stress.",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 workers with intellectual disabilities and nine supervisors who support them in their daily work to capture their respective perspectives. A rigorous thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews was conducted by combining deductive and inductive approaches with a double-coding of certain interviews. The results globally highlighted the specific nature of job demands and job resources in sheltered employment settings, the presence of work recovery processes, and relevant indicators for assessing well-being at work in this population. In addition, a number of individual factors—either facilitating or limiting—were identified as influencing the workplace experience of this population. These findings, while demonstrating the relevance of the models considered, also underscore the need for future research to empirically test the theoretical relationships, using designs adapted to this population.",

          "abstract": "Unlike spatial attention, the role of rhythmic temporal attention in visual awareness remains less explored. To address this issue, we investigated how rhythmic temporal attention operates with exogenous spatial attention during detection of near-threshold Gabor patch targets. Targets appeared after a series of placeholders flickering either regularly or irregularly in the left or right visual field. Each target was equally likely to occur at the same location as the rhythmic stream (spatially attended trial) or the opposite location (unattended trial). Participants first made a detection response, followed by a localization judgment. Target visibility was calibrated to 50% in Experiment 1 and 75% in Experiment 2. At 50% visibility, spatial attention induced a more conservative response criterion for unattended compared to attended trials. Unexpectedly, irregular rhythms enhanced perceptual sensitivity relative to regular rhythms. At 75% visibility, rhythms had no effect on perceptual sensitivity, whereas spatial attention improved perceptual sensitivity, sped responses, and maintained a more conservative response pattern for unattended trials.  In follow-up experiments with fully visible (100%) targets, responses were faster after regular rhythms, but only when the localization response was removed, suggesting that rhythmic temporal sequences primarily facilitated response preparation under simplified task demands. Overall, these results call for caution in attributing a direct role of rhythmic temporal attention to visual awareness, at least under the current rhythmic sequences and in the presence of spatial uncertainty, while confirming a key role for exogenous spatial attention in enhancing conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Qualia, the subjective qualities of experience, pose a fundamental challenge to scientific explanation. A promising recent approach is to characterize qualia by their relational structures rather than their intrinsic nature. Assuming the structure of qualia is characterized by the geometry of neural representations, we posit that this geometry is fundamentally organized by symmetry. We propose that the principal bundle, induced by a symmetry group $G$ acting on a neural network's state space, is the essential mathematical object that provides a complete and rigorous characterization of this geometric structure. The core mathematical principle is that, for a $G$-equivariant network, its state space partitions into a quotient space $Q$ and orbits induced by the group $G$. This framework reveals a three-level hierarchy for characterizing qualia. First, the choice of the symmetry group $G$ itself defines the fundamental nature of the qualia modality (e.g., vision versus audition). Second, we identify a qualia signature with a point in the quotient space $Q$ (e.g., perceiving the signature ``cat''), representing the invariant identity of a percept. Third, we identify a qualia attribute with a position on a specific orbit (e.g., the cat's location), representing its continuous variations. This framework uncovers a powerful duality: the geometry of the orbits is rigid, inheriting the structure of the group $G$, which explains the stable relational structure of qualia attributes. In contrast, the geometry of the quotient space is plastic, allowing the relationships between qualia signatures to be shaped by learning. This geometric hierarchy provides a unified language for explaining the structure of perceptual experience. Furthermore, our framework generates empirical predictions and a clear research strategy for characterizing qualia, offering a path to a deeper scientific understanding of subjective experience.",

Here, we asked whether greater enjoyment of an audiobook is associated with better comprehension and motivation toward narratives, and whether aspects of the narrator’s voice can modulate the experience and outcomes of audiobook listening. In Experiment 1, participants heard audiobook excerpts produced by a highly-naturalistic synthesised voice.\nAfter each excerpt, participants rated their listening enjoyment, answered a multiple-choice content comprehension question, and finally chose whether to wait to hear more of the narrative (or skip to the next one). We found that greater enjoyment was associated with increased probability of correct comprehension and waiting. Building on previous findings for book reading, we therefore show that the enhancing effects of moment-to-moment fluctuations in book enjoyment generalise across written and spoken modalities. In Experiment 2, participants heard the same audiobook excerpts, now narrated by 2 different synthesised voices that significantly differed in perceived pleasantness. Here, we demonstrated higher ratings of enjoyment for excerpts read by the more pleasant-sounding voice. In Experiment 3, we harnessed personalised voice cloning to further show that audiobook enjoyment was greater when listening to personally-familiar narrators (self, friend), compared with unfamiliar narrators. Our findings offer new evidence for the rewarding role of voice identity perception in spoken language perception, and present interesting implications for how personalised narrators could improve engagement with spoken book language.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study conducted a preliminary naturalistic effectiveness evaluation of Individualised Metacognitive Therapy (MCT+) delivered via videoconferencing for individuals with bipolar I disorder in a real-world clinical setting in Chile. It also explored how therapist characteristics—specifically mentalisation capacity—influence the therapeutic alliance in digital psychotherapy.\nMethods: A longitudinal quantitative case series design was implemented across 14 therapist–patient dyads. Patients received 12 weekly sessions of MCT+ online. Standardised measures assessed anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), metacognitive beliefs (MCQ-30), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). Therapeutic Alliance was tracked session-by-session (WAI-S). Therapist mentalisation and attachment were evaluated at baseline (MASC-SP, RFQ-8, ECR-12). Changes in outcome measures were analysed using paired t-tests, effect sizes (Cohen’s d), correlations, Reliable Change Indices (RCI), and hierarchical linear modelling. \nResults: Across the intervention, there were significant decreases in anxiety (d = 0.64) and improvements in metacognitive beliefs (d = 0.37). Depression showed a modest improvement (d = 0.34), while changes in quality of life were negligible (d = –0.21). Hierarchical modelling indicated a significant interaction between automatic and controlled mentalisation (b = –0.45, p = .008), suggesting that flexible adjustment supported therapeutic alliance development. Attachment style showed no significant associations with the alliance (largest unadjusted effect: ρ = –.54, p = .073; all adjusted ps &gt; .99).\nConclusions: Digital MCT+ showed preliminary effectiveness in reducing anxiety and maladaptive metacognitive beliefs among individuals with bipolar disorder, with more limited effects on depression and quality of life. Importantly, therapist mentalisation flexibility—the capacity to shift between automatic and controlled modes, or the mentalisation switch—emerged as a central mechanism for alliance-building and engagement in digital contexts, highlighting a key target for clinical training and future research.\nKeywords: therapeutic alliance, bipolar disorder, digital psychotherapy, MCT+, therapist mentalisation, reflective functioning, mentalisation, metacognitive therapy",

          "abstract": "Facial temperature has been proposed as a non-invasive marker of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. Previous research indicates that nose-tip temperature increases with parasympathetic activation, whereas periorbital temperature reflects sympathetic arousal. However, facial thermal fluctuations during resting state have not yet been systematically investigated, which represents the aim of the present study. \n Here we examined the relationship between regional facial temperature - measured from nose-tip and periorbital regions using functional infrared thermal imaging - and cardiac parasympathetic activity, indexed by high-frequency (HF) power and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of heart rate variability (HRV). Analyses included (i) grand-average correlations to identify overarching physiological patterns, (ii) within-subject correlations to explore the strength of individual-level associations, and (iii) between-subject correlations to examine inter-individual variability of the cardiac and thermal signals. \nAcross 32 participants during a 13.5-min resting-state session, HF power showed a positive association with nose-tip and a negative association with periorbital temperature, whereas RMSSD showed weaker effects. A differential temperature index (nose-tip minus periorbital) was the most robust correlate of HF power.  These findings suggest that facial thermal dynamics mirror vagal modulation at rest and that the differential index converging the information from different facial areas may provide a sensitive, contactless indicator of autonomic activity.",

          "abstract": "Pleasure is a central element of how physical exercise is experienced, and it depends on the perceived physical demands of the activity. Recent evidence suggests that the prediction error of perceived exertion (PEexert), defined as the discrepancy between anticipated and experienced effort, shapes pleasure experienced during exercise. Understanding how both individual and contextual factors influence this process is, therefore, critical. The present study examined whether repeated exposure to the same exercise route, thereby increasing route familiarity, reduces PEexert and modulates its association with running pleasure. Forty-seven participants completed four runs at a self-selected intensity along the same forest trail. Using this within-subjects design, familiarity was operationalized as repeated runs on the identical route. At each session, participants reported their prospective and retrospective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) that created the PEexert index, confidence in prospective RPE, retrospective running pleasure, and pre- and post-run state-anxiety. Running speed and heart rate were measured. Tolerance to physical effort, physical activity level, and prior familiarity with the trail were also assessed. Linear mixed models showed that PEexert significantly decreased after the first run and stabilized in the next runs; indicating that repeated exposure to the same route reduced the discrepancy between anticipated and experienced exertion. In turn, more positive PEexert (runs feeling easier than expected) was associated with higher running pleasure and greater reductions in state-anxiety. Crucially, route familiarity reduced PEexert but did not change the strength of the PEexert-pleasure association. These findings suggest that growing familiarity with an exercise environment refines effort prediction without altering the core affective mechanism linking prediction error to the pleasure of running.",

          "abstract": "Background: Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS)—such as aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose, and saccharin—are increasingly used as sugar substitutes to enhance food palatability without additional caloric intake. While the metabolic effects of NNS are well documented, their potential cognitive and socio-emotional consequences remain unclear. \nObjective: This study investigated the associations between chronic NNS and sugar consumption, cognitive performance, and socio-emotional behaviors in healthy young adults, while controlling for sugar intake to isolate substance-specific effects.\nMethods: A total of 291 French adults aged 18-30 years completed five computerized tasks assessing decision-making and emotion regulation: the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), the Game of Dice Task (GDT), the binary dictator game, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Daily NNS and sugar intakes were estimated using quantitative food frequency questionnaires. Logistic mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the effects of NNS and sugar intake on choice probabilities, rigidity scores, and response times.\nResults: Higher NNS intake was associated with increased selection of the riskiest options under explicit risk in the GDT (p = 0.04) but did not affect decision-making in the IGT. Conversely, higher sugar intake was positively associated with selecting the advantageous yet risky option compared to both disadvantageous (p = 0.04) and advantageous non-risky (p = 0.02) options during the early ambiguity (learning) phase of the IGT. Sugar intake also tended to increase selection of the riskiest option (versus the safest option) under explicit risk. NNS intake was further linked to shorter mean response times across IGT trials (p = 0.04) and showed a trend toward higher rigidity scores at the end of the task, whereas sugar intake predicted longer response times (p &lt; 0.01) and tended to decrease rigidity scores. Neither NNS nor sugar intake significantly influenced altruism, cooperation, or emotion regulation.\nConclusion: Chronic NNS and sugar consumption appear to differentially modulate decision-making processes under explicit and experiential risk, without significantly impacting social or emotional behaviors. These findings underscore the need for longitudinal and neuroimaging studies to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying sweetener-related behavioral modulation.",

          "abstract": "Recent theories of interoceptive inference suggest that individuals use bodily signals to guide behavior, comparing predictive models of internal states with ascending interoceptive input. Although interoceptive accuracy has been shown to influence both decision-making and physiological activation, empirical evidence on how interoceptive abilities concurrently shape behavioral and physiological responses during socio-economic games, such as the Ultimatum Game, remains limited. This study explores the impact of interoceptive accuracy on decision-making and autonomic responses during a modified Ultimatum Game. Participants received offers with varying formats to modulate attentional engagement, while heart rate responses were recorded between offer presentation and decision-making. Results confirm previous findings that unfair offers evoke a stronger cardiac orienting response, especially when the attentional engagement was low. Importantly, interoceptive accuracy was positively related with coherent behavioral and physiological patterns: individuals were more likely to reject unfair offers and showed greater heart rate deceleration in response to them. These findings suggest that individuals with higher interoceptive accuracy integrate bodily feedback more effectively, resulting in heightened sensitivity to social norm violations. These data support the hypothesis that interoceptive precision enhances coherence across behavioral and physiological domains, particularly in socially normative contexts. This coherence is likely shaped by long-term social learning, pointing to the relevance of interoception in structuring adaptive behavior over time.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents learn to navigate increasingly complex social environments, where flexible and efficient\ncognitive mechanisms are needed to behave adaptively. Prominent theories of cognitive maturation suggest\nthat adolescents’ decision-making is noisier than adults’ and that their decisions can be swayed by irrelevant\ninformation. By contrast, here, we suggest that cognitive development also allows them to increasingly use\ncombinatorial representations of social input. This manifests in emergent use of abstract social basis\nfunctions across adolescent development. Social basis functions represent combinations of individuals’\ninteractions (e.g., patterns of cooperation and competition) and allow for efficient information compression.\nIn a novel in-person group decision-making experiment with adolescents (n = 50) and young adults (n =\n50), we confirmed a counterintuitive set of predictions derived from the basis function model: Adults made\nmore accurate decisions than adolescents, but, in parallel, they increasingly made a specific type of decision\nerror more frequently than adolescents. They ‘mixed up’ relevant and irrelevant players as a function of the\ngroup structure of the task. Using multi-attribute drift diffusion modelling, we show that the observed age\ndifferences are consistent with a stronger influence of the group structure during social decision-making in\nadults. Together, these findings suggest that cognitive development during adolescence involves\nfundamental shifts in the use of abstract social representations generally and in the use of combinatorial\nsocial basis functions in particular.",

          "abstract": "Healthcare professionals tend to overprescribe antibiotics despite knowing the risks of antibiotic resistance. This tendency, amplified under diagnostic uncertainty and patient pressure, suggests that mechanisms beyond lack of risk awareness or knowledge sustain overprescription. One such mechanism may be willful ignorance—deliberately avoiding information about the consequences of one’s prescribing decisions. By allowing healthcare professionals to justify immediate antibiotic prescriptions that prioritize short-term self-interests over long-term collective benefits, willful ignorance may contribute to persistent overprescribing. Despite its practical relevance, this psychological mechanism has not yet been empirically investigated in the context of antibiotic prescribing. To test this empirically, we conducted a preregistered online experiment with healthcare professionals (N = 698) from the United States and the United Kingdom. Participants completed an adapted version of the Moral Wiggle Room Task, a behavioral decision-making paradigm designed to investigate willful ignorance. This task compares choices across a full information condition with low diagnostic uncertainty, and a hidden information condition with high diagnostic uncertainty that can be voluntarily reduced. The results support the presence of willful ignorance in antibiotic prescribing. Healthcare professionals were more likely to prescribe antibiotics immediately in the hidden vs. full information condition. Even healthcare professionals who voluntarily reduced diagnostic uncertainty prescribed more antibiotics immediately than those who received diagnostic information involuntarily. These results highlight the role of willful ignorance in antibiotic prescribing and suggest practical implications for policymaking, such as promoting transparent environments to guide appropriate antibiotic prescription choices.",

Furthermore, we have grouped the existing literature based on the study approach into two groups (i.e., lab and field). For each group, we have discussed the research methodologies followed to attain respective objectives. We have emphasized on the field studies owing to the growing use of digital devices, especially smartphones, and wearables, for understanding SAD.   This template simplifies and summarizes the use of artificial intelligence to predict and detect SAD using digitally captured data. In addition to the existing digital SAD psychotherapy, we have also discussed mHealth interventions that use smartphones and wearables to manage mental disorders.

However, most of the available techniques for use in human subjects lack the ability to probe the underlying neuron- and circuit-level mechanisms. Animal experiments offer a promising solution to these limitations. In particular, experiments in rodents allow us to combine large-scale neuronal recordings with the causal manipulations of neuronal activity. Although non-human species cannot verbally report their subjective experiences, behavioral indicators of consciousness have proven to be reliable across species, and the range of behavioral tests available for rodents has grown substantially. This chapter reviews recent advances in using rodents for consciousness research, emphasizing how microcircuit-level studies have the potential to majorly expand theoretical frameworks. We will highlight two key aspects that make rodents particularly valuable for consciousness science: novel behavioral assays and perturbational methods such as optogenetics. Ultimately, we aim to provide evidence that experiments in rodents need to become part of the standard toolbox for consciousness science, complementing and expanding insights gained from human experiments.",

Research suggests that a significant number of CYP experiencing attendance difficulties are neurodivergent, and that these CYP experience very high levels of school distress. While there have been several qualitative studies on the experiences of CYP who struggle with attendance, there is less evidence on the lived experience of parents/carers who have children struggling to attend school. In this study, 44 parents/carers of CYP were interviewed about their experiences of having a neurodivergent child who struggled to attend school. Four themes were identified using thematic analysis: ‘Misalignment between mainstream demands and neurodivergent pupils’ needs’, ‘A fragile and dysfunctional support system’, ‘Distress takes over the lives of families’, and ‘Driving change: What do we want from our children’s education?’. These themes highlight how the misalignment between CYP’s needs and the mainstream school environment, combined with a lack of appropriate support, contributes to significant impacts on families. Parents/carers called for changes in their child’s current school provision, as well as wider changes to make the UK education system more inclusive for neurodivergent pupils. Overall, this study provides timely insights from a substantial number of parents/carers, who are important informants about neurodivergent CYP’s school distress and attendance difficulties.",

          "abstract": "The idea that racial prejudice contributes to discrimination not only deliberately but also in a more automatic fashion has been one of the most prominent topics in social psychological research in the last 30 years. Much of the evidence for theories of automatic prejudice stems from the use of indirect measures of implicit attitudes, yet meta-analyses give differing estimates regarding the predictive validity of such measures. The present adversarial collaboration provides a test of the relationships between prominent measures of implicit racial attitudes and discriminatory behavior using a set of established lab-based paradigms using a sample of White Americans (N = 2114). Using structural equation models that can account for measurement error, frequentist and Bayesian multiverse analyses confirmed that White Americans’ performance on indirect measures correlate modestly with these behavioral outcomes, and explain unique variance (~2.5%) beyond direct, self-report measures of racial attitudes. At the same time, self-report measures exhibited greater predictive and incremental validity than indirect measures (explaining ~45% of the variance) despite behavioral measures of discrimination displaying weak internal reliability. Results provided some support for greater predictive and incremental validity for indirect measures among participants scoring relatively low on measures of executive function and motivation to control prejudice. These results lend themselves to both relatively optimistic and pessimistic interpretations concerning scientific and practical significance. All collaborators agree that the best path forward is collaborative and focused on the generalizability of implicit racial attitudes to high-accountability organizational settings.",

          "abstract": "Laypersons can often predict effects studied in psychological research. Corneille and Béna (2023) noted that this questions the boundaries between scientific and folk psychological knowledge and suggested that new psychological phenomena may be discovered by directly asking non-experts about treatment effects: a more inclusive and collaborative approach to psychological science. Here, we followed upon that suggestion. In Study 1, non-experts (N = 125) predicted higher truth ratings for trivia previously paired with positive than negative pictures. Consistent with Study 1’s predictions, this “Truth Beliefs Conditioning\" effect was observed in Study 3 (N = 186), which overcame two limitations of Study 2 (N = 187), in which the effect was not significant. This supports our claim that folk mental representations about treatment effects can be usefully probed for discovering new psychological phenomena. Future research should investigate the generalizability of this approach and test the mechanisms underlying truth beliefs conditioning.",

Experience Sampling Methodology was used to gather data from 211 adolescents (meanage = 15.59, 84.98% female) over two separate weeks. Greater screen use was not associated with higher levels of negative affect but this relationship was partially moderated by the presence of others. Appraisal of company was associated with affect however, did not moderate its relationship with screen use. The sample skewness leaned majority female, white, and not in receipt of free school meals and therefore not fully representative of the UK population, limiting the generalisability of the findings. This study contributes to the nuanced picture regarding the impact of screens on adolescent wellbeing by highlighting the moderating role of peer presence on how screens relate to adolescent affect.",

To support open and cumulative research in this area, we introduce the Living SEB Project, a continuously updated database combining ongoing literature searches, an open repository of coded studies and effect sizes, and an interactive application enabling customizable meta-analyses. At the time of writing, we identified 259 publications, with 28 meeting criteria for the living review and 17 (24 samples) for quantitative synthesis. Two tutorial analyses are used to demonstrate the database’s utility: a meta-analysis of SEB–academic achievement links and a meta-analytic structural equation model testing SEB skills’ incremental validity beyond personality traits. The Living SEB Project sets out as a transparent, dynamic and openly accessible tool to accelerate and ease cumulative science and synthesis within the SEB skills framework and beyond.",

          "abstract": "The most preferred visibility measure in unconscious processing studies is the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS). Since it was originally proposed as a methodological approach, no PAS labels, instructions or display are currently official. Authors tend to adapt this scale to their experimental tasks often without specifying their PAS properties or without providing adequate justification for the modifications. In this work, we tested how “choosing your own PAS” affects response-process validity both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the same  unconscious working memory (WM) task as in Franco-Martínez et al. (in press) replication. In a preregistered 2×2×2 between-subjects design (N = 176), we manipulated: PAS Version (Original vs New labels, updated based on pilot participants’ reports), Examples (With brief demonstrations of PAS = 4 and PAS = 1 trials vs Without them), and Display (Scale&amp;Text shown onscreen trial-by-trial vs ScaleOnly). In a post-experiment PAS questionnaire participants were asked to qualitatively report how they recalled and interpreted the scale. The unconscious WM effect and its reliability were robust under the Version and Examples manipulations, but presenting the New Version and/or With Examples increased the proportion of valid trials, enhancing statistical power. Although the unconscious WM effect increased in the ScaleOnly Display, the qualitative evidence suggests participants in this condition tend to forget the PAS labels and ultimately use them differently from intended. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for the use of PAS and a post-experiment PAS questionnaire to evaluate its validity.",

          "abstract": "Social polarisation poses a major challenge to collective climate action. In this context, biodiversity conservation, when aligned with climate objectives, may receive broader public support than direct climate policies. However, the links between biodiversity values and wider cultural worldviews remain poorly understood. We investigated this relationship using a nationwide survey (N = 1,133) in Japan. Individuals with hierarchical worldviews perceived climate change risks as lower and tended to be less supportive of climate policies. The negative association between hierarchical worldviews and perceived biodiversity risks or support for biodiversity policies was weaker, and no direct association was found for biodiversity conservation measures unrelated to climate. Higher general scientific knowledge was associated with greater support for biodiversity policies linked to climate policy. Framing climate initiatives via biodiversity conservation may reduce culturally driven resistance. Enhancing scientific literacy could promote societal support for integrated climate–biodiversity policy measures.",

Cognitive reserve (CR) may protect against trauma-related cognitive deficits, but CR's moderating role in relationships between trauma exposure, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and cognition is unclear. \nMethods: We examined 745 community-dwelling middle aged to older adults (50-86 years) who completed assessments of traumatic event exposure (Life Events Checklist for DSM-5), post-traumatic stress symptoms (PCL-5), cognitive performance, and CR proxies (Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire and verbal intelligence). \nResults: Higher CR scores protected against cognitive performance deficits correlated with both greater exposure to traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and were associated with reduced post-traumatic stress symptoms associated with greater traumatic event exposure. Moderated mediation analysis revealed that for individuals with lower CR, the negative cognitive effects associated with traumatic events were mediated through post-traumatic stress symptoms, while this indirect effect became non-significant at higher CR levels. CR proxies showed different protective effects by trauma type, with higher CR buffering against poorer cognitive performance associated with natural/accidental traumas. \nDiscussion: These findings suggest that interventions targeting modifiable CR components may build resilience against trauma's psychological and cognitive impacts throughout the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "For over a century, researchers have documented robust individual differences in people’s ability to think creatively. Today, however, generative AI appears to democratize creativity, potentially minimizing individual differences by offering powerful tools for anyone to generate ideas, stories, and more. Do individual differences still matter for creativity when everyone has access to the same advanced technology? Across two studies (N = 442), we tested whether two individual factors—creative ability (assessed via idea generation and story-writing tasks) and general intelligence (assessed via reasoning and knowledge tests)—predict performance in creative collaboration with large language models (LLMs). We isolate for the first time a latent construct for AI-assisted creativity, unique and separable from creativity without AI. Study 1 found that baseline creative writing ability strongly predicted AI-assisted story writing with GPT- 4o (β = .42): people who wrote more original stories without AI also wrote better stories with AI. Study 2 replicated and extended this finding, showing that people who were more creative (β = .39) and intelligent (β = .35) in general performed better on entirely different creative tasks done with AI assistance. Thus, people with more creative task expertise (Study 1) and those with higher baseline cognitive abilities (Study 2) produced more original ideas, despite all participants having equal access to a powerful LLM. Our findings suggest that the successful use of generative AI may preserve individual differences in human creativity and intelligence, highlighting implications for education and the future of creative work.",

However, in those tasks, participants were explicitly instructed to ignore gaze and face stimuli, which may have minimized or even eliminated the effect of the face mask on gaze-related behavior. To address this limitation, the present study revisited the effect of face masks on joint attention using a spatial Stroop task, in which participants explicitly judged the gaze direction of a lateralized face. We compared the reversed congruency effect elicited by masked and unmasked faces, which has been attributed to joint attention. Across three experiments and a combined analysis, face masks did not affect the magnitude of the reversed congruency effect. These results reinforce the idea that gaze-triggered joint attention is robust enough to override the presence of face masks, highlighting the stability of human social attention even under conditions of limited facial visibility.",

Although rape myth\nendorsement decreased, participants still evaluated a non-stereotypical assault scenario more\nnegatively than a stereotypical one.

It stems from the increasing professional and administrative demands faced by lecturers, which have an impact on their occupational well-being, as well as the need for proactive behaviors such as championing behavior as a form of adaptation to institutional change. The theoretical review highlights that championing behavior can strengthen lecturers' psychological well-being by increasing their sense of meaning, autonomy, and social support. This study uses a quantitative approach with a survey method and criterion sampling technique and uses instruments that have undergone validity and reliability tests with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Cronbach's Alpha, and Composite Reliability through SPSS ver. 30.0 software. Simple linear regression analysis shows that championing behavior has a positive and significant effect on occupational well-being (β = 0.592; p &lt; 0.001), indicating that lecturers with proactive and innovative behavior tend to have higher occupational well-being. The results of this study emphasize the importance of championing behavior in building lecturers' occupational well-being and recommend that higher education institutions create a supportive, transparent, and appreciative work environment to foster championing behavior for the improvement of occupational well-being and academic quality.",

The present study explored chain mediation pathways, examining the impact of camouflaging autistic traits on the self and its subsequent influence on depressive symptoms. According to the diathesis-stress models, the dynamic interactionist model of vulnerability, the dual vulnerability model, the disconnect theory, and the unified model of depression, the present study examined two potential chain mediation pathways (i.e., social camouflaging - self-concept clarity and social camouflaging - self-disgust) of the association between autistic traits and depressive symptoms. Four hundred sixty-three undergraduate and graduate students completed an online survey measuring autistic traits, depressive symptoms, social camouflaging, self-concept clarity, and self-disgust. Autistic traits were directly and indirectly associated with increased depressive symptoms in the general population. Specifically, autistic traits were related to depressive symptoms through the chain mediation pathways of social camouflaging to self-concept clarity and social camouflaging to self-disgust. The results demonstrate the relationship between autistic traits and depressive symptoms when individuals engage in social camouflaging, particularly focusing on self-aspects (i.e., self-concept clarity and self-disgust). These findings underscore the complexities of mental health challenges associated with camouflaging autistic traits and highlight the importance of considering self-factors as critical intervention points for depressive symptoms.",

Job crafting is a proactive process in which employees redesign their tasks to find greater meaning and satisfaction, which is instrumental in meeting the challenges posed by the changing demands of education. Data were collected online between September 24–29, 2024, from 85 educators selected through purposive sampling, ensuring all participants had at least one year of teaching experience. The sample comprised 20 males (23.53%) and 65 females (76.47%), with teaching experience ranging from 3 to 30 years. Descriptive statistics indicated an average workload score of 94.89 (SD = 7.66) and an average job crafting score of 76.92 (SD = 26.04). Reliability testing showed strong internal consistency of the measurement tools, while regression analysis using SPSS 27.0.1 confirmed that workload significantly predicted job crafting (β = 0.486, p &lt; 0.001), explaining 23.6% of the variance.This finding highlight how the dual role of workload can both challenge and encourage proactive adaptation in work practices. These findings highlight the dual role of workload, which can act both as a stressor and as a catalyst for proactive adaptation in work practices. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how workload dynamics shape job crafting among educators, offering practical insights for improving teacher welfare and performance in the Indonesian education context.",

          "authors": "Kyung Hee Kim",
          "abstract": "Measurement is the foundation of scientific inference, yet educational and psychological research often relies on instruments that are abbreviated, selectively administered, or modified without evidence that the resulting scores remain valid. This measurement fragmentation alters what a test measures, weakens the interpretability of its scores, and undermines the comparability and reproducibility of findings. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing emphasize that validity is version-specific and must be demonstrated for each distinct form of an instrument; reliability alone cannot establish valid interpretation. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) offer a clear illustration of these issues. When administered in full, the TTCT has demonstrated strong construct representation and long-term predictive validity across cultures and decades. However, many researchers use only one or two TTCT activities or substitute unvalidated short forms, assuming that the validity of the complete instrument transfers to these modified versions. Such practices yield findings that reflect the limitations of the altered test rather than the properties of creative thinking, often leading to unwarranted criticisms of the TTCT or of creativity assessment more broadly. This article situates the TTCT within wider meta-scientific concerns and provides recommendations for improving measurement practice, including version-specific validation, comprehensive reporting of measurement decisions, and transparency in test materials. Addressing measurement fragmentation is essential for producing interpretable, replicable, and theoretically meaningful research.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated gambling behaviors as a predictor of depressive symptoms among undergraduate students at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, while examining gender differences and the moderating effect of age on this relationship. Employing a cross-sectional design, 400 participants were selected through simple random sampling from multiple faculties. Data collection utilized a questionnaire comprising demographic information and two standardized instruments: the problem gambling severity index (Ferris and Wynne, 2001) and the Beck's Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1961). Results revealed that gambling behaviors significantly predicted depressive symptoms (β = .546, t = 12.993, p &lt; .001), explaining 29.8% of the variance in depression scores. Gender analysis showed that female participants reported significantly higher depression scores (M = 34.15, SD = 17.31) compared to male participants (M = 31.39, SD = 7.91), t(398) = -1.998, p &lt; .001. Age emerged as a significant moderator of the gambling-depression relationship, F(1, 396) = 652.9209, p &lt; .001, accounting for an additional 35.5% variance (ΔR² = .3553). Conditional effects analysis revealed that participants aged 36-45 years demonstrated the strongest relationship between gambling behaviors and depressive symptoms (β = 1.9687, p &lt; .001), indicating heightened vulnerability in this age group. These findings highlight the substantial psychological impact of gambling behaviors on mental health among Nigerian university students, emphasizing gender disparities and age-related vulnerabilities.

          "abstract": "Virtue science has expanded significantly in recent decades but has focused almost exclusively on measurement at the individual level, ignoring the environments that shape character formation. Addressing this gap, we aimed to develop and validate the Character Climate Scale (CCS) to capture the moral ecology of higher education environments. Across ten studies (N &gt; 1,600) at five U.S. institutions the CCS was designed and refined to capture students’ perceptions of the moral ecology of their university as expressed through peers, professors, courses, co-curricular activities and personal formation experiences. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the hypothesized higher-order Character Climate factor and a five-factor structure capturing core domains of moral ecology. The CCS showed strong psychometric properties, including internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity, with stable structure across institutional contexts. The final 23-item CCS provides a robust, practical tool for assessing and tracking the moral ecology of education environments. It also enables institutions to evaluate virtue development efforts, identify strengths and growth areas, and monitor change over time, ultimately advancing virtue science and practice by situating moral development within its environmental context.",

          "abstract": "Climate change adaptation (CCA) increasingly relies on collaborative efforts to generate and circulate actionable knowledge. Among these, knowledge networks (KNs) have emerged as key infrastructures for fostering transnational cooperation, enabling mutual learning, and supporting local implementation. While their theoretical value is widely acknowledged, the empirical landscape of adaptation-related knowledge networks in Europe remains poorly understood. This article offers the first systematic mapping of KNs working on CCA in Europe, with a particular focus on Transnational Municipal Networks (TMNs)—a prominent subset composed primarily of local authorities. We identify and compare 32 knowledge networks across key dimensions including structure, governance, membership, funding models, and core activities. The analysis is grounded in two original datasets: a network-level dataset comprising 32 adaptation-related KNs and a membership-level dataset encompassing over 17,000 entries, systematically collected and geo-referenced. These resources provide an unprecedented empirical basis for understanding how climate knowledge is shared, institutionalised, and mobilised across Europe. Our findings reveal a diverse and uneven landscape, with significant variation in access thresholds, support mechanisms, and geographic representation. TMNs, in particular, differ in the type and intensity of support they provide—ranging from technical expertise and financial assistance to symbolic capital and peer learning opportunities. The article contributes to ongoing debates about multilevel climate governance and the role of networks in enhancing local adaptation capacity.",

          "abstract": "The social media platform TikTok has surged in societal and political significance, underscoring the need for communication researchers to study its content and dynamics. `traktok` is an `R` package that combines an implementation of the TikTok Research API with access to TikTok content through web-scraping and the 'hidden' API, which was reverse engineered to grant users access to more content. While it is neither the first nor only tool to do so, the combination  both ways to retrieve data from the platform with an easy-to-understand consistent syntax is built to encourage TikTok research.",

          "authors": "Heikki Wilenius",
          "abstract": "This chapter examines media imaginaries surrounding resource commodification in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, with a focus on events in 2020. It analyses two distinct yet interconnected media events. The first pertains to how the politics of natural resource commodification are debated and how various actors are positioned within these discussions. The second concerns the circulation of accounts of supernatural phenomena. The data include personal online exchanges from 2020–2021; three annual volumes (2018–2020) of a Central Kalimantan newspaper; selected news items from internet-based media (2017–2020); Twitter conversations from 2020 under various keywords; and selected YouTube videos featuring supernatural phenomena published between 2017 and 2020.\n\nFirst, the analysis argues that the Central Kalimantan mediascape is fragmented: established media outlets explicitly represent various state interests while claiming to serve the public, whereas social media discussions and circulating multimedia narratives often provide a counternarrative—if not constitute a counterpublic—serving as platforms for citizens to mobilise and articulate their interests. Second, the chapter introduces a new type of circulating discourse, termed “haunted publics,” in which accounts of supernatural events circulate in ways distinct from conventional counterpublics, yet the emergent effects of this circulation can still generate political critique. Third, consistent with previous research, it shows that discourses on supernatural events and resource politics are interrelated, even when they do not directly engage one another.",

          "authors": "Sherri Candelario",
          "abstract": "Kate’s House Foundation operates and owns seven accredited MAT homes serving justice-involved adults referred by the Drug Court and the Department of Corrections (DOC). The program emphasizes trauma-informed care, no rapid-exit policies, and prohibits resident “vote-outs.” Because all participants were justice-involved at entry, the realistic alternative to remaining in housing was the possibility of losing drug court benefits or returning to jail or prison for relapse or non-compliance. Within this high-risk context, the longer lengths of stay observed in this cohort represent extended periods in the community in lieu of incarceration, underscoring the preventive impact of a non-punitive, stabilization-first recovery housing model. We evaluated early exits, length of stay (LOS), completion/active status, employment change, and age patterns using assessments at ~0, 45, and 90 days (REC-CAP). 10, 12. Mean LOS was ~141 days (median ~97), and among residents engaged beyond 30 days the mean LOS was 181 days. Using LOS ≥60 days as a priori “engagement success,” retention was strongest among older adults, while residents &lt;25 showed the weakest ≥60-day retention. 5, 6 REC-CAP Social Capital &amp; Meaningful Activities scores skewed high (94% scoring 4–5 on a 5-point scale across 394 responses), indicating substantial perceived connection and purposeful activity during residence. Uniquely, this large single-system cohort spans seven houses run by one foundation under consistent policies, with data collected by two trained staff—reducing site-level variability common in multi-operator studies. In this cohort, Drug Court participants achieved retention patterns similar to DOC participants, supporting the role of non-punitive, MAT-compatible housing in maintaining community placement across justice-system categories.",

          "abstract": "Mitigating climate change requires individual behavioral changes and robust support for green policies. However, significant carbon inequality — where wealthier individuals have disproportionately larger carbon footprints — potentially poses a challenge to building broad-based demands for meaningful climate change mitigation. High emissions by the wealthiest in society may dampen the general public's perception of responsibility and support for policies necessary for stringent climate change mitigation. For this reason, we investigate how information about unequal carbon emissions within countries affects public support for climate mitigation efforts through a survey experiment (N = 1,110) on a representative sample of US respondents, providing information about the distribution of carbon emissions. Results show that exposure to this information increases support for stringent climate policies, particularly those targeting wealthy individuals. Notably, respondents perceive wealthier individuals as more responsible for climate change, without diminishing their own sense of responsibility for reducing pro-environmental behaviors. These findings suggest that making carbon inequality more salient can enhance broad-based support for climate policies without compromising individual engagement, offering insights into strategies for facilitating the green transition.",

          "authors": "Regina N. Watteel",
          "abstract": "Background: Canada’s 2021–2022 COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports were implemented with the stated aim of reducing transmission and hospital burden. In the absence of randomized controlled trial evidence for these endpoints, policymakers relied on vaccinated vs. unvaccinated comparisons from surveillance data and observational studies, as well as ungrounded simulations, despite known methodological limitations that rendered such evidence unreliable for public health policies with rights implications.\nMethods: We systematically critiqued Canadian public health surveillance reports and advisory briefs (Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health Ontario, Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table) together with related studies, identifying seven key biases classified by severity (critical/catastrophic), correctability, and scope. Distortions were quantified using published rate corrections, classification rules, time-series data, and population trends.\nResults: Critical biases included &gt;40% misclassification of early post-vaccination cases as unvaccinated and an 80-fold overestimation of senior unvaccinated hospitalization rates due to denominator errors. Additional critical biases—age-standardization obfuscating low-risk youth trends, testing fluctuations understating breakthrough cases, and misattribution rendering COVID-19 hospitalizations an invalid metric for burden—further distorted policy evidence. Catastrophic biases—selection and cumulative methodology—rendered group comparability invalid. Population trends showed case and hospitalization surges despite &gt;80% vaccination coverage, with vaccinated individuals dominating Omicron-era infections. Simulation studies retroactively justifying mandates contradicted real-world data with ungrounded counterfactuals used to estimate unproven benefits.\nConclusions: Pervasive, uncorrected biases in observational comparisons invalidated causal claims of transmission or hospital burden reduction. Progressive reliance on weaker evidence—coupled with expert bodies' lack of transparency in emphasizing unproven benefits while dismissing dissenting views—highlights a systemic failure to meet evidentiary standards for public health policies with rights implications. This analysis underscores the need for greater scientific rigor in interpreting observational data through real-time bias correction, transparent limitation reporting, and risk-stratified approaches to uphold evidentiary standards, ethical proportionality, and accountability. These lessons hold global relevance for evidence-based public health policy.",

It develops a theoretical argument grounded in analyses of Half-Earth Socialism, Green New Deal Simulator, and The Financial Times Climate Game, also drawing on qualitative interviews with developers and player discussions on Steam. These games invite players to experiment with climate crisis solutions, fostering learning by placing them in the role of powerful decision-makers confronting challenges such as achieving net-zero CO₂ by 2050 while maintaining full employment. Learning is shaped by three characteristics: offering curated choices, delivering immediate and vivid feedback, and manipulating time. Yet limitations such as restricted choice and ideological bias make reflection essential. Informal online spaces, including discussion forums, host debates on political visions and the realism of in-game simulations, offering blueprints for integrating digital games into climate action education.",

          "authors": "Patrick Habecker; Rick A. Bevins",
          "abstract": "The opening of sanctioned overdose prevention centers (OPCs) in New York City and the decriminalization of personal possession of all illicit drugs in Oregon marked significant changes to drug policy in the United States. Both changes came as the national yearly overdose deaths approached and then surpassed 100,000 deaths annually (CDC 2025a). Rising overdose deaths have been declared a state of emergency in the US and more Americans likely know someone who has died of an overdose than at any time in US history. In such an environment, new drug policies may have more support than they typically would. However, without sufficient public support, policy measures such as OPCs or decriminalization may be short-lived or reversed. In Oregon, the change in public support for decriminalization eroded enough from the passing of a law by ballot measure in 2020 to being revoked in 2024 by the legislature. Similarly, the current downturn in overdose deaths may cut support for sanctioned OPCs and other overdose prevention measures. Public support is therefore a critical component for sustained drug policy changes such as OPCs and decriminalization, even when these policies are introduced in times of emergency. In this paper, we studied the level of public support for OPCs and decriminalization measures as viewed by the general public in Nebraska. Nebraska is a state with little history of drug policy reform, a low rate of overdose deaths, and its residents are predominantly Republican. We estimated that 64.5% and 56.4% of adult Nebraskans support OPCs and 69.2% to 65.3% supported decriminalization in 2022 and 2023, respectively. This support was related to political party with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting both policies. However, 38% to 52% of Republicans also supported these two policies depending on the year. Although focused on Nebraska, these findings show what may be expected from similar states such as those in the Great Plains and Midwest areas of the US.",

Findings indicate high engagement with social media, with older participants showing higher usage levels (p = .006). Platform use was function-specific: Instagram and Facebook facilitated broad information sharing, while WhatsApp supported tactical grassroots organizing such as donation coordination. Despite widespread participation (64% shared verified information), efforts were undermined by rumours and a lack of two-way engagement with formal disaster agencies.

          "abstract": "Digital polarization is often examined through identity-based frameworks that presuppose stable groups. We instead conceptualize Digital Connective Narratives (DCN) as a process of interactional co-construction that yields an emergent connective narrative field around shared issues and oppositional framings. Within this framework, Polarized DCN (PDCN) arise when these connective fields consolidate along five structural dimensions, social relevance, conflict scope, historical depth, power asymmetries, and emotional intensity. To illustrate the approach, we analyze debates on X (formerly Twitter) during South Africa’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign using topic modeling, stance classification, and adversarial-language detection tracked across rollout phases. Findings show that polarization did not diffuse across all topics: it concentrated in conflict-relevant debates, while institutional/informational topics remained largely non-polarized and faded over time. Within polarized debates, adversarial language intensified and engagement persisted, with challenger (non-institutional) streams gaining relative prominence as the campaign unfolded. As the pandemic’s immediate salience waned, public justification lost urgency and conflict retreated to a narrower circle of highly engaged users.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCo-production with public stakeholders is increasingly recognised as an important approach to ensuring health research is relevant to communities and interventions and likely to generate sustainable change. Ideally, co-production needs to be sustained throughout different stages of research and allow stakeholders ownership of the research agenda. We explore a case study of iterative co-production conducted over a nine-month period with a wide range of disparate stakeholders that transformed into a research-ready consortium able to design and obtain funding for a creative health research programme. \n\nMain body\nThe ReCITE consortium is comprised of academics, creatives, and specialists in capacity development and community engagement in Liverpool, UK. Its main focus is health equity and coming up with new ways of working to tackle entrenched, avoidable and unfair differences in health. ReCITE led a series of six workshops in 2023 to co-produce a research programme to investigate creative approaches for improving health equity. Fifty-six stakeholders from the academic, creative and arts, health, community and voluntary sectors participated across six workshops that sought broad engagement and consolidated stakeholder input to develop a research agenda and expand the consortium. Common emerging themes were: 1) understanding complexities in funding creative health; 2) investigating storytelling as a catalyst for change; 3) achieving change through collective action; 4) the role of creative advocacy to change societal and funding structures; 5) evidencing the impact of community-led creative health interventions on health equity. These formed multiple co-produced outputs, including five pillars of a theory of change for the research that underpinned the research questions and determined five interventions to take forward by the research-ready consortium to securing funding for future work. \n\nConclusion\t\nThe iterative process of gaining stakeholder input, consolidating it, and seeking further input, helped to incorporate the perspectives of different stakeholder groups into different project outputs. Equitable power-sharing guided decision-making over what to prioritise was important in building ownership of the research agenda and trust among stakeholders. However, this was a lengthy iterative process and sustaining time commitment was difficult for those stakeholders who were not fully funded to participate.",

The findings show that both offenders and victims employ bounded rational decision-making. For offenders, this is exemplified by aspects such as tailor-made ransom demands for each victim and balancing between trust signals and pressure tactics. For victims, this includes aspects such as the reasoning behind the decision to negotiate and pay a ransom demand, considering for example, the financial situation of their company, value of the data, and time and effort required to recover without a decryptor. However, both parties also have to deal with information asymmetry, including offenders having incomplete information on the victim’s finances or the value of the data, or victims being unsure about the credibility of the ransomware group. The findings also illustrate the interplay between both parties in shaping the outcome of the ransomware attack, and the professional aspects and imperfections of LockBit’s ransomware operations. The study highlights the importance of understanding victim-offender interactions during ransomware attacks, while also providing practical implications for the support of victims.",

          "authors": "Phil Swatton",
          "abstract": "Empirical political science generates knowledge of the world through abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation. However, to date, no attempt has been made to compare the explanatory quality of the sociological modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the socio-economic positions of voters, and the spatial modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the ideology of voters. I argue that the paradigm of predictive inference, or machine learning, offers three contributions towards comparing these traditions within the abductive framework of political science. This depends on a change in emphasis, from seeking to produce maximally predictive models according a given metric to treating the predictive power of well-chosen variables as a theoretically interesting quantity. Taking the 2019 UK general election and 2019 EU parliament election as my primary and secondary case studies respectively, I use supervised machine learning to compare models using demographic variables and ideological variables to predict vote choice. Using British Election Study data I find that models using demographic variables are not much more accurate than assuming all voters vote for the largest party. I find that models using ideological variables perform better, but even these models struggle to predict third party vote choice. Using European Election Study data from 15 countries, I confirm that this result generalises, albeit there is too much uncertainty to confirm it in any particular country. I perform some post-hoc analysis using mutual information and PCA to give further support to my evidence. To my knowledge, this is the first time mutual information has been used to study vote choice. I conclude by arguing that in line with the three contributions my evidence shows that the spatial modelling tradition represents a better explanation in the abductive reasoning framework, and highlight several promising directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "This study examines mortality dynamics across major macroeconomic regions—Western countries, non-Western regions, and China—from 1960 to 2023, exploring variability and underlying drivers. Descriptive analysis shows that non-Western regions experienced the highest death rates in 1960–1990, followed by a marked decline as GDP per capita increased. China exhibited a similar pattern. Conversely, Western countries achieved only modest mortality reductions after 1991 despite sustained economic growth, even when controlling for population aging (≥65 years). Regression models and partial correlations indicate that economic progress initially correlates with mortality decline in all regions. However, in Western countries, this relationship reverses after 1991, forming an inverted-U curve when mortality is modeled against GDP per capita and elderly share. This suggests diminishing health returns and potential adverse effects of advanced development—such as environmental degradation, lifestyle-related diseases, and occupational risks. Non-Western regions, with slower economic acceleration, show no comparable reversal. Findings imply that beyond a development threshold, further growth may paradoxically elevate mortality. Policy strategies should prioritize balanced, sustainable development and integrated “One Health” approaches to mitigate health risks associated with over-rapid economic expansion.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding the intricate relationships\nbetween body, subjectivity, and emotions within social anthropology. Drawing on\nphenomenological, feminist, and critical social theory, I argue that these three dimensions\nconstitute mutually constitutive domains that cannot be analyzed in isolation. The body\nis not merely a biological entity but a site of social inscription, cultural meaning-making,\nand lived experience. Subjectivity emerges through embodied practices situated within\nspecific cultural contexts and power relations. Emotions, far from being purely individual\npsychological states, function as socially mediated phenomena that shape and are shaped\nby both corporeal experiences and subjective formations. By synthesizing contributions\nfrom phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, Csordas), practice theory (Bourdieu, Ortner),\nbiopolitics (Foucault), feminist theory (Butler, Grosz, Fausto-Sterling), and the\nanthropology of emotions (Rosaldo, Ahmed, Lutz), this paper proposes an integrative\nanalytical approach. This framework enables anthropologists to examine how social\nstructures become embodied, how subjects navigate normative regimes through their\ncorporeal existence, and how emotional experiences mediate between individual agency\nand collective formations. The paper concludes by discussing methodological\nimplications for ethnographic research that takes seriously the embodied, emotional\ndimensions of subjectivity.",

Based on interviews and group discussions with 47 migrants residing in Germany, this study identifies the contours of a distinct “German Dream”. Participants portrayed Germany as an institutional counterpoint to the United States, describing it as a “caring society” characterized by low inequality and extensive welfare provisions. This study makes three contributions to the study of geographical imaginaries. First, it demonstrates how imaginaries are relationally constructed by showing how migrants construct the German Dream through comparisons with the American Dream. Second, it highlights how different institutional contexts foster distinct imaginaries. Third, it emphasizes how imaginaries convey a vision of the good society, showing that migrants evaluate not only their own prospects but also the broader social order.",

In the resulting uncontested elections, voters cannot choose between different candidates and hold local representatives accountable. Amalgamation might be a solution for this challenge to democracy since larger jurisdictions need fewer elected officials per voter. Combining data on all Swiss local government mergers in the 21st century with data on local executive elections, this article assesses whether amalgamation reforms indeed increase candidate supply and hence local electoral contestation. Staggered difference-in-differences regressions show that amalgamation increases the number of candidates/seat. The underlying mechanisms seem to go beyond a ``mechanical'' effect that results from a mere expansion of the candidate pool. This study, thus, provides first empirical evidence that local government amalgamation might contribute to mitigate a hidden supply side crisis of electoral democracy at the local level.",

This study finds only limited signs of selective exposure: while intention to vote for or against the initiative was not related to the query stance, respondents’ climate beliefs partially influenced query selection. I further test whether selective exposure is greater when users choose queries from recommended options than when they formulate them independently, and discuss the role of expected vote outcome, political beliefs, and cognitive factors in query selection.",

          "abstract": "As remote and hybrid work become more common, many workers are seeking ‘third places’ -alternative environments outside the home and office - to work and connect. This study explores the role of public libraries as alternative workplaces for remote workers in Australia. Drawing on survey data from 225 remote workers recruited via Prolific, we examine who uses libraries for remote work, how often, and why. Weekly, around eight per cent of respondents use libraries for at least half a day, a rate similar to that for coworking spaces, while a further one in three would consider doing so. Libraries are valued for quietness, affordability, internet access, and a sense of community, but limited privacy and restricted hours remain barriers. The findings highlight the library’s potential to meet workforce needs and offer practical implications for library managers seeking to design spaces and policies that better support remote workers and their wellbeing.",

          "authors": "Sally Eunyoung Seo",
          "abstract": "Animals often stand as the most vivid symbols of the natural world, shaping how people imagine, value, and care for the environment. This study examines how emotional connections with animals relate to environmental attitudes and whether feelings of place attachment mediate this relationship. Drawing on frameworks from conservation psychology and sense-of-place research, two animal connection constructs—Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity—were tested as predictors of environmental concern among a U.S. sample of 282 adults. Each mediation model was estimated with 5,000 bootstrap samples, entering one predictor at a time while controlling for the other. These mediation models were specifically designed to evaluate whether place attachment functions as an intervening variable linking each animal connection construct to environmental attitudes, allowing us to estimate both direct and indirect effects while accounting for the other predictor. Results showed that both Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity were positively associated with pro-environmental attitudes and with both measures of Place Attachment. Place Attachment partially mediated the relationship between Animal Empathy and Environmental Attitudes. In contrast, Place Attachment did not significantly mediate the effect of Animal Solidarity, which was directly predictive of environmental concern. These findings suggest that empathy-based and solidarity-based connections with animals may foster environmental care through distinct psychological pathways. Understanding how affective bonds with animals shape place-based and environmental engagement can inform education, communication, and relational approaches to fostering ecological responsibility.",

In this paper, we explore the structure of a network of 1,435 IHEs on Twitter. We discovered significant correlations between the network attributes: various centralities and clustering coefficients -- and IHEs' attributes, such as enrollment, tuition, and religious/racial/gender affiliations. We uncovered the network's community structure linked to homophily -- such that similar followers follow similar colleges. Additionally, we analyzed followers' self-descriptions and identified 12 overlapping topics that can be traced to their group identities.",

          "abstract": "While a significant body of scholarly work exists to diagnose the probability of systemic socio-political crises, less attention has been paid to the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the character of the regime that emerges from the collapse. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a falsifiable theoretical framework for forecasting the post-collapse morphology of political systems. It integrates insights from the structural history of the Annales School, the heuristic use of concepts from depth psychology, and findings from evolutionary psychology to posit that a society operates on three interconnected levels: a rapidly changing socio-cultural \"Operating System\"; a deeper, intermediate layer of universal symbolic patterns, or archetypal \"BIOS\"; and a foundational \"Hardware\" of immutable biological instincts. The framework’s first stage provides a robust diagnosis of systemic instability by measuring the relationship between stress and resilience within the surface \"Operating System.\" The second, and more innovative stage, introduces the Archetypal Activation Index (AAI), a heuristic tool designed to forecast the ideological and psychological DNA of the successor state by analyzing the activation of deep symbolic patterns during a systemic \"reboot.\" The purpose of this paper is thus methodological: to propose a structured framework that shifts the focus from diagnosis to prognosis. Through a detailed examination of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, and the Weimar Republic, we illustrate how this two-stage analysis can deconstruct the anatomy of historical chaos and provide a more structured understanding of the political forms that emerge from it.",

          "abstract": "The 2025 shift from Biden’s Democratic to Trump’s Republican administration led to a relevant change in US strategy for the war in Ukraine. Models of democratic responsiveness imply that this would also be reflected in divergent preferences among US partisan voters regarding the normative, strategic, and economic considerations connected to supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Do voters on the political left and right resolve these trade-offs differently? We bring conjoint and vignette survey experiments with 2,334 US citizens to this question. We show that absolute levels of support for Ukraine are lower among Republicans. However, irrespective of partisanship, citizens resolve the fundamental trade-offs involved in Ukraine policy similarly. Average support is higher for strategies that sustain the territorial integrity and political sovereignty of Ukraine compared to concessions to Russia -- even if less strongly so among (moderate) US Republicans. Both Democrat and Republican voters show relevant concern for the human costs of war, domestic economic costs, and escalation risk -- with economic costs resonating more among Republicans. Our results imply, tentatively, that differences in partisan preferences are smaller than the US administrations’ drawback of Ukraine support would let expect. Overall, for a case where normative motivations for intervention loom large, public support is not structured as expected along the left-right axis.",

          "authors": "Jan Mazza; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Using Italian microdata, this paper documents that, conditional on parental resources, education, and transfers, (i) expecting an inheritance predicts a 19.6 percentage points (63.5%) higher probability of university enrollment, and (ii) expected heirs tend to belong to altruistic dynasties, since having received an inheritance nearly doubles the intention to leave a bequest. I rationalize these findings with a stylized model where dynastic altruism underpins expected heirs’ stronger bequest motives. They accumulate human capital to increase lifetime income, hence the ability to finance bequests. The quantitative model attributes 44% of the gap in student rates between expected heirs and the rest to dynastic bequest motives, 35% to coresidence with parents and inter vivos transfers, whereas the expected wealth transfer itself has a strong negative effect on education. Policy counterfactuals show that inheritance taxation raises enrollment, especially when it funds student grants, and that the link between inheritance expectations and education is stronger when the discounted returns to education are lower. These findings help explain intergenerational persistence in education, wealth, and income, and highlight how inheritance taxation can affect the level and composition of human capital.

This raises many important questions for researchers. What is the political motivation for Republicans to side with Russia against Ukraine? How did this come to be? To answer these questions, this article presents the first recorded history of speech manipulation in Republican discourse. The investigation traced the origin of speech manipulation in Republican discourse to conservative principles introduced by William F. Buckley Jr. and Barry Goldwater. Critical discourse analysis identified manipulative strategies and techniques and revealed hidden messages and motivations connected across speakers and generations.

When academics rely on social media platforms’ classifiers, concepts, and categorization methods, it undermines the replicability of findings.

Industry control over data collection and curation raises concerns about the self-interested goals of industry players in such collaborations, especially when the social media platforms claim the findings are highly policy-relevant. We specifically discuss Meta’s intentional deployment of \"break glass\" measures—changing the active algorithm to reduce polarization—during data collections in those collaborations.

          "abstract": "Research shows that women leave male-dominated work settings more often than their male colleagues. In public services such as policing, disproportionate attrition of women slows improvement of gender equality, but can also affect legitimacy and service outcomes. Typically, attrition of women in policing is studied in isolation, while sources (and thus, solutions) of inequalities may lie in societal or broader organizational dynamics. Using monthly employment register data, this study compared attrition of Dutch female policing staff to those of their male counterparts and their peers in other public subsectors. Findings indicated that, while women were more likely to leave the Dutch policing sector than men, several other subsectors showed similar gender differences. Results suggest that approaches to improve gender equality, both in policing and in other ‘gender-typed’ subsectors, should not be limited to increasing representation and should involve reviewing implicit assumptions about employees, including procedures for appraisal.",

          "abstract": "While journalism research increasingly engages with the applications of artificial intelligence (AI), it often overlooks the foundational layer that enables AI itself: data. This study conceptualizes ‘data’ in journalism, a field profoundly shaped by data-intensive practices. Integrating perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS), infrastructure studies, and journalism practice, this study traces how data is embedded in news organizations. Following a Laswellian framework, we describe: What is datafied (subjects), who produces and processes data (actors), where data circulates (spaces), how data is composed (constructions), and why data is valued (values). To illustrate these facets, we construct a Patchwork News Outlet, which is a composite case that synthesizes empirical insights from six news organizations from five countries, identifying common data practices and points of divergence. Findings reveal that data practices span from the ubiquitous use of data, to selective engagement with data-driven strategies, and strategic resistance to datafication. We offer not one but five definitions of data, each grounded in a specific theoretical stream and derived from an analysis across the Lasswellian framework’s dimensions: data (1) as a socially constructed artifact shaped by power structures, biases, and strategic interests; (2) as an infrastructural entity embedded in socio-technical systems; (3) as resource for news stories; (4) as machine-readable input optimized for computational processing; and (5) as empirical representations of audience transactions and editorial practices, embedded with biases and contested value. Alongside its conceptual contribution, we introduce a systematic framework for locating research foci across intersecting dimensions of data in journalism.",

Drawing on Ostrom’s (1990) Nobel Prize-winning principles of commons governance and the formal repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery (Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, 2023; UN Human Rights Council, 2021), we contend that Indigenous stewardship frameworks represent not historical artefacts but sophisticated legal systems optimally suited for abundance management. Quantitative evidence demonstrates that Indigenous-managed lands exhibit superior ecological outcomes compared to protected areas (Fa et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2019). Constitutional recognition of Indigenous sovereignty is presented as a positive-sum transition from the failing logic of the scarcity-based Extraction Paradigm (market/state binary) to the proven effectiveness of the Stewardship Paradigm. This analysis shows that legal continuity arguments cannot resolve foundational legitimacy deficits when the underlying dominant epistemic architecture actively obstructs human flourishing in conditions of technological potential and ecological urgency.\nKeywords: Indigenous sovereignty, constitutional legitimacy, post-scarcity economics, commons governance, Doctrine of Discovery, stewardship frameworks, Ostrom.",

By integrating theories of destructive leadership, moralized favoritism, and social exchange, the paper proposes a framework of procedural and institutional remedies that transform discretionary authority into accountable and transparent practice.

The results obtained after an overarching comparison show how KNN is significantly more accurate and trustful in relation to any other method, outperforming any other on any key error measure and interpretability factors. The addition of contribution and importance investigation on variables extends to this paper a unique degree of originality, showing which SKUs’ physical variables are most significantly influencing volume saturation on pallets, and offering immediate management implications related to their operative meaning.

Yet, even flexible MRP models contain errors generated by non-response and model misspecification. We propose a principled, data-driven method to leverage observable errors on auxiliary quantities with known marginal distributions — e.g., election outcomes — to improve estimates of policy attitudes. Our method leverages the correlation between auxiliary variables and outcomes of interest to calibrate MRP estimates to these known marginal distributions. We illustrate our approach using a pre-election poll measuring support for an abortion referendum. We find that the method reduces county-level error by two-thirds relative to traditional MRP. We also show how our calibration approach can be used to generate estimates for smaller nested geographies, such as precincts, even in the absence of poststratification data at this level. Our approach provides a framework for fully incorporating known population data to improve estimates of public opinion in small subgroups, providing scholars another tool to study representation.",

          "abstract": "Much AI risk discourse centers on loss of control under AGI. We ask a nearer question: before those thresholds, does modern machine learning already create a structural risk for how societies produce knowledge and culture? We use temporality in an operational sense: the way understanding changes over time and the signals left by that process. Representation learning and large-scale autoregressive generation approximate the distribution of task outputs like text, designs and decisions while omitting the slow, path-dependent human learning that produced them; at scale, these pipelines function as general-purpose production technologies. We formalize the link from technical indistinguishability to market selection with a GAN-inspired economic model and a screening threshold: when divergence between model signals and temporal signals is small and verification remains costly, decision makers cease screening, prices track pooled quality, and temporality-intensive work exits. We call this value collapse. As training data increasingly mirror such environments, models absorb their own outputs and the risk of model collapse rises through loss of diversity and feedback. Alignment is, in our model, largely orthogonal: by improving usability and narrowing observable gaps, it can reduce incentives to screen and thereby intensify these selection pressures, especially where provenance remains costly to verify. This integration of machine learning and economic reasoning clarifies conditions under which signals and rewards are reshaped.",

There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "authors": "Kenji Akimoto",
          "abstract": "This study examines the impact of the nationwide suspension of nuclear power plants following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident, as well as the subsequent restart of the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima Prefecture, on local socio-economic structures. Using municipal-level statistics for 2010, 2014, and 2020, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to extract the underlying patterns of regional socio-economic organization. In addition, difference-in-differences (DID) regression analysis was employed to evaluate the effects of plant proximity on municipal fiscal indicators. The findings reveal that in 2010, urban scale and plant location were the primary axes of differentiation; by 2014, however, the suspension accentuated demographic and fiscal vulnerabilities across municipalities. In 2020, even after the plant restart, the structure of urban dominance and peripheral stagnation persisted, with widening disparities. The DID analysis further suggests that the fiscal benefits of the restart were limited and unevenly distributed. This study contributes to the literature by quantitatively and spatially assessing the dynamic impacts of exogenous shocks on regional societies, while highlighting both the risks of nuclear dependence and the pressing policy challenge of mitigating regional inequality.",

          "authors": "Douglas Guilbeault; Spencer Caplan; Charles Yang",
          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle throughout the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' choices systematically deviate from both imitation and optimization. Instead, they follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their choices stabilize. We effectively estimate this threshold using the Tolerance Principle (TP), a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. We show that threshold-based agents produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents, while also providing a better model of how a critical mass of dissenters can overturn conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. Furthermore, in a preregistered dyadic experiment requiring people to infer non-linguistic behavioral patterns amid controlled levels of noise in observed signals, TP outperforms all other models at reproducing learning rates among human participants. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

Drawing on data from 815 German Android users, we analyzed digital traces collected before and during a seven-day study involving up to seven daily short surveys. Using mixed-effects models, we assessed how granting log access and completing short surveys affected glance, session, and app episode frequency and duration in both the short term (after surveys) and long term (across days). The result show that smartphone logging induced small, transient reductions in use frequency and duration, particularly during the first five days, suggesting initial self-regulation due to awareness of monitoring. Experience sampling prompts produced short-term increases in use lasting two to three hours. Overall, both methods induced some degree of reactivity in smartphone use, though the effect of this reactivity on inferences remains unknown.

          "abstract": "While journalism research increasingly engages with the applications of artificial intelligence (AI), it often overlooks the foundational layer that enables AI itself: data. This study conceptualizes ‘data’ in journalism, a field profoundly shaped by data-intensive practices. Integrating perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS), infrastructure studies, and journalism practice, this study traces how data is embedded in news organizations. Following a Laswellian framework, we describe: What is datafied (subjects), who produces and processes data (actors), where data circulates (spaces), how data is composed (constructions), and why data is valued (values). To illustrate these facets, we construct a Patchwork News Outlet, which is a composite case that synthesizes empirical insights from six news organizations from five countries, identifying common data practices and points of divergence. Findings reveal that data practices span from the ubiquitous use of data, to selective engagement with data-driven strategies, and strategic resistance to datafication. We offer not one but five definitions of data, each grounded in a specific theoretical stream and derived from an analysis across the Lasswellian framework’s dimensions: data (1) as a socially constructed artifact shaped by power structures, biases, and strategic interests; (2) as an infrastructural entity embedded in socio-technical systems; (3) as resource for news stories; (4) as machine-readable input optimized for computational processing; and (5) as empirical representations of audience transactions and editorial practices, embedded with biases and contested value. Alongside its conceptual contribution, we introduce a systematic framework for locating research foci across intersecting dimensions of data in journalism.",

Although regression approaches frame these as mutually exclusive, the underlying theoretical expectations concern differences at the extremes of the genetic distribution, as measured by a polygenic index (PGI). Here compensation and reinforcing dynamics are mapped to socioeconomic (SES) differences in the rate of overachievers (low-PGI individuals who attain a degree) and underachievers (high-PGI individuals who do not). Using three representative datasets from the US and UK, the findings show that compensatory and reinforcing dynamics can operate simultaneously: high-SES students are more likely to overachieve despite a low PGI - suggesting compensation - and less likely to underachieve - supporting Scarr-Rowe hypothesis. This framework challenges the presumed trade-off between equity and efficiency, and, in reconciling longstanding hypotheses on GxE interactions, possibly explains inconsistent findings from the literature.",

This study employs computational methods to examine the prevalence, composition, partisanship, content production, and reposting behavior of religious users in abortion-related Twitter discourse during Italy’s 2022 general elections. Findings reveal that religious users constitute a small but vocal minority, overrepresented among media, political, and influencer accounts, potentially amplifying their visibility. Their partisanship aligns with right-wing parties, yet engagement with mainstream political leaders is lower than average, possibly due to selective curation and limited resonance with party messaging. Their content also includes misinformation linking vaccines to abortion, reinforcing moral-conservative narratives. These results advance understanding of religious users as political actors in networked public spheres and demonstrate the value of computational approaches for empirically analyzing religion’s role in online political communication.",

          "abstract": "With the adoption of the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, Artificial Intelligence Act, and European Media Freedom Act, the EU has set in motion an ambitious regulatory project to shape the governance of digital platforms and AI systems. This paper maps the governance stakeholders involved in the operationalization of these four instruments and examines their distribution of powers and responsibilities. Building on existing typologies of platform governance and regulatory space theory, we introduce an analytical framework that foregrounds three structural elements–competencies, capacities, and connectedness–alongside eight regulatory functions, ranging from agenda-setting to enforcement and discourse shaping. We then operationalize this framework in the context of the standardization ecosystem, highlighting the growing prominence of standardization bodies as central actors in multi-stakeholderism. Our analysis shows that, despite the promises of multi-stakeholderism for more democratic and cooperative governance configurations, in practice this approach often disregards material power asymmetries. This reality privileges technocratic expertise and industry stakeholders over public-interest actors, hindering ultimately a more equitable and democratic governance paradigm. We conclude by arguing that pursuing strategic autonomy, as the EU boasts, requires reducing the regulatory power of private actors and strengthening capacities of actors normatively and materially grounded in the public interest.",

While such initiatives have been criticized as conspicuous consumption or vanity projects, one public benefit claimed is the display of new artistic perspectives: Due to their strong personal vision and independence, private museums have been argued (including by private museum founders themselves) to showcase underexposed artists and provide artistic innovation. We test this proposition with large-scale exhibition and auction data. We find that contrary to claims of artistic novelty, private museums disproportionately exhibit established artists, as their exhibition choices tend to favor artists who have already had longer careers, more prior exhibitions and higher auction turnover. Thus, the potential of private museums to serve as incubators of novel perspectives is limited.",

We employ a competition-in-utility approach to offer a tractable characterization of developers' revenue source choices.

          "authors": "Mohit Singhal",
          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThe opioid epidemic continues to impose a profound human and financial burden on the U.S. healthcare system. While previous studies have examined prescribing behavior or social determinants of health (SDOH) separately, few have quantitatively integrated these domains with Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) cost levers to explain geographic variation in opioid-related spending. This study develops an interpretable, county-level machine-learning framework linking Medicare Part D opioid-prescribing data (2013–2023) with socioeconomic, behavioral, and healthcare-access indicators from the County Health Rankings dataset.\n\nUsing a Random Forest regression pipeline with automated feature selection and five-fold cross-validation, the final model achieved R² = 0.9698 and RMSE = $445.36, explaining nearly all observed variation in opioid cost per capita. Comparative analysis showed that SDOH-only models explained 34% of variance, utilization-only models 95%, and the integrated PBM + SDOH model 97%, confirming that economic, behavioral, and access factors jointly shape fiscal burden. Global SHAP and permutation-importance analyses identified cost per claim, claims per 1,000 population, and opioid-prescribing rate as dominant predictors, amplified by structural vulnerabilities such as unemployment, income inequality, and low mental-health-provider density.\n\nCounterfactual simulations quantified the potential financial impact of PBM and SDOH interventions. PBM levers—including formulary tightening, prescriber-utilization guidance, and cost-per-claim reduction—produced short-term savings of approximately 4–6%. SDOH improvements, such as expanded primary-care and mental-health capacity and reductions in behavioral-risk prevalence, generated larger compounding effects, with integrated PBM + SDOH reforms yielding national savings of roughly 17% (≈$23 billion annually). Geographic patterns aligned with CDC dispensing-rate distributions, with the highest predicted cost burden concentrated in Utah, Kentucky, and Alabama.\n\nThis integrated analytical framework demonstrates how combining PBM program design with SDOH modeling can inform equitable policy, optimize healthcare spending, and guide targeted interventions in the ongoing U.S. opioid crisis.\n\nKeywords: opioid prescribing; social determinants of health; pharmacy benefit management; Medicare Part D; machine learning; public health policy.",

          "abstract": "Since 2017, Western scholarly publishers have faced growing pressure from Chinese state regulators to restrict access to politically sensitive content or risk losing market access. This study examines the conditions compelling publishers to acquiesce to censorship demands through qualitative interviews with twenty-four participants: twelve Asia Studies academics and twelve publishing professionals. Thematic analysis revealed ten themes across six categories: conditions, definitions, responsibility, knowledge, resistance, and values. Censorship complicity stems from China's economic power and publishers' revenue dependence on subscriptions, article processing charges, and citation metrics. The study identifies pervasive tendencies to deny or redistribute responsibility, contributing to normalization despite value alignment opposing censorship. \n\nSelf-censorship occurs in a climate of strategic uncertainty, where publishers withhold information to protect commercial interests and avoid anti-competition violations, preventing coordinated resistance. While author boycotts initially constrained compliance—reversing Cambridge University Press's 2017 decision to acquiesce to censorship demands—fragmentation has weakened collective action, particularly among early-career scholars dependent on access to China. Participants demonstrated shared conceptualizations of censorship and liberal-democratic values favouring resistance but diverged on whether China-based scholars' interests should inform responses. Collaborative resistance requires expanding stakeholder coalitions to include research funders and librarians through industry-wide frameworks analogous to the Global Network Initiative.",

Girls with younger siblings drive this finding. At age 13, the same group is more likely to share and fulfil caregiving duties. Findings suggest that mothers might have leaned on their children to maintain some paid work after job loss, stimulating their daughters’ prosocial development and involvement in caregiving.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe study highlights how economic downturns reinforce the gendered and generational underpinnings that bind the paid and unpaid work of family resilience.",

Using data from 148,421 couples across 30 low- and middle-income countries and 34 Indian states, we estimated Bayesian regression models via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with uninformative priors. IPV justification and IPV experience varied significantly across and within countries. Women’s risk was more strongly associated with their own attitudes than with their husbands’ attitudes. Community-level justification independently increased risk, while higher country-level gender equality was linked to lower IPV exposures. The association between neighbourhood norms and women’s risk was moderated by spousal attitudes, with the association strongest among couples in which neither partner justified IPV. Country-level gender equality consistently reduced women’s risk regardless of couples’ attitudes. These findings suggest that focusing solely on couples where husbands perpetrate IPV is insufficient. Sustainable prevention efforts must also address community norms and structural gender inequality.",

          "abstract": "Geopolitical risk has emerged as a persistent feature of the global business environment, yet its impacts on domestic mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) remain underexplored, particularly in emerging economies with distinctive institutional contexts. This study examines how geopolitical risk influences M&amp;A deal failure in India and whether acquirers’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) moderates this relationship under the country’s mandatory CSR regime. Using a sample of 377 domestic M&amp;A deals announced between 2015–16 and 2019–20, the analysis reveals a counterintuitive pattern: higher geopolitical risk is associated with a lower likelihood of deal failure, suggesting that firms pursue domestic consolidation as a defensive hedge against external volatility. While acquirers’ CSR performance independently reduces the probability of deal failure, its interaction with high geopolitical risk increases the likelihood of failure. It indicates that strong CSR commitments may constrain financial flexibility during uncertain times, thereby heightening deal vulnerability. These results remain robust across alternative model specifications, sub-samples, and disaggregated geopolitical risk measures. By integrating geopolitical risk with a legally enforced CSR spending regime, this study provides one of the first empirical demonstrations of how macro-political turbulence and regulatory social responsibility jointly shape corporate M&amp;A outcomes in emerging markets. These findings re-conceptualize CSR as a potential financial constraint under regulation and advance the understanding of firm behavior at the intersection of risk, responsibility, and regulation.",

          "abstract": "Sociological theories propose contradictory predictions regarding the influence of underlying social inequalities on parents’ sport expectations. This study used data from a national survey of adults to examine how, why, and to what extent parents’ expectations for athletic achievement are linked to underlying social inequalities. Logistic regressions using data from parents (n = 676-690) revealed factors associated with expectations of their children becoming a small college, college scholarship, or professional or Olympic athlete. Most parents appeared to have realistically pessimistic expectations. Higher expectations were apparent among parents of younger children, who perceived their children to have stronger athletic identities seemingly born out of their sport participation histories, who were sport fans, who had children that were Black or Latinx, who lived in neighborhoods with more non-White families, and, when it came to expectations of becoming a professional or Olympic athlete, who were from a lower socioeconomic status position.

The results supported some theoretical arguments and contradicted others, and they can be used to target educational messaging around youth sport practices.",

          "authors": "Alicea Peyton",
          "abstract": "This article examines the role of Library and Information Science (LIS) in countering\norganized deception through ethical information stewardship. Drawing on Paulette\nRothbauer’s framework of everyday information behavior and Benson George\nCooke’s concept of epigenomic ignorance, it argues that truth distortion—\nmanifested through misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation—is not\nmerely a cognitive hazard but a structural enabler of trafficking, cartel violence,\npropaganda, and other organized harms. Using a taxonomy of information disorder\nand theological framing from Genesis and John 8:32, the piece positions LIS as a\nmoral and public-health intervention. It outlines accountability practices—\nprovenance tracing, contextualization, equitable access, and verification—as\nessential tools for disrupting epistemic violence and restoring communal agency.\nThe article concludes that withholding information is not only a breach of\nprofessional ethics, as codified in the ALA’s Bill of Rights, but a betrayal of\nliberation itself. Truth-telling, in this context, becomes a ministry of repair.",

          "authors": "George Cooper",
          "abstract": "Since 2017, Western scholarly publishers have faced growing pressure from Chinese state regulators to restrict access to politically sensitive content or risk losing market access. This study examines the conditions compelling publishers to acquiesce to censorship demands through qualitative interviews with twenty-four participants: twelve Asia Studies academics and twelve publishing professionals. Thematic analysis revealed ten themes across six categories: conditions, definitions, responsibility, knowledge, resistance, and values. Censorship complicity stems from China's economic power and publishers' revenue dependence on subscriptions, article processing charges, and citation metrics. The study identifies pervasive tendencies to deny or redistribute responsibility, contributing to normalization despite value alignment opposing censorship. \n\nSelf-censorship occurs in a climate of strategic uncertainty, where publishers withhold information to protect commercial interests and avoid anti-competition violations, preventing coordinated resistance. While author boycotts initially constrained compliance—reversing Cambridge University Press's 2017 decision to acquiesce to censorship demands—fragmentation has weakened collective action, particularly among early-career scholars dependent on access to China. Participants demonstrated shared conceptualizations of censorship and liberal-democratic values favouring resistance but diverged on whether China-based scholars' interests should inform responses. Collaborative resistance requires expanding stakeholder coalitions to include research funders and librarians through industry-wide frameworks analogous to the Global Network Initiative.",

          "abstract": "How can partisan favoritism persist when institutions have formal rules designed to prevent it? Existing scholarship emphasizes the electoral or elite payoffs of favoritism, but pays less attention to the processes that make partisan favoritism possible. We develop a theory of coordination advantage in which shared partisanship facilitates networks that link local and central officials. These networks provide privileged access to information and informal guidance, enabling local officials aligned with central officials to submit more and higher-quality grant applications without overtly violating formal rules. Using data on municipal grant requests and federal allocations in Brazil, we show that aligned mayors submit more proposals, receive more funding, and achieve greater compliance with technical standards than their unaligned counterparts. Original data on legislators' visits to municipalities and ministerial schedules show that partisan ties activate coordination. These findings suggest that partisan favoritism persists by exploiting partisan networks to navigate within institutional constraints.",

          "abstract": "Traditional retailing has undergone a profound transformation driven by shifting consumer expectations, an increase in e-commerce, and growing demand for immersive shopping environments. Experiential marketing has emerged as a strategic approach aimed at creating memorable, multisensory, and emotionally engaging retail experiences. Rather than focusing solely on products and transactions, experiential retailing emphasizes sensory stimulation, emotional connection, aesthetic design, and interactive participation, which collectively influence customer satisfaction, engagement, and loyalty. Prior research highlights that hedonic and utilitarian motivations, environmental cues, and holistic experience design significantly shape consumer behavior within retail settings. This study synthesizes key theoretical perspectives on experiential marketing and examines their implications for the redesign of physical retail spaces. Experience-based strategies have become essential for retailers seeking differentiation and a sustained competitive advantage in an increasingly digital marketplace.",

          "abstract": "Can large-scale geopolitical shocks causally reshape how individuals perceive their intergenerational mobility? We address this question by examining the immediate impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on mobility perceptions using a quasi-experimental design. Leveraging World Values Survey data collected in Czechia and Uruguay during the invasion, we implement a regression discontinuity design that compares respondents interviewed immediately before and after February 24, 2022. This unexpected event during survey design approach addresses key limitations of correlational studies by exploiting quasi-random variation in exposure to the shock. Across multiple specifications -- including bandwidth sensitivity analyses, logit models, demographic controls, and robust bias-corrected estimates -- we find consistent null effects. The invasion produced no discernible immediate impact on either upward or downward mobility perceptions in either country, despite Czechia's geographic proximity and historical ties to the region. These findings complement prior correlational evidence showing associations between war concerns and mobility beliefs one year after the invasion, suggesting that such effects may unfold gradually rather than instantaneously, or that correlational patterns reflect selection into worry rather than immediate causal impacts. Our study demonstrates the value of combining multiple methods and measures when studying how geopolitical crises shape social perceptions.",

          "authors": "Carlo Luiu",
          "abstract": "As populations in both developed and developing countries continue to age, ensuring access to transportation that meets the mobility needs of older adults is becoming increasingly important. This issue is particularly pressing for individuals who are unable to drive or access private vehicles. Flexible Transport Services (FTS) offer a promising alternative to private transport for older people, thanks to features such as door-to-door accessibility and operational flexibility. This paper investigates travel satisfaction, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward FTS among older adults residing in the urban context of Birmingham, United Kingdom. A mixed-methods approach is employed, beginning with an analysis of travel frequency and purpose associated with FTS use, followed by a thematic analysis aimed at capturing older people's experiences, perceptions, and overall attitudes toward this mode of transport. The analysis reveals six key themes: lack of need, service provision issues, stigma, lack of awareness, convenience, and social implications. These themes highlight both the benefits of FTS and the factors that hinder its use. A central finding is the marked difference in perception between frequent users and non-users. FTS is often viewed negatively by non-users, with three of the four identified barriers predominantly arising from this group. In contrast, frequent users express satisfaction with the service, particularly emphasising its role in meeting discretionary travel needs. This is especially true for individuals over the age of 80 and those with limited access to a car.",

          "abstract": "Short-form video platforms, such as TikTok, have rapidly transformed digital media consumption, with billions of active users worldwide. Their design features, such as algorithmic personalization, endless scrolling, and rapid novelty, have raised concerns about mobile overuse and its associated adverse effects on well-being. However, evidence on whether short-form videos increase mobile usage remains limited. To address this gap, we estimate the causal effect of short-form video platforms on mobile usage behavior using individual-level data (N=1,764) drawn from a representative panel of U.S. mobile device users. Specifically, we compare TikTok adopters to adopters of Instagram/Facebook during the period (1/5/2019--5/8/2020) when short-form video was the key distinguishing feature of TikTok (i.e., before these competitors introduced their own short-form video products), thereby shedding light on the effect of exposure to short-form videos. We find that using short-form video platforms significantly increases total mobile usage duration by up to 17% (about 28 minutes per day for the average user) and reduces average time away from the mobile phone by -20% (29 fewer minutes per day for the average user), but does not consistently affect the number of daily sessions. Effects are disproportionately higher among individuals who previously used their phones less, relative to those with higher baseline usage. Contrary to fears about nocturnal overuse, effects are only significant during daytime hours. Surprisingly, older individuals have significantly larger increases in mobile sessions per day from usage of short-form video platforms compared to younger individuals. Altogether, our results show a behavioral mechanism through which short-form video platforms contribute to mobile usage, offering new insights into theories of digital addiction and highlighting the importance of promoting healthier digital engagement.",

          "abstract": "Residential water demand is strongly shaped by showering behaviour, yet quantifying drivers at the event level remains rare. We first explored and identified key patterns across 8,550 sensor-logged showering events from 319 German households. We then combined this high-resolution smart-meter data with time-stamped post-shower surveys to analyse shampoo-shower duration. The Gamma mixed model (14 predictors spanning demographics, context, in-shower behaviour and hair characteristics) explained 68.4% of deviance (AIC = 4281.6). Behavioural predictors showed the clearest associations: showers with two or more shampoo applications were 27% longer than those with one, while showers with three or more water pauses were 28% longer than those with one. Some contextual and demographic predictors also mattered: soft water areas were linked to 23% longer durations, and younger/mid-age adults had durations up to 31% longer than adults 50+. Other factors (gender, employment, household composition/size, home type, bills responsibility and most hair characteristics) showed small or uncertain effects after adjustment. Findings demonstrate how smart metering, event-level behavioural data and robust modelling can reveal actionable levers for demand-side management, behavioural interventions and product design.",

          "abstract": "The scholarly literature on development projects primarily focuses on implementation and outcomes, yet little is known about how projects are designed and funded. This study addresses this gap by investigating how local communities initiate development projects. We propose that communities learn from their geographic neighbors and past experiences, with local administrative capacity moderating this learning process. Using data from Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan, we find robust evidence of positive spatial and temporal effects and a significant interaction between temporal effects and administrative capacity. Additional evidence from project descriptions and interviews with beneficiaries elucidates the mechanisms driving these effects.",

Demografischer Wandel, Fachkräftemangel, technologische Innovationen und eine zunehmende Ambulantisierung verändern die Anforderungen an Gesundheitsfachkräfte ebenso wie an deren Aus- und Weiterbildung. Der Beitrag skizziert zentrale Herausforderungen der Gesundheitsfachberufe und leitet daraus fachdidaktische Konsequenzen für die Lehrendenbildung ab. Im Mittelpunkt stehen die Digitalisierung und der Einsatz von E-Learning, Interdisziplinarität, Kompetenzorientierung, die Heterogenität der Lernenden, der Theorie-Praxis-Transfer, Fragen von Ethik und Professionalität, lebenslanges Lernen sowie Motivation und Lernmanagement. Auf dieser Grundlage werden Konsequenzen für die Gestaltung von Curricula, für Fort- und Weiterbildung, für eine forschungsbasierte Lehre sowie für praxisorientierte Lehr-Lern-Arrangements diskutiert. Etablierte Ansätze wie Blended Learning, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) und Mentoring werden aufgegriffen und um Möglichkeiten des Einsatzes von Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI), virtueller und augmentierter Realität erweitert. Abschließend wird deutlich, dass eine zukunftsfähige Lehrendenbildung in den Gesundheitsfachberufen eine flexible und integrative Herangehensweise erfordert, in der bewährte didaktische Konzepte mit innovativen Technologien und einer systematischen Evaluation verknüpft werden.",

          "authors": "Hanne Vandenbroucke; Annelien Smets",
          "abstract": "News recommender systems (NRSs) are increasingly implemented in news industry to enhance digital distribution, yet their development and evaluation are shaped by a complex interplay of organizational stakeholders with diverse objectives. This study investigates the real-world complexities of NRS implementation, considering the multitude of objectives on the NRS provider side by exploring how different stakeholder groups —from journalistic, commercial and tech logic— conceptualize NRS goals and assess their performance. Through 22 semi-structured expert interviews across four news organizations in Europe, we uncover a `jungle of metrics' where an overabundance of data insights does not necessarily lead to better decision-making. While traditional accuracy-based metrics like click-through rate (CTR) remain widely used, they fail to capture the broader strategic objectives that guide NRS adoption in industry. This paper identifies a critical gap between current academic evaluations of NRS and the business key performance indicators (KPIs) used in practice. Rather than evaluating NRS in isolation, stakeholders assess their contribution to overarching organizational goals, including reach, engagement, conversion, and retention. Our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced, multi-stakeholder approach to NRS evaluation that aligns with both business imperatives and journalistic values.",

Yet these transitions raise significant equity and justice challenges, as policies risk reproducing and exacerbating existing inequalities. Despite shared concerns over affordability, accessibility, and exposure to harm, scholarship on energy and mobility justice remains fragmented and sector-specific. This review presents a systematic, cross-sectoral analysis of justice-oriented scholarship across both domains, analyzing 481 peer-reviewed articles published between 2003–2022. Bibliometric and thematic analyses reveal three dominant patterns: (i) conceptual narrowness, with distributive, procedural, and recognition-based dimensions prevailing; (ii) asymmetry in the geography of knowledge production, driven by a small number of central knowledge brokers predominantly affiliated in the Global North; and (iii) institutional and technocratic framings that marginalize power-laden externalities and conflicts. As a synthesis, we introduce the Spatio-temporal, Holistic, and Inclusive Framework for Transition (SHIFT) to advance pluralistic, intersectional, and context-sensitive low-carbon justice agendas.",

I study a population in rural Bangladesh (N=1600) along the banks of the Jamuna River, at risk of being affected by riverbank erosion and floods. I compare their replies to questions on hypothetical movement behavior if hypothetically affected by natural disaster (pre-monsoon, May-June 2021) to  migration intentions and actual migration 2-6 months later after quasi-experimental actual exposure (post-monsoon, August/September 2022/January 2023). Results show that hypothetical as well as actual affectedness and risk shape migration intent and behavior similarly. However, the vignette experiment is approximating actual migration intent more closely than migration, indicating that survey experimental approaches likely overestimate actual behavior, while capturing behavioral intent well. Given the evidence base for the external validity of survey experiments is slim, this study contributes a crucial comparison from a rarely studied developing-country context on the extent to which survey-experimental scenarios generalize to real-world exposure.",
