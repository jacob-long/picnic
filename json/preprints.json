          "title": "Beliefs about the Causal Interdependence of Virtues and Vices",
          "authors": "Benjamin Hardin; Sydney E. Scott; Jessie Sun",
          "abstract": "How do people think different moral virtues and vices affect one another? For example, do they think that improving one virtue (e.g., honesty) will facilitate improvements in another virtue (e.g., compassion)? Do people believe in “master virtues” that, when improved, have disproportionate positive impacts on other moral virtues? Here, we holistically examine perceived causal interdependence among 15 moral virtues and 13 moral vices. Across four studies, participants indicated their beliefs about how increasing their virtues would impact their other virtues (Study 1; 275 Prolific participants), how increasing their vices would impact their other vices (Study 2; 423 undergraduate students), and how increases in virtues would affect vices (or vice versa; Studies 3–4; 337 undergraduate students and 298 Prolific participants). We find people generally believe in facilitation effects, where improving one trait improves other traits and worsening one trait worsens other traits. Specifically, people believe that increasing one virtue tends to increase other virtues (Study 1) and decrease other vices (Studies 3–4). Similarly, people believe that increasing one vice tends to increase other vices (Study 2) and decrease other virtues (Studies 3–4). Perceived tradeoffs were rare and involved laziness and cowardice decreasing or being decreased by other vices. There was little evidence for beliefs in a “master virtue.” However, we find some evidence that people think cruelty and greed are disproportionately impactful “master vices.” These results add to our understanding of lay moral concepts by holistically documenting people’s beliefs about the causal interdependence among moral virtues and vices.",

          "authors": "Luis Eduardo Muñoz; Audun Rosslund; Natalia Kartushina; Julien Mayor",
          "abstract": "Non-nutritive sucking (NNS), including pacifier use and thumb sucking, is common in infants and has been associated with both positive and negative developmental outcomes. While NNS is known to reduce distress, sustained use has been linked to lower vocabulary scores (Muñoz et al., 2024). The present longitudinal study investigates the relationship between NNS and word comprehension in 69 Norwegian infants. Parents reported their infant’s NNS use concurrently (C-NNS) at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months old, which was used to derive measures of lifespan use (L-NNS) and relative changes in NNS. Word comprehension was measured using eye-tracking, and vocabulary size was assessed through parental reports (CDIs). Neither L-NNS nor changes over time were significantly associated with language measures. However, greater concurrent NNS (C-NNS) correlated with reduced word comprehension in older infants. These findings extend Muñoz et al. (2024) and provide additional evidence on the role of NNS in language acquisition.",

          "abstract": "A comprehensive cognitive science requires broad sampling of human behavior to justify general inferences about the mind. For example, the field of psycholinguistics relies on a rich history of comparative study, with many available resources that systematically document many languages. Surprisingly, despite a longstanding interest in questions of universality and diversity, the psychology of music has few such resources. Here, we report the Expanded Natural History of Song Discography, an open-access corpus of vocal music (n = 1007 song excerpts), with accompanying metadata detailing each song’s region of origin, language (of 413 languages represented here), and one of 10 behavioral contexts (e.g., work, storytelling, mourning, lullaby, dance). The corpus is designed to sample both broadly, with a large cross-section of societies and languages; and deeply, with many songs representing three well-studied language families (Atlantic-Congo, Austronesian, and Indo-European). This design facilitates direct comparison of musical and vocal features across cultures, principled approaches to sampling stimuli for experiments, and evaluation of models of the cultural \nevolution of song. In this paper we describe the corpus and provide two proofs of concept, demonstrating its utility. We show that (1) the acoustical forms of songs are predictive of their behavioral contexts, including in previously unstudied contexts (e.g., children’s play songs); and (2) similarities in acoustic content of songs across cultures are predictable, in part, by the relatedness of those cultures.",

          "title": "Who Cares? Religiosity’s Role in Compassionate Responses to Human Suffering",
          "authors": "Patty Van Cappellen",
          "abstract": "Compassion – defined as care and concern for others' suffering – is a core value in all world religions. Yet, extending compassion is often challenging, requiring individuals to overcome significant personal and situational barriers. Could religious practices help navigate these barriers, fostering greater compassion? Across five studies (total N = 2,210) sampling from diverse faiths (Christians, Muslims, Buddhists), we investigate whether, when, and why engaging in religious practices promotes compassionate responses. These responses were measured as the selection of compassion-inducing situations and the upregulation of state compassion when witnessing suffering in various contexts (e.g., daily life, difficult events, victims of war). Religious practices, both public (worship attendance) and private (prayer), were consistently associated with greater compassionate responses (small to moderate association), even in the face of situational challenges, whether measured (e.g. target neediness, Study 1) or manipulated (i.e., compassion collapse for many victims, Study 2). Using experience sampling, we find that within-person fluctuations in religious practice are associated with momentary increases in compassion (Study 3). We further demonstrate that participating in religious practices increased compassionate choices, as shown in a natural experiment during Easter (Study 4). Finally, we identify two mechanisms – valuing compassion and feeling closer to those who suffer (Study 5) – that explain these associations. By bridging religion, emotion, and prosociality literatures, this work highlights how engaging in religious practices motivates compassionate responses to suffering, advancing theory on motivated compassion and its situational regulation.",

          "authors": "Kayley Birch-Hurst; Michael Maddocks; Phoebe Asquith; Kait Clark",
          "abstract": "Athletes exhibit exceptional fitness levels and cognitive abilities in practice and competition. A large body of work has demonstrated that expert athletes perform better than novices and non-athletes on sport-specific tasks, but the transfer of sports training to more general laboratory-based measures of perception and cognition is less clear. A number of studies have explored the relationship between sports expertise and perceptual-cognitive abilities, but some findings are contradictory, and there is a lack of clarity of effects associated with various facets of attention. This study aimed to assess whether university-level athletes demonstrate superior performance across a broad range of visual-attentional skills compared to non-athletes, while controlling for potential motivational differences between the groups. We administered a comprehensive battery of computer-based visual tasks to university hockey players and non-athlete student controls. Our tasks assessed selective attention (Eriksen Flanker Task), sustained dynamic attention (Multiple-Object Tracking), spatial distribution of attention (Useful Field of View), and basic perception (Line Comparison). We found that, compared to controls, the hockey players demonstrated enhanced performance in measures of selective attention and in identifying transient stimuli at central fixation, even after controlling for potential group differences in motivation and strategy. Our results provide novel insight into sport-specific and sport-general cognitive enhancements associated with competitive sport training and have implications for generalised enhancements in cognitive performance.",

          "authors": "Hongru Song; Jason Chan; Christian Ryan",
          "abstract": "Self-compassion is an emotion regulation strategy which may be influenced by culture. This study aimed to examine the levels of the two factors of the Self-Compassion Scale (self-compassion and self-coldness) and their associations with cultural values at the individual level in Western and East-Asian cultural contexts, and the possible moderating role of alexithymia. Data were collected from 397 adults from the general population living in Ireland and China. Chinese participants reported more self-compassion and less self-coldness than Irish participants. In the Irish sample, greater horizontal individualism was associated with higher levels of self-compassion; moreover, vertical collectivism was associated with higher levels of self-coldness, whereas the relationships were more complicated in the Chinese sample since both individualistic and collectivistic cultural values were found to be positively correlated with self-compassion and self-coldness. Furthermore, in both samples, marginal interaction effects were found between alexithymia and specific cultural values when predicting self-compassion and self-coldness. Overall, this study highlights the dynamic nature of culture and indicates the understanding of two-factor construct of the Self-Compassion Scale may be culture-specific. Moreover, this is the first study to explore how alexithymia interacts with cultural values at the individual level to influence self-compassion and self-coldness, contributing preliminary evidence to the field of cross-cultural alexithymia.",

Here, we developed a digital parenting scale across three separate samples (N = 1,050). The digital parenting scale (DPS) was shown to be a reliable and valid measure of six distinct types of digital parenting strategies, aligning with six analytic factors: regulation (i.e., using rules and restriction to regulate adolescent use of technology), boundary negotiation (i.e., balancing adolescent and parent needs and goals with respect to adolescent technology use), co-use (i.e., parents and adolescents using digital devices together), mediation (i.e., teaching and offering guidance related to safe use of technology), monitoring by proxy (i.e., using friends and family to monitor adolescent technology use), and technological monitoring (i.e., using technology to assist parents in monitoring adolescent technology use). We found broad associations between each of the six factors of the digital parenting scale and well-established measures of general parenting practices, suggesting that digital parenting is an extension of one’s general parenting strategies.",

          "authors": "Bradley E. Cox; Kayden M Stockwell; Cassandra R. Kepple; Courtney B. Francis",
          "abstract": "How prevalent is autism in higher education? Research to date has not specifically addressed this seemingly straightforward question. Yet, an answer may be critical to the advancement of research, policy, and practice related to autistic students in higher education. This paper addresses three related but distinct questions about autistic students’ college enrollment within the United States: 1) What percentage of autistic high school students go on to college? 2) What percentage of students registered with their postsecondary institutions’ Disability Services Offices are autistic? 3) What percentage of enrolled undergraduates are autistic? To answer these questions, we examined more than 700 publications, reviewed more than a dozen common survey instruments used at postsecondary institutions, and pulled data from several federal datasets. We assessed each of these sources and synthesized their findings to generate a range of estimates regarding the prevalence of autism in higher education. Considering only those studies for which we held moderate or high confidence regarding the quality and generalizability of their data, the best available evidence suggests 42.9% – 47.0% of high school students with autism continue on to college and 2.8% – 4.0% of college students registered with their schools’ Disability Service Offices are autistic. Ultimately, our calculations suggest there are likely between 84,896 and 213,598 autistic undergraduates currently attending college in the United States. These estimates can be used by researchers, policymakers, and educators to highlight the importance of attending to the interests, needs, experiences, and outcomes for autistic students.",

          "abstract": "When children encounter new challenges, parents often ask themselves: should I let my child figure it out, or should I step in and do it for them? How parents resolve this dilemma is linked to various child developmental outcomes, yet we know little about the cognitive computations that underlie parents’ decision to intervene. Here, we model parenting decisions as a Bayesian solution to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and qualitatively compare predictions with behavioral data from real-time parent-child interactions. Empirically, we find that parents are more likely to take over when they believe children are less skilled and when tasks are challenging, and more likely to step back when they believe their child can learn from doing the task on their own. The model captures the fine-grained ways in which these factors shape parent decision-making and, alongside the empirical data, uncovers the cognitive computations that drive parental intervention.",

          "abstract": "People in high-income countries underestimate their affluence relative to the global population, potentially limiting their will- ingness to donate to charity. We test whether a rank-based nudge (RBN) informing individuals how their post-tax income ranks globally increases charitable donations. Further, because people have been shown to shift their reference point for who should give to charity based on their current income, we inves- tigate whether donations can be boosted by asking how much people with different income ranks should give to charity (in- junctive distribution task, IDT) before administering the RBN. Participants (N = 1,217) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: control, RBN, IDT, or IDT+RBN. Those in the RBN conditions donated significantly more and reduced over- estimation of others’ income across all percentiles of the global income distribution. However, the addition of the IDT did not further increase donations. These findings suggest that RBNs effectively boost generosity by correcting misperceptions of relative affluence.",

          "abstract": "Cedric Boeckx’s monograph 'Reflections on language evolution: From minimalism to pluralism' is an entertaining and useful introduction to recent advances in biological approaches to the evolutionary origin of our language ability. It can be read as a reminder of the need for more tolerance and diversity in our approach to linguistic research. However, its central thesis is more ambitious and controversial than this: it seeks to reformulate the field by suggesting that linguistics should be centred on the problem of how our language ability evolved. It also promotes the belief that this language ability is best studied as a collection of individual skills and it suggests that the method best suited to this problem is the use of paleo-genetic evidence. This review highlights this interpretation of the monograph and offers a critique of this perspective by suggesting that the structure and cognitive properties of language should remain our focus.

          "abstract": "Background: Preliminary evidence suggests psilocybin may have therapeutic value for various mental health conditions; despite this, it is currently illegal in the UK. Less is known about how people form their attitudes towards psilocybin policies. \n\nObjectives: To explore whether beliefs about the benefits and safety of psilocybin influence support for psilocybin policies.\n\nMethods: In an online survey experiment, 804 participants were randomised to receive one of four interventions in a 2 (no information vs evidence for psilocybin benefits) x 2 (no information vs evidence for psilocybin safety) design. Public support for four psilocybin policies and beliefs about the benefits and safety of psilocybin were measured before and after participants were randomised to a group.\n\nResults:  In a two-way ANCOVA, the Benefits Intervention significantly increased policy support overall and for two of four psilocybin policies when analysed separately. Furthermore, the Benefits Intervention significantly strengthened beliefs that psilocybin is beneficial and safe. The Safety Intervention increased psilocybin policy support overall (d = .10, p = .003); and for three of four psilocybin policies when analysed separately. The Safety Intervention also strengthened beliefs that psilocybin is safe but not that it is beneficial.\n\nConclusions: Communicating the benefits and safety of psilocybin can increase psilocybin policy support and strengthen beliefs about psilocybin, however further research is needed to explore the longevity of these results.",

          "authors": "Emma Katharine Bridger; John Maltby; Eiko I Fried; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "It is widely established that social determinants influence multiple adverse life outcomes such as becoming depressed, living in poverty, and mortality. Although causal beliefs are core to understanding public views on these issues, studies of beliefs about social causes have occurred in parallel literatures with diverging outcomes of interest and methodological approaches. We ask which social determinants are perceived to be causally important, how these are weighted relative to non-social causes and whether this differs for different outcomes. In a pre-registered study, 1,000 UK general-public respondents rated the causal influence of 43 individual-level social vs. non-social risk factors for becoming depressed, living in poverty, and reduced life expectancy. We use a much wider range of adverse social risk factors and outcomes than in any previous examination of causal beliefs. To understand whether causal attributions relate to individual characteristics, we collected information on political orientation, subjective socioeconomic status, sense of control and material deprivation. We find that UK respondents perceive a causal role for social determinants that is comparable to that of non-social factors. Overall, respondents saw a stronger causal role of social risk factors for living in poverty and becoming depressed than for mortality. Aligning towards the political left and having a lower sense of control (higher perceived constraints) were independently associated with higher causal ratings of social determinants. Avenues for future research are discussed as well as the correspondence between causal beliefs and academic models of social determinants.",

          "abstract": "Bilateral cochlear implantation is the typical intervention for children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss intended to support development of skills across language, cognitive, social, behavioural and academic domains. However, speech-perception outcomes post-implantation remain variable. This scoping review explores which contextual factors relate to speech perception and hearing outcomes following paediatric bilateral cochlear implantation based on themes aligned with Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory: 1) individual; 2) microsystem; 3) exosystem; 4) macrosystem; and 5) chronosystem. Twenty-three research articles met the criteria for inclusion, and the contextual factors identified ranged from the proximal context, such as individual cognitive and social development, cochlear implant usage and the home environment, to the distal context, such as socio-economic health determinants. Contextual factors were explored with a narrative synthesis approach, with methodological limitations discussed. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) criteria. Our results indicate that research on outcomes related to bilateral cochlear implantation should actively integrate and examine contextual factors in prospective, longitudinal designs. This approach will facilitate the development of interventions to target specific levels of the bioecological system, thereby improving outcomes for the paediatric bilateral cochlear implant recipient.",

          "authors": "Irene Balboni; Olga Kepinska; Raphael Berthele; Narly Golestani",
          "abstract": "Research on dyslexia and bilingualism has largely been conducted separately (Cline, 2000). This systematic review explores the interaction between bilingualism and dyslexia by summarising and synthesising studies that include bilingual dyslexic readers (DRs). The goal is to identify aspects of dyslexia that are independent of multilingual experience and to determine the most appropriate diagnostic tests for bilingual populations. We include 40 studies, categorised into three groups: studies involving only bilingual dyslexic and typical readers (TRs), studies comparing monolingual and bilingual DRs and TRs, and studies predicting poor reading in bilingual populations. Our findings indicate that rapid naming and reading impairments remain prevalent in bilingual dyslexic populations. Phonological awareness, a common deficit in dyslexia, appears to be less impaired in bilingual readers. Notably, language experience is associated with more differences in DRs than TRs, suggesting that bilingualism may interact with relevant skills more markedly in dyslexic than in typically reading individuals. In predictive studies, the high variability across studies does not allow for evidence-based recommendations for reliable diagnostic measures. Future research should focus on clearly defining the language profiles of participants and should ensure that assessments account for linguistic experience in the language of testing. Additionally, evaluations should adopt a more comprehensive and individualised approach to accurately assess bilingual readers.",

          "abstract": "It is widely established that social determinants influence multiple adverse life outcomes such as becoming depressed, living in poverty, and mortality. Although causal beliefs are core to understanding public views on these issues, studies of beliefs about social causes have occurred in parallel literatures with diverging outcomes of interest and methodological approaches. We ask which social determinants are perceived to be causally important, how these are weighted relative to non-social causes and whether this differs for different outcomes. In a pre-registered study, 1,000 UK general-public respondents rated the causal influence of 43 individual-level social vs. non-social risk factors for becoming depressed, living in poverty, and reduced life expectancy. We use a much wider range of adverse social risk factors and outcomes than in any previous examination of causal beliefs. To understand whether causal attributions relate to individual characteristics, we collected information on political orientation, subjective socioeconomic status, sense of control and material deprivation. We find that UK respondents perceive a causal role for social determinants that is comparable to that of non-social factors. Overall, respondents saw a stronger causal role of social risk factors for living in poverty and becoming depressed than for mortality. Aligning towards the political left and having a lower sense of control (higher perceived constraints) were independently associated with higher causal ratings of social determinants. Avenues for future research are discussed as well as the correspondence between causal beliefs and academic models of social determinants.",

          "authors": "Sam Verschooren; Luc Vermeylen; Sam Boeve; Gilles Pourtois",
          "abstract": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, i.e., external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. One potential explanation for this cost asymmetry is in terms of internal shielding, i.e., the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. However, it is currently unclear how this cost asymmetry is instantiated in the brain and how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased CNV component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared to repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with internal shielding. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

Using a controlled environment where teenagers interact with their classmates, I examine the evolution of cooperation over repeated interactions and explore its determinants. I find that girls and altruistic pupils demonstrate higher levels of cooperation. The introduction of non-monetary rewards and punishments, serving as forms of social pressure, significantly enhances cooperation among adolescents, aligning their behavior with group's cooperation. Surprisingly, the study finds that the intensity of social pressure does not directly impact cooperation, suggesting that adolescents adapt their pro-social behavior in response to social pressure awareness. This study demonstrates that peer-enforced norms sustain cooperation among adolescents, even in the absence of material incentives.",

          "authors": "Helmut Appel; Alexander L. Gerlach",
          "abstract": "Background: Many decisions involve uncertainty. Consequently, intolerance of uncertainty (IU)—a dispositional aversion to uncertainty—may interfere with decision making and cause indecisiveness—a chronic inability to make decisions. Problematic decision-related safety behaviors may play a role in this. However, previous studies have not conclusively established this link. Therefore, this research tests whether IU is associated with safety behavior, operationalized with a novel measure, and whether indecisiveness mediates this relationship.\nMethods: Across four studies (total N = 944), participants reported their IU and imagined a decision scenario. They rated the extent to which their response to this decision aligned with features of safety behaviors. Study 1 examined the validity of these safety behavior ratings by comparing ratings of a maladaptive “safety behavior-like” response to a decision vs an adaptive response. In Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, indecisiveness was also assessed. Additionally, decision importance was experimentally varied to evaluate whether more important decisions would amplify the IU-safety behavior association.\nResults: Study 1 confirmed the validity of the safety behavior measurement, showing that a maladaptive behavior was rated higher than an adaptive behavior. Most importantly, across all studies, higher IU predicted more safety behavior in response to decisions, irrespective of decision importance. Studies 2a-3 additionally showed that this relationship was partially mediated by indecisiveness. \nConclusions: Our findings add an important insight to the literature, using an unequivocal safety behavior measure to demonstrate its association with IU across decision-making contexts. The results are consistent with IU as a transdiagnostic mental health risk factor, with significant implications for understanding and intervening in maladaptive decision-making processes.",

          "authors": "Nilsu Atilgan; Nazbanou Nozari",
          "abstract": "Possible spoken and written sequences of a language are determined by phonotactic and orthotactic rules, respectively. Adult speakers quickly learn simple new phonotactic rules (e.g., “/k/ is always an onset in a syllable), but they only learn the more complex second-order rules (e.g., “/k/ is an onset only if the vowel is /æ/, but a coda if the vowel is /ɪ/”) after the first day of training. However, the learning timeline for more complex rules is less consistent across populations and languages. In the current paper, we first show that, in Experiment 1, adults quickly learn new first-order constraints in typing, similar to those in speaking. Next, in Experiment 2, we show that, despite a much higher error rate and opportunities for error-based learning, learning the second-order rules in typing only occurs in the second day, replicating the results of most studies in spoken production. We further discuss that the second-order constraint was learned for the coda, but not the onset, suggesting that learning new rules of sequencing is carried out by a chaining-type mechanism.  Lastly, in Experiment 3, we demonstrate that learning new orthotactic constraints in typing is not mediated by phonology, instead, the learning effect is truly orthotactic in nature. Collectively, these data support strong parallels between the statistical learning of orthotactic and phonotactic constraints in language production, despite the differences between spoken and typed modalities of production.",

Findings reveal varied levels of internalized stigma, with some participants feeling ashamed or uncomfortable, while others perceived menstruation neutrally. Anticipated stigma, stemming from societal views linking menstruation to femininity, led to fears of misgendering and medical discrimination. Enacted stigma included negative reactions and limited access to menstrual products and suitable restroom infrastructure. Some participants resisted stigma by reframing menstruation positively or neutrally. To promote inclusivity, participants recommended gender-neutral language, menstrual products and disposal bins in all restrooms, and increased representation in period advertising. This study underscores the need for an intersectional approach to address menstrual stigma, acknowledging the diverse experiences of trans communities.",

          "abstract": "The visual system takes advantage of redundancy in the world by extracting summary statistics, a phenomenon known as ensemble perception. Ensemble representations are formed for low-level features like orientation and size and high-level features such as facial identity and expression. While recent research has shown that the visual system forms intact ensemble representations even when faces are partially occluded via solid bars, how ensemble perception is impacted with the addition of naturalistic objects such as face masks or sunglasses is largely unknown. To investigate this, we conducted a series of experiments using continuous report tasks in which faces (either varying in identity or expression) were partially occluded with a surgical mask or sunglasses and participants had to report the average face using a face wheel. We found evidence that participants could still accurately extract the average even when a significant portion of it was occluded with either face masks or sunglasses. In a second experiment, however, we found performance was worse when the face wheel was variable trial to trial. Thus, part of the preservation of performance in occlusion arises from the visual system learning the features of the particular face wheel being used. Overall, our results suggest that the visual system is able to establish robust ensemble representations for faces with naturalistic occlusions, but that robustness appears to be supported at least partially by learning information about the particular features that are informative for a given set of faces.",

          "abstract": "Our visual landscape consists of not only people, places, and objects (e.g., “soldier”, “stadium”, “flag”), but also the conceptual relationships that unite them (e.g., “patriotism”). Do individuals’ gaze patterns reflect, in part, their conceptual-level attentional priorities? Here, we show that latent conceptual priorities drive an individual’s idiosyncratic gaze patterns across different real-world environments. Participants (N=61) naturally explored a diverse set of immersive real-world photospheres (N=100) in head-mounted VR while their gaze was continuously monitored using in-headset eye-tracking. We leveraged the embedding spaces of large vision and language models to uncover the latent priorities guiding individuals’ unique patterns of selective attention across environments.  We found that different individuals exhibit stable and idiosyncratic gaze patterns across diverse real-world scenes, akin to an “attentional fingerprint”. These patterns can be accurately modeled in the embedding space of a large language model (LLM), which encodes the abstract relationships between scene content (e.g., “patriotism”, linking “flag” and “jet”) – in contrast with vision models that capture only visual similarity. LLM gaze models specifically leveraged conceptual information to predict participants’ attentional priorities, and these predictions were stable over time (i.e., across test-retest sessions), suggesting that they reflect enduring conceptual priorities of an individual mind. Together, these findings show that the eyes are not simply a “window into the mind”, but a window into an individual mind, and its unique cognitive priority map across diverse visual landscapes.",

The ability of recursion is considered crucial for language and universally available, but there are considerable with- and cross-linguistic differences regarding the rules for recursive embedding, which poses a learnability problem. Previous research has shown that adults can learn the recursivity of linear structures in an artificial language from distributional cues in non-recursively embedded data. However, an important open question is participants’ structural representation of the grammar, which is considered crucial for linguistic recursion. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that representation of the structural head is necessary for the distributional learning of recursive structures. Adult participants were exposed to one of the two artificial languages which had identical linear orders but different heads. At test, participants were asked to rate test strings which examined their knowledge of the head and recursion. As predicted, we found that the learning mechanism is constrained: participants who learned the language with the correct head were more likely to allow recursive embedding. The findings suggest that human learners need structural representations beyond surface-level distributional cues to acquire recursive structures.",

However, manual scoring is time-consuming, requires specialized training, and is subject to interrater variability. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a promising solution to automate and standardize the scoring process.\n\nMethods: This study evaluated the performance and reliability of five LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Llama 3 70b) in scoring the Cookie Theft picture description task. A subset of 25 participants were selected from the DementiaBank corpus. The LLMs were tasked with scoring 22 content units in the participants’ responses using various prompt strategies, including few-shot learning, prompt chaining, and self-consistency. LLM performance was compared to the consensus score of three human raters.\n\nResults: LLMs demonstrated comparable accuracy to human raters in scoring the Cookie Theft task, with no significant differences in mean absolute error (MAE) between the best performing models and human raters. Few-shot learning significantly improved LLM performance, while prompt chaining and self-consistency showed limited benefits. Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o exhibited the highest accuracy and reliability. Notably, LLMs showed significantly higher interrater reliability compared to human raters.\n\nConclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to accurately and reliably score picture description tasks, offering a promising approach to streamline and standardize neuropsychological assessments. By automating the scoring process, clinicians and researchers can benefit from increased efficiency, reduced subjectivity, and improved scalability in evaluating cognitive functions.",

Less is known about how people form their attitudes towards psilocybin policies. \n\nObjectives: To explore whether beliefs about the benefits and safety of psilocybin influence support for psilocybin policies.\n\nMethods: In an online survey experiment, 804 participants were randomised to receive one of four interventions in a 2 (no information vs evidence for psilocybin benefits) x 2 (no information vs evidence for psilocybin safety) design. Public support for four psilocybin policies and beliefs about the benefits and safety of psilocybin were measured before and after participants were randomised to a group.\n\nResults:  In a two-way ANCOVA, the Benefits Intervention significantly increased policy support overall (d = .11, p&lt; .001); and for two of four psilocybin policies when analysed separately. Furthermore, the Benefits Intervention significantly strengthened beliefs that psilocybin is beneficial (d = .44, p&lt; .001) and safe (d = .26,  p&lt; .001). The Safety Intervention increased psilocybin policy support overall (d = .10, p = .003); and for three of four psilocybin policies when analysed separately. The Safety Intervention also strengthened beliefs that psilocybin is safe (d = .28, p &lt; .001) but not that it is beneficial.\n\nConclusions: Communicating the benefits and safety of psilocybin can increase psilocybin policy support and strengthen beliefs about psilocybin, however further research is needed to explore the longevity of these results.",

          "abstract": "Tier 2 interventions are designed for students who are not making sufficient progress despite receiving whole-group instruction. These interventions target a specific population, necessitating clear eligibility criteria for screening participants. While efficacy studies of Tier 2 interventions often generalize their findings to struggling readers, the eligibility criteria for selecting study samples can vary across studies. In our simulation study, we compared effect size estimates from different samples, each screened using commonly used eligibility criteria. Despite each method accurately recovering the true effect on average across 500 iterations, the range of estimates showed substantial variation, with significant under- and overestimation in individual iterations. We concluded that the perceived effectiveness of Tier 2 interventions may fluctuate based on how the sample is screened for eligibility. We propose future research to address this methodological challenge while balancing the practical demands of Tier 2 intervention studies.",

          "abstract": "Voice identification across and between utterances are distinguishable tasks.  To test how accent affects voice identification, we used voice-cloning to isolate and extract speech patterns from English-language recordings of people from the UK, Poland, and China. These speech patterns were applied to a different set of cloned voices. The result is a set of voices that have the same or different identity or accent and speak the same or different phrases. Participant accuracy in distinguishing voices was tested using varied voice pairs. Different accents applied to the same identity and the same accent to different identities increased errors by ~10% in telling whether people were the “same” or “different”.  Using different sentences diminished error rates only when different identities had the same accent.  Collectively, these findings reveal that expectations about accent use affect our ability to identify people as same or different, in addition to familiarity and other language-related cognitive processes. Our research supports the view suggesting that voice identification is a complex task that humans employ several different cognitive strategies to solve, depending on the context.",

          "abstract": "Stereotypes are often viewed as cognitive shortcuts that simplify expectations about how individuals in a group may behave. Consequently, prior work primarily examined stereotype content as a function of group labels, overlooking how stereotypes vary across perceivers, situations, and intersecting categories. To address this gap, we conducted two pre-registered studies with U.S. representative participants (N = 1,721) who freely wrote stories about how other people generally view 9 groups across 6 representative situations and 30 intersectional categories. We analyzed these stories using large language models. We found that although stereotypes are considered products of social learning about groups, they varied considerably across perceivers and situations. Intersectional stereotypes showed evidence for dominance effects of “Asian” and “unattractiveness”, potentially due to their lower representativeness in the U.S. population and uniform stereotypes across situations. These findings highlight the complex variability of stereotype content in naturalistic contexts, opening new doors to reducing intergroup biases.",

          "abstract": "Developmental stuttering, or childhood-onset fluency disorder, has been traditionally characterized by the production of speech disfluencies, such as repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. However, the manner, intensity, and overall effects of stuttering vary widely among individuals. Despite extensive scientific inquiry spanning over a century, the complex and seemingly paradoxical nature of stuttering has thwarted attempts at a unified explanation. Active inference, a predictive processing theory of sentient behavior, provides a potential account for understanding the core behaviors and diverse phenomena of stuttering. Stuttering likely arises from disruptions in perception-action cycling that facilitate the fluent sequential production of syllables. More specifically, aberrantly high sensory precision to speech-related predictions may cause the abrupt inhibition of syllable initiation, resulting in the hallmark stuttering ‘block.’ Moreover, active inference elucidates the perplexing contextual variability of stuttering behavior, such as the effects of adaptation, consistency, and distraction. Importantly, this account holds significant clinical implications for stuttering treatment, offering novel avenues for intervention.",

          "abstract": "Concerns about the negative impact of social media on wellbeing have surged, particularly for adolescents who may have heightened susceptibility to social media’s adverse effects. In response, there is a growing interest in developing social media interventions, which aim to change users’ interactions with social media to improve wellbeing. Despite the potential for interventions to advance causal knowledge of social media’s effects and mitigate potential wellbeing harms, academic research on these interventions remains scarce. In this paper we review the landscape of social media interventions, categorising them by the context in which they intervene: social media platforms, smartphones, users, families, and society. In doing so, we highlight important limitations of current research and intervention designs. To improve how we study and develop social media interventions in future, we introduce a theoretically-grounded framework to assist in choosing intervention targets and designs. Specifically, by evaluating how social media use impacts core psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness as proposed by self-determination theory, and developing interventions to specifically target such processes, we can maximise effectiveness of future interventions particularly for vulnerable populations such as adolescents. With increasing calls for interventions to be developed to improve adolescent mental health and counteract social media risks, this robust foundation will be widely relevant for future research in both academia and industry, with direct practical applications to enhance wellbeing in our increasingly digital age.",

Using a controlled environment where teenagers interact with their classmates, I examine the evolution of cooperation over repeated interactions and explore its determinants. I find that girls and altruistic pupils demonstrate higher levels of cooperation. The introduction of non-monetary rewards and punishments, serving as forms of social pressure, significantly enhances cooperation among adolescents, aligning their behavior with group's cooperation. Surprisingly, the study finds that the intensity of social pressure does not directly impact cooperation, suggesting that adolescents adapt their pro-social behavior in response to social pressure awareness. This study demonstrates that peer-enforced norms sustain cooperation among adolescents, even in the absence of material incentives.",

Across a series of artificial language learning experiments, we demonstrate that learners exhibit a robust preference for placing nominal morphology encoding gender information closest to the stem. This bias, consistent across English, Italian, and Kîîtharaka speakers, holds both for prefixing and suffixing morphology, and across different types of gender and number systems.These results provide a new source of empirical support for theories proposing a gender-first derivation and highlights cognitive constraints influencing morpheme order.",

The gestures students produce in their explanations of a problem communicate their understanding of the problem to teachers, prompting them to provide instruction that leads to student progress. This cycle of teacher-student interaction showcases the beneficial role of gesture in teaching and learning. But how gesture confers this benefit is unclear. Here, we propose a framework for thinking about how attention and memory might mediate the link between gesture and learning. We speculate that bottom-up and top-down processes in attention and memory, as well as the interaction between the two, play a role in fashioning the beneficial effects gesture has on learning. By bridging the gesture and cognition literatures, we hope to motivate research investigating the mechanisms underlying gesture’s impact on learning and to shed light on more effective use of gesture in natural settings, including education.",

          "authors": "Mariana Von Mohr; Manos Tsakiris",
          "abstract": "Where does political ideology come from? Early research in political neuroscience has linked stronger physiological responses to threat and disgust with conservatism, implying a neurobiological basis of ideology, beyond societal factors. However, recent replication failures challenge the idea of a direct connection between physiological reactions and political attitudes. Given the role of interoception in body-awareness and emotional regulation, we investigated whether the relationship between disgust and political ideology is moderated by interoceptive sensibility (i.e., one’s ability to be attuned to their internal bodily states). Using survey data from 632 U.S. participants (321 Democrats, 311 Republicans), we show that when people have higher interoceptive sensibility, their political ideology is not driven by their disgust sensitivity. It is only when interoceptive sensibility is low that disgust sensitivity plays a significant role in political ideology: higher disgust sensitivity increases the likelihood of identifying as Republican, while lower disgust increases the likelihood of being Democrat. We propose that individuals with higher interoceptive sensibility rely more on physiological signals to process emotions like disgust. As a result, their ideological differences are less shaped by internalized cultural beliefs about what is disgusting and instead reflect their actual physiological experience. In contrast, those with lower interoception are more susceptible to socially constructed associations, relying more on ‘social priors’ to interpret their physiological states. This research highlights the importance of interoception in political cognition, offering a novel perspective on the psychophysiological underpinnings of political ideology, paving the way for replicable and causal studies.",

          "abstract": "Studies of cognitive control using tasks with isolated (single-item) vs. multiple (multi-item) item\npresentation have shown that multi-item tasks may be more effective in capturing limitations of\nthe cognitive control system arising from capacity constraints. Importantly, during multi-item\ntasks, performance decreases but does not collapse, consistent with effective management of\ncognitive overload. This has been interpreted by positing a strategic shift from a more parallel to\na more serial processing, whereby the processing of the current item is prioritized over\nupcoming items, termed lockout scheduling. Here, we investigate this proposal by examining\nwithin-task modulations of eye-voice span (EVS) measures and articulation duration in multiitem color naming tasks with and without internal interference (i.e., incongruent and neutral\nStroop conditions). We hypothesized that lockout scheduling would manifest itself across\nmeasures and conditions as the task progresses and cognitive overload emerges. The results\nshowed dynamic changes in both EVS and articulation measures as a function of time-on-task,\nconsistent with the gradual implementation of a lockout scheduling strategy in response to\nemerging cognitive overload. The observed patterns indicate that the shift from a more parallel\nto a more serial processing is not an all-or-none phenomenon but a dynamic interplay between\ngaze, voice, and covert (i.e., parafoveal) attention, affecting online decisions about spatial\ndistance, timing, and processing resource allocation.",

One prominent perspective is that the sensory content of inner speech would correspond to the predicted sensory consequences of inhibited speech acts. Scott (2013) provided experimental evidence suggesting that inner speech indeed involves the mental simulation of speech acts, as evidenced by the attenuation of the effect of an external speech sound. However, Scott (2013) assessed silent speech, but not inner speech, which in contrast to silent speech, does not involve visible articulatory movements.

However, current measures of decision thresholds have only been administered in adult samples and are based on subjective probability estimates. The current study validates a new instrument that was adapted to measure the decision thresholds of children and is based on the objective probability values of a situation by using a signal detection analytical approach. We assessed decision thresholds in a sample of N = 299 children from an extracurricular enrichment program for talented primary school students. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the new measurement instrument has high accuracy. Furthermore, its construct validity was supported by positive associations with children’s performance in the original beads task, a measure of confirmation bias, age, grade level, and math performance. However, no associations were found with a measure of alternation bias, epistemic certainty beliefs, self-concept in data-related tasks, general self-efficacy, or gender. This study introduces a new instrument for measuring the decision threshold in children using objective probability values and gives insights into decision-making processes and their implications for cognitive biases and related constructs.",

The 28 studies that met the inclusion criteria revealed a clear pattern: People raised their goals after success and lowered them after failure. Results of a meta-analysis further showed that the discrepancy between goal and performance predicted the strength of upward goal revision after success and downward goal revision after failure (r = .51). Moreover, a narrative summary of previously tested moderators revealed two mechanisms by which moderators might influence the direction and strength of goal revision, namely by affecting (1) the direct link between goal-performance discrepancy and goal revision or (2) self-efficacy, which emerged as a central mediating variable between goal-performance discrepancy and goal revision. Based on these findings, we developed the Triple-A Model (Assessment, Appraisal, Adjustment) of Goal Revision, which allows deriving directional hypotheses about how much people revise their goals after goal successes and failures.",

In this work we investigate how they interact during sentence processing of an SOV language Bengali. In a series of sentence completion studies, we find that both prediction and priming show consistent and robust effects. Interestingly, the strength of priming induced prediction is modulated by the structural similarity between the prime structure and the structure of the predicted construction in the target -- when this similarity is high, prediction strength increases, conversely, when the similarity is low, prediction strength decreases. We additionally find that priming induced prediction reaches a saturation point when prime structure is very complex (operationalized in terms of number of verbal arguments and thematic structure). These novel findings pose a challenge to the current theories of priming such as `residual activation theory' and the `implicit learning' model. The current work suggests that syntactic priming during comprehension could be modulated by language typology (SVO vs SOV). Broadly, we find that the parser in an SOV language predominantly prefers to posit syntactically simple structures and this tendency is not overridden by priming.",

However, what remains unclear is how people perceive receiving a referral to the arts from a clinician (i.e. an arts prescription), and, more specifically, whether arts prescriptions are likely to be taken up by recipients. Data were taken from the Americans Speak Out About the Arts in 2023 Survey led by Americans for the Arts in the US. A sample of 3,062 adults aged 18+ from the continental U.S. were recruited and interviewed online in English, of whom 2,996 provided complete data for analyses (52.5% female, 70.1% White). Participants were asked “If your doctor wrote you a prescription to participate in the arts as a means of improving your physical or mental health (singing in a choir, taking a ceramics class, dancing, or joining a book club, etc.), how likely are you to follow their recommendation?”. Overall, 76% said they were somewhat or very likely to follow a doctor’s recommendation if they were given a prescription to engage in the arts. Multiple logistic regression models showed that the strongest predictors of positive responses were experience of past health benefits from the arts, belief in future health benefits, high educational attainment, approval of government arts funding, existing engagement in the arts, and being female. Applying behaviour change frameworks, the strongest identified predictors relate to reflective motivations, suggesting that rich programmes aimed at explaining what arts on prescription is, how it works, why patients are receiving referrals, what the evidence base is, and what benefits patients may experience could be fundamental to increasing uptake as pilot schemes of arts on prescription continue to develop in the US.",

Following intake, they completed a 28-day EMA-protocol with six assessments each day. After this self-monitoring period,  a feedback survey was completed in which general and NSSI-specific increases in self-insight and self-efficacy, compliance, beep disturbance, and negative emotional experiences related to EMA were assessed. \nResults: Average EMA compliance was 72.14% (SD=20.47) and decreased linearly over time (β=-0.50, p&lt;.001). After using EMA, 32.98% reported increased general self-insight and 9.27% reported increased general self-efficacy. In contrast, 63.91% reported increased NSSI-specific self-insight and 41.24% reported improved NSSI-specific self-efficacy. Additionally, 21,62% experienced negative emotional experiences due to EMA. Higher levels of negative emotional experiences were significantly associated with lower compliance (r=-.297, p=.004), higher beep disturbance (r=.383, p&lt; .001), and lower general self-insight (r=-.286, p=.005).\nConclusion: EMA appears feasible and may promote NSSI-specific self-insight and self-efficacy for most patients.",

          "abstract": "The Psychological Typhoon Eye (PTE) effect refers to the observation that those living in the epicenters of natural disasters or public emergencies exhibit lower levels of psychological distress than those living further away. The effect was first described in the aftermath of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Li et al., 2009). However, despite its potential relevance for emergency relieve, this phenomenon has received little research attention and requires further replication. Therefore, data was collected following an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 on the Richter scale that occurred in December 2020 in Petrinja, Croatia. The goals of this study were to replicate the PTE effect using the original measures used by Li et al. (2009) and to conceptually replicate the effect using the validated Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995). The sample consisted of 316 participants living in Croatia at the time of the earthquake. We found no evidence for the PTE effect in our study. Instead, we observed a ripple effect, whereby those in the epicenter showed the most psychological distress. We argue that the ripple effect, rather than the PTE effect, should be seen as the default psychological response pattern to natural disasters and emergencies.",

The integrity of this process can be compromised by sophisticated fraud attacks using manipulated face images. Therefore, in this study we examine whether human observers can detect digitally manipulated passport photos, and whether super-recognisers (SRs) outperform typical recogniser controls. Using two face manipulation detection tasks (DFMD1, DFMD2), participants were asked to decide whether a ‘suspected’ passport photo had been digitally manipulated. SRs were found to significantly outperform controls; this effect was not the result of a ‘speed-accuracy trade-off’. Individual differences on tests of face identification aptitude, self-rated ability, and response times, accounted for over 20% of the variance in manipulated image detection sensitivity. Taken together, these findings show that, despite increasing sophistication in digital face manipulation techniques, there is still utility in employing human operators, particularly SRs, to detect them.",

          "abstract": "Background: The field of preventive psychological intervention has made significant strides, but a need persists for comprehensive frameworks with a strategic direction for large-scale implementation. Existing preventive programs face limitations that hinder their ability to reach a larger audience and have a broad impact.\n\nBody: The Fount Prevention Framework aims to bridge this gap by proposing strategies to enable preventive intervention programs to achieve scalability, reach a wider audience, enhance mental health outcomes, reduce the financial burden, and allow faster access for communities. This paper examines the fundamental features of the Fount Prevention Framework, which serves as a protocol designed to guide prevention and mental health promotion programs in achieving a broader impact.\n\nAdditionally, the paper examines a preventive program, Mind Wellbeing, developed based on this framework, as a practical application of how these principles can be implemented. Strategies that render the program independent of experts, trained facilitators, and technology-based delivery modes—including the use of a self-help, group-based mode of program delivery through physical, paperback workbooks—are examined. Other features of the program, such as its transdiagnostic, universal, and comprehensive nature, are explored in light of the need to foster widespread prevention coverage and broader public engagement and participation. Limitations and challenges of the program are also addressed, offering insights into the broader application of the framework and considerations necessary for achieving a goal of this magnitude.\n\nConclusion: Through ongoing empirical research and innovative strategizing to overcome the intrinsic challenges faced by programs of this nature, the measures proposed by this framework may present a compelling avenue for influencing global mental health and a potential pathway to enhancing mental health outcomes worldwide.",

          "abstract": "The complex associations between child media use and development cannot be fully understood through screen time estimates alone. Parental motivations for media use are one of the factors that may shape the quality of media experiences and ultimately child development and family well-being. However, validated scales to capture parents’ motivations for their own and their children’s media use are lacking. Filling this gap, the current paper describes the development and validation of the Media Motivations for Children (MEMO-C) and Parents (MEMO-P) scales in a sample of 521 parents with young children (2-5 years old). The scales were designed to capture regulatory and relational aspects of child and parent media use. Factor analyses revealed a three-factor structure for each scale (MEMO-C: Regulate, Occupy, and Connect; MEMO-P: Regulate, Relax Alone, and Connect). These factors demonstrated strong psychometric properties including high reliability as well as convergent and incremental validity in predicting child- and parent-related constructs above and beyond screen time estimates and related demographic information. By measuring parental media motivations through a relational lens, these scales enable researchers to more closely examine how family media use is associated with child development and family members’ well-being.",

          "authors": "Massimo Lipari; Morgan Sonderegger",
          "abstract": "Quebec French is reportedly developing rhoticity, with low F3 resulting from a bunched or retroflexed tongue (like English /ɚ/), in some or all of its front mid rounded vowels /ø, œ, œ̃/. The source of this rare, understudied sound change is unclear from previous work: contact with English and contrast enhancement have been suggested, and phonologization of coarticulation is typologically plausible. We examine this issue, investigating the apparent time change in the F3 trajectories of the three vowels using generalized additive mixed models on a corpus of parliamentary speech (106 speakers from across Quebec). We observe rhoticity in /ø/ and /œ̃ /: men begin with low F3 in these vowels, and women show change in progress. Conversely, there is less clear evidence of change in /œ/. We suggest these findings are best explained by rhoticity being a two-phased change, originally due to borrowing and subsequently spreading through contrast enhancement. Rhotacization, we argue, is the combined product of intensive exposure to English (which led to frequent non-integration of bunched/retroflex segments in loanwords) and an exceptionally large vowel inventory. It thus results from the unique interplay of social and phonological factors in Quebec French, which is consistent with such changes being cross-linguistically rare.",

          "abstract": "The rapid growth of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) research and considerable debate around PAT’s promise and limitations as a healthcare intervention demand addressing theoretical gaps in PAT development. Traditional clinical trials evaluate PAT as a simple pharmaceutical treatment, overlooking its inherent complexity as a multi-component intervention. This position piece advocates for applying the UK Medical Research Council’s complex intervention framework to PAT, emphasising: theory of therapeutic change, structured development phases, contextual interactions, and stakeholder inclusion. The limitations of standard explanatory clinical trials, particularly their challenges with real-world validity, are contrasted with pragmatic clinical trial designs. Pragmatic randomised controlled trials (RCTs), informed by the PRECIS-2 tool, provide a pathway to align PAT clinical trial designs with real-world applications. This approach enables the exploration of how PAT interacts with existing healthcare systems potentially optimising its therapeutic utility in the intended patient population.  Furthermore, we discuss the philosophical divergence between perspectives on PAT’s efficacy, contrasting drug-centric views with psychotherapy-augmented theories and how this should influence PAT trial design. We propose the integration of qualitative data, adaptive designs, and comparative effectiveness research to refine PAT interventions and address the shortcomings of conventional double-blind RCTs. By leveraging academic and community-led research, this work proposes a pluralistic evidentiary model, enabling more inclusive, practical trial designs that might be considered in expanded evidence assessments. This approach holds the promise of advancing psychedelic medicine while avoiding the historical pitfalls that limited its development in prior decades.",

In this paper, we compare the performance by humans and ChatGPT-4o in an association task involving 13 colors and 20 emotions (and 5 intensities of emotion) in two languages, Spanish and Mandarin. We found that ChatGPT-4o associates colors with emotions similarly to humans, also apprehending cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences. Nonetheless, some differences also exist. Overall, ChatGPT-4o associates colors with more positive emotions. Furthermore, whereas there are notable differences in the intensities of emotion associated to colors by speakers of Spanish vs Mandarin, the responses by ChatGPT-4o are more homogeneous.

Results indicate that most autistic people have some experience and/or familiarity with psychotherapy and counseling and that from those experiences they have small to moderate preferences, as evidenced by scores on the Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP), for therapist directivity; encouragement of emotional expression and therapist-guided exploration of the therapeutic relationship; focus on the client’s present and future; and warm support and unconditional positive regard rather than strong challenge and confrontation. Respondents valued their therapists holding systemic and social justice-oriented perspectives and preferred their therapists use identity-first language in reference to autism; and held favorable attitudes towards psychotherapy-adjacent supports like medication and self-help books. Most respondents with therapy experience believed they had experienced at some point a “seemingly or overtly harmful” event in meeting with their therapist. These and other findings are discussed.

          "abstract": "Research suggests that individuals consistently demonstrate favorable attitudes towards members of their ingroups compared to those belonging to other social groups. Such ingroup biases are observed not only in well-established historical groups but also in minimal group settings. The current study investigates the robustness of the said ingroup bias across different contexts through four experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were merely assigned to one of the two minimal groups, and their ingroup bias was assessed. In the next three experiments (Exps 2a- 2c), the relationship between the minimal ingroups and outgroups was manipulated. In Experiment 2a, both groups were described as good and in a mutually harmonious relationship; in Experiment 2b, the two groups were in a conflicted relationship, with the ingroup described as good and the outgroup as bad; and finally, in Experiment 2c, both groups were again in a conflicted relationship with the ingroup being described as bad and the outgroup as good. The degree of ingroup bias was indexed in terms of faster response times, higher accuracy, and greater sensitivity on a perceptual-matching task. Interestingly, while the preliminary analysis showed a significant moderation of bias measures across the four experiments, a more detailed examination using Bayesian regression analysis and Drift-Diffusion Modeling established a strong persistence of ingroup favoritism despite changing group characteristics and relations. The changing relations didn’t affect the robust ingroup bias much as the general trend for favoring one’s own group persisted across all experiments. The minimal yet robust nature of ingroup favoritism is explicated.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence linking media use to worse child outcomes highlights a need to understand mechanisms driving media use. Past research links media use to infant negative affect, and parents report using media to cope. However, trait-level measures can mask within-person effects that reflect mechanisms more directly. In the current study, 401 predominantly White (70.32%), college-educated (88.03%) parents (75.56% mothers) of an infant 12-24 months old (M=16.43 months, 51.37% boys) completed daily diaries reporting the frequency of parent and child activities, behaviors, and affective states each day for 21 consecutive days. Temporal network modeling was used to examine associations among parents’ daily reports of infant affect, media motivations, and parenting behavior. On days when infants were fussier, parents reported more frequent yelling and more frequent media use to occupy children, regulate children, and regulate parents’ own emotions the same day, and more media to occupy children the next day. The reverse was not true: Media use did not predict negative affect the next day. Using media to relax alone and to regulate children predicted more parent comforting the next day, while using media to connect with children predicted more infant positive affect the next day. Again, the reverse was not true. Thus, temporal effects suggest media use may be an adaptive strategy, at least in the short term. Critically, short-term (i.e., same-day and next-day) within-person effects were not found at the between-person level, underscoring the importance of examining fluctuations within individuals to identify mechanisms and potential intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "Background: Icon arrays, which visually depict frequencies, are commonly recommended for communicating risk information like survival rates. However, they have been found to be ineffective at buffering against motivated reasoning that can lead to undue optimism. To determine whether the impersonal frequency format of icon arrays (reporting a number affected out of a reference class) makes them vulnerable to motivated reasoning, a novel intervention is tested as a means for reducing undue optimism. Methods: Female U.S. participants from Amazon’s MTurk (N=399) imagined a scenario in which their infant would be born extremely preterm. They were presented with icon array information about the survival chances (15-in-100 or 45-in-100) of prematurely born infants with intensive care. For the key intervention, some participants were asked a reflection question immediately after seeing the icon array, which prompted them to indicate what the information meant for their own infant’s percent-chance of survival (i.e., they converted a frequency about a reference class to a probability value about the personal outcome of interest). For other participants, the reflection question merely asked about frequency. The main dependent measure came next and assessed gut-level optimism. Results: People’s gut-level beliefs about their infant’s chances of survival were optimistically biased; the intervention did not reduce this. These gut-level beliefs, rather than the objective survival rate information conveyed through icon arrays, were predictive of subsequent treatment choices. Conclusions: The results suggest that the inability of icon arrays to buffer against motivated reasoning is not due to their frequency format. Moreover, the findings highlight the usefulness of measuring gut-level interpretations of likelihood, which can reveal significant insights into the psychological mechanisms driving patient-treatment choices.",

Bayesian hierarchical regressions revealed that variables associated with physical sensations (interoceptive strength, motor action) and communication experience (head or mouth movement, auditory strength) produced strong effects in both groups. On the other hand, variables associated with concrete objects (visual, haptic experience) and with taste/smell (olfactory, gustatory experience) influenced L1 word recognition performance to a larger extent than in L2. In L2, reliance on semantic information during word recognition is reduced, with stronger effects of lexical variables compared to L1.

The language-switching task (LST) typically assesses two indices of language control: asymmetric switch costs, where switching into L1 incurs greater costs than switching into L2, and reversed language dominance, where L1 becomes slower than L2. We ask if these measures are affected by the language context a bilingual is in and whether the relative balance between languages is sustained after mixed language use. Polish-English unbalanced bilinguals performed the LST in L1- and L2-dominant contexts. We found that language context modulated the magnitude of language control indices. In the L1-dominant context, we replicated effects typical for unbalanced bilinguals: asymmetric switch costs and reversed language dominance. However, in the L2-dominant context, the asymmetry of switch costs was reversed, and the reversed dominance effect decreased. Furthermore, to measure if language dominance reversed from their usual dominance and whether the language context modulations were sustained after leaving, participants named pictures in pure language blocks before (pre-LST) and after (post-LST) LST. Initially, unbalanced bilinguals exhibited a typical L1 dominance (i.e., faster L1 than L2 naming) which reversed during LST and remained reversed post-LST. The modulations of bilingual language control suggest that immediate language context flexibly shapes control mechanisms for effective production, with adjustments persisting beyond the L1- or L2-dominant context. Thus, mechanisms of control are highly adaptive to contextual demands rather than being solely determined by the language proficiency or other fixed speaker traits.",

          "abstract": "Long-standing research suggests that social inferences are captured by a few latent dimensions (e.g., warmth and competence). Others argue that social inferences are more complex but lack empirical support. Here, we conducted two pre-registered studies to test the high-dimensional properties of social inferences. To maximize generalizability, we computationally sampled diverse naturalistic videos and recruited U.S. representative participants (N = 1,598). Participants freely described people in videos using their own words. Cross-validation identified 25 latent dimensions which explained only 15% of the variance in the data. Alternatively, a sparse network model representing the unique correlations between inferences better represented the data. The network models informed the dynamics of naturalistic inferences, revealing how different inferences co-occurred and how they unfolded over time from concrete to abstract (Study 1). The network models also indicated cultural differences in how one inference was related to another between samples (Study 2, Asian N = 651, European N = 792). Together, these findings show that the high-dimensional network approach provides an alternative model for understanding the mental representation of social inferences in naturalistic contexts, which provides new insights into the dynamics and diversities of social inferences beyond the static, universal structure found with traditional low-dimensional latent-construct approaches.",

          "authors": "David A. Haslett",
          "abstract": "Large language models segment many words into multiple tokens, and there is mixed evidence as to whether tokenization affects how state-of-the-art models represent meanings. Chinese characters present an opportunity to investigate this issue: They contain semantic radicals, which often convey useful information; characters with the same semantic radical tend to begin with the same one or two bytes (when using UTF-8 encodings); and tokens are common strings of bytes, so characters with the same radical often begin with the same token. This study asked GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Llama 3 whether characters contain the same semantic radical, elicited semantic similarity ratings, and conducted odd-one-out tasks (i.e., which character is not like the others). In all cases, misalignment between tokens and radicals systematically corrupted representations of Chinese characters. In experiments comparing characters represented by single tokens to multi-token characters, the models were less accurate for single-token characters, which suggests that segmenting words into fewer, longer tokens obscures valuable information in word form and will not resolve the problems introduced by tokenization. In experiments with twelve European languages, misalignment between tokens and suffixes systematically corrupted categorization of words by all three models, which suggests that the tendency to treat malformed tokens like linguistic units is pervasive.",

          "abstract": "The current pre-registered study compared subjective, autonomic and neurophysiological correlates of nocebo hyperalgesia across three groups: Direct Experience (N=20), Social Learning (N=20), and Control (N=20). Participants first underwent a Learning-Phase, where an association between treatment cues and painful thermal stimulation was established. Conditioned responses, induced via social or direct experience, were assessed during the Test-Phase, relative to the control comparator. Pain perception, autonomic arousal, and brain activity were measured via VAS, electrodermal activity, facial action units, and electroencephalography. Both direct and social learning produced significant nocebo hyperalgesia, as indicated by increased pain ratings, autonomic arousal, and modulation of event-related potentials. Increased N2 amplitude, associated with nociceptive processing, was comparable across the two conditioned groups, demonstrating expectancy-driven changes in brain activity irrespective of learning type. While social learning elicited stronger nocebo hyperalgesia in subjective ratings, direct experience was associated with heightened autonomic response and greater activation of facial action units associated with pain during the Learning-Phase. Differences in the trajectory of the autonomic response during the Test-Phase was also observed, with phasic responses diminishing for direct experience but persisting social learning. These findings highlight the role of social information in shaping maladaptive pain responses and highlights the need to mitigate nocebo effects in clinical settings where maladaptive health outcomes can be both directly experienced and socially expressed. By demonstrating distinct behavioural and physiological patterns associated with direct and social learning, this research contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying expectancy-driven pain modulation.",

Yet, a majority of participants were unaware of the AI suggestions’ bias and their influence. Further, the influence of the AI writing assistant was stronger than the influence of its suggestions when presented as static text, showing that the influence is partially due to AI writing assistants leading people to incorporate biased viewpoints into their own writing.

It has been varyingly estimated by measuring the temporal boundaries within which stimuli in different sensory modalities are perceived as simultaneous or elicit multisensory integration effects. However, there is ample evidence that these approaches produce distinct psychometric outcomes, as the widths of the windows they yield differ even when estimated with equivalent designs and stimuli. In fact, these two estimates can sometimes even be negatively correlated. What is more, the perception of synchrony has been found to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of multisensory illusions. This indicates that subjective simultaneity and integration phenomena are dissociable, undermining the conclusions of studies that use them interchangeably. Failing to disentangle the temporal windows in which they occur has led to contradictory findings and considerable confusion in fundamental research that has started extending to other domains. In clinical studies, this confusion has affected work ranging from neuropsychological conditions (such as schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment, dyslexia, and autism) to more general health factors (such as obesity and inflammation); in industrial applications, it is seen in studies using virtual reality, human-computer interfaces, and warning systems in vehicles. In this brief review, we discuss the importance of distinguishing these two constructs. We propose that, while the temporal boundaries of integration phenomena are aptly described as the temporal window of integration (TWI), the temporal boundaries of simultaneity judgments should be referred to as the temporal window of synchrony (TWS).",

We test the hypothesis that perceived realism underpins case strength decisions, where realism reflects a good match between the case and retrieved information. To assess how realism affects juror decisions, jury-eligible subjects (N = 83) read mock criminal cases, rating the strength of each case. Participants also reported their ability to recall a similar case (autobiographical recall), their knowledge of similar cases (factual recall), and the perceived realism of the case. Perceived realism was the most influential component of mock-juror decisions. Additional analyses identified two contributions of perceived realism: a common factor combining realism with memory recall; and an independent factor, as might arise from a mismatch between memory and case evidence. These findings support the hypothesis that complex decisions rely on perceived realism in light of memory retrieval.",

This review presents a systems framework for understanding diverse trajectories in bilingual language acquisition. Drawing on systems theories, we examine how multiple levels of influence interact, from individual factors such as maturational processes that lay the foundation, to immediate language experiences with family and educational contexts that provide learning opportunities. These experiences unfold both dynamically over time, and within broader societal contexts that determine language status and community support. The framework reveals how successful bilingual development depends on alignment across system levels: children, equipped with powerful learning abilities, must meet rich and sustained language experiences, as well as supportive social conditions. This approach illuminates systematic patterns in bilingual development, and emphasizes coordinated, multi-level approaches for supporting bilingual development.",

          "authors": "João Tenório",
          "abstract": "This paper aims to analyze the meanings and feelings represented by semiotic elements available in the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho. The theoretical approach adopted is the Semiotic Cultural Psychology (SCP) in which considers human beings as meaning makers in the world through the mediation of signs. In this paper we consider signs from the Peirce perspective as the representation of objects in the real world and divided into symbols, indexes and icons. From SCP we considered how these signs can represent mediation by pleromatization and schematization in order to understand meanings and feelings represented by field-like signs and point-like signs. In the excerpt from this article, we selected the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho to understand how meanings and feelings are regulated through existing complexes of signs during the narrative. To achieve this, we cataloged the main semiotic elements of the episode, classifying them as point-like signs or field-like signs. Subsequently, we analyzed which of these signs were part of a semiotic hybrid complex (pleromatization/field-like signs/hyper-generalization) regulating feelings related to the narrative and which expressed constructed and shared meanings (schematization/point-like signs/generalization). In the results, we found that semiotic elements can be considered as narrative devices to involve the viewer in the story based on the intentionality of the author. In the Yu Yu Hakusho first episode, the intentionality is based in the presentation of the character Yusuke and the creation of feelings related to him. In this sense, in order to present who Yusuke is, point-like signs were identified representing some characteristic about him. In the second part of the episode, there was a predominance of field-like signs in order to create some feelings about Yusuke based on the empathy constructed in the first part of the narrative. Then, as related in the literature, mediations by schematization and pleromatization acted all the time in order to relate cognitive elements (meanings constructed about Yusuke) and effective elements (feelings to be felt for Yusuke).",

          "abstract": "Hunger and satiety are key physiological states that regulate food intake and contribute to the maintence of body weight. Identifying appetite phenotypes, such as reduced satiety sensitivity, holds significant potential for developing personalized prevention and treatment strategies for obesity. However, a key challenge in obesity research is the lack of objective, quantitative tools to measure the physiological states of hunger and satiety.  We developed the Food Attentional Bias (FAB) task, a novel, free-viewing eye-tracking paradigm designed to capture shifts in attentional bias toward food (should we add compared with other stimuli?). In this study, we investigated within-subject changes in attentional bias toward food before and after eating in a cohort of healthy-weight individuals  (n=??) using the FAB Task. Our results indicate a marked decrease in dwell time to food stimuli after eating, regardless of counterbalanced condition, BMI, sex, or age. A linear mixed model for relative dwell time revealed a significant effect of the AOI (area of interest) category on dwell time (F(4, 5538) = 43.520, p &lt; .001). Post hoc comparisons for the AOI * Meal interaction revealed that the dwell times for food AOIs were significantly greater premeal than postmeal (mean difference = 0.070, p &lt; .001). These findings suggest that as the body’s satiety signals increase postmeal, the motivational value of food decreases, leading to a reduction in attentional bias toward food stimuli. This dynamic recalibration of attention may act as an objective physiological marker of satiety, illustrating how internal physiological states influence attention allocation following food consumption.",

Whilst there was an evaluation landscape in education this was dominated by quasi-experimental designs that could not, by their very nature, enable the minimisation of selection bias.  Consequently, even well conducted quasi-experiments have the potential to be misleading as their results may be influenced by selection effects.  However, over the last 20 years there has been a sea change, with large pragmatic randomised controlled trials dominating the evaluation landscape especially in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US).  Key funding agencies for educational evaluations in both countries encourage the adoption and prioritisation of ‘true’ experimental designs.  Furthermore, the methodological quality of recent experiments is high with trial registration, large sample sizes, independent randomisation and blinded pre and post testing featuring in many if not most of the published examples. In this paper we summarise the massive progress in the quality and quantity of educational trial design over the last 20 years.  We also describe innovative trial designs that have and are being used to control for various confounders that can still be present in a trial design despite adequate randomisation.",

          "abstract": "Emerging single-process propositional perspectives in psychology and philosophy have introduced the key idea that, much like their explicit (controlled) counterparts, implicit (automatic) attitudes should reflect logical operations such as negation. In the present project, we subject this idea to a particularly stringent test by probing not only whether implicit attitude formation is sensitive to negation but also whether such sensitivity additionally reflects the distinction between easy-to-negate bipolar adjectives (those with clear antonyms, e.g., “strong”) and difficult-to-negate unipolar adjectives (those without clear antonyms, e.g., “unique”). Across four experiments (three preregistered; total N = 6,707), we found (a) no significant difference in implicit attitude formation in response to affirmed bipolar vs. affirmed unipolar adjectives (β = 0.07); (b) modulation of implicit attitude formation by whether adjectives were affirmed or negated (β = 0.67); and, critically, (c) stronger modulation of implicit attitude formation by the negation of bipolar relative to unipolar adjectives (β = 0.23). These results generalized across three sets of adjectives, two implicit attitude measures (the Implicit Association Test and the Affect Misattribution Procedure), and two novel targets (social and nonsocial). Together, these data provide remarkably strong evidence to suggest that implicit attitude formation reflects logical operations, including not only whether an adjective is affirmed or negated but even whether adjectives are relatively easy or difficult to negate. We discuss theoretical implications for single-process and dual-process accounts of attitude formation and higher-order human cognition, as well as translational implications for theoretically informed attempts at modifying preexisting implicit social attitudes.",

Here we investigated the contribution of explicit and implicit memory to the learning of action-effect relations across four experiments. Participants produced object images by pressing one of two keys, with each action-effect episode experienced three times. Learning was either incidental (Experiments 1-2) or intentional (Experiments 2-4) and occurred under full (Experiments 1-4) or divided (Experiments 3-4) attention. In a test phase, participants were re-presented the effect images and asked to either reproduce or alternate the action that had produced them. Results obtained through cognitive modeling revealed that action-effect relations are primarily represented in explicit memory, with minimal contributions of implicit memory. Intentional learning enhanced memory compared to incidental learning, while divided attention during encoding reduced it, with these factors mainly affecting explicit memory. These findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying skill acquisition and provide insights into the representational nature of action-effect relations.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic amplitude modulation (AM) patterns carry important information, particularly in speech. AM masking, influenced by frequency selectivity in the modulation domain, is considered a crucial factor for speech intelligibility in noisy environments. Based on recent evidence suggesting an age-related decline in AM frequency selectivity, this study investigated whether increased AM masking in older listeners is associated with reduced speech intelligibility. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured using tone-vocoded speech and maskers with no modulation, broadband AM, or narrowband AM at varying modulation frequencies. AM masked thresholds were assessed for a 4-Hz target modulation frequency. The study included young (N=14, 19-25 years) and older (N=14, 57-79 years) listeners with normal hearing. It was hypothesized that SRTs would be higher for the older group with modulated maskers and that the age-related increase in SRT would depend on the masker’s modulation frequency content.  The speech intelligibility results showed that maskers with broadband AM produced higher SRTs than unmodulated maskers. However, SRTs varied little with masker-modulation center frequency across the range tested (2-32 Hz). While older listeners exhibited lower AM frequency selectivity than young listeners, they did not consistently exhibit higher SRTs than their young counterparts across maskers. However, there was a trend for the effect of age to be greater for maskers with broadband AM than for unmodulated maskers. Overall, despite supportive trends, the results do not conclusively demonstrate that older listeners are more susceptible than young listeners to AM masking of speech.",

          "abstract": "Visual cross-modal conflicts occur when visual distractors interfere with auditory task performance. However, the specific effects of semantic and non-semantic visual distractors, particularly their neural dynamics, remain poorly understood. This study investigated the impact of semantic and non-semantic visual cross-modal conflicts on auditory working memory performance and its neural mechanisms, as revealed by an electroencephalogram (EEG). Thirty-nine healthy, right-handed young adults participated, completing the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) under three conditions: no visual distractor, semantic visual distractors (digits), and non-semantic visual distractors (symbols). Both semantic and non-semantic distractors significantly reduced task accuracy compared to the no-distractor condition, with semantic distractors producing stronger interference, as reflected in longer reaction times (RT) and higher omission rates (MR). Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed that both conflicts elicited larger P200 amplitudes, more negative N200 amplitudes, and delayed P300 latencies. The semantic conflict elicited more negative N200 amplitudes at the frontal region, while the non-semantic conflict evoked smaller P300 amplitudes and longer P300 latencies at the central region. Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between changes in behavioral performance and ERP components. Specifically, ∆P300 amplitude negatively correlated with ∆RT and ∆Error rate in the semantic conflict condition. ∆N200 amplitude negatively correlated with ∆Accuracy and ∆RT, and ∆P300 latency positively correlated with ∆MR in the non-semantic conflict condition. These findings demonstrate that visual cross-modal conflicts disrupt auditory working memory task performance, involving both specific and general mechanisms for resolving semantic and non-semantic conflicts.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the psychological, cultural, and social factors that shape attitudes toward mafia-type organized crime (MCOs) and influence collective anti-mafia action is crucial, yet research on this topic remains limited. Existing studies have largely focused on cognitive and affective variables, such as beliefs about social change, romanticization of MCOs, and vicarious shame, while the effects of demographic, personality and contextual factors have been overlooked. Additionally, the interplay between implicit and explicit processes in shaping behavior toward MCOs, and the role of individual differences in determining knowledge about the mafia phenomenon remain unclear.\n\nTo address these gaps, we conducted two online studies with Italian participants. In Study 1 (N = 220), participants recalled names of well-known figures associated with either mafia-type crime or the anti-mafia movement. Their intentions to engage in collective anti-mafia action were measured via self-report. In Study 2 (N = 150), participants completed a face recognition task involving mafia and anti-mafia figures, alongside an innovative mouse-tracking assessment to capture implicit anti-mafia collective action intentions.\n\nOur findings suggest that demographic factors (i.e., news reading frequency, media exposure, education, birth and residence region), personality traits (i.e., extroversion, openness, conscientiousness), social orientations (i.e., attitudes toward MCOs, civic engagement, system justification) and contextual factors (i.e., perceived risk and efficacy) influence implicit and/or explicit anti-mafia intentions. Notably, participants’ age, attitudes toward mafia-type crime, news reading frequency, and occupation predicted the recognition frequency of mafia and/or anti-mafia figures. Finally, recall and recognition were higher for anti-mafia personalities than for mafia members.\n\nThese results contribute to an underexplored research area and have practical implications for designing evidence-based interventions to counter mafia culture and promote civic engagement against organized crime.",

          "abstract": "The experience sampling method (ESM) has become a popular tool across various fields of\npsychology. However, the intensive nature of ESM raises concerns about careless\nresponding, where participants respond to questionnaires without paying sufficient\nattention to them. To better understand careless responding in the context of ESM, this\nstudy investigated its temporal dynamics across three commonly used sample types\n(community, student, clinical). We leveraged four careless responding indicators from\nprevious research — response time, within-beep standard deviation, an inconsistency\nindex, and occasion-person correlation — and used univariate and multivariate multilevel\nmodels to examine their trajectories over time, both over the course of the study and over\nthe course of a day. Our results demonstrate that careless responding is not a stable\nphenomenon but changes over time, with evidence for increases in carelessness across days\nand non-stationarity within days across the different samples. Furthermore, our findings\nimply that the indicators differ in their ability to capture carelessness: while response time,\nwithin-beep standard deviation, and the inconsistency index show potential for capturing\ncarelessness, occasion-person correlation appears unsuited for an ESM context. The\npresence of few and small associations among the indicators indicates that they flag\ndistinct and independent kinds of carelessness and thus complement one another, making it\nadvisable to use multiple indicators where possible. Overall, our findings underscore the\nimportance of considering the temporal dynamics of carelessness in ESM studies and\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the indicators in assessing it.",

          "abstract": "Do ideological differences in moral concern reflect a true reversal of ethical priorities, or do liberals simply extend moral concern more broadly without compromising their commitment to close relationships? Across two large-scale reanalyses, we test the claim that liberal moral universalism comes at the expense of concern for close others. First, we analyze a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 1,000) weighted to match census benchmarks. Second, we conduct an integrative reanalysis of four large online convenience samples (N = 3,201; Prolific). Using the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), a widely used measure of moral concern, we examine how ideology shapes moral circles and whether concern for distant others competes with––or coexists alongside––care for those closer to home. Results show that greater concern for distant entities, including outgroups and non-human entities, positively correlates with concern for close others rather than displacing it. Moreover, across the ideological spectrum, ingroup favoritism remains a strong and consistent pattern. However, very conservative individuals in the representative sample showed no meaningful difference between their moral concern for ingroups and outgroups, driven not by heightened outgroup concern but by lower concern for close others. These findings challenge the notion that liberals neglect their immediate social circles and instead suggest that ideological differences in moral expansiveness stem from the degree to which concern extends outward. Our results have important implications for understanding how ideological worldviews shape moral priorities, particularly in a political climate where moral concern is often framed in zero-sum terms.",

Participants’ performance was measured by the quality, elaboration, and originality of their ideas. Subsequently, two-step clustering was employed to identify groups of low- and high-performing students. Finally, process mining techniques (heuristics miner) were used to analyze the interactions of low- and high-performing students.\n\nResults: The findings suggest that including clear evaluation criteria when prompting ChatGPT to generate ideas (rs = .38), providing ChatGPT with an elaborated context for idea generation (rs = .47), and offering specific feedback (rs = .45), enhances the quality, elaboration, and originality of the solutions. Successful problem-solving involves iterative human-AI regulation, with high performers using an overall larger number of prompts (d = 0.82). High performers interacted with ChatGPT through dialogue, where they monitored and regulated the generation of ideas, while low performers used ChatGPT as an information resource.\n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the importance of active and iterative engagement for creative problem-solving and suggest that educational practices should foster metacognitive monitoring and regulation to maximize the benefits of human-AI collaboration.",

Half of the applicants were unaware that their sexual orientation was relevant to the asylum decision. Approximately one third of applicants cited either concerns about the confidentiality of the interview or discomfort with disclosure. One in five applicants referred to a professional involved in the registration or asylum interview as a barrier to disclosure. Against established asylum guidelines, in two case decisions, the credibility of the applicant’s explanation for delaying disclosure was not evaluated. To encourage disclosure, information regarding the eligibility criteria for asylum should be more readily available to asylum applicants; moreover, applicants’ explanations for the delayed disclosure should be carefully evaluated in all cases, with regard for the psychological barriers to sharing sensitive personal information. Finally, psychological research should test and validate interviewing techniques that enhance trust and rapport in the asylum context.",

          "abstract": "Meditative experience has long been associated with conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity to phenomena, increased present moment perception and more pleasant experience. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such meditative “deconstruction” are not well understood, with no formal computational models available to explicate how deconstruction alters perception and action during meditation. Using the active inference framework, I demonstrate that the phenomenology of deconstruction–in terms of conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity and shorter temporal scale perception–naturally emerges from the dynamics of hierarchical inference when the deconstructive notion of letting go is cast as a reduction in belief precision over hidden states at a specific level of the generative model. I present a formal hierarchical three-level generative model and simulate deconstruction as an intervention in a facial recognition task, where the agent selects a letting go policy when perceived affective valence becomes excessively negative. The results demonstrate that the capacity to deconstruct permits agents to self-regulate experienced affect via letting go. The model offers a novel perspective within the paradigm of computational phenomenology on conceptual attenuation, equanimity, stillness and affect during meditative deconstruction.",

There has been consensus around the principles governing this process: lexical items are activated immediately and incrementally as speech arrives, perceptual and lexical representations rapidly decay to make room for new information, and lexical entries are temporally structured. In this framework, speech processing is tightly coupled to the temporally unfolding input. However, recent work challenges this: low-level auditory and higher-level lexical representations do not decay but are retained over long durations; speech perception may require encapsulated memory buffers; lexical representations are not strictly temporally structured; and listeners can delay lexical access substantially in some circumstances. These findings argue for a deep revision to models of word recognition.",

Optimal performance requires switching clusters in a manner that maximizes the rate of retrieving words, known as the marginal value theorem. Previous work has found evidence for this in semantic fluency. The current study tests whether people adhere to the marginal value theorem in letter fluency and whether executive functioning is associated with optimal performance. Three letter cues (T, N, and J) and one semantic cue (animals) were administered. Results are consistent with optimal search in N and J, but not T or animals.

This paper provides a theoretical framework explaining why anxious individuals might engage with horror media and how such engagement could be harnessed to alleviate anxiety and build psychological resilience. First, I outline how specific features of horror media may provide immediate anxiety relief through mechanisms like distraction, perceived control, and physiological regulation. I then propose that repeated exposure to fear-inducing content in horror can foster long-term psychological benefits by enhancing emotional clarity, challenging emotional reasoning, increasing tolerance of somatic experiences, and promoting cognitive reappraisal. These processes are discussed in relation to principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy, highlighting how horror media may serve as a novel, accessible tool for anxiety management. Finally, I outline critical avenues for future research. By integrating insights from clinical psychology, media studies, and neuroscience, this paper lays the groundwork for understanding horror media’s potential role in therapeutic contexts.",

We show how to combine large language models, retrieval-augmented personification (a novel variant of retrieval-augmented generation), and custom code-based logic to create a psychology engine that simulates realistic patient responses by emulating several key psychological mechanisms: short- and long-term memory, varying levels of conscious awareness about topics (as well as modulation of such awareness), and dynamic mood states where attitudes toward topics of conversation evolve over the course of the dialogue. We also describe algorithms for creating realistic patients with coherent symptom profiles and backstories. Taken together, these tools produce a realistic training partner for an MHP, enabling both training-at-scale as well as automated evaluation of specific skill sets. We discuss how our psychology engine framework makes training qualified MHPs more efficient and scalable, facilitates the continuing education needed as potential new treatments such as psychedelics emerge from clinical trials.",

These experiences unfold both dynamically over time, and within broader societal contexts that determine language status and community support. The framework reveals how successful bilingual development depends on alignment across system levels: children, equipped with powerful learning abilities, must meet rich and sustained language experiences, as well as supportive social conditions. This approach illuminates systematic patterns in bilingual development, and emphasizes coordinated, multi-level approaches for supporting bilingual development.",

In one domain of collective action, labor unionization, membership in the US has continuously declined since the 1980s. Despite this decline, recent surveys suggest that pro-union sentiment is rising. Amid workplace inequity and rising public interest in unionization, we draw from research on collective action and organizational identification to examine whether exposure to worker-organization conflict and information about unions changes how workers evaluate existing and novel organizational grievance procedures, and consequently, increases pro-union sentiment. Across four studies (N = 3,143), we find that exposure to workplace conflicts and information about unions reduces workers’ perceived alignment with organizational grievance procedures and increases pro-union attitudes, relative to control conditions where participants are not exposed to information about unions. These findings have implications for employee wellbeing and for the psychological processes implicated in collective action organizing.",

          "abstract": "Human learners often seek information rationally: they prefer more informative over less informative data, and ask questions that optimally discriminate between competing hypotheses. But this picture holds only in simple, controlled settings: in more complex tasks, the computations needed for optimal information seeking become intractable and human inquiry empirically is often far from optimal.  How do people effectively navigate the information landscapes the real world presents? We propose a model of information-seeking under representational constraints, which simplifies complex data used to make inferences and seeks information rationally with respect to its costs.  Six behavioral experiments using two popular search games support this account: we find that people reason imprecisely and make queries in ways that are objectively uninformative under standard models, but are actually efficient given their limited representational capacity. Participants also increasingly prefer simpler, less informative queries as they gain experience in a task, suggesting rapid adaptation to their cognitive limits. Our findings challenge theories of human information-seeking based on an idealized notion of rationality and instead support a more nuanced and realistic view: people are limited in what information they can represent but have information-seeking strategies that are efficient given those limits.",

          "abstract": "Objective\n\nResearch indicates higher prevalence of dissociative experiences in adolescents than in adults. However, the exact phenomenology and underlying mechanisms of dissociation in adolescence have yet to be clarified. The current study explores the presentation of, and possible psychological factors underlying, dissociation in this population.\n\nMethod\n\nTwo online self-report surveys captured data from 3076 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. Participants completed the Černis Felt Sense of Anomaly (ČEFSA) scale of felt sense of anomaly-type dissociation, alongside measures of mechanisms implicated in a cognitive-behavioural model of dissociation in adults (cognitive appraisals, alexithymia, and affect intolerance). N=409 completed the ČEFSA scale at a second timepoint, one month later.\n\nResults\n\nMost (91.87%) adolescents endorsed at least one ČEFSA item. The mean number of endorsed items was 13.00 (SD = 9.67). The most endorsed factors of the ČEFSA were Altered Sense of Agency (82.96%), Anomalous experience of the Self (76.76%), and Altered Sense of Connection (73.76%).\n\nMediation analysis indicated that emotion regulation (expressive suppression) mediated the relationship between Time One and Time Two dissociation scores: greater suppression was associated with greater dissociation one month later. No other tested variables showed statistically significant mediation.\n\nConclusions\n\nAdolescents are likely to experience dissociation as detachment and disconnection, particularly relating to their selfhood and external world (i.e., depersonalisation and derealisation). \nThis study suggests that the key element of a recent cognitive-behavioural model of dissociative experiences in adults – that affect intolerance perpetuates dissociation – may also be applicable in adolescence.",

Network modelling can reveal these relationships, but it has rarely been conducted with prospective, naturalistic data. We explored networks looking at prospective relationships between negative and positive emotions on one hand and transdiagnostic eating-related behaviors (hunger, food craving, and calorie intake) on the other. These variables were assessed six times a day across eight days in female participants with Binge-Eating Disorder (BED, N=37), Bulimia Nervosa (BN, N=42), and Anorexia Nervosa of the binge-purge (AN-BP, N=26) and restrictive (AN-R, N=29) subtypes. Most prominent were associations of calorie intake with subsequent negative affect, seen in every group, particularly in BN. We also observed several possible affect-mediated pathways for restriction: in BN and AN-BP, hunger predicted reduced negative affect, and there were clear restriction- and hunger-promoting feedback loops mediated by emotional responses; in AN-R, depression predicted less hunger and desire-to-eat. We also observed differing patterns of emotional eating. AN-R showed positive emotional eating, with happiness predicting desire-to-eat and thereby eating. BED showed negative emotional eating, with worry predicting subsequent hunger and desire-to-eat, and irritation predicting calorie intake. AN-R and BN showed bored eating, while AN-BP showed no negative emotional eating whatsoever. Lastly, when it comes to emotional experience, patients with AN-BP experienced the most intense and persistent negative affect across the sample, and their network was most dissimilar to that of AN-R, supporting their study as a separate group with elevated emotional distress.",

Specifically, the authors propose a framework that combines citation impact and sample size of the original articles as a metric for assessing replication value. This implies that original studies with higher scores on this metric can be prioritized for replication efforts.\n \nWe thoroughly agree with the authors' assumption, and indeed support the view of working towards an optimal framework that helps the community achieve maximum research impact from the replication efforts.

We received 190 eligible responses of which 91 were randomized into the ‘without spin’-condition and 99 into the ‘with spin’-condition. \nInterventions   We selected 10 abstracts from published RCTs that investigated behavioural treatments for depression. The RCTs had at least one nonsignificant primary outcome and an abstract conclusion that claimed a beneficial effect despite that nonsignificant primary outcome. We rewrote the abstracts to create a spinless version of each of the 10 abstracts. Participants were randomly assigned to read one version of one of the 10 abstracts and answer questions about the study described in the abstract. \nOutcome measures   The primary outcome was the participants’ perception of the effectiveness of the treatment proposed in the abstract, rated on a scale from 0 to 10. \nResults   The Bayesian analysis showed no convincing support for an effect of spin on the participants’ perception of the treatment effectiveness (posterior mean = 0.53, SE = 0.27, 95% CI [-0.01, 1.07]; posterior mode = 0.54, 95% HDI [-0.02, 1.06]).

The current study investigates the consequences of focused attention for prioritized information in visual working memory. Specifically, in three behavioral experiments, we study how focused attention modulates the distractor susceptibility of mental representations that are the object of focused attention, using different prioritization modes (spontaneous, cued-based, and reward-based prioritization). When we relied on spontaneous prioritization in Experiments 1a and 1b, our findings indicated that information in the focus of attention is as vulnerable to perceptual interference as information represented elsewhere in working memory, and this did not change over time. When prioritization was externally-guided in Experiment 2, we found information in the focus of attention to be either protected from perceptual interference (when using cue-based prioritization) or as vulnerable as information represented elsewhere in working memory (when using reward-based prioritization), regardless of when the priority signal was presented (before, during, or after encoding). Thus, overall, distractor susceptibility of information in working memory was revealed to be either reduced (when cue-based) or unaffected (when spontaneous or reward-based) by prioritization, but never increased in the current study.

However, the onset timing of these phenomena, particularly under visual-only stimulation, remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on body-part ownership under visuotactile conditions, the temporal dynamics of VT in a full-body context remain underexplored.\nThis study investigated FBOI and VT in 34 healthy participants observing a virtual body from either a first-person (1PP) or third-person (3PP) perspective. Illusory experiences were categorized into different outcomes, and participants provided subjective ratings of onset timing and intensity. These were analyzed alongside physiological measures (respiratory rate, heart rate variability, and skin conductance) and psychological traits (empathy and attachment) to explore factors modulating these experiences.\nResults showed that 1PP significantly accelerated and intensified both FBOI and VT, highlighting the pivotal role of perspective in sensory integration. Conversely, 3PP was linked to a higher prevalence of No Illusion outcomes and weaker illusions, reflecting difficulties in aligning sensory cues. Respiratory rate emerged as a marker of VT experiences, while empathy predicted faster and more intense VT, indicating greater sensitivity in emotionally attuned individuals.\nThese findings provide insights into the temporal dynamics of VT and FBOI, with implications for VR-based therapeutic applications targeting sensory integration and body representation.",

Growing evidence suggests that people often rely on mental simulations to evaluate probability and risky events.

Across four experiments (total N=206, with Experiment 4 pre-registered), we investigated the influence of utility using a random generation paradigm. These responses were then compared to probability judgments and predictions. While we identified individual differences, the majority of participants exhibited neutrality, with no systematic impact of utility on their sampling distributions. Nevertheless, biases emerged under specific conditions, including a preference for smaller or more probable outcomes as the starting point of simulations and optimism in single-response predictions. Additionally, we found evidence suggesting that probability judgments, predictions, and random generation tasks may rely on a shared underlying mental process. Our findings suggest that models of judgment and decision-making should account for individual differences in utility influences, particularly distinguishing between unbiased sampling and optimistic sampling—the selective over-representation of high-utility outcomes.",

Such a stimulus has been used by researchers to study perceptual phenomena in the absence of changes in sensory structure. Others have used it to study altered states of consciousness (ASCs). Until now, these different facets have been studied separately with little attention for the emotional subjective experience. This study aimed to elucidate the perceptual, phenomenal, and emotional experience of the multifaceted Ganzfeld using a multi-method approach combining behavioral (eye-tracking) and neural (EEG) measures, with qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires) assessments. We show that Ganzfeld spaces induce ASCs and offer immersive, full-body experiences, including bodily effects. Our results pertaining to bodily sensations further prompted us to identify a perceptually grounded processing type with either an inward-directed or externally-directed focus. We also identified the presence of an abstract cognitive processing type characterized by an introspective focus and meditative experiences. At the behavioral level, decays were characterized by decreased eye movements. The lag in reporting decays and the subjective experience of decays point to the notion of mind blanking. At the neural level, we found increased theta activity preceding decays, further hinting at a potential interrelation between perceptual decays and mind blanking. Finally, decays were characterized by more alpha activity, indicating attenuated sensory processing and a relaxed state. Our findings contribute to a more in-depth understanding of all the components contributing to the rich Ganzfeld experiences.",

Shorter rhythmic cycles were learned and recalled by Culturally Familiar Non-Musicians and Culturally Unfamiliar Musicians, while longer ones posed challenges. Culturally Unfamiliar Non-musician participants showed no learning or recall for the four rhythmic cycles.

          "abstract": "Understanding consumer search behavior is crucial for businesses and policymakers aiming to effectively engage with consumers through product offerings and interventions. Consumer search in service for choice remains a significant topic in marketing, economics, and psychology although existing theories differ in fundamental assumptions and methodological approaches. Theoretical assumptions range from the order in which items are searched being independent of their value, to search being influenced by cognitive and visual factors. Methodological approaches vary from directly observing search (with eye tracking or click stream data), to inferring search from choice data alone. This article proposes a framework for integrating theoretical and methodological approaches to consumer search. This integration will help marketers and policymakers compare and apply theories to different contexts. Ultimately, it paves the way to a unified framework for understanding and guiding consumer behavior as well as strategic decisions in marketing and policy. We review five prominent theoretical models, each with distinct terminologies. For each model, we review its background, aims, core assumptions, and provide illustrative examples. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we initiate a synthesis to resolve terminological differences and outline a path toward theory integration, and (2) we discuss how our framework can guide future research and foster a more comprehensive understanding of consumer search and choice.",

The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the user’s\nbelief that the content is AI-generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as ’like’, comment, and sharing.

Unfortunately, the consensus from sixty years of psychological research is that people cannot do so: when attempting to be random, people’s responses exhibit systematic patterns. Random phenomena, however, are not instantaneously random. They require sufficient time between observations (e.g. the weather) or for enough iterations of a randomizing process to have occurred (e.g. card shuffling). It is unknown whether human sequences can be random if afforded such delays. Here we show that a modest temporal separation between items can make human sequences indistinguishable from random ones. We carried out our own experiment (N = 54) and analyzed ten existing datasets with different production rates, response sets, and response modalities. We found that when the delay between items was between two and four seconds, differences between human and random sequences disappeared. Furthermore, by comparing sequences produced by the same participants at different speeds, we confirmed that when participants make an effort, the needed delay is independent of production rate, akin to the weather. Our results show that people are able to generate randomness, and within a few seconds, giving us an accessible protection against potential exploits.",

Computational deep-learning studies have been conducted to predict facial attractiveness and explore its contributing factors. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the mainstay of these analyses, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has recently attracted considerable attention. In this study, facial attractiveness prediction models were constructed using CNN-based models or ViT, and the facial regions the models focused on were identified. While the CNN focused on local features, particularly facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, the visual geometry group 19 (VGG19), a CNN model with a deep architecture, covers a wider range. In contrast, ViT focuses on global features, such as skin texture and facial contours, suggesting that it may reflect holistic processing based on the relationships between facial parts. In research on understanding facial attractiveness factors using deep learning models, the extracted facial features differ by model architecture, advocating the need for an approach that considers both local and global features based on the research objective.",

          "abstract": "Computational models of auditory salience predict that acoustic change and divergence from prediction increase the salience of sound streams. Confirming these predictions, prior research has shown that acoustic change and unpredictable sound features are linked to increases in physiological arousal and disruption of concurrent task performance. However, it remains unclear whether linguistic features, such as phonemic and lexical/semantic surprisal, help drive attentional orienting, or whether instead attentional capture takes place prior to linguistic analysis. To address this question, we introduce a new technique for assessing attentional capture by naturalistic task-irrelevant speech. In this paradigm participants tap to a metronome while ignoring a spoken passage from an audiobook. Salient features of the task-irrelevant speech capture attention, increase arousal, and expand subjective time, leading to shifts in tap timing. We show that distortions of subjective time are driven not only by acoustic change but also by phonemic surprisal. Thus, attentional orienting to sound takes place after the initial stages of linguistic analysis.",

          "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that the phonological production of words does not follow a single pathway, as was assumed in the past.

Previous studies showed such pathway separation for words from different categories (e.g., number versus non-number words) or with different meanings (number words with numerical versus non-numerical meaning, e.g., ‘Nine West’). Here, we show that the separation of phonological production pathways is even greater than that: even the same word with the same meaning can follow different phonological production pathways, depending on the context in which the word is produced. We report HLI, a woman with aphasia. She erred in 5 number-production tasks, all with phonological output but with different input modalities: digits, written number words, dice patterns, encyclopedic questions, and approximate quantities.

This dissociation indicates multiple phonological production pathways for verbal numbers. We propose that HLI has a deficit in a default phonological production pathway, which serves most number-production tasks. At the same time, other, dedicated pathways of phonological number production, which are recruited uniquely by the calculation, counting, and repetition tasks, are spared. Finally, we propose a concrete model that explains when and how the dedicated, task-specific phonological-access pathways are created, and we show that HLI’s performance satisfies a central prediction of this model.",

In this commentary, we suggest that the approach of Isager et al., while a good theoretical departure point, oversimplifies the complex decision-making process that underpins replication target selection in practice. We present what we view as some issues with RVCN, notably the use of citation count and ambiguity as to whether RVCN is prescriptive or descriptive. We also present preliminary empirical evidence that RVCN diverges on its performance as a replication target selection method, compared with existing selection methods (such as those published by us in the past). We conclude with the recommendation that going forward, approaches should emphasize the multifaceted nature of replication target selection to maximize their practical utility.",

          "abstract": "The built environment profoundly influences human cognition and behavior, with light playing a crucial role in modulating attentional processes. This study investigates the interplay between attentional load and correlated color temperature (CCT) on neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during scene perception. Twenty participants were exposed to combinations of three different CCTs (2000K, 6000K, 10000K) within a virtual coffee shop environment, presented from four different angles. During the experiment, participants completed a visual detection task under both low and high attentional load conditions. EEG data were analyzed using frequency analysis to assess alpha-band (8–13 Hz) oscillations, a key neural marker of attentional engagement. Results revealed that high attentional load led to significant alpha suppression, particularly in the right hemisphere, indicating increased cognitive demand. While a trend of greater alpha-band modulation was observed as a function of lighting (from blue-enriched to warm lighting), this effect did not reach statistical significance. These findings highlight the potential role of lighting conditions in shaping attentional processes and suggest that thoughtful lighting design may contribute to creating environments that support cognitive engagement. Optimizing lighting environments in spaces designed for both focus and relaxation could enhance productivity and well-being by accommodating diverse cognitive demands.",

          "abstract": "In this research, we explored the efficacy of various warning label designs for AI-generated content on social media platforms—e.g., deepfakes. We devised and assessed ten distinct label design samples that varied across the dimensions of sentiment, color/iconography, positioning, and level of detail. Our experimental study involved 911 participants randomly assigned to these ten label designs and a control group evaluating social media content. We explored their perceptions relating to 1) Belief in the content being AI-generated, 2) Trust in the labels and 3) Social Media engagement perceptions of the content. The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the user’s\nbelief that the content is AI-generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as ’like’, comment, and sharing. However, there were significant differences in engagement based on content type: political and entertainment. This investigation contributes to the field of human-computer interaction by defining a design space for label  implementation and providing empirical support for the strategic use of \nlabels to mitigate the risks associated with synthetically generated media.",

          "abstract": "Self-Categorization Theory (Turner et al., 1987; 1994) has proven itself to be one of the most influential and robust explanatory theories in social cognition. Its two foundational texts have been cited almost 25,000 times and it has spurred theoretical, empirical, and applied research across a wide array of topics. Despite its successes, I will argue in this talk that its theoretical commitment to a “Roschian” prototype view of categorization holds it back. In particular, I will argue that its reliance on the “principle of meta-contrast” for category discrimination (1) renders it computationally intractable; and (2) saddles it with a model of semantic content that does not meet the criterion of naturalness. I will propose instead that Fodor’s (1995; Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn, 2015) “conceptual atomism” should be adopted. I will outline Fodor’s critiques of what he refers to as the “inferential role semantics” of prototype models and discuss their relevance to self-categorization. I will then explore the implications for Self-Categorization Theory of adopting a conceptual atomism approach, with a particular emphasis on issues of context dependence, prototypicality, and perceiver readiness.",

We investigated double standards in judging collective action—that is, whether observers judge the same protest actions to be more acceptable depending on who the protesters are and what they are protesting. In two studies, we used item response theory to develop an instrument of 25 controversial protest actions to measure where people draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable forms of collective action. In three preregistered experiments (N = 2776), we found no consistent evidence for ingroup bias in terms of social class when judging protests for workers’ rights (Experiment 1), in terms of race when judging protests for and against defunding the police (Experiment 2), and in terms of gender when judging protests for and against restricting abortion (Experiment 3). Instead, we found that progressive participants (Experiments 1–3) who rejected system-justifying beliefs (Experiments 1–2) considered the same protest actions more acceptable when a cause aligned with their ideological orientation (for workers’ rights, for defunding the police, against restricting abortion) than when it did not (against defunding the police, for restricting abortion). Conservative participants considered the same actions somewhat more acceptable when protesters supported, rather than opposed, restricting abortion (Experiment 3) but considered all protest actions, for and against defunding the police, equally unacceptable (Experiment 2). Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for understanding the often-divided response to social movements.",

          "abstract": "Adults aged 65 and older are the fastest growing population demographic. Standard, stationary eye tracking has been used to test for age differences in attention and cognition toward understanding decline trajectories and identifying ways to enhance functioning into late life. More recently, advanced methods of at-home eye tracking, mobile eye tracking, and simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and eye tracking have suggested promise for insight into more dynamic and naturalistic processes of visual attentional and cognitive processing as well as their brain correlates in aging. Here, we outline challenges, best practices, and novel frontiers in the use of eye-tracking methodology among older adults. We cover considerations pertaining to optimized age-tailored study designs and procedures, eye-tracker setup as well as data quality and analysis. Throughout, we reflect on our experiences conducting novel experiments via at-home and mobile eye tracking as well as simultaneous MRI-eye tracking in aging populations. We also present empirical data comparing the quality of eye tracking in the behavioral lab vs. the MRI environment among both young and older adults, in support of simultaneous MRI-eye tracking informing brain-behavior links in aging, while acknowledging trade-offs in data quality of this combined methodology. We propose for future research to leverage these novel, advanced eye-tracking applications for a more comprehensive and real-life capture of attentional and cognitive changes with age.",

          "abstract": "Objectification—the psychological phenomenon of relegating people to the status of objects, denying their humanness—is associated with a host of negative consequences for those targeted, from diminished cognitive performance to heightened risk of danger. Girls and women constitute the primary targets of objectification; thus, these harms fall disproportionately on them. Despite the persistence of such gendered patterns, however, it is not clear how they arise. That is, we do not yet know whether and to what extent perceivers objectify children along gender lines (i.e., associating girls with objects and boys with humans), thus limiting our grasp of this phenomenon both theoretically and practically. In the present studies, we addressed this gap on two fronts. First, we tested whether adults (n=430) objectify young children based on gender. Second, we tested whether children themselves (n=418, ages 4-10 years) display gendered patterns of objectification toward other children. We found evidence that adults objectify children based on gender: in both their categorizations and attributions, adults revealed overlap between their concepts of girls and objects and their concepts of boys and humans (although the degree to which each specific pattern manifested varied across studies). Children showed more limited evidence of this phenomenon: boys, but not girls, displayed the predicted pattern of conceptual overlap, and only in their categorizations. Together, these findings reveal that gender-differentiated patterns of objectification may take root in perceptions of young children—suggesting that the gendered consequences of this phenomenon may be larger in scope and earlier-emerging than previously assumed.",

          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for these children’s development and adaptation. The normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-generation, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. As few studies differentiate between students from different immigrant generations, there is a need to investigate adaptation process of first-generation and second-generation immigrant students separately, and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, academic track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family microsystem, including family structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational believes (educational aspirations), and family process variables (parent-child reading). Collecting data from N = 271 German fourth-graders (M(age) = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; 54.2% female, 44.6% male, 0.4% non-binary; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants) and controlling for age differences, we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. However, no significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that, among family variables, high educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading positively related to higher life satisfaction independent of immigrant status. Furthermore, life satisfaction was additionally positively predicted by educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and by socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, for whom we found significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

          "abstract": "Associative memory naturally declines with age. However, when associative memory is supported by semantic knowledge, older adults can compensate for this decline. This study aims to explore the use of the method of loci, which involves associating each item of a to-be-memorized list with a location along a familiar route, that we adapted to leverage pre-existing knowledge in semantic memory. The memory of young (18–30 years old) and older (60–75 years old) participants was tested after encoding word lists using the method of loci under two conditions: congruent or incongruent with pre-existing knowledge, compared to a control condition. The objective was to assess memory performance improvement based on encoding conditions and age groups. The results showed significant memory performance improvements in both groups when the method of loci was used with congruent associations. In contrast, performance in the incongruent condition was similar to that observed during encoding without a specific strategy, highlighting the importance of semantic links for associative memory.  Furthermore, using the method of loci with congruent associations, older adults displayed recall performance equivalent to young adults, while it was not the case with incongruent associations. The method of loci applied in conditions of semantic congruence thus appears to be a promising compensatory strategy for older adults.",

          "abstract": "Theories of memory consolidation claim that new word learning is bolstered by existing semantic knowledge. However, when semantic knowledge exerts its effects (i.e., at encoding and/or consolidation) and whether semantic benefits change across development remains unclear. Sixty-one children (Experiment 1) and 63 adults (Experiment 2) learned novel word forms paired with pictures of (i) real but rare animals akin to existing animals (Highly Linkable to existing knowledge), (ii) fictitious animals that were less clearly associated with familiar animals (Less Linkable), and (iii) “name tags” written with unfamiliar symbols (Unlinkable). Word form and meaning recall were tested immediately, 1 day and 1 week after learning. Children showed greater improvements across tests than adults despite comparable performance immediately after learning. Regardless of test sessions, semantic knowledge benefited adults’ recall of word form and meaning, with additional benefit from highly versus less linkable knowledge. Children only showed semantic benefits in meaning (and not word form) recall, with additional benefits from highly linkable knowledge. Instead, children’s word form recall was more globally associated with receptive vocabulary and nonword repetition. These results suggest that when present, the benefits of semantic information permeate across the timecourse of word learning; they also point to developmental differences in word learning mechanisms. Adults made clear use of associated semantic knowledge, whereas children showed more general associations between word learning and language abilities and greater benefit from offline consolidation. These results highlight the need for models of word learning and consolidation to incorporate developmental and individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Musicians’ performance experiences range widely, from elation to severe anxiety. In this study, we examined musicians’ performance experiences through the lens of the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat. According to this model, a challenge state arises when perceived resources meet or exceed perceived demands, while a threat state occurs when demands outweigh resources. These states can be quantified using the Demand Resource Evaluation Score (DRES), calculated as the difference between resource and demand evaluations, with higher values indicating a greater challenge-type response. Although post-event processing is a key factor in maintaining social anxiety, research on factors influencing musicians’ post-performance thoughts remains limited. Additionally, the link between DRES and post-performance thoughts is unknown. This study aimed to determine 1) how DRES is influenced by the general music performance anxiety (MPA) level, audience presence, and time (pre-performance vs. during-performance); 2) how negative and positive post-performance thoughts are influenced by general MPA level and audience presence; and 3) whether DRES predicts post-performance thoughts. Classical music students (N = 121) with varying levels of MPA performed solo in a private and a public session. We assessed pre-performance and during-performance DRES, and negative and positive post-performance thoughts. DRES decreased with increasing general MPA level, was lower in public than private sessions, and declined from pre-performance to during-performance. These effects were qualified by a three-way interaction: the effect of general MPA level was strongest before performing publicly, the audience effect was most pronounced at higher general MPA levels before performing, and the time effect was greatest at lower general MPA levels during public sessions. General MPA level was associated with more negative thoughts and fewer positive thoughts. Audience presence increased only negative thoughts. Higher during-performance DRES predicted fewer negative and more positive thoughts both intraindividually and interindividually, with pre-performance DRES showing similar interindividual effects. These findings demonstrate the complex interplay of personal and situational factors in shaping musicians’ challenge and threat experiences. Moreover, high general MPA levels are associated with a general tendency toward more negative and fewer positive post-performance thoughts. Interventions fostering challenge-oriented appraisals may enhance musicians’ post-performance processing, potentially mitigating performance anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Repeatedly seen or heard statements are typically judged to be more likely true than statements not encountered before, a phenomenon referred to as truth effect. Similarly, statements judged to be old typically receive higher truth judgments than statements judged to be new. However, it is unclear whether and how this recognition-based truth effect depends on the latent memory states underlying observed recognition judgments. In order to investigate this question, we used a model-based approach to compare truth judgments as a function of recognition judgments ('old' versus 'new') and their underlying memory states (state of memory certainty vs. state of uncertainty). In three experiments, we observed a recognition-based truth effect and found this effect to be larger in the state of memory certainty than in the state of uncertainty. This result also replicated for subjective instead of modeled memory states. Moreover, we found effects of recognition judgments on judged truth to be stronger than effects of factual repetition in all three experiments. Taken together, our research highlights the role of episodic memory processes in the truth effect and provides a methodological tool that takes underlying memory states into account.",

However, after stricter control of image luminance and arousal, pupil dilation for high-memorability images was observed in all memorization, recognition, and passive view phases (Experiments 2 and 3). This effect of image memorability was further validated through item-based analyses. The pupil old/new effect and the subsequent memory effect on the pupil were replicated.

          "abstract": "Affective polarization—antipathy towards members of one’s political outgroup—may pose challenges to social cohesion and personal well-being. Prior studies have suggested that one’s affective polarization may cause intrapersonal harm as well as interpersonal harm. It has been associated with reduced social support, increased stress, and worse physical health. This pre-registered study investigated the intrapersonal harm of affective polarization using a six-wave longitudinal survey (N = 470). Affective polarization, social support, perceived stress, and self-rated health were measured fortnightly for three months preceding the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models were employed to investigate the within-person effects of affective polarization on these indictors of wellbeing. Contrary to hypotheses, none of the hypothesised cross-lagged effects were significant, suggesting that changes in affective polarization did not predict changes in social support, stress, or health. However, cross-sectional analyses did reflect past findings, showing that higher levels of affective polarization were associated with lower social support, greater stress, and worse health. We additionally found evidence for perceived stress causing moderate increases in affective polarization. Stable differences by political orientation were also observed in our sample, with liberals reporting higher affective polarization and stress, lower social support, and worse health. Despite the lack of significant effects, potentially due to limitations such as sample size and measurement constraints, our findings underscore the importance of further investigations with appropriate robust designs to clarify the relationship between affective polarization and well-being. These results challenge the assumption that affective polarization directly drives declines in well-being.",

Additionally, the study examined the role that resilience variables–mindfulness and emotion regulation–play in the association between victimization timing and PTSS severity.\nMethod: Participants were 247 cisgender community women aged 21-30 recruited for a larger study on high-risk drinking and sexual behaviors. Victimization history was assessed using the Computer Assisted Maltreatment Inventory and Sexual Experiences Survey-Revised. PTSS severity was measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Emotion regulation and mindfulness were evaluated using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-36 and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire, respectively. Negative binomial regression models tested the hypotheses.\nResults: Analyses revealed significant differences in PTSS severity by victimization timing: CSA + ASA was associated with the greatest PTSS severity, followed by ASA-only, and CSA-only reporting the lowest severity. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were directly associated with reduced PTSS severity across all victimization profiles. \nConclusions: Revictimization was linked to the most severe PTSS, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were associated with reduced PTSS severity, regardless of victimization timing. Future interventions could prioritize enhancing psychological skills, like mindfulness and emotion regulation, to reduce distress for victim-survivors of sexual victimization.",

However, there is growing recognition that incentivised decisions in behavioural economic games provide better or at least complementary measures of latent preferences. Much prior research also views politics along a unidimensional left/progressive versus right/conservative spectrum, even though increasing evidence suggests two distinct dimensions of political views, one correlated with attitudes on inequality and a second with attitudes on social control. The former dimension is labelled as economic conservatism/progressivism, and the latter as social conservatism/progressivism.

Despite citing a well-established positive reinforcement protocol in stopping chasing behavior in dogs by Bangura (2024), Johnson and Wynne’s implementation markedly diverged from empirically supported methods, resulting in methodological confounds that invalidate their claims of low efficacy for non-aversive approaches. The present critique synthesizes peer-reviewed research, professional standards, and foundational learning principles to demonstrate that the misapplication of recommended procedures, inadequate reinforcement strategies, and poorly controlled variables produced artificially inflated success rates for e-collar training. Furthermore, the analysis reveals significant concerns regarding experimental design, welfare measures, and data interpretation that cast doubt on the reliability and ethical defensibility of the study’s conclusions. References are drawn from current, high-caliber sources to reinforce that properly executed positive reinforcement techniques can effectively curb high-drive chasing behaviors without resorting to punitive measures.",

          "abstract": "A phylogenetical split, beginning perhaps between 8 and 6 Ma (million years ago) came to separate paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, and homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had yet evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. The former were to become woodland-dwellers in multifemale-multimale troops with social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal investment or interest in their offspring, which is the preserve of mothers. \n \tContrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primeval homininans, a \"heretical\" proposal is that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (consisting of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had three consequences that would impinge on homininan evolution and differentiate it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans, namely: \n(1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be scrounged, foraged, eaten, or carried away, within a 2-hour walk; \n(2) Whatever was scroungeable, forageable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any time of the year, which meant that voracious social units were necessarily small; \n(3) Smallness which, in turn, demanded ingenuity and the transmissibiity of existential information in the form of active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, by virtue of the broadening of homininan \"zones of bounded surprisal\" with respect to paninans' zones, both within each homininan social unit and between adjoining homininan units in the landscape, which spread geographically over time as budding small-world information networks (and eventually reached Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Late (Upper) Pleistocene);\n(4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sometimes collaboration between social units (maybe ca. 4.2 Ma in Australopithecus anamensis), which, together with the generation of information within each unit, favoured paternal investment in child-rearing in mixed-sex social units and by mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners with establishment of mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby (mixed-sex philopatry), which maintained not only heterozygosity but also, most important, kinship links that favoured cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units: all of that marked a major behavioural shift away from paninan social arrangements.\n                          \n\tThe vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of false dawns between ~4.2 Ma (Australopithecus anamensjs) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan palaeospecies (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving Homo sapiens alone in prehistory to roam around the world, the sole depositary of our now highly-evolved homininan hierarchically mechanistic mind conditioned by our unparallelled wide zone of bounded surprisal grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle.",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nDissociative experiences are common transdiagnostically, and particularly prevalent in psychosis. Such experiences have long been under-recognised in routine clinical practice, despite evidence that dissociation is related to clinical complexity and increased risk of self-harm and suicidality. Adopting a symptom-specific, targeted approach to conceptualisation and intervention of dissociation may help improve outcomes. \n\nAims\n\nThe evidence base for psychological treatments targeting dissociation is building, but training and guidance for clinicians remains sparse. This review outlines a preliminary approach to the treatment of a subtype of dissociative experience (‘felt sense of anomaly’ dissociation), based on emerging research evidence and clinical practice. The guidance is tailored to the context of first episode psychosis, and may also have broader clinical relevance.\n\nMethod\n\nFactors to consider in the assessment, formulation, and intervention of felt sense of anomaly dissociation in the context of first episode psychosis are outlined, including reflections on process issues. We present a cognitive-behavioural model, where affect-related changes are interpreted as an internal threat, driving a maintenance cycle of catastrophic appraisals and safety behaviours. Using this formulation, evidence-based therapy techniques familiar to most readers can then be applied.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt is important for clinicians to consider dissociation. As well as generating new avenues for translational intervention research, we anticipate that the novel insights and specific advice outlined here will be of use to professionals working with dissociation in psychosis (and beyond). Encouragingly, we demonstrate that widely used, evidence-based skills and techniques can be employed to address distress arising from dissociation.",

          "abstract": "Background: Schizophrenia, characterized by symptoms such as auditory and visual hallucinations, imposes significant challenges on mental health care. Recent research highlights the potential of meditation to alleviate symptoms by enhancing emotional regulation and neuroplasticity. This study examines the role of meditation as an adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia, exploring its neurobiological underpinnings and practical integration into care models.\n\nMethods: A mixed-methods approach was employed. Quantitative data were analyzed from clinical trials and intervention studies assessing meditation-based therapies in schizophrenia. Metrics included changes in symptom severity, cognitive performance, and quality of life using standardized scales such as PANSS and WHO-QOL. Qualitative data were collected through structured interviews with patients and practitioners, analyzed using thematic analysis to identify recurring patterns and insights into the feasibility and cultural acceptance of meditation in schizophrenia care. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate effect sizes and correlations between meditation practices and symptom improvement.\n\nResults: Findings indicate that meditation significantly modulates neural circuits associated with stress and emotional dysregulation, reducing symptom severity and improving coping mechanisms. Quantitative analysis revealed consistent reductions in PANSS scores (p &lt; 0.05) and improved quality-of-life measures. Thematic analysis highlighted increased self-awareness and reduced distress from hallucinations as key benefits. Providers emphasized the need for personalized meditation protocols tailored to individual symptom profiles.\n\nConclusion: Meditation offers a promising complementary strategy for managing schizophrenia symptoms, supported by both quantitative and qualitative evidence. Its integration into treatment plans requires interdisciplinary collaboration and sensitivity to cultural contexts. Future research should focus on long-term efficacy and refining protocols to maximize therapeutic outcomes.",

We measured anxiety (The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale; OASIS), depression (The Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale; ODSIS), loneliness (The Three-Item Loneliness Scale; TILS) and self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale; GSES). Statistical analysis was performed using binary logistic regression, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), Wilcoxon rank-sum and the Kruskal-Wallis test. \nResults\nPeople with higher loneliness were more likely to experience anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79, p &lt; 0.001) and depression (OR = 1.77, p &lt; 0.001); self-efficacy was associated with lower likelihood of these symptoms by 9% (OR = 0.91, p &lt; 0.001).  The SEM analysis revealed that loneliness was significantly associated with both anxiety and depression; higher self-efficacy significantly moderated the loneliness–depression relationship (β = -0.08, p = 0.03) by weakening this association.\n\nConclusion\nLoneliness is associated with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, while self-efficacy is the opposite. High self-efficacy is associated with a reduction in the negative mental health impacts of loneliness, which can be used in intervention programmes for vulnerable groups. The causal relationship should be tested in future studies.\nKeywords\nloneliness, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, OASIS, ODSIS",

          "abstract": "Assessing a parent's ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their children is a challenging task for child welfare workers. Given the complex and indefinite nature of parenting, decision-makers often rely on subjective criteria in their evaluations. In Study 1 (N = 49), we examined the variability among child welfare professionals as they independently assessed the overall quality of care in ten vignettes, each depicting different scenarios. We found an inter-rater reliability of .50, indicating a concerning level of unwanted variability (‘noise’), with 24.7 % of the variance attributable to average differences between raters. This suggests that raters have different thresholds for what constitutes unsafe parenting. In Study 2 (N = 44), we examined whether aggregating domain-specific evaluations would reduce noise, but the resulting improvement in inter-rater reliability to .54 was not statistically significant. We found 28.7 % level noise after aggregating. We conclude that noise-reduction strategies are appropriate and necessary to improve the consistency of assessments in child welfare decisions.",

          "abstract": "The development and evaluation of psychological outcome measures can involve the application of numerous sophisticated psychometric methods. Recent research noted that the use of different methods can lead to a plurality of modelling outcomes for commonly used measures. Furthermore, using these methods to optimise existing measures and derive weighted scores may not change the substantive results of studies when compared to original findings using total sum scores. In a series of semi-structured interviews, we presented these findings to 21 key stakeholders with psychology/psychiatry research backgrounds to elicit their perceptions regarding the use of advanced psychometric methods in applied research. Participants were purposively sampled and included psychometricians, clinicians, applied researchers, statisticians and academics. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we interpreted three themes; (1) Heterogeneity of latent traits, (2) A legacy of poor measurement, and (3) When psychometrics matter. Our findings highlight a mismatch between the generally held perception that latent traits are heterogeneous in nature and the way in which many measures were established as unitary constructs. The quality of commonly used outcome measures was critiqued, and a shortcoming in knowledge of how psychometrics could improve measurement accuracy was acknowledged. Improved training and increased collaboration with psychometricians could augment psychometric skills among applied researchers and enhance critical evaluation of routinely used outcome measures.",

          "abstract": "Background: Tool innovation in young children is an underexplored topic, and the Gestalt and the perception-action theories offer different explanations of the process of tool innovation. Aims: We aimed to design and to validate nine new tool innovation tasks and to investigate 3- to 6-year-olds’ tool innovation process. Sample: From three kindergartens, 141 Chinese children (77 boys and 64 girls) took part in this research. Methods: Using the new tasks, children’s performance was coded as task success (whether the reward was retrieved) and ideal manipulation (whether certain manipulation was performed), and children’s exploration process was coded for fixation (the frequency of repeating the same actions) and flexibility (the frequency of shifting to novel actions). Children’s cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibitory control, divergent thinking, and general intelligence were also measured. Results: The new tasks showed varied difficulty levels and exhibited high internal consistency, and children’s individual differences in task performance were positively associated with their individual differences in age, general intelligence, and divergent thinking. Children’s behavioral fixation hinders their tool innovation; and this effect was strengthened for easier compared to harder tasks, whereas children's behavioral flexibility enhances their tool innovation; and this effect was seemingly stronger for harder compared to easier tasks. Conclusions: The new tasks were robust and suitable for studying young children’s tool innovation. Task difficulty level has a critical role in shaping children’s tool innovation process, which may serve as a mechanism to bridge the Gestalt and the perception-action theories in explaining the process of tool innovation.",

The quality of generated items was assessed through expert evaluations and empirical testing with 93 psychology undergraduates and 184 participants from a general population pool. Results indicate that items generated by ERNIE 4.0, particularly new items from Approach 1, met or exceeded the quality of existing tests in both expert evaluations and empirical validations, while adapted items showed some limitations.

          "abstract": "Long, naturalistic stimuli are effective in evoking meaningfully differential neural response patterns between groups. However, the resulting timeseries data often have a high number of features compared to a limited sample size, increasing the likelihood of overfitting and reducing predictive power. This paper introduces multi-timepoint pattern analysis (MTPA) as a temporal dimension reduction approach for improving prediction accuracy when building models with long neural timeseries data. Using feature selection with elastic net regression, MTPA identifies predictive neural patterns while preserving the temporal structure and interpretability of the data. Across two experiments with distinct populations and objectives, MTPA demonstrated consistent advantages over approaches using principal component analysis (PCA), windowed averaging, and no dimension reduction. Experiment 1 predicted persistent work-related psychological states in business professionals, achieving accuracies up to 79.1%. Experiment 2 predicted cognitive load and narrative context during video viewing in undergraduates, with accuracies up to 66.5%. These findings suggest that MTPA may be a useful tool for analyzing neural data from extended naturalistic designs, enabling researchers to improve prediction accuracy across diverse outcomes and obtain new insights into the temporal dynamics of neural responses.",

Acute alcohol\nconsumption reduces one’s ability to regulate anger by altering prefrontal cortical activity and\nsubsequent self-regulation. Past research suggests that brief stimulation of prefrontal cortical\nregions implicated in emotion regulation can reduce anger in sober individuals. Here, we\ninvestigated whether transcranial direct current stimulation over the right ventrolateral\nprefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) would reduce anger in intoxicated (vs sober) participants\nfollowing instructed emotion regulation. Two-hundred healthy participants consumed alcohol\nor no drink and received transcranial direct current stimulation or sham stimulation over the\nrVLPFC. During stimulation, participants engaged in cognitive reappraisal, distraction, and\nrumination to regulate recalled anger. As predicted, anger was lowest after engaging in\ndistraction, followed by cognitive reappraisal, and greatest after engaging in rumination.\nContrary to our predictions, we did not observe any main effects of alcohol, stimulation, or\ntheir interaction. However, exploratory analyses revealed anger following rumination was\nsignificantly reduced for intoxicated participants high in trait anger who received anodal\nstimulation, compared to sham stimulation. Alcohol also increased anger in people prone to\nangry rumination.

At present, however, there is limited access to high-quality neuroimaging data obtained from human infants. Addressing this gap, we present a dataset comprising electroencephalography responses from 42 human infants obtained in response to visual presentations of various objects. Leveraging a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm, 42 infants between 2 and 12 months of age viewed 200 images spanning 50 distinct objects, with as many repetitions as possible tailored to individual infants comfort. Our technical validation demonstrates discernible neural responses to both individual objects and categorical distinctions, affirming the dataset's robustness and utility for exploring the neural underpinnings of visual object recognition in infancy. Building upon insights gained from adult studies, our findings suggest that fast presentation paradigms hold promise for efficiently capturing electrophysiological responses to a large array of visual stimuli in human infants. This dataset represents a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of the developmental trajectory of object recognition and semantic knowledge in the early stages of human life.",

To provide confidential, private, and accessible mental health support to HCWs at Stony Brook Medicine we adapted and disseminated three evidence-based, digital, self-guided single-session interventions (SSIs). Through focus groups, interviews, and surveys, we collected HCW testimonials and feedback for adapting each SSI. Using an open-access, internet-based platform (i.e., Single Session Support Center website), we piloted each adapted SSI to investigate their individual and combined effects on hopelessness, agency, and subjective distress. Usage patterns were analyzed to assess engagement, effect sizes were calculated to determine SSI effectiveness, and acceptability was measured to determine real-world applicability. HCWs who completed a SSI (n = 91) reported significant improvements in agency and hopelessness, although differential effects emerged between SSIs. Acceptability results were high, across all three SSIs, indicating satisfaction with the self-guided program. Findings suggest digital, self-guided SSIs may be accessible, acceptable, and effective for providing HCWs with mental health support at any time, and from any location connected to the internet.",

          "abstract": "The science of consciousness requires multiple disciplines. There are complex philosophical questions that need to be understood, physical restrictions to consider, biological organisation that seems relevant to conscious beings, and phenomenological and psychological aspects that can not be studied under quantitative methods only. Today, however, scientific models of consciousness target a few aspects and little dialogue is found among them, even less among fields. In this article, we react to this current state of consciousness research and motivate a transdisciplinary, diverse and rigorous approach. We first introduce how the primacy of experience generates an explanatory paradox for mechanistic accounts and how to avoid it with a broader perspective. We follow by presenting tools such as mereological distinctions (constitution and causation), constraint-types of explanations and a sound axiomatic strategy for empirical and theoretical research. This critical and constructive reading motivates open dialogue and intellectual humility. We end our contribution by offering collaborative paths beyond neuroscience and calling for a fruitful exchange between different models of consciousness. This, we argue, might be the only way to solve and/or dissolve the \"problem\" of consciousness.",

Rather, the intervention recommended based on current prediction models is unrelated to the model and only shown to work on average across the population. Consequently, current clinical prediction models are not actionable. To be actionable, clinical prediction models must be based on causation not association, use counterfactuals to predict the individualised treatment effect incorporating the proposed intervention into the model, and provide dynamic not static predictions which react to changes in treatment.

Drawing inspiration from Procedural Content Generation (PCG) in gaming, we created a scalable and adaptable method for generating a variety of cognitive trials. Our exemplary task, influenced by traditional cognitive measures and digital puzzle games, involves moving colored blocks to form matches and clear the screen, and assesses planning. The task development process is detailed from designing mockups through to coding, making the task accessible online, and conducting internal testing. The procedural generation technique, used to automatically generate trials for the task, followed a generate-and-test methodology. The process began with the pseudo-random generation of puzzles, then a solving algorithm (breadth-first search) explored the generated configurations and retained only the solvable puzzles. This approach automatically produced many diverse trials for our task. We discuss future directions for PCG in cognitive assessment, including the potential exploration of advanced algorithms to further optimize trial generation. We also provide guidelines for digital cognitive task development and procedural trial generation in cognitive assessment to facilitate the generation of many trials for a broad range of applications, particularly for longitudinal implementations, including cognitive intervention studies and cognitive ecological momentary assessment.",

The use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) shows clinical potential for engaging patients outside the therapy room, but the utility for individuals who self-injure remains unclear. This prospective study evaluates self-reported benefits (e.g., increased self-insight and self-efficacy) and challenges (e.g., beep disturbances and emotional discomfort) associated with using EMA among individuals reporting past-month NSSI at treatment intake.\nMethods:  In this cohort study, 124 treatment-seeking adolescents and adults who self-injure completed baseline assessments and participated in a 28-day EMA protocol with six daily self-monitoring assessments of emotions, cognitions, and behaviors (including self-injury). After one month, participants received an EMA feedback survey assessing general and NSSI-specific increases in self-insight, self-efficacy, EMA compliance, beep disturbances, and emotional discomfort.\nResults: Of 124 participants, 98 completed the EMA survey (Response Rate = 79.03%). Average EMA compliance was 74.87% (SD = 18.78) and decreased linearly across time. Four in five patients (78.57%) reported experiencing at least one benefit. After using EMA, 32.65% reported increased general self-insight, 64.58% reported increased NSSI-specific self-insight, 9.28% reported increased general self-efficacy, and 41.67% reported improved NSSI-specific self-efficacy. Across the sample, 7.29% experienced EMA in treatment as tiring, stressful, at times overwhelming, and not enjoyable. Higher levels of emotional discomfort were significantly associated with lower compliance (r=-0.29, p=.004), higher beep disturbance (r=.37, p &lt; .001), and lower general self-insight (r=-0.28, p=.006).\nConclusion: Although the use of EMA in treatment may evoke emotional discomfort in patients, it may help promote NSSI-specific self-insight and self-efficacy outside the therapy room in patients who self-injure.",

This approach has proven important for discerning potentially causal environmental effects (i.e., father absence) from genetic confounds, but suffers from a methodological asymmetry that can undermine conclusions about the relative importance of genes and environments. The purpose of this study was to examine the relative importance of a set of 10 commonly examined, ostensibly environmental predictors of AAM in comparison to genetic variation captured by a polygenic score (PGS). Dominance analysis that included 2,048 regression models was applied to longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N = 3,645 Caucasian female participants) to determine the relative importance of these 11 predictors for explaining variance in AAM. Results showed that the PGS explained more variance in AAM in than any of the environmental predictors in every model and more than double the variance of all the environmental predictors combined. Notably, father absence explained the third-most variance, falling behind BMI and prenatal smoking. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of genetically informed research on father absence/AAM and how the asymmetry between methods of measuring genes and environment in these studies can impact the conclusions drawn.",

          "abstract": "Over the last 20 years, personality development has become one of the most widely studied topics in personality science. However, evidence on normative and event-related personality development stems almost exclusively from Western countries, providing limited insight into the cross-cultural generalizability of personality trait changes. To address this limitation, we used data from the Africa Long Life Study to examine personality development in young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa over 1 to 2 years (N = 2,382). We found that the cross-cultural Big Two personality traits – Agency and Communion – were moderately rank-order stable over 1 year, with test-retest correlations of r = .38 to r = .55. In contrast to our expectations, Agency and Communion significantly decreased across the study period. Finally, using open-ended questions, we investigated the most important life changes of our participants and examined their associations with personality trait changes. We found that personality trait levels predicted the occurrence and perception of life events, while the occurrence and perception of life events, in turn, predicted personality trait changes. Overall, our findings were partly in line with but also partly diverging from findings on personality development from Western countries. This suggests that insights into personality development cannot automatically be generalized across cultural contexts but that a careful examination of which personality development phenomena are universal and which are culture-specific is warranted. Our study provides initial indications that environment-driven personality trait changes may be a mechanism of personality development that generalizes across cultural contexts.",

Methodologically, we highlight that the differences in the RV become very small when comparing studies with different large (e.g., over 500) samples.

          "abstract": "Learning multiple tasks in succession is a challenge for artificial and biological agents alike. However, it is often claimed that artificial agents fail to learn new tasks without overwriting previous ones, while humans succeed. Here, using a canonical sequential rule-learning task in which learners acquire Task~A, then learn Task~B, and are finally re-tested on Task~A, we see conserved patterns of transfer and interference in humans and neural networks. When successive tasks are similar (compared to dissimilar), both types of learner benefit more from transferring prior knowledge to Task~B, but demonstrate greater interference when retested on Task~A. Examining the hidden representations in neural networks, we observe this interference arises because networks utilise their existing solutions to accelerate learning of similar tasks, whilst corrupting those solutions for their previous use. In humans, we also observe striking individual differences where some participants (`lumpers') show interference after sequentially learning two similar tasks, while others (`splitters') avoid interference. These two strategies are associated with opposite patterns of performance benefits: `lumpers' are better at learning shared structure across stimuli and generalising to new settings, while `splitters' are better at remembering unique features of the stimuli. By varying the training regime for neural networks (`rich' versus `lazy'), we can recreate these differences, pushing networks towards low-dimensional representations which capitalise on shared structure, or high-dimensional representations maximising discrimination between inputs. Overall, our findings reveal shared computational principles relating transfer and interference in both systems, governed by global factors like task similarity and individual differences in structuring knowledge.",

In recent years, interest in quantifying psychology using text described by people and state-of-the-art natural language processing methods, such as BERT, has increased. In this study, short open-ended free texts were collected from participants asking about their thoughts (general thoughts and those about themselves and others) and behaviors in three challenging situations. Then, a regression model was developed to predict the self-compassion scores (i.e., SCS and CEAS) from free texts with BERT. The self-compassion scores quantified by free texts and BERT highly correlated with the SCS score and certain criterion-related validity. Furthermore, the results suggest that thoughts, behaviors, and levels of self-compassion differ across situations and that the SCS score is related to both cognition (thoughts) and behaviors. The method of psychological quantification using free text may be less prone to priming or bias than measurement using questionnaires. Thus, future studies are encouraged to apply this natural-language-based approach to more diverse samples and other psychological constructs.",

A total of 424 sources were included in this first comprehensive scoping review on this topic, giving an overview of all applications and developments of multiverse-style data-analytic methods. The constant rise in applications of these methods in diverse scientific disciplines spurred developments in all their aspects. Inconsistencies could be found in terminology and, analysis and reporting of results of multiverse-style methods. Although preregistration still falls short, analysis code was available in almost half of all included sources. Concluding recommendations on good practice might further increase the standardisation and transparency of the methodology and provide a first guideline for multiverse-style methods.",

          "abstract": "People show significant individual differences in their ability to recognise emotions. These differences are particularly pronounced in ageing, with dementia, after brain lesions and as a function of mental health factors, such as depression. Older people, for example, tend to have poorer recognition of negative emotions, such as anger, fear and sadness, but better recognition of positive emotions, such as happiness. This ‘positivity bias’ has been suggested to support mental well-being in ageing, but has also been found in association with cognitive decline and brain lesions. Here, we investigated the brain correlates of increased positivity bias with age. We used multimodal brain imaging in a large, population-derived cohort across the adult lifespan, together with a standard emotion recognition task using facial expressions. We first replicated previous behavioural findings showing increased perceptual thresholds in older adults for detecting negative emotion, but reduced threshold for positive emotion, even after accounting for general face recognition abilities. This positivity bias was strongly associated with lower cognitive performance in older people, but not with (non-clinical) depressive symptoms. This age-related bias was associated with reduced grey matter volume in bilateral anterior hippocampus-amygdala. Moreover, resting-state functional connectivity between these regions and orbitofrontal regions was greater with increased positivity bias. Together, our results suggest that the age-related positivity bias is associated with cognitive decline and structural and functional brain differences. Similar to neurodegenerative conditions, a positivity bias in emotion recognition may reflect an early marker of neurodegeneration, which could be confirmed in longitudinal studies.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitions role in youth antisocial phenotypes of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (i.e., lack of remorse, guilt, and empathy) from conduct problems (CP; i.e., antisocial patterns of disruptive and aggressive behaviors) has been a debated topic. Recent evidence points to the need for more nuance in parsing different inhibitory processes. Specifically, selective control (i.e., selectively inhibiting a prepotent response for an alternative to specific stimuli) rather than passive control (i.e., non-response action restraint) has been linked, independent of CP, to affective processing deficits in CU traits. However, it is not known whether CU traits relate to a general difficulty with cognitive demands or a specific impairment in selective control. \nMethods: The present study tested whether CU traits were differentially related to difficulties in passive versus selective control, while accounting for CP. The design for this test leveraged a randomized parallel-arm design with test and control groups. Data from 85 participants aged 12-14 (female 47%) were analyzed using mixed effects analysis accounting for individual variance across repeated measures.\nResults: CU traits were associated with better passive control performance but worse selective control performance, whereas CP were unrelated to these trials when including CU traits. These findings were supported across individual trial type accuracy and reaction time, as well as contrasts between trials (e.g., selective &gt; passive). Follow-up analysis suggested that CU traits were related to a more rigid cognitive style during selective control trials only.  \nConclusions: This study provides additional evidence of a specific cognitive limitation in selective control that differentiates CU traits from CP. Additionally, initial evidence on cognitive strategy during selective control may implicate difficulties with cognitive resources in how cognitive information is processed that aligns with work on adult psychopathy. Thus, selective control may be an important feature for understanding antisocial etiological pathways.",

          "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly common in the psychology and neuroscience literature to use Bayes factors to provide evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. The most common approach reports a Bayes factor that compares the null hypothesis to a “default” alternative. This approach can show that the data is more likely to have been generated under the null hypothesis than under the specific alternative tested, but it cannot provide evidence for the absence of an effect. In fact, analyses using default alternatives can return evidence in favor of the null hypothesis when the data is consistent with medium to large effects. I show that common interpretations of these Bayes factor analyses are misleading, and I provide examples and simulations that help to understand what a Bayes factor in favor of the null does and does not tell us. I argue that Bayes factors have no special ability to help us understand null effects when compared to frequentist methods such as equivalence testing and confidence intervals.",

Here, we present the cross-sectional baseline results from the analysis of associations between symptom severity and regional gray matter volumes We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess associations between symptom severity and regional gray matter volumes in 300 participants on sick leave due to ED. Symptom severity was measured using the total score of the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ), and the subscales Physical exhaustion, Listlessness, Cognitive weariness and Tension. All analyses were adjusted for age, intracranial volume, salary, education and sick leave duration. Total SMBQ scores and Physical exhaustion were negatively associated with gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex, and right insular cortex. Listlessness was negatively associated with gray matter volume in the bilateral hippocampi, right insular cortex, left cingulate cortex and right middle temporal gyrus. These associations remained significant after adjusting for symptoms of depression, except for the insular cortex. No significant associations were observed for Cognitive weariness or Tension. These results support a link between symptom severity and gray matter alterations of brain circuits involved in stress in ED and suggest that these effects may extend beyond those attributable to depressive symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Despite growing popularity and scientific interest in meditation retreats, their effects on mental health and their safety remain poorly understood. Accordingly, we aimed to study their salutary and adverse effects on mental health. Method: We conducted a preregistered prospective intervention study among 89 adults who registered for 6-day insight mindfulness meditation retreats and 46 matched controls (Mage(SDage) = 33.75(9.50), 56.3% female). Controls were selected from a pool of 543 people recruited from the same community of meditators as retreat participants and matched to retreat participants on age and lifetime meditation experience. Participants completed measures of well-being (WHO-5), affect (I-PANAS-SF), emotion regulation (DERS-16), repetitive negative thinking (PTQ), brooding rumination (RRS-B), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (OASIS) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up. Results: Retreat participants demonstrated significant improvements in well-being, negative affect, perseverative thinking, brooding rumination, and depression symptoms at follow-up compared to matched controls (η² range = .04–.08, ps &lt; .05). Importantly, the % of participants exhibiting statistically reliable deterioration in mental health outcomes were equal or lower among retreat participants than among matched controls in the entire sample, as well as in a sub-sample with clinically elevated depression and/or anxiety (ORs &lt; 1). Conclusions: A 6-day mindfulness meditation retreat can produce mental health benefits on par with effect sizes of longer 8-week mindfulness-based programs. Findings challenge concerns about adverse effects of intensive high-dose meditation training and suggest that it may be a safe and effective intervention modality, even for clinically vulnerable adults struggling with depression and anxiety.",

          "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has long been associated with economic and social decision-making in neuroimaging studies. Several debates question whether different ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) regions have specific functions or whether there is a gradient supporting social and non-social cognition. Here, we tested an unusually large sample of rare participants with focal damage to mPFC (N = 33), individuals with lesions elsewhere (N = 17), and healthy controls (N = 71) (total N = 121). Participants completed a temporal discounting task to estimate their baseline discounting preferences before learning the preferences of two other people, one who was more temporally impulsive and one more patient. We used Bayesian computational models to estimate baseline discounting and susceptibility to social influence after learning others’ economic preferences. mPFC damage increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls and increased overall susceptibility to social influence compared to those with lesions elsewhere. Importantly, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) of computational parameters showed that this heightened susceptibility to social influence was attributed specifically to damage to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, area 9; permutationbased threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) p &lt; 0.025). In contrast, lesions in the vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum were associated with a preference for seeking more immediate rewards (permutation-based TFCE p &lt; 0.05). We show that the dmPFC is causally implicated in susceptibility to social influence, with distinct ventral portions of mPFC involved in temporal discounting. These findings provide causal evidence for sub-regions of the mPFC underpinning fundamental social and cognitive processes.",

Training curricula that ‘divide and conquer’ by presenting one cue at a time facilitate later performance on test trials involving multiple cues. We show that this can be explained by a boundedly rational learning model in which credit is (erroneously) assigned to each input independent of every other. We use this model to generate new ‘skewed distribution’ multi-cue curricula that should, and should not, successfully promote human learning.

Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. \n\nResults: Five themes were generated. The first two focused on factors contributing to the rise in self-diagnosis: (1) Self-diagnosis stems from an inherent need to be understood and (2) Access to diagnostic language has proliferated. The latter three focused on the impact of self-diagnosis on therapy: (3) Self-diagnosis is meaningful therapeutic material; (4) When adolescents feel validated, self-diagnosis often fades over time; and (5) Self-diagnosis becomes a barrier to change when it is inflexible.\n\nDiscussion: The study indicates that, in most cases, clinicians do not consider self-diagnosis as problematic and report it can sometimes help understand the adolescent’s concerns. However, our study also supports concerns about harm to the individual when self-diagnosis is inflexible, and how self-diagnosis could be harmful on a population level if it trivialises psychiatric language and suffering. These findings suggest the need for careful management of self-diagnosis in clinical settings and addressing public discourse that promotes self-diagnosis.",

Recent research has identified IU as a causal contributor to pervasive decision difficulties (indecisiveness). Given that IU and indecisiveness occur across mental disorders, understanding whether IU's causal role in indecisiveness extends to clinical populations is critical. This study therefore tested the effect of IU on indecisiveness in a clinical sample.\nMethods: In this pre-registered experiment, N = 154 individuals with formally diagnosed obsessive-compulsive and/or anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to a condition aimed at either increasing or decreasing IU. Subsequently, participants reported their current levels of (situational) IU and, critically, their indecisiveness regarding two personally relevant decisions.\nResults: The experimental manipulation successfully altered IU levels. Participants with heightened IU exhibited more indecisiveness compared to those with reduced IU, but this effect occurred only indirectly through situational IU. The observed effect sizes were small.\nLimitations: Compared to preceding research, effect sizes were small and the effect of IU on indecisiveness only manifested itself indirectly. More robust interventions may be necessary to induce more pronounced changes in IU within clinical populations. The reliance on a heterogeneous sample with various diagnoses limits the disorder-specificity of the findings.\nConclusions: These results extend the causal role of IU in indecisiveness to mental disorders. The findings suggest IU as a potential approach for addressing problematic indecisiveness.",

Among non-forensic personality features, everyday sadism is said to reflect the most aversive one. A plethora of studies found males to score higher on average in everyday sadism.

Using four samples (ntotal = 2,909 [70% female]), we tested for gender-related measurement invariance of all currently available everyday sadism self-report measures. We found partial scalar invariance for the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies (regardless of the inclusion of a method factor), scalar invariance for the Assessment of Sadistic Personality (irrespective of the inclusion of a method factor) and the Comprehensive Assessment of Sadistic Tendencies, and partial metric invariance for the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale. The everyday sadism subscale from the Short Dark Tetrad did not even exhibit configural invariance; the respective subscale from the Mixed Short Dark Tetrad yielded partial scalar invariance only when a method factor was included. These findings have important implications for gender-specific expressions of everyday sadism that need to be considered in scale development and the interpretations of test scores.",

          "abstract": "Understanding fractions is a major hurdle for many students. A key aspect of fraction comprehension\nis the ability to evaluate their numerical magnitude. Here, we use a number-to-line task, where\nstudents point to the location of a number on a graduated line, to characterize errors in fraction\ncomprehension. A total of ~26,000 French pupils from 6th to 10th grade were tested. Error rates were\nhigh, almost 80% in 6th grade and 45% in 10th grade. Errors could be classified into seven dominant\npatterns, whose frequency varied by grade level and individual performance. Younger and\nlower-performing children mostly confused fractions with decimals. Older and higher-performing\n𝑎\n𝑏\nchildren often confused a fraction 𝑏 and its inverse 𝑎 . All grades also confused the roles of the\nnumerator and the denominator. We propose a theoretical framework suggesting that errors arise as\nbugs in the execution of one of two main strategies: children converting the fraction into a decimal,\nor partitioning the line into units and counting them. This model explains the observed error patterns\nas stemming from inappropriate strategy selection, flawed execution, or incorrect corrective steps\ndue to flawed execution. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the various traps that\nstudents face when interpreting a fraction’s magnitude, the frequency of these errors, and their\nsequential order.",

          "abstract": "Despite the complexity of real-world environments, natural vision is seamlessly efficient. To explain this efficiency, researchers often use predictive processing frameworks, in which perceptual efficiency is determined by the match between the visual input and internal models of what the world should look like. In natural scene processing, predictions derived from our internal models of a scene should play a particularly important role, given the highly reliable statistical structure of our environment. Despite their importance for scene perception, we still do not fully understand what is contained in our internal models of the environment. Here, we argue that the current literature on scene perception disproportionately focuses on an experimental approach that tries to infer the contents of internal models from arbitrary, experimenter-driven manipulations in stimulus characteristics. To make progress, additional participant-driven approaches are needed: Rather than solely relying on manipulating the input to the visual system, researchers should adopt a complementary approach focusing on participants' descriptions of what they believe constitutes a typical scene. Such descriptions promise to capture the contents of internal models in more unconstrained ways on the level of individual participants. Critically, the descriptions of internal models can in turn be used to predict the efficiency of scene perception. We highlight recent studies on memory and perception using innovative methodologies like line drawings to characterize internal representations. These emerging methods show that it is now time to also study natural scene perception from a different angle – starting with a characterization of individual’s expectations about the world.",

          "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a powerful clinical tool for treating neuropsychiatric conditions, yet our understanding of how TMS modulates neural circuits in the human brain remains limited. While decades of research have established the therapeutic efficacy of TMS, fundamental questions persist about the spatial and temporal dynamics of TMS effects, including which brain regions are activated and modulated, how long neural changes persist, and the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect. Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and intracranial electroencephalography (TMS-iEEG) can fill this gap by providing important insights into how the human brain responds to non-invasive stimulation. TMS-iEEG enables investigation of both local cortical responses and network-level propagation with millisecond temporal resolution and precise spatial localization. This chapter provides an overview for conducting TMS-iEEG experiments. We first detail phantom validation procedures for evaluating potential heating, electrode displacement, and induced currents. We then outline safety monitoring protocols for human participants, including continuous electrophysiological monitoring for epileptiform activity. Finally, we outline procedures to perform TMS-iEEG experiments – from equipment setup through data collection and analysis. When properly implemented, TMS-iEEG can reveal both immediate local effects and network-level responses to TMS that are not accessible through conventional recording approaches, providing critical insights into the mechanisms of brain stimulation.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this short report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. Overall, we show that just as for correlational strength, observed standardized group differences are attenuated as a function of sqrt{reliability} for each measure. This has important implications for biomarker discovery, clinical translation, and other areas of group differences research that inform policy and real-world applications.",

Our process-based model is illustrated by reproducing inter-individual diﬀerences in a developmental study of noun comprehension (Garrison et al., 2020). In our modeling framework, numerical values of model parameters map onto specific cognitive processes (e.g., attention or working memory) involved in gaze control.

While previous research has primarily focused on perception (vision, audition), this study explores the application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model visual working memory through a 2-back task. Participants viewed sequences of images and identified whether each image was seen two steps back in the sequence. We trained Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks on this task using pixel-level representations of complex images from the ImageNet database and utilized the learned representations to predict functional brain activity recorded from subjects performing the 2-back task designed by the Human Connectome Project. Results demonstrate that ANNs can perform the 2-back task with high accuracy, and sparse attention mechanisms were beneficial for a fixed network capacity. The artificial representations of images effectively encoded individual brain activity during 2-back trials. High encoding accuracy was consistently observed in regions such as the dorsal and visual dorsal streams, and frontal cortices.",

Whilst evidence indicates multiple factors contribute to dissociative experiences, a multifactorial explanation of increased risk for dissociation has yet to be achieved. Methods: We used multiple regression to investigate the relative influence of five plausible risk factors (childhood trauma, loneliness, marginalisation, socio-economic status, and everyday stress), and machine learning to generate tentative high-risk profiles for ‘felt sense of anomaly’ dissociation (FSA-dissociation) using cross-sectional online survey data from 2384 UK-based 16- to 25-year-olds. Results: Multiple regression indicated that four risk factors significantly contributed to FSA-dissociation, with relative order of contribution: everyday stress, childhood trauma, loneliness and marginalisation. Exploratory analysis using machine learning suggested dissociation results from a complex interplay between interpersonal, contextual, and intrapersonal pressures: alongside marginalisation and childhood trauma, negative self-concept and depression were important in younger (16–20 years), and anxiety and maladaptive emotion regulation in older (21–25 years) respondents. Conclusions: Validation of these findings could inform clinical assessment, and prevention and outreach efforts, improving the under-recognition of dissociation in mainstream services.",

          "abstract": "Irritability and anhedonia are two prevalent, co-occurring, and impairing symptoms of major depression that are proposed to result from dysfunctions in reward processing. While irritability is associated with heightened sensitivity to reward receipt, anhedonia is linked to blunted sensitivity to reward receipt. Given these supposed paradoxical effects on reward sensitivity, it is noteworthy that no studies have examined how both symptoms interact to affect reward sensitivity. In a community sample of young adults (N=73, Mage=21.21±2.27, 56.16% females), we evaluated the interacting effects of dimensionally-assessed irritability and anhedonia symptoms on neural (i.e., event-related potentials and time-frequency) measures of reward and loss sensitivity during the Doors task, a well-known reward paradigm. We used univariate and multivariate (based on generalized eigendecomposition) approaches to isolate patterns of delta and theta activity in response to reward and loss. General linear models tested the unique and interacting effects of irritability and anhedonia on EEG measures of reward sensitivity (Feedback-Related Negativity [FRN], Reward Positivity [RewP], theta, and delta power). Results revealed a significant interaction effect of irritability and anhedonia on the FRN to loss (R2=.13, F(3, 69)=3.35, β=-.03, p&lt;.01). Specifically, anhedonia was associated with larger (i.e., more negative) FRN to loss only in the presence of high irritability. At low levels of irritability, anhedonia was associated with smaller (i.e., more positive) FRN to loss. We also found that anhedonia was associated with reduced theta power to win (R2=.20, F(3, 69)= 5.89, β=-.01, p&lt;.01) at mean and high irritability levels. These effects remained significant when controlling for broader depressive symptoms, gender, and income. These findings provide preliminary evidence of an interactive effect of anhedonia and irritability on neural sensitivity to both reward and loss in individuals without clinical levels of symptoms. Our results highlight the importance of considering symptom interactions to better understand reward-related mechanisms in depression.",

We explored the neural origin of this effect, having 38 observers perform target localization and more difficult shape identification, while simultaneously recording EEG. The results showed a strong feature synergy effect over a wide range of feature contrasts in both tasks, which was accompanied by a strongly reduced posterior P2 amplitude in a time window from 240 to 280 ms after stimulus onset (TOI-1) and to a lesser extent by a reduction of P3 in a later time window from 320 to 380 ms (TOI-2), both in a cluster of 13 adjacent electrodes from the left, central and right occipital and central parietal-occipital lobes. Only a subset of electrodes responded to increased target saliency due to higher feature contrasts, while all electrodes consistently showed the strongest amplitude reduction for the double-cue condition. In TOI-1, ERP amplitudes were lower for localization than for shape identification at the same feature contrasts, but the effect was reversed in TOI-2, where significant double-cue effects mainly concerned shape identification. The task dependence of the P2 reduction and the specificity of the P3 double-cue effects for the more demanding shape identification task indicate that fewer resources need to be allocated to a given task when features are combined. This suggests an origin in sites where features and shapes are processed under attentional control.",

          "abstract": "Sudden changes are common in clinical trajectories, yet a theoretical framework to understand the underlying mechanisms is still lacking. In this article, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing the mechanisms and features of four distinct types of transitions drawn from complex dynamic system research: bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping), noise-induced tipping (N-tipping), rate-induced tipping (R-tipping), and noise-induced diffusion (N-diffusion). Those types of transitions differ in the main cause of the change and data characteristics. To illustrate their application to clinical phenomena, we present two real-life scenarios using simulated time series. These examples demonstrate how theoretical types of change may connect to clinical phenomena and highlight how different types of transitions can co-occur in various subsystems. In the first example, we show that the mood system and the momentary affect system of a patient with sudden loss may show B-tipping and N-diffusion at the same time; in the second example, we show that increasing the stimulus strengthening speed in exposure therapy may lead to R-tipping, while the therapeutic decision in this context may be caused by N-tipping. Finally, we lay out possible pathways for determining the appropriate type of transition for future empirical research, highlighting methods both from dynamic system research and special opportunities for research in clinical psychology.",

Probabilistic reversal learning involves updating beliefs about rewards when contingencies change. Obsessions and paranoia have been linked to excessive switching behaviors during reversal learning, although some report perseveration in patients with OCD and those with schizophrenia. Here, we analyze data gathered from the general population to assess the associations between obsessions, paranoia, and PRL task performance. Using a novel computational method – Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Modeling combined with a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter – we distinguish the impacts of paranoia and obsession on reversal learning – despite their significant correlation. We find that win-switching arises in paranoia from deficits in learning about uncertainty in the global task structure, whereas excessive switching in OCD arises from challenges in learning about uncertainty at the local choice level.",

We obtained an equation relating the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time and the time he or she is depressed, and described the importance of considering the time when a person becomes depressed. Next, we derived an equation giving the time of being depressed and showed that the time of being depressed has an exponential distribution.

          "authors": "Andrea Adriano",
          "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying numerosity perception remain debated, with theories proposing either a dedicated system for segmented items or reliance on low-level features such as spatial frequency (SF) and texture-density. Numerosity adaptation—where exposure to an array of objects shifts the perceived numerosity of a subsequently presented array—has been considered strong evidence for a dedicated numerosity-processing system. However, a recent hypothesis suggests that this effect results from filtering previously processed information rather than genuine numerosity adaptation. To clarify the visual features driving this phenomenon, we employed a novel adaptation paradigm in which participants were exposed to arrays of illusory-contours (ICs) items before performing a comparison task on arrays of real dots. ICs arrays, generated using the Ehrenstein-illusion, allowed us to disentangle numerosity adaptation from texture-density/SF or filtering effects. Because ICs-numerosity in the Ehrenstein grid is negatively correlated with texture-density/SF (e.g., fewer ICs cause greater power in low-SFs), the texture-density hypothesis predicts a reduction in the point of subjective equality (PSE) after adaptation, whereas the filtering hypothesis predicts no effect. Our results showed a significant increase in PSE following adaptation, suggesting that adaptation was driven by the number of ICs in the adapting arrays rather than by SF. Moreover, the strong difference between control and adaptation conditions indicates that adaptation was not merely due to filtering. In sum, our findings demonstrate that numerosity adaptation is driven by item quantity, irrespective of stimulus type, providing further support for a numerosity-selective mechanism and challenging theories based solely on low-level visual features or filtering.",

We present data from a large survey of the Danish population, showing that some types of supernatural beliefs are somewhat widespread in Denmark (with some beliefs, e.g. angels, being much more prevalent than others, e.g. vampires), but much less so than in Sweden and in particular the USA. Supernatural beliefs are non-randomly distributed and fall into meaningful clusters, including clusters of spiritualism and magical thinking. Our analysis shows a strong correlation between biological sex and belief (with women being more likely to believe in the supernatural, including religious items) and a small, negative correlation between educational attainment level and belief. The findings are consistent with the assumption that while people may be naturally predisposed for belief in supernatural agency, such belief can be facilitated or counteracted by cultural structures.",

Its two foundational texts have been cited almost 25,000 times and it has spurred theoretical, empirical, and applied research across a wide array of topics. Despite its successes, I will argue in this talk that a number of its theoretical and meta-theoretical commitments and the underdetermination of some of its core tenets hold it back. Specifically, I will outline 5 related issues in current statements, understandings, and/or operationalizations of the theory: (1) an overemphasis on (and sometimes conflation of) groups as categories; (2) a general ambiguity with regard to the nature of the stimuli being categorized; (3) an underappreciation of the distinction between categories and entities; (4) a relative absence of recursive embedding in conceptions of the self and of the relations between self and other; and (5) the implausibility (and perhaps the computational intractability) of meta-contrast as a basis for category differentiation. I will conclude the talk with a discussion of ways in which these challenges can be addressed, with the goal of strengthening Self-Categorization Theory and extending its scope into the future.",

The current project was designed to address these gaps by examining the impact of taking a cycle-based approach to nutrition and exercise on these outcomes in a sample of women who are users of the 28 Wellness Cycle Based Wellness application. In particular, we examined whether using the cycle-based nutrition and fitness guidance offered by the 28 app leads to improvements in women’s mental and physical health.

          "abstract": "Models like the drift diffusion model have been highly influential in explaining decision-making as a tug-of-war process, where evidence for competing options accumulates until a threshold is reached. While these models capture several key aspects of decision-making, they have difficulty accounting for others, including the influence of individual option values on choice speed and the subjective cost of choosing, as well as the fact that that choice competition is itself malleable. This chapter argues for a broader framework that moves beyond a strict tug-of-war approach, by incorporating both independent and competitive evidence accumulation. We show that adopting this alternate framework not only better accounts for the evaluative processes underlying choice (e.g., which option is best), but also how the same evaluations can be applied towards decisions about how good one’s options are on the whole; whether and when to make a choice; and how many options to choose.",

Since special relativity provides the groundwork for the general theory of relativity by providing the building blocks consisting of local Lorentz reference frames, the imaginative, cognitive component found in the relativity of simultaneity is key to understanding general relativity as well.

          "abstract": "Background: Residual cognitive complaints are frequently observed in remitted depressed individuals (RMD), which can impair full recovery and increase the likelihood of recurrent episodes of depression. Cognitive control training has shown potential as a preventative intervention in RMD with small to moderate effect sizes, but substantial heterogeneity in effects between individuals exists.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to identify individual characteristics associated with treatment response to CCT in RMD participants using machine learning models.\n\nMethods: A sample of 227 RMD participants underwent a CCT regimen of at least 10 sessions. Three machine-learning models were evaluated: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, alongside one random classifier benchmark. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were computed. The importance of individual features in predicting preventative effects was assessed using SHAP values.\n\nResult: All models demonstrated low performance, despite different machine learning methodologies and robust analyses. The random forest model scored the highest performance, although this was still considered low (accuracy: 0.52; AUC-ROC: 0.46). Exploratory feature importance analysis revealed that age, sense of well-being, and life satisfaction were important variables in the models, while current use of psychotherapy, number of prior depressive episodes, and a history of inpatient treatment were not.\n\nConclusion: All models performed poorly, indicating that baseline characteristics did not confidently predict CCT preventative effects in this RMD sample. Exploratory feature analysis proposed some variables that increase the likelihood of benefiting from CCT, as well as  indicated that most demographical variables did not strongly affect treatment effects, suggesting that CCT may be suitable for a broad range of RMD individuals.",

          "abstract": "Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) studies linked measures of spectral power under rest and fluid intelligence; however, subsequent high-powered studies challenged this relationship. The present study aimed to address previous limitations (low statistical power, lack of preregistration) and investigate the predictability of intelligence measures from resting-state EEG in the CoScience data set (N = 772). Support vector regressions were applied to analyze eight minutes of resting-state EEG with eyes open and closed before and after unrelated tasks. The decoding performance between the spectral power of 59 EEG channels within 30 frequency bins and fluid and crystallized intelligence, was evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation. We could not identify any meaningful associations between resting-state EEG spectral power and either fluid or crystallized intelligence. However, we replicated the previously reported association between state sleepiness and theta power, attesting to the integrity of the CoScience data set. Furthermore, the decomposition of the EEG signal into its periodic and aperiodic components revealed that the aperiodic offset parameter is significantly correlated with state sleepiness, emphasizing the relevance of aperiodic signal components in understanding states of alertness versus sleepiness.",

          "abstract": "Polygenic score (PGS) predictions of educational achievement are sizeable at population level. They capture so-called ‘direct’ genetic effects that are independent of environmental confounding, but also ‘indirect’ genetic effects due to gene-environment correlations, assortative mating, and population stratification. Indirect genetic effects complicate the interpretation and application of PGS predictions.  Here, we systematically charted the variability of PGS predictions in N=8,115 dizygotic twins from UK, US, Swedish, and German samples aged 7 to 19 years. \n\nPopulation-level PGS predictions of educational achievement ranged from beta =.16 to .37 across ages and countries. Indirect genetic effects due to environmental confounding accounted for 10% to 65% of the population-level PGS predictions, with family socioeconomic status explaining 29-100% of these indirect genetic effects. Variability in direct and indirect genetic effects was largely unsystematic across countries’ school systems (multi-tiered vs. comprehensive) and children’s ages. Therefore, interpretations of indirect genetic effects on educational achievement remain, at present, speculative.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conduct problems trajectory studies suggest their development is highly heterogeneous and that different trajectories may be uniquely associated with different risk factors and outcomes. Yet studies combining trajectory modelling and a varied set of genetic and early-life risk factors, as well as adult outcomes, are scarce. \n\nMethods: We analysed data from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), a longitudinal UK twin cohort (N=18,993). Conduct problems were measured using parent reports of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) conduct problems subscale at four time points between ages 4 and 12. Trajectories were identified using growth mixture modelling. We then explored associations between trajectory class membership and genetic and early-life factors (age 4), and adult life and clinical outcomes (age 26). \n\nResults: Four conduct problem trajectories were identified: Low Stable (n=15,304, 81%), Childhood-Limited (n= 1,395, 7%), Childhood-Increasing (n=1,791, 9%) and Persistent (n=503, 3%). Associations with risk factors followed a stepped pattern with individuals in the Persistent class reporting higher genetic liability and early-life risk. Higher genetic vulnerability to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder distinguished between the Low Stable and all other classes. Higher externalising problems polygenic score, negative family environment and hyperactivity/inattention, distinguished between all classes, except the Childhood-Increasing and the Childhood-Decreasing ones. Children experiencing conduct problems in childhood were at higher risk for reporting poorer current and lifetime mental and physical health outcomes, lower educational attainment and financial difficulties.\n\nConclusions: Children experiencing conduct problems face multiple risk factors that should be addressed. Previously identified risk factors (i.e. negative family environment, hyperactivity/inattention), continued to differentiate between all classes after accounting for various psychiatric polygenic scores, validating existing interventions targeting these factors. Childhood conduct problems were associated with poor outcomes in adulthood, emphasising the need to develop interventions identifying those at risk early.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "So far, we have used stochastic differential equations to explain the process that leads to feelings and thoughts that assume a Wiener process. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is feeling at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using exponential distribution (exponential process) and Poisson process. We derived the stochastic differential equation given for the time when the person is not depressed, and showed that the time when the person is not depressed is an exponential distribution (exponential process). We also derived an exponential distribution (exponential process) for the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time, and showed that the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time is a Poisson process. Based on these results, we explained the relationship between the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time and the time when he or she is not depressed. We also discussed the connection with similarity curve and other results in the previously discussed paper. Finally, he stated that placing oneself in an environment or state where one is less likely to become depressed is a way to cope with depression.",

Yet, differential diagnosis is challenging and limited to clinical interviews and self-report symptom questionnaires. We predicted that obsessions and paranoia would be associated with distinct patterns of behavior in our well-established probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task. Probabilistic reversal learning involves updating beliefs about rewards when contingencies change. Obsessions and paranoia have been linked to excessive switching behaviors during reversal learning, although some report perseveration in patients with OCD and those with schizophrenia. Here, we analyze data gathered from the general population to assess the associations between obsessions, paranoia, and PRL task performance. Using a novel computational method – Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Modeling combined with a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter – we distinguish the impacts of paranoia and obsession on reversal learning – despite their significant correlation. We find that win-switching arises in paranoia from deficits in learning about uncertainty in the global task structure, whereas excessive switching in OCD arises from challenges in learning about uncertainty at the local choice level.",

Drawing on theories of labour market segmentation, time availability and gender roles, this study examines gender differences in pandemic-related changes in job-related training. Using panel data from the German National Educational Panel Study (2018–2022, N=7,857), results from fixed-effects regressions indicate an overall decline in training participation. Contrary to the expectations, mothers’ participation did not decline more than that of fathers and childless women and men. For all groups, declines in training were partly attributed to work-related changes and the regional severity of COVID-19, but for parents these declines were more closely linked to changes in private and family life. The findings highlight the complex impact of demand- and supply-side factors influencing job-related training and show that gender disparities in unpaid work did not translate into wider training gaps.",

          "authors": "Yassine Khoudja; Marcel Lubbers; Ines Schäfer",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the evolving relationship between attitudes toward immigration and redistribution in Europe. While much of the existing literature suggests a positive correlation between support for immigration and redistribution, recent developments—such as the rise of political parties combining anti-immigration rhetoric with pro-redistribution platforms—challenge this assumption. Moreover, little is known about how these attitudinal combinations have changed over time and how they relate to individuals’ social structural positions. Using data from the European Social Survey (2002–2020), we investigate how the relationship between attitudes toward immigration and redistribution has shifted across European countries, and the extent to which these shifts are anchored in the changing social stratification of political attitudes. Our results show that, in 2002, the correlation between pro-immigration and pro-redistribution attitudes was negative, but by 2020, it had shifted to near zero. This shift is mainly driven by an increase in the share of individuals who support both immigration and redistribution, especially in Northern and Western European countries since 2012. In contrast, groups rejecting both immigration and redistribution, or rejecting immigration while supporting redistribution have not substantially expanded. We further show that these changes are partly due to changing educational and occupational divides. These findings highlight the shifting relationship between the cultural and economic dimension of political conflict in Europe, and underline the importance of social structural transformations, particularly the educational expansion, in re-shaping the demand-side of political dynamics. More generally, the study calls for a stronger focus on analyzing the intersection of attitudes across different domains and on understanding how social-structural transformations shape attitudes towards immigration and support for the welfare state.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the ethical dimensions of health communication during the 2022 mpox outbreak, focusing on the interplay between social media and public health officials in shaping stakeholder responses. Based on semi-structured interviews, findings reveal that social media played a crucial role in information dissemination for months during the crisis, while public health officials were slow to offer clear guidance. While social media empowers advocacy and the sharing of personal stories, it also raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding how vulnerable communities may become entangled in an economy of suffering, where their experiences of pain are validated and interpreted by stakeholders through a selective mechanism rooted in cultural codes and power dynamics. Moreover, systemic inequities render the suffering of marginalized groups, particularly those with intersecting identities, less visible and intensify the consequences of inadequate outreach. This creates a disparity where the suffering of those in more privileged positions is more readily recognized and addressed. The theoretical advancement lies in reconceptualizing the platformization of pain to include narrative resistance, highlighting that marginalized groups actively contest and reshape suffering narratives rather than passively experience them. This expanded framework also deepens the concept of an economy of suffering by integrating hermeneutical injustice, which emphasizes how power dynamics shape not only the visibility of suffering but also the interpretive frameworks that validate certain narratives while marginalizing others.",

It explains how over the years, his mapping techniques evolved from journal mapping to overlays over global maps of science and finally towards interactive interfaces portraying multiple classifications and ontologies. It then critically reviews the challenges of current approaches to science mapping, which implicitly assume a ‘natural’ underlying structure, with examples from recent case studies. We observe that existing algorithmic approaches, either based on citation or semantic approaches, have problems of logic consistency of the categories obtained, which belong to methods, materials, empirical objects or theories. I propose that science mapping should engage with the conceptual goals of analyses that could define the type of ontologies relevant for each specific study. To do this science mapping should embrace mixed-methods to generate plural classifications and multiple ontologies which respond more specifically to sociological and policy questions.",

While much research has focused on [i] conceptually distinguishing race from ancestry and [ii] understanding how people interpret GAT information, few social scientific studies construct and utilize these quantities – which we call genetic similarity proportions (GSPs). Consequently, the empirical distributions and measurement properties of GSPs remain underexplored. After conceptually distinguishing between genealogical and genetic ancestry, we leverage computational genomic methods to estimate GSPs of genotyped respondents from the nationally-representative Add Health study. Utilizing a survey question on respondents’ self-reported ancestral countries, we observe that – though a person’s self-reported ancestry is associated with their GSPs – there exists considerable variation in GSPs among individuals with the same self-reported ancestry. Then, we explore how GSPs can inform our understanding of racial construction and racialization in the U.S. today by examining their relationship with skin tone and racial classification by others. We find that, among respondents who self-report ancestry from the Americas and/or from Sub-Saharan Africa, GSPs are robustly associated with both skin tone and racial classification – suggesting they may be useful for studying within-group heterogeneity and stratification.",

          "abstract": "The historical use of native languages for secure military communication, often referred to as code talking, has provided tactical advantages in warfare. However, this paper argues that such methods, like those employed by the Navajo code talkers of World War II, are no longer effective in modern warfare. A recent case is Russia's deployment of North Korean soldiers in the Russo-Ukrainian War, which raised the question of whether their language could provide a linguistic advantage. This paper examines why native language secrecy, including the potential use of North Korean as a code language, has lost its effectiveness. Factors such as advancements in AI-driven linguistic analysis, extensive international intelligence monitoring, and the well-documented nature of the North Korean language have significantly reduced the viability of native language ciphers. Additionally, the logistical challenges associated with deploying large numbers of North Korean soldiers without sufficient language support have further undermined their strategic value. While such methods may still hold limited utility in small-scale operations, reinforcing psychological cohesion, and confusing the enemy, they are no longer a significant asset in the modern, highly interconnected intelligence landscape.",

          "abstract": "Where do LGBTQ+ immigrants settle in the United States? The policy landscape for same-sex couples in the U.S. has changed rapidly in recent years, and number of immigrants in same-sex couples have increased rapidly. But little is known about where these lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) immigrants choose to settle and enjoy their new rights. Do they behave more similarly to their straight immigrant counterparts and locate based on job opportunities and cost of living? Or do they gravitate toward more LGBTQ+-friendly cities and states, as U.S.-born LGB people do? How have these patterns changed over time, especially in conjunction with local policy changes relevant to LGBTQ+ people and immigrants? Using American Community Survey data from 2008-2023 and original datasets, this paper studies the geographic context of immigrants in same-sex couples in the U.S. We find that the distribution of immigrants in same-sex couples is expanding across the U.S. over time. These settlement patterns generally look more similar to fellow U.S.-born LGB Americans: locations with higher concentrations are more progressive, have more robust LGBTQ+ civic life, and have higher incomes. Yet immigrants in same-sex couples also live in more racially and ethnically diverse areas compared to U.S.-born Americans in same-sex couples. Our findings contribute to a fuller understanding of this rapidly growing population and its unique characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Conjoint experiments have gained popularity in political science, accompanied by methodological discussions. We contribute to these by investigating the impact of (randomly) offering an abstention option alongside the usual forced choice dependent variable. We explore the usage of abstention employing data from a novel experiment with 4466 respondents. The findings reveal that a notable proportion of respondents abstain due to non-acceptance and unwillingness or inability to choose. Abstention from binary choice also impacts the subsequent rating tasks, suggesting binary choice may overestimate favorability deduced from conjoint experiments. Mirroring the real-world decision process, which often includes abstention options, improves our understanding of preferences and prevents biases in the analysis, highlighting the importance of considering offering an abstention option in conjoint experiments.",

          "abstract": "We study whether the educational disadvantage of children from households where parents have dissolved their union is due to selection or deteriorating non-school environments and whether exposure to school environments compensates or exacerbates such disadvantage. We apply a differential exposure approach (DEA) to Danish population data collecting public-school reading comprehension tests. The approach exploits variation in children’s birth dates and test administration dates to decompose children’s learning as the product of joint exposure to school and non-school environments. Key findings reveal that children experiencing parental separation have 5-7% lower test scores, with lower learning returns to non-school environments, and diminishing learning outcomes proportional to time spent in separated households. Critically, school appears to neither mitigate nor exacerbate these achievement gaps, suggesting that degrading of non-school environments post-separation primarily impacts children's learning.",

          "authors": "Marie-Caroline Compans; Heini Väisänen",
          "abstract": "According to clinical studies, miscarriages, that is spontaneous pregnancy losses before 22–24 weeks of gestation, affect approximately 13 to 18 % of recognized pregnancies. However, clinical studies are rarely representative of the population. Surveys tend to be, but they are subject to misreporting of miscarriages, as suggested by existing work in the US. Thus, existing evidence of social inequalities in miscarriage risk is inconsistent. This study first applies a model to estimate the extent of miscarriage misreporting in the French FECOND survey (2010-11). Estimated 92% of miscarriages were reported and underreporting was slightly more pronounced among women with lower education. Nevertheless, the estimated prevalence of miscarriages (14% of all pregnancies) remained largely unaffected and only with small educational differences. These findings indicate that estimating miscarriage risk factors can be done without correcting for reporting bias in this survey. Second, we used multilevel multinomial logistic regressions to estimate socio-demographic characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with miscarriage. As in previous work, advanced reproductive ages were associated with a higher miscarriage risk. Our models reveal that the association between miscarriage risk and prior reproductive history is explained by unobserved time-consistent individual characteristics, such as potentially. Conversely, education and self-assessed financial conditions were not associated with miscarriage risk. Younger cohorts exhibit a higher miscarriage risk, suggesting either an age effect on recall, a cohort effect regarding pregnancy recognition, or reduced stigma resulting in more reliable reporting of miscarriage in surveys.",

          "abstract": "Organizations vary in the degree to which their members experience social belonging. Interventions designed to boost belonging have typically focused on changing individuals’ mindsets. We instead develop a structural intervention that seeks to foster belonging by exposing people to unfamiliar colleagues---ones they are not in regular contact with. We consider two forms of such exposure: consonant, to colleagues from the same network community as the focal actor; and dissonant, to colleagues from different network communities. We hypothesize that consonant exposure engenders more group solidarity, more persistent relationships, and enhanced social belonging. We test these expectations in a pre-registered field experiment at a non-profit organization. Participants (N=213) engaged in a facilitated professional development experience with unfamiliar colleagues and were randomly assigned to either consonant or dissonant groups. Although the anticipated solidarity advantage of consonant exposure was only marginally significant when assessed immediately following the intervention, consonant-condition participants maintained more intervention-group ties and reported greater social belonging three months after the intervention. Yet, pointing to the potential tradeoffs of consonant versus dissonant exposure, dissonant-condition participants experienced steeper declines in network constraint and greater increases in betweenness and closeness centrality. We discuss implications for research on social networks, workplace belonging, and organizational interventions.",

          "authors": "Kamo Araz",
          "abstract": "The historical use of native languages for secure military communication, often referred to as code talking, has provided tactical advantages in warfare. However, this paper argues that such methods, like those employed by the Navajo code talkers of World War II, are no longer effective in modern warfare. A recent case is Russia's deployment of North Korean soldiers in the Russo-Ukrainian War, which raised the question of whether their language could provide a linguistic advantage. This paper examines why native language secrecy, including the potential use of North Korean as a code language, has lost its effectiveness. Factors such as advancements in AI-driven linguistic analysis, extensive international intelligence monitoring, and the well-documented nature of the North Korean language have significantly reduced the viability of native language ciphers. Additionally, the logistical challenges associated with deploying large numbers of North Korean soldiers without sufficient language support have further undermined their strategic value. While such methods may still hold limited utility in small-scale operations, reinforcing psychological cohesion, and confusing the enemy, they are no longer a significant asset in the modern, highly interconnected intelligence landscape.",

As a result, it is unclear what inferences researchers can draw from lobbying expenditures about interest groups' strategies and their ideological alignment with policymakers. We study a model of informational lobbying with a collective decision-making body and endogenous reforms to investigate the determinants of the value of access. We show that the funds flowing to a given policymaker depend not only on this policymaker's ideology and procedural power, but also on the overall distribution of preferences and power among other policymakers. Two policymakers with the same ideology and procedural power might therefore attract different amounts of contributions, depending on the preferences of fellow policymakers. Our results help clarify empirical research linking lobbying expenditures by interest groups to politicians' ideologies and power.",

          "authors": "Milind Raskar",
          "abstract": "Due to its intricate clusters of symbols, the absence of clear connections to known ancient or modern scripts from the Indian subcontinent, and broad assumptions about the likely languages of the Indus civilization, scholars have long struggled to decipher the Indus script. This study seeks to identify Indus characters by analysing common graphemes of synonymous words across known Indian languages, using traces in the existing languages as a \"Rosetta Stone.\" It interprets the pictographic symbols on Indus seals by applying principles from the Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system.\nThe findings suggest that the Indus script follows an Abugida-style writing system, comprising nineteen consonants and three vowels, and represents a Proto-Pali language. Analysing grammatical structures, reading sequences, and linguistic parallels with Pali provides strong evidence that the Indus civilization employed a structured language integrating phonetics and symbolism. Further validation through the interpretation of anthropomorphic and some other specific seals, along with architectural and urban planning elements, establishes a direct link between the script and the cultural practices of the Indus people—particularly in meditation and spiritual traditions.\nKey urban features such as courtyards, walls, and granaries help clarify the administrative functions, Meditation universities, and social structures of Indus settlements. Identified as an early form of Proto-Pali, the deciphered script reveals linguistic traditions that suggest continuity between the Indus script and modern languages. By offering significant insights into its language, grammar, and cultural context, this study provides a deeper understanding of the historical and linguistic legacy of the Indus civilization.",

However, extant studies have only partially considered the role of gender in this process. To reduce this gap in the literature, this study examines gendered genetic influences on educational attainment in Germany before and after reunification. Drawing on Gene-SOEP data (N=1,573), we analyze polygenic risk scores across cohorts (1943 to 1992) in East (German Democratic Republic, GDR) and West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany, FRG) using stepwise OLS regression with three-way interactions. Our findings reveal that genetic influences on educational attainment increased over time, thereby reducing gendered educational inequality in both regions. However, this positive trend was more gradual in the FRG. Although the GDR promoted gender equality, its policies alone were insufficient to eliminate gender-based differences in genetic educational attainment.",

          "authors": "Cameron Thomas Langfield",
          "abstract": "Exceptional events bring with them exceptional consequences. During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most devastating exceptional events in recent memory, the lives and routines of millions of people around the world were significantly disrupted. Criminologists were quick to document the immediate and short-term effects of pandemic-related restrictions on recorded crime, with the meta-story being that most types of recorded crime declined beyond statistical expectations. However, in the aftermath of these discoveries, it has become clear that research focusing on young people and their offending has not garnered the same level of attention. To remedy this, the current paper uses officially recorded unit-record offence data from the state of New South Wales (NSW) to explore and document to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic has affected youth offending. With this data in hand, we estimate the prevalence and frequency of offending among this cohort of young people pre-and-post the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions. We find that throughout periods of lockdown restrictions in NSW, the prevalence and frequency of this cohorts offending declined significantly, and that most of these declines were clustered in property and violent offences. Interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) was conducted to confirm these findings, with statistical evidence suggesting the largest declines in prevalence and frequency occurred at the point of the first national lockdown in 2020 and the second state-wide lockdown in 2021. We end this paper by discussing why these findings are important and how they continue to shed light on the COVID-crime puzzle, specifically addressing the gap in research on youth offending during an exceptional event.",

          "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitutes a range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by differences in communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early detection of ASD can significantly improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely interventions, thereby reducing challenges in later life. Nonetheless, diagnosing ASD can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting researchers and healthcare professionals to explore automated screening and diagnostic tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive data-driven approach to ASD screening using a publicly available dataset of 704 adult participants. We examine and compare six different modeling techniques, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep Dense Neural Networks (DDNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). By optimizing hyperparameters and carefully preprocessing the data, we achieve a 100% accuracy on the hold-out test set using SVM and XGBoost, and above 98% accuracy with all deep learning models. We discuss the methodological framework, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, encoding, scaling, and model evaluation. We also present significant insights from the machine learning pipeline and highlight implications for future research in the domain of ASD screening. Our results underscore the feasibility of leveraging modern computational approaches to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and resource prioritization for ASD.",

          "abstract": "In this paper we present estimates of socioeconomic vulnerability along three major scenarios developed as part of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for 181 countries over the period 2020-2100. The estimates are based on the GDL Vulnerability Index (GVI), a composite index for monitoring the human components of vulnerability to climate change across the globe. The GVI is based on an additive formula that summarizes the essence of seven major socioeconomic dimensions of vulnerability into a single number. This formula approach makes it possible to compute the index for any region at any point in time for which the underlying indicators are available. This makes the GVI the first composite index which can be used to estimate projected values of vulnerability. We use and derive projected indicators from the databases underlying the SSPs and other sources to compute future values of the GVI at the level of countries, major global regions and for three vulnerability levels. Projections of GVI are provided for three SSPs: a green road scenario (SSP1), a middle of the road scenario (SSP2), and a rocky road scenario with high international fragmentation (SSP3). Vulnerability decreases most substantially under SSP1, the green road scenario with largest emission reductions. Countries and regions which at present are most vulnerable are projected to show the largest improvements.",

These data will help further various welfare state and social policy research agendas, in particular in the area of work-injury policy which is often understudied in comparison to other social security policies.

          "abstract": "Neoliberal conservation is enjoying its latest zenith in the form of ‘biodiversity finance’. The endurance of neoliberal conservation is rooted in often unseen negotiations of knowledge and power; hence it is crucial to understand how material futures are being shaped by discourse. Analysis of interviews with biodiversity finance professionals in Australia revealed novel discursive mechanisms centred on innovation and regulation. Commodification of nature is seen as impossible, but inevitable – with tradeable biodiversity units being the primary object of innovation. The complexity of biodiversity markets elevates the power of the “innovators”, whose expert knowledge and elite networks reshape the material world. These discourses risk entrenching biodiversity loss, particularly for threatened components, and further subordinating the role of government. The data also revealed fear, risk and the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures as potential loci for disruption – highlighting one of several opportunities to chart materially better pathways for biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "Computational reproducibility is increasingly essential for advancing archaeological science, yet its implementation remains inconsistent across the discipline. This study presents a bibliometric assessment of archaeology’s status relative to other fields alongside a systematic review of computational reproducibility in published archaeological research. Analyzing nearly 10,000 articles, I identify trends in authorship, citation practices, and related metrics that position archaeology between the natural and social sciences. A review of reproducibility assessments for the Journal of Archaeological Science reveals persistent challenges, including missing data, unspecified dependencies, and inadequate documentation. To address these issues, I recommend to authors basic practical steps such as standardized project organization and explicit dependency documentation. Strengthening reproducibility will enhance archaeology’s scientific rigor and ensure the verifiability of research findings. This study underscores the urgent need for cultural and technical shifts to establish reproducibility as a cornerstone of rigorous, accountable, and impactful archaeological science.",

          "authors": "REGROUP project; Giulia Torchio",
          "abstract": "This research evaluates the effectiveness of the European Union’s (EU) 2030 Digital Decade Policy Programme (DDPP), highlighting its current shortcomings and providing recommendations for improvement. The DDPP aims to enhance the EU’s global competitiveness and align digital transformation with European values, focusing on digital skills, infrastructure, business digitalisation, and public services. However, the 2023 and 2024 reports indicate that the EU is off track to meet its 2030 goals, with slow progress on all targets. Potential challenges stemming from a failure of the DDPP include a loss of technological competitiveness, a widening digital divide, skills polarisation, and the creation of new vulnerable groups. Reckoning with the critical state of the DDPP, President von der Leyen has tasked Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice-President (EVP) for Tech, Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, with a review of the strategy to be carried out in 2026. Ahead of it, this research aims to kickstart a conversation on the need to substantially and comprehensively revisit the DDPP targets. It combines desk research with expert discussions to assess the effectiveness of the Digital Compass and reveals significant delays, funding issues, and an overall lack of coherence in the strategy.",
