          "abstract": "The purpose of this brief is to provide an introduction to an increasingly popular way of communicating outputs of research: the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. This model came into practice in the early 2000s, and it is now beginning to grow more rapidly. Here, we explain the model for the benefit of researchers, research funders, research institutions, and others in the scholarly communication ecosystem, and we provide data on uptake of the model to date.",

          "title": "Seeing a talker’s mouth reduces the effort of perceiving speech and repairing perceptual mistakes for listeners with cochlear implants",
          "authors": "Justin Fleming; Matthew Winn",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Seeing a talker’s mouth improves speech intelligibility, particularly for listeners who use cochlear implants (CIs). However, the impacts of visual cues on listening effort for listeners with CIs remain poorly understood, as previous studies have focused on listeners with typical hearing (TH) and featured stimuli that do not invoke effortful cognitive speech perception challenges. This study directly compared the effort of perceiving audiovisual speech between listeners who use CIs and those with TH. Visual cues were hypothesized to yield more relief from listening effort in a cognitively challenging speech perception condition that required listeners to mentally repair a missing word in the auditory stimulus. Eye gaze was simultaneously measured to examine whether the tendency to look toward a talker’s mouth would increase during these moments of uncertainty about the speech stimulus. \n\nDesign: Participants included listeners with CIs and an age-matched group of participants with typical age-adjusted hearing (N = 20 in both groups). The magnitude and time course of listening effort was evaluated using pupillometry. In half of the blocks, phonetic visual cues were removed by selectively blurring the talker’s mouth, which preserved stimulus luminance so visual conditions could be compared using pupillometry. Each block included a mixture of trials in which the sentence audio was intact, and trials in which a target word in the auditory stimulus was replaced by noise; the latter required participants to mentally reconstruct the target word upon repeating the sentence. Pupil and gaze data were analyzed using generalized additive mixed effects models (GAMMs) to identify the stretches of time during which effort or gaze strategy differed between conditions.\n\nResults: Visual release from effort was greater and lasted longer for listeners with CIs compared to those with TH. Within the CI group, visual cues reduced effort to a greater extent when a missing word needed to be repaired than when the speech was intact. Seeing the talker’s mouth also improved speech intelligibility for listeners with CIs, including reducing the number of incoherent verbal responses when repair was required. The two hearing groups deployed different gaze strategies when perceiving audiovisual speech. CI listeners looked more at the mouth overall, even when it was blurred, while TH listeners tended to increase looks to the mouth in the moment following a missing word in the auditory stimulus. \n\nConclusions: Integrating visual cues from a talker’s mouth not only improves speech intelligibility, but also reduces listening effort, particularly for listeners with CIs. For listeners with CIs (but not those with TH), these visual benefits are magnified when a missed word needs to be mentally corrected — a common occurrence during everyday speech perception for individuals with hearing loss. These results underscore the importance of including participants with hearing loss in listening effort studies and suggest caution in assuming results from TH listeners will generalize to those with hearing loss. They also highlight the potential clinical relevance of visual speech information, for counseling patients and families and potentially for the development of audiovisual strategies to reduce listening effort.",

          "authors": "Geertjan Overbeek; Catrin Finkenauer; Lenneke Alink; Patty Leijten; Susan Branje; Wendy Schrama; Jacqueline Schenk",
          "abstract": "Most research with minors currently requires active caregiver consent. This is important as minors may lack the power, education, and resources to protect themselves. Yet, this approach comes at a big cost: it reduces research quality—reducing participation rates and leading to biased samples—and unduly restrains youth’s right to informed, autonomous decision-making. This goes against the best interest and rights of youth, their caregivers, and society at large. In this commentary, we propose a hybrid research ethics strategy, which may help to strike a better balance between meeting ethical responsibilities (protecting minors from involuntary or unconsented participation) and safeguarding research quality and youth’s right to autonomous decisionmaking. This strategy allows the use of active, informed consent from caregivers where needed, and ‘passive’ (opt-out) consent in cases where youth can make autonomous and well-informed decisions to participate in research.",

          "authors": "Yong Hoon Chung; Lauren Williams; Timothy F. Brady; Viola S. Störmer",
          "abstract": "Across many studies, verbal labels have been shown to significantly affect perceptual and cognitive processes. Here we ask whether verbal labels can also improve visual working memory performance by making objects more recognizable. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to remember visual details of unrecognizable shapes derived from real-world objects. Participants were either provided with category labels prior to stimulus presentation or not. We reasoned that the labels could aid object recognition, which would then help maintain them in working memory based on recent work showing that meaningful, recognizable objects are better remembered than arbitrary visual shapes. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no reliable increase in visual working memory performance when participants were given verbal labels. This pattern of results persisted across various experimental manipulations, including different methods of distorting the objects, testing label memory, and using within or between-category stimulus sets. Overall, our results indicate that category labels did not readily enhance working memory performance for obfuscated shapes that are difficult to recognize, suggesting that improving visual working memory for meaningful stimuli may depend on how the visual system reorganizes incoming visual information perceptually rather than associating visual inputs with verbal knowledge. Thus, verbal labels do not seem to have as broad and general effects on cognitive functioning as previously assumed.",

          "authors": "Jacinda Taggett; Charan Ranganath; James W Antony; Xiaonan Liu",
          "abstract": "Students are often taught that testing themselves will help them retain new material. Less well known, however, is that testing oneself before learning can also produce benefits (the “pretesting effect”). Prior studies have indicated that the semantic relatedness between the provided information (cue) and the answer (target) may be critical for this effect. Here, we investigated this by measuring the trifold relationship between cue, target, and guess using continuous relatedness measures. In Experiment 1, participants learned cue-target word pairs by studying or generating guesses based on the cue word before taking a test on both cue-target pairs and the original cue-guess combinations. We found a robust difference in accuracy favoring pretesting over studying, regardless of cue-target relatedness. In Experiment 2, we further examined if errorless generation contributed to the pretesting effect by adding a condition in which cue and target were present, but subjects still generated a related word. Cue-target memory was better in both the pretesting and generation conditions than the study condition. In both studies, while cue-target relatedness benefitted accuracy overall, these benefits did not interact with pretesting or generation pair conditions. Importantly, we observed an interaction between the cue-target semantic relatedness and guess-target semantic relatedness only in the pretesting condition, demonstrating a benefit for (incidentally) high relatedness between guesses and targets when cue-target relatedness was low and an impairment when cue-target relatedness was high, likely reflecting interference between target and guess. Our results illuminate the importance of considering guess quality in uncovering the mechanisms in pretesting.",

          "authors": "Ivana Buric; Lucija Žderić; Maja Wrzesien; Esther de Bruin",
          "abstract": "Objectives: The benefits of mindfulness are well-documented, but limited research has explored sources of individual differences in outcomes of mindfulness interventions although understanding this can improve their efficacy and adherence. This study aimed to investigate the role of baseline participant characteristics in predicting the response to a low-dose mindfulness intervention in young adults. \nMethods: Participants were 161 students (M=22.1, SD=3.22) recruited from the University of Amsterdam who were enrolled in either a mindfulness-based intervention course or an unrelated psychology course that served as the control group. General linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of improvements in emotion regulation from pre- to post-intervention. Specifically, the study examined the influence of trait mindfulness, mental health, well-being, intervention expectations, perceived recent stress, and lifetime stress on changes in emotion regulation. \nResults: The results showed that baseline trait mindfulness was the only significant predictor of change in emotion regulation after the intervention (b = 0.25, SE = 0.13, p &lt;0.05). Participants with lower scores on trait mindfulness at baseline showed a greater improvement in emotion regulation. Other baseline participant characteristics, including mental health, well-being, intervention expectations, perceived recent stress, and lifetime stress, did not significantly predict changes in emotion regulation.\nConclusions: This study contributes to the understanding of individual differences in mindfulness interventions and highlights the importance of measuring trait mindfulness before implementing such interventions. Further research is needed to explore additional predictors and replicate these findings in different populations and intervention formats.",

          "abstract": "Background. Electronic health (eHealth) programs are a promising avenue to enhance the accessibility of parenting interventions that aim to improve parent mental health. However, engagement in eHealth parenting programs can be variable and sociodemographic factors may help elucidate for whom there are barriers. Such work may inform specific components of future eHealth interventions and support the scalability and effectiveness of existing interventions for those experiencing barriers.\nObjective. The current study aims to investigate the extent to which sociodemographic factors predict various engagement metrics in a novel eHealth parenting program (The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health [BEAM]).\n\nMethods. A secondary data analysis of engagement metrics was conducted in two separate randomized controlled trials (RCT) of the BEAM program. A total of n = 110 mothers (Mage = 31.85 years old, SDage = 4.67) of young children participated across both trials. We examined the magnitude of the relationships between sociodemographic predictors with distinct metrics of engagement.\n\nResults. Program engagement was highest in the earlier weeks of the program and declined across later weeks (β = -.16, p &lt; .001). Older mother age positively predicted several engagement metrics, including more time watching mental health videos (β = .34, p = .010) and parenting videos (β = .34, p = .010). Higher household income positively predicted more forum page views (β = .44, p &lt; .001), number of BEAM sessions attended (β = .30, p = .006), and more weeks of BEAM program engagement (β = .35, p &lt; .001). First time-parents engaged in fewer program weeks (β = -.25, p = .009). Number of children in the household, employment status, and living in an urban area did not significantly predict any program engagement metrics. \n\nConclusions. Parent engagement varied throughout the program, and it may be beneficial to specifically target mid and later program engagement for participants. First-time and low-income parents may face additional barriers in participating in eHealth programs and benefit from additional support from the intervention team to bolster engagement. Additional research will be helpful in replicating and extending these findings with larger samples to optimize program engagement.",

          "authors": "Ivana Buric",
          "abstract": "The consequences of chronic stress present a major public health challenge, and we are beginning to understand ways to mitigate these damaging effects. Research on mindfulness has accumulated over the past decades and suggests that it can counteract the psychological, neural, and immune effects of chronic stress, but more research is required to provide precise clinical guidelines. This article describes mindfulness interventions in a language that can be understood by researchers from different backgrounds, reviews three central gaps, and provides future directions for research on the psychoneuroimmunology of mindfulness. \n\nThe first gap addresses the need to explore adaptations to existing mindfulness interventions that may further increase effectiveness or accessibility across diverse populations—such as varying intervention duration and doses of home practice or utilising technology. The second gap refers to a lack of consensus on the theoretical framework in mindfulness research that blocks progress. Researchers are invited to use the Interdisciplinary Theoretical Framework (INSPIRER) that integrates disciplines and explains the psychological, neural, and immune mechanisms by which mindfulness produces broad benefits across different levels of observation. The final gap refers to individual differences in responses to mindfulness interventions, and discovering who benefits the most from mindfulness interventions. Baseline levels of psychopathology are some of the participant characteristics that influence responses to mindfulness interventions, but only further identification of participant characteristics and replication of existing ones will allow for more targeted approaches. \n\nBy addressing these three research gaps in the 21st century, we can advance the field of mindfulness and contribute to the development of cost-effective and personalised interventions that can be applied on a large scale to mitigate the effects of chronic stress and protect human health.",

          "authors": "Rosa E. Torres; Christine Salahub; Karen L. Campbell; Stephen M Emrich",
          "abstract": "Previous behavioral research has demonstrated that when given positive and negative cues (i.e., cues indicating the features of upcoming targets and distractors, respectively), young and older adults are able to use this information to a similar extent. However, it is possible that older adults achieve similar behavioral performance via different neural mechanisms. The current study aimed to test this question by examining the neural underpinnings associated with effective attentional filtering across age. Young and older adults were presented with either positive (target matching), negative (distractor matching), or neutral cues, which were immediately followed by a search array where participants had to report the orientation of a search target. We found that both age groups appropriately attended to target information when given information about it in the form of a target-matching pre-cue, as indicated by faster response times (RTs) and target-processing event-related potentials (ERPs). However, older adults were not able to suppress distracting information when given a negative cue, as no distractor-positivity (PD) ERP, indicative of suppression, was observed. Additionally, when given a neutral cue, older adults’ ability to suppress distracting information was correlated to measures of inhibitory control. Thus, although young and older adults seem to use negative cues similarly at first glance, neural evidence suggests there are differences between the two age groups in their ability to suppress task-irrelevant information.",

          "authors": "Sean Noah; Sreenivasan Meyyappan; Mingzhou Ding; George R. Mangun",
          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that sustained visual attention operates rhythmically, as if the visual system periodically samples stimuli in the environment. In this study, we find evidence for rhythmic attentional sampling of internal representations of Targets and Distractors up to almost one second after the offset of visual stimulation. Twenty participants performed an anticipatory object-based visual attention task in which they were instructed to determine whether a short-lasting Target object image was blurry or not-blurry. This task was made more challenging by the overlaid presentation of a Distractor object image that might also be blurry, requiring focused attention to the cued object \ncategory to perform the task successfully. We recorded EEG during the task and performed a decoding analysis on the stimulus-evoked EEG to measure Target and Distractor information present in the scalp voltage topography over the stimulus epoch. We found that the magnitude of the represented Target and Distractor information oscillates in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz), consistent with previous characterizations of rhythmic attentional sampling. Moreover, we found a correlation between the Target-Distractor theta band phase difference and task performance. Our findings suggest that: 1. Attention separately samples Target and Distractor representations during the cognitive processes that occur between stimulus presentation and behavioral response; 2. These separately sampled streams of information interfere with one another; and 3. Target discrimination improves when Target and Distractor sampling rhythms are desynchronized.",

Prior research suggests that motor synchrony promotes closeness and prosocial behaviour, but few studies have examined its role in social learning. This study investigated whether motor synchrony, through a clapping game, enhances preschoolers' closeness with others, imitation, over-imitation, and prosociality. We hypothesized that children would feel closer, imitate more, and share more with a partner who moved in synchrony compared to one who moved asynchronously. In a group setting, motor synchrony and asynchrony were experimentally induced between the child and two experimenters. Bayesian analyses revealed no credible evidence for differences in affiliation, imitation, over-imitation, or prosocial behaviour between experimenters (BF10=0.045-0.216). A manipulation check indicated low motor synchrony scores, suggesting the intended synchrony may not have been fully achieved, potentially influencing the outcomes. These findings highlight the challenges of inducing motor synchrony in playful group contexts and raise questions about the conditions necessary for synchrony to impact social learning in young children.",

          "abstract": "A culture of honor refers to a social system where individuals' status, reputation, and esteem play a central role in governing interpersonal relations. Past works have associated this concept with the United States (US) South and related with it various traits such as higher sensitivity to insult, a higher value on reputation, and a tendency to react violently to insults. In this paper, we hypothesize and confirm that internet users from the US South, where a culture of honor is more prevalent, are more likely to display a trait predicted by their belonging to a culture of honor. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that US Southerners are more likely to retaliate to personal attacks by personally attacking back. We leverage OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to both geolocate internet users and to automatically detect whether users are insulting each other. We validate the use of GPT-3.5 by measuring its performance on manually-labeled subsets of the data. Our work demonstrates the potential of formulating a hypothesis based on a conceptual framework, operationalizing it in a way that is amenable to large-scale LLM-aided analysis, manually validating the use of the LLM, and drawing a conclusion.",

          "abstract": "Background:\n\nWith the rapid expansion of wearable technologies, there is increased interest in their utility for passive data collection applications in aging research. Wearables can be specifically beneficial to research featuring people with dementia and their families who have burdens that can make both study participation and reliable data collection more difficult, especially as dementia progresses. However, population-specific issues affecting the success of wearables for data collection can include remembering to wear a device, fluctuating acceptance of the device or study participation, and reliance on strained caregivers. Better understanding of how research with wearables can address these and other issues is necessary to enhance participant buy-in and sustained wearing for better quality dementia research.\n\nObjective:\n\nWe undertook a systematic evaluation of contemporary wearables research to describe this population's wearables experiences, desired qualities, and protocol needs.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe used the PRISMA 2020 guide to systematic reviews and searched three scholarly databases using medical subject heading (MeSH) terms for papers published since 2018 featuring the use or discussion of wearable devices for persons with dementia. We screened 1757 abstracts and retained 58 for full-text review.\n\nResults:\n\nWe present synthesized preferences, barriers, and facilitators to wearables buy-in and adherence in dementia research. A total of 29 factors were categorized into four overarching categories aligned with study development: device selection, protocol considerations, enhancing recruitment, and promoting adherence.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThese findings inform researcher guidelines for wearable device selection and protocol design to enhance the utility of wearables in future longitudinal research featuring persons with dementia and their caregivers.",

          "abstract": "Background:\n\nInexperienced adolescent drivers are particularly susceptible to engaging in distracted driving behaviors (DDB) such as texting while driving (TWD). Traditional driver education approaches have shown limited success in reducing motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.\n\nObjective:\n\nWe test an innovative approach to help address the critical issue of DDB among teenagers. We investigated the effectiveness of using a novel virtual reality (VR) game \"Distracted Navigator\" to educate novice teenage drivers about DDB.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe game consisted of maneuvering a spaceship around asteroids while engaging in simulated DDB (e.g., inputting numbers into a keypad). Facilitated discussion, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, linked gameplay to real-life driving. Teenagers were recruited and divided into intervention (VR gameplay/discussion) and control (discussion only) groups in a ratio of 2:1. Pre-post surveys measured the impact on TWD-related beliefs and intentions. Focus group interviews elicited feedback on the utility of the VR gameplay and discussion.\n\nResults:\n\nThe majority of participants were male (62.5%), ranging 14-17 years old (M(SD) =15.8(0.92)), with universal cell phone ownership. Approximately 60% reported never texting while driving and 29% said they rarely did. Compared to the control group (n=7), the intervention group (n=17) was more likely to report that the programming had changed how they felt about texting and driving overall (P=.015). However, specific TWD attitudes and intentions were not different by treatment status. Irrespective of the treatment, pre-and post-scores indicated reduced confidence in safely texting while driving (perceived behavioral control; P=.005). Thematic analysis revealed: 1) the VR gameplay adeptly portrayed real-world consequences of texting and driving; 2) participants highly valued the interactive nature of the VR game and discussion; 3) both the VR game and facilitated discussion were deemed as integral and complementary components, and 4) feedback for improving the VR game and discussion.\n\nConclusions:\n\nOur findings show the novel use of immersive VR experiences with interactive discussions can raise awareness of DDB consequences and is a promising method to enhance driving safety education. Widespread accessibility of VR technology allows for scalable integration into driver training programs, warranting a larger, prospective randomized study.",

Further, for racial/ethnic minority youth living in low-segregation neighborhoods, higher neighborhood access/quality of educational resources related to lower internalizing symptoms.\n\nConclusion\nWhile adverse neighborhood environments are associated with higher psychopathology symptoms and lower cognitive performance, some aspects of neighborhoods may buffer this association. Understanding these patterns is necessary for informing structural interventions that might reduce disparities in mental health and cognitive function.",

          "abstract": "Limited evidence exists on ADHD-related disfluency and lexical diversity behaviour in connected speech, although a significant number of individuals with ADHD experience language difficulties at different linguistic levels. Using a retrospective cross-sectional design with data from the Asymmetries TalkBank database, this study aims to capture differences in disfluency production and lexical diversity between children with ADHD and Typically Developing (TD) children. These measures include the frequencies of different disfluency subtypes and two lexical diversity measures, and are correlated with performance on a working memory task and a response inhibition task. Results indicate that the ADHD group produced a higher mean frequency of each disfluency type, but no differences were found to be significant. Correlation analysis revealed that filled pauses and revisions were negatively correlated with working memory and response inhibition in the ADHD group, whereas they were positively correlated with working memory performance in the TD group. This suggests that the underlying causes of disfluency differ in each group and that further research is required of speech monitoring ability in children with ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Recent evidence (e.g., Monaghan et al., 2021; Rebuschat et al., 2021) showed that adult learners can acquire words and grammar simultaneously by tracking cross-situational statistics. In this study, we tested whether cross-situational learning (CSL) is powerful enough to support simultaneous learning in younger learners. Twenty children (ages 8 to 9) were exposed to a complex artificial language comprising novel nouns, verbs, case markers, with variable word order by means of a CSL paradigm, adapted from Rebuschat et al. (2021). We found that participants were rapidly able to learn the novel word order but failed to learn the novel vocabulary. The results can shed light on the understanding of differences in CSL across the life span and provide further empirical evidence for the cognitive underpinnings of child-adult differences in the earliest stages of language acquisition.",

They understand that people play particular roles within a larger social fabric that shapes their identities and expectations, and that their self image is affected by appraisals of how well (or not) they perform these roles. We designate here as relational concerns the considerations that arise from these roles and relationships, and study how they affect judgments of fairness. A series of vignette studies is used to explore how relational concerns compare with the impartial principles of equity and equality that fairness is commonly held to entail. We provide evidence that for participants based in the UK and in India, relational concerns are important for judging the fairness of distributions where people coordinate around shared goals. We also show that relational concerns may vary across cultural communities.",

          "abstract": "Background: Even though evidence-based treatment is generally effective in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among youth, many still experience elevated symptoms after treatment. A better understanding of how PTSD develops through treatment can increase treatment efficiency and reduce residual symptoms. Objective: The current study investigated which PTSD symptom clusters and symptoms within these clusters that change the most and least through trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) and identified common residual symptoms after treatment. Method: Latent growth curve modelling was used to identify differences in intercepts and slopes of symptoms, and residual symptoms were identified with McNemar tests in a sample of 517 youth (6 -19 years, 75.6% girls) receiving TF-CBT. Results: We found small but statistically significant differences in slopes across clusters. Avoidance both reduced the most and demonstrated most residual symptoms. Also, within clusters, many of the symptoms that reduced the most, such as psychological cue reactivity, persistent negative emotional state, and difficulties sleeping and concentrating, had the highest symptom levels at pretreatment and the most residuals posttreatment. Conclusions: Overall, symptoms of PTSD were reduced throughout TF-CBT. Symptoms that were rated highest at treatment start showed the most decrease but also tended to remain as common residuals. Symptoms such as psychological cue reactivity, persistent negative emotional state, and negative beliefs that were common residuals and are known to be central in development and maintenance of PTSD are of particular clinical relevance. Elaborate research on short-term symptom development and mechanisms of change is needed to advance the field.",

Study 2, which included 245 American and 222 Japanese employees, not only replicated the results of Study 1 but also demonstrated that companies’ meritocratic promotion system further mediated the association between job mobility and prestige leadership.

          "authors": "Andrea Adriano; Lorenzo Ciccione; Minye Zhan",
          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that participants can enumerate a set of objects more quickly and precisely when clusters can be formed according to Gestalt factors. This effect is known as \"groupitizing\". Although predominantly observed in the visual domain, the role of visual experience in its development is still unknown. Has groupitizing emerged from neural mechanisms underlying grouping-cues processing in the early visual cortex? What is the impact of visual deprivation on its development? A fundamental model to investigate these questions is to study congenitally blind (CB) individuals. Lacking experience of visual grouping cues, CB individuals should not develop groupitizing strategies if vision is essential. Conversely, if vision is not mandatory, CB individuals should reveal groupitizing abilities in other sensory modalities. Importantly, visual deprivation could prompt compensatory cognitive abilities, such as better auditory working memory, which may influence the enumeration of auditory stimuli. We compared congenitally blind and sighted individuals in an auditory groupitizing task, where participants estimated the number of pure tones (5 to 12) presented rapidly, which were randomly interspaced (ungrouped condition) or grouped by temporal proximity (grouped condition). We found that grouped sequences yielded lower error-rates and higher precision compared to ungrouped ones in both blind and sighted participants. Overall, the blind group presented lower error-rates and slightly better numerical precision, with a greater grouping-benefit toward larger set sizes, compared to sighted participants. These findings suggest that groupitizing may emerge even without vision, potentially relying on perceptual amodal mechanisms, and that visual deprivation may boost groupitizing in the auditory modality.",

          "authors": "Oda van Jole; René Westerhausen",
          "abstract": "Since it was first noticed in the 1970s, studies have continued to observe that various types of portraits are often produced with the left side of the face protruding more than the right side of the face. This pose orientation is often preferred by the viewer and the displayed cheek appears to influence the viewer’s perceptions of the portrayed individual. This phenomenon has become known as the left-cheek bias. Based on the notion that the right hemisphere both innervates the left hemiface and is considered dominant in emotion processing, a popular explanation for the left-cheek bias is that such a posing orientation better displays emotional qualities. Given societal stereotypes associating women with emotional expressiveness, it has been suggested that this bias is more prevalent in portraits of women. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the literature on the left-cheek bias, both in terms of its occurrence, its effect on the viewers, and potential gender effects. A systematic literature search was conducted in seven electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, EBSCO Discovery Service, PsychInfo, MEDLINE, and Embase. Two independent raters assessed the resulting 268 articles, ultimately including 65 articles comprising 98 studies. These studies were first categorised by whether they assessed pose orientation in a set of stimuli (DV-group; k = 64) or how pose orientation affected an outcome measure (IV-group; k = 34). The present poster primarily focuses on the DV-group, analysing the outcomes of studies across various DV-categories with respect to pose orientation. Furthermore, the poster includes a review of studies examining gender differences in posing bias, along with their conclusions.",

Researchers examining child characteristics that can moderate the effects of socialization have tested increasingly complex, nuanced, and sophisticated models, largely inspired by the highly influential frameworks of child plasticity or differential susceptibility (Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2009). Yet, multiple questions remain unsettled. We addressed four such questions as applied to predicting children’s observed disregard for rules at age 4.5 in a study of 200 community families from the US Midwest. (1) We examined children’s observed negative emotionality at 16 months, most commonly seen as plasticity “trait”, but separating anger and fear proneness, which may differently moderate effects of socialization. (2) We examined two separate aspects of observed parental socialization at age 3, Mutually Responsive Orientation and power assertion. (3) We distinguished analytically diathesis-stress from differential susceptibility. (4) We examined all effects in mother- and father-child relationships. We supported both diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility, depending on the facet of negative emotionality, the aspect of socialization considered, and parental gender, highlighting the nuanced nature of the processes involved.",

          "authors": "Juyoung Kim; Grazyna Kochanska",
          "abstract": "As interest in early morality has grown, researchers have increasingly focused on young children’s moral self, but recent studies have targeted mostly its structure and associations with behavior rather than its developmental origins. Addressing this gap, we followed children, mothers, and fathers in US Midwest from late infancy (16 months old, N = 194, 93 girls, 101 boys), to toddlerhood (3 years old, N = 175, 86 girls, 89 boys), to preschool age (4.5 years old, N = 177, 86 girls, 91 boys). We proposed that moral self at preschool age originates in the second and third years, when the onset of parental control engenders in the child both receptive and adversarial stance toward the parent. In infancy and in toddlerhood, we collected behavioral indications of both stances – positive affect and responsiveness (in toddlerhood, also positive representation of the parent); and defiance and violations of parental prohibition. At preschool age, we measured child moral self in a puppet interview (Kochanska, 2002). For both mother- and father-child relationships, structural equation modeling supported direct paths from receptive and adversarial stance at age 3 years to higher and lower moral self, respectively, and the expected indirect effects of the child’s receptive stance in infancy on moral self, mediated by the receptive or adversarial stance in toddlerhood. The path from toddler-age adversarial stance to lower moral self was present only in father-son relationships. This study highlights the long-term pivotal significance of the child’s early stance toward the parent for the formation of moral self.",

          "abstract": "Speed–accuracy trade-offs are a fundamental aspect of decision-making, requiring individuals to balance collecting more information against making faster decisions. Although speed–accuracy trade-offs have been studied extensively at the individual level, their role in human group decision-making remains poorly understood—even though faster, and possibly more error-prone, decisions often influence group outcomes more than slower decisions. We examined how individual differences in speed–accuracy trade-off preferences shape decision-making in pairs, using an interactive online experiment and drift–diffusion modeling. Participants first performed a visual perception task alone, allowing us to estimate their individual drift rates and decision thresholds, the key cognitive determinants of speed–accuracy trade-off preferences. Participants then performed the task in pairs, sharing decisions in real time. Group accuracy depended on the faster (and thus more error-prone) member, and not on the slower (but more accurate) member. Social decisions were not worse than individual ones because faster members increased their thresholds in the social condition and became more accurate, while slower members incorporated less social information. These findings show that individuals adjusted their social information use to the speed–accuracy trade-off preferences of their group members, highlighting the importance of such individual differences for understanding collective behavior.",

When a forest catches fire after a lightning strike, for example, people tend to say that the lightning bolt was the cause of the fire, not mentioning the presence of oxygen in the air, although they are well aware that the latter was no less indispensable for the fire to occur. We argue that the extant literature on causal selection has so far operated on the implicit premise that the only relevant variables for causal selection are individual variables, corresponding to distinct nodes in the relevant network of causes. Ours is the first systematic study of plural causes in the context of causal selection. First, we establish by means of two behavioral experiments the psychological reality and non- triviality of plural causes, ruling out potential deflationary explanations. Second, we show that state-of-the-art models of causal selection based on counterfactual dependence can be extended to make non-trivial predictions about plural causes consistent with our experimental findings. Third, we show that surprising logical properties of plurals in natural language interpretation can be found in causal reasoning with plural causes. We argue that the mental representations involved in causal-selection judgments show marks of the representations formal semanticists have proposed for plurals in natural language.",

          "abstract": "Teacher retention in England continues to be in a state of decline with early career teachers (ECTs) most at risk of leaving the profession. High attrition rates create an unstable and unsustainable workforce which negatively affects the educational development of young people. The purpose of this paper was to explore the career-related push and pull factors for ECTs in England. The paper also explores the way in which ECTs’ experiences shape career decision-making, and the extent to which their motivational needs are being met. Previous studies have considered workplace retention; however, little is known about the motivational needs and perspectives of ECTs. This paper explores the experiences of 20 ECTs in state-funded primary, secondary and special schools in England. All participants had less than five years teaching experience and were selected through purposive sampling. Participants took part in semi-structured online interviews with data analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were constructed from the data: Complexity, Belonging, Emotional Impact, Professional Identity and Relentlessness. Findings show that these themes are interrelated and combine to create a clear ‘tipping point’ where ECTs begin to find the job unmanageable. From a motivation perspective, we found that autonomous motivation reduces quitting intentions and that the need for relatedness and positive professional identities are particularly important for retaining teachers in the first five years of their careers.",

We then demonstrated that describing a scientist as high (vs. low) in intellectual humility increased perceived trustworthiness of the scientist (Studies 2-4), belief in their research (Studies 2-4), intentions to follow their research-based recommendations (Study 3), and information-seeking behavior (Study 4). We further demonstrated that these effects were not moderated by the scientist’s gender (Study 3) or race/ethnicity (Study 4).

          "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an existential threat to humanity, yet public awareness remains low. An underexplored tool for AMR risk communication is metaphor. By inviting a comparison between abstract and familiar concepts, metaphors can make complex health information more accessible. However, metaphor use in the context of AMR has been haphazard and remains poorly understood. We address this issue by providing an integrative content analysis of metaphor use in global, English-language, public AMR discourse. Four types of public sources were searched: (1) websites of 71 non-profit organisations, (2) national AMR action plans from 84 countries, (3) 819 international newspaper articles and (4) 2,616 social media posts. Across all sources, 2,149 metaphors excerpts were extracted. Qualitative content analysis identified 41 distinct metaphor themes, but 75% of metaphors fell into one of four themes: “War against resistance, infections and microbes”, “Heroes and villains of resistance”, “Post-antibiotic apocalypse and looming crisis of AMR”, and “Silent, creeping threat of AMR”. All key themes are inapt or theoretically problematic by painting a misleading picture of a finite struggle between good and evil, which does not match the ecological reality of a continuously evolving challenge. Furthermore, most existing metaphors are highly conventional and emotive. They aim to raise general awareness about AMR without conferring specific knowledge. Our findings call for an urgent re-framing. Media, policy makers and health officials should choose theoretically informed, apt and novel explanatory metaphors that are specific to the context of AMR and challenge public misunderstandings with the potential to prompt behaviour change.",

          "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that the psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic are heterogenous. We model classes in a dataset of emotional responses to the pandemic using latent class trajectory analysis on a panel dataset of UK-based participants. Participants (n=868) rated eight emotions on a nine-point Likert scale in April of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, and provided demographic variables, data on perceived social support and the impact of life events. Using a latent class trajectory analysis, we found evidence for six distinct latent trajectory classes: 68.3% of individuals belonged to classes with a pattern of well-coping (decreasing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions) while the remainder showed patterns of poor adjustment. Social support and negative life events were predictive of class membership in a multinomial logistic regression: low social support and experiencing negative life events increased the probability of participants belonging to poorly adjusted classes. Our study suggests that most individuals – over the period of four years - were able to adjust well to the pandemic, while a about one third of individuals struggled considerably. Social support may be of interest as a protective factor and could aid policy makers during future crises.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol is widely used, but motives for consumption vary. Since drinking motives are proximal predictors of initiation and escalation of alcohol use, accurate measurement of these motives is crucial. This study compared the psychometric properties – factor structure, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability- of the 12-item, 18-item, and the original 20-item versions of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire (DMQ). We also examined the associations between drinking motives and alcohol use outcomes using network analysis. A total of 434 adults (77.4% female) completed the baseline session and 130 (85.3% female) participated in a follow-up approximately two weeks later. Results showed that the subscales of the DMQ have good internal consistency ( .80) regardless of version. Test-retest reliability was acceptable to good (rs= .71-83) but was higher for social and enhancement than for conformity and coping motives. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 12-item short form outperforms the original 20-item version and the more recently proposed 18-item version. Partial correlation networks including DMQ subscales and alcohol outcomes revealed consistent positive association between social motives and binge drinking, alcohol use quantity per drink occasion and enhancement motives, while frequency of use was primarily associated with coping motives. However, while associations amongst drinking motives were identical in the 12- and 18-item version, these differed from the 20-item version. This study demonstrates how network models can be valuable tools in the validation and comparison of questionnaires and shows that the 12-item DMQ could be a good alternative for the often used longer forms.",

After a 2-week baseline phase, participants (Mage = 21.42 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental (N = 35) or a passive control (N = 32) condition. Participants in the experimental condition were asked to limit their SMU to a maximum of 30 minutes (divided across their preferred apps) per day for 2 consecutive weeks, while participants in the control condition were instructed to continue their SMU as usual. After the intervention phase, participants in both conditions were followed up for 2 weeks during which all restrictions were removed. During the experiment, participants reported on their self-esteem, mindfulness, sleep, and emotional well-being. Results indicate a main effect of time for most outcomes, but induced SMU restriction did not moderate these effects.

          "abstract": "The speech-to-song illusion is a phenomenon in which the continuous repetition of a spoken\nutterance induces the listeners to perceive it as more song-like. Thus far, this perceptual\ntransformation has been observed in mostly European languages, such as English; however,\nit is unclear whether the illusion is experienced by speakers of Bangla (Bengali), an\nIndo-Aryan language. The current study, therefore, investigates the illusion in 28 Bangla-\nand 31 English-speaking participants. The experiment consisted of a listening task in\nwhich participants were asked to rate their perception of repeating short speech stimuli on\na scale from 1 − 5, where 1 = \"sounds like speech\" and 5 = \"sounds like song\". The stimuli\nwere composed of English and Bangla utterances produced by two bilingual speakers. To\naccount for possible group differences in music engagement, participants self-reported\nmusical experience and also performed a rhythm discrimination task as an objective\nmeasure of non-verbal auditory sequence processing. Stimulus ratings were analysed with\ncumulative link mixed modelling. Overall, English- and Bangla-speaking participants rated\nthe stimuli similarly and, in both groups, better performance in the rhythm discrimination\ntask significantly predicted more song-like ratings beyond self-reported musical experience.\nEnglish speakers rated Bangla stimuli as significantly more song-like than English stimuli.\nBangla speakers did not distinguish between English and Bangla stimuli–possibly reflecting\ntheir enhanced understanding of English, in comparison to the English participants’\ncomprehension of Bangla. An exploratory acoustic analysis revealed a role of harmonic\nratio in the illusion for both language groups. These results demonstrate that the\nspeech-to-song-illusion occurs for Bangla speakers to a similar extent as English speakers\nand that, across both groups, sensitivity to non-verbal auditory structure is positively\ncorrelated with susceptibility to this perceptual transformation.",

At the core of the model is a dynamic retrieval process incorporating two essential mechanisms: iterative retrieval, whereby information is sequentially sampled from memory to access the full history of experiences; and competitive retrieval, whereby the most prominent features in memory inhibit the recollection of other features. Together with context-based encoding, the model quantitatively explains well-known facts about response order and inter-response times in recall experiments. We show that our retrieval process maps closely to existing decision frameworks, such as drift-diffusion models, suggesting that the memory system plays a fundamental role in a wide-ranging set of decision-making settings.",

          "abstract": "The rise of large language models and their impressive capabilities suggests their output is indistinguishable from human and that the Turing test has been passed definitively. Much existing work has focused on testing the capabilities of the models. However, it is unknown how people themselves conceive of artificial intelligence technology's putative knowledge or attitudes, and of how they differ from the mental states of humans. By exploring how people interrogate systems to decide whether they are natural or artificial, we show that people fail to spot large language model output most of the time, except for answers to factual questions. We found people systematically overestimate the use of personal questions in a Turing test. However, people are sensitive to brusque, cynical tone, slang and perceived idiosyncrasy as cues to natural human output. Despite claims the Turing test is becoming obsolete, we argue it endures as a probe of evolving lay intuitions about artificial intelligence and a way to track theory of mind expanding to encompass different sorts of mind.

          "abstract": "Counterfactual learning, which refers to learning from what could have happened under different circumstances, is crucial for understanding decision-making in humans. Recent studies have well characterized the computational and neural processes underlying this aspect of learning. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of attentional allocation towards the different alternatives faced by individuals, and their consequences. The present study explores the role of gaze and pupil dilation as potential indicators of counterfactual thinking during reinforcement learning tasks. By examining how these physiological measures correlate with the cognitive processes involved in evaluating both experienced and forgone outcomes, the research provides insights into the complex dynamics of human counterfactual learning. We recorded the gaze and pupil size of 36 participants engaged in a computer-based 2-arm bandit task with full information. The participants faced scenarios where they made choices and were then shown both the actual outcomes and hypothetical outcomes of unchosen options. While the overall pattern of allocation typically involved a first fixation on the factual outcome followed by a subsequent one on the counterfactual outcome, this pattern was affected differently by both outcomes’ value. On the other hand, pupil size reflected the outcome valence of the chosen option as well as the similarity between outcomes. These findings suggest that gaze dynamics and pupil dilation serve as effective biomarkers of counterfactual processing, reflecting the cognitive load and confirmation bias associated with such processes.",

In total, 104 German twelve-month-olds (57 female) observed an established imitation task (FIT 12, Goertz et al., 2006). The results revealed that infants anticipated action goals presented at a realistic speed. Furthermore, infants’ imitative behavior was related to their goal-predictive gaze shifts.

This study aims to address this gap by examining the vulnerabilities and health risks faced by this population. \n\nMaterials and methods: Individuals aged 18 and older filmed for pornography in Sweden were recruited to participate in face-to-face interviews. A total of 120 participants completed a combination of study-specific questions and standardized questionnaires on their background, experiences in pornography, and health status. Descriptive statistics were reported, and a regression analysis was performed to assess factors impacting PTSD severity. \n\nResults: Participants reported high levels of abuse both in childhood and during pornography production. Nearly all participants had experienced sexual abuse (88%), psychological abuse (90%), and physical abuse (79%) as children. This pattern of victimization continued into their involvement in pornography, where they were subjected to further abuse and exploitation, including verbal abuse (87%), rape (65%), physical assault (56%), third-party control (56%), and online harassment (57%). The consequences of this continuous polyvictimization were significant: 83% exhibited clinically significant PTSD, 69% had attempted suicide, and 80% had been diagnosed with at least one mental health problem. Our regression analysis found that childhood abuse, third-party control, and online violence were significant predictors of PTSD severity. \n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive legal, social, and mental health interventions to protect this highly vulnerable population and address the unique harms stemming from being documented in pornography.",

          "abstract": "Humans often need to make decisions that take future situations into account. This kind of sequential choice entails a trade-off between the present and the future, where decision-makers have to decide to accept or reject the currently available option. The approach-avoidance conflict, on the other hand, is a frequently used framework in psychology to study the behavioral trade-off regarding appetitive and aversive stimuli. This study investigates the influence of approach and avoidance conditions on sequential choice. Therefore, we developed experimental conditions in which participants should either approach or avoid environmental dangers in order to optimize their behavior. The main objective is to evaluate meta-decision making strategies under ecologically valid conditions. To accomplish this, we developed a game-like foraging paradigm with probabilistic outcomes where people could use different types of decision rules (or policies). While some policies would only account for one variable of our game environment, others would account for different variables depending on the time-point and the situation. Model comparisons allowed us to test whether participants would rely on a rather myopic/heuristic or a forward-looking policy. We then tested whether policies differed depending on our task’s approach and avoidance condition. Our findings suggest that people generally use a myopic strategy in sequential decision-making. However, we observe increased optimal behavior in situations where the environment bears higher dangers that should be avoided. We suspect the underlying mechanisms to be linked to an internal energetic trade-off between efficient and accurate meta-decision making depending on the risks imposed by the environment.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive dissonance, a fundamental psychological process involving inconsistent cognitions causing discomfort, may vary across cultures. These variations could be attributed to differences in the way people define themselves, known as “self-construal”. Previous cross-cultural studies on the role of self-construal in cognitive dissonance have mainly employed the free-choice paradigm. However, many concerns have been raised about the validity of this procedure and these studies, more generally. To address this issue, we will conduct secondary analyses to explore unexamined associations in a large existing dataset (Vaidis et al., 2024). Specifically, the current study will investigate the moderating role of individual (self-construal) and cultural (individualism) variables on dissonance effects following an induced-compliance paradigm across 18 countries (N = 3822). Based on the literature, we hypothesised that induced-compliance effects (i.e., adjusting attitude to match behaviour, particularly when it has been adopted freely) will be stronger for participants with higher individual self-construal scores (H1), in more individualistic countries (H2), and in countries with higher aggregated levels of independent self-construal (H3).

We analysed data (N=15,400) from undergraduate students over eight years across three campuses at an Australian tertiary institution. Using linear mixed models, we compared examination performance across different room scales, while accounting for coursework performance, and other variables. We found some evidence that student examination performance was worse in rooms with elevated ceiling heights, but additional modelling indicated a more complex relationship (where ceiling height might be linked to improved performance). These results provide tentative support for the notion that built environment scale influences cognitive performance, and suggest caution in conducting examinations in large scale, high-ceiling rooms.",

Additionally, suprathreshold sensitivities to temporal (TM), spectral (SM), and spectrotemporal (STM) modulation as well as binaural temporal fine structure (TFS) were estimated. Older adults showed worse speech in competition (SiC) performance with 6° and 45°, but not 0°, masker spatial locations and benefited less from only 45° of spatial separation compared to young controls for speech masking. For garbled-speech masking, older adults showed worse performance overall, but benefited similarly from spatial separation compared to young controls. Older adults also showed worse sensitivity for binaural TFS, but comparable TM, SM, and STM sensitivity. Age as well as TM and SM sensitivities predicted SiC performance, whereas STM and binaural TFS sensitivities did not.

          "abstract": "How is visual stability maintained across saccades? One theory poses the visual system assumes the external world as stable unless there is extreme evidence against it. As support, prior studies demonstrated a “blanking effect”. However, there remains a considerable gap between these findings discovered with impoverished sparse stimuli and understanding trans-saccadic stability in naturalistic scenes. Here we tested 19 adult observers in a blanking paradigm with naturalistic scene images: AI-generated “scene wheel” stimuli that varied in a continuous and quantifiable manner. Psychometric modeling revealed that inserting a brief blank screen during a saccade increased sensitivity to trans-saccadic scene changes and decreased the stability bias. These effects occurred only when observers made actual eye movements, but not when eye movements were simulated with retinal image shifts. These findings demonstrate that trans-saccadic memory of complex scenes and an overarching stability assumption work in tandem to achieve stable perceptual experience in natural environments.",

          "abstract": "When masked by competing speech, an utterance is more intelligible when it is spoken by someone familiar than a stranger (novel). If this benefit occurs because familiar voices are less cognitively demanding, then a concurrent task should disrupt perception of speech less if the carrier voice is familiar. Participants (N=30) heard two sentences spoken concurrently (familiar-novel or novel-novel) and reported the content of one (target) while ignoring the other (masker). Simultaneously, participants either ignored (single task) or tracked the location of four moving dots on a screen (dual task). Across both tasks, word-report was most accurate when the target voice was familiar, lower when both voices were novel, and lowest when the masker was familiar. The presence of the concurrent multiple object tracking (MOT) task decreased intelligibility of the novel but not the familiar target, suggesting that long-term memory for a voice can free up cognitive capacity to aid speech perception.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the importance of estimating demographic biases in research has become apparent. Here we provide a systematic review of the CHILDES database, the major source of naturalistic recordings of children’s linguistic environment. We analyzed the database according to four dimensions considered central to language learning: SES, urbanization, family structure, and language. We present descriptive statistics of each dimension to assess whether naturalistic recordings were biased regarding the demographics of the countries and the families recorded within them. We find that CHILDES’s recordings overrepresented wealthier countries and higher parental education levels; urban settings; and smaller households. Middle- and higher-class participants were likewise over-represented. The corpora were not representative of their countries in terms of urbanization either - with a larger percentage of families residing in urban settings than is overall true for their respective countries. In terms of family structure, nuclear families were more prevalent than in the countries where the data was collected. Last, we found that corpora were linguistically diverse, but we estimate that these recordings underrepresent bilingual and multilingual households. We conclude that researchers should be careful when generalizing from naturalistic recordings of children's input and output obtained from CHILDES.",

The study explored the perspectives of seven college faculty internship supervisors, eight accessibility advisors, and 14 students with diverse disabilities who were currently doing - or had recently completed - a required internship for their program. Thematic analysis was used to uncover key themes related to facilitators and barriers relevant to accessibility, knowledge, communication, disclosure / self-identification, policies / legislation, support strategies, and useful technologies. Highlights of our results indicate that accommodations that are typically available in college classrooms are not appropriate for most internship settings, that policies and procedure manuals related to accessibility supports / accommodations in internships are scarce, and that communication among faculty, students and accessibility advisors is poor and do not typically include on-site clinical supervisors. In addition, we found that students are often reluctant to self-identify as having a disability because of fear of stigma and professional concerns. A variety of technologies that can be useful in internship settings was identified, but participants noted that internship settings were often reluctant to use these because of concerns with patient confidentiality and biohazard safety. We recommend that colleges develop Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility (EDIA) policies that reflect internships and that communication structures be developed that allow all stakeholders to participate.",

The present research explored variation in profanity use generating jokes. A sample of adults (n = 618) completed a creative humor production task, and text-mining methods detected and coded the appearance and severity of profanity. Random forest models were used to identify potentially important predictors, such as variables relevant to profanity generally (e.g., age, gender, and personality) and variables specific to humor creation (e.g., humor self-concepts and self-ratings of their jokes’ funniness). Profanity in the jokes was reasonably common, used by 22% of the sample, diverse in type, and generally mild in severity. The random forest models identified a set of uniquely important predictors. Profanity use and severity were marked by being younger, identifying as male, rating one’s own jokes as funny, and expressing more confidence in one’s ability to be funny and make others laugh—a true profile in boorishness. The discussion explores roles for personality in indecorous humor and the broader question of strategic aspects of humor creation.",

Offloading strategies such as creating\nexternal reminders instead of relying on internal memory are highly effective and\nplay a key role in supporting real-world cognition.

These metacognitive biases\ncould potentially be mitigated by metacognitive interventions. However research\ninvestigating the effect of metacognitive interventions has produced mixed results.\nHere, we investigated the influence of a brief intervention comprising just five trials\nof metacognitive feedback during an initial practice session. After this intervention\nparticipants performed a memory task where they decided between using internal\nmemory (for maximum reward) or external reminders (for reduced reward),\nallowing us to determine the optimality of offloading strategies. The key difference\nfrom earlier work was that task performance determined financial reward, to\nincentivise optimal offloading.

          "abstract": "Mental health research often seeks to witness, understand and empower marginalised communities through methods such as qualitative research. Qualitative research favours rich and meaningful data segments representing peoples’ lived experiences. The neurodiversity movement has identified and challenged the ableism that can arise when applying research methods with normative assumptions about human minds and language production. However, schizophrenia and psychosis qualitative research has so far been under-considered in efforts to reduce these forms of ableism in research. This paper highlights how mental health researchers can resist and reject the ableism that comes from adopting ‘rich data’ as representative of the lived experiences of those with schizophrenia. Qualitative research may occlude the real experiences of individuals with schizophrenia if they are not heard or represented in the multitude of ways they communicate or articulate themselves, the language they use and the stories they tell. This article provides solutions to meaningfully represent those with schizophrenia and their voices in all stages of the research process so that the available research in the field accurately reflects the needs and experiences of those with schizophrenia.",

          "abstract": "HIV is a highly stigmatized condition, and negative beliefs about HIV and people with HIV are frequently internalized. This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

          "abstract": "In this review, challenges related to the measurement of word durations in language production are identified, highlighting gaps in current theoretical frameworks and the resulting difficulty in interpreting available evidence. To compensate for limited theoretical predictions regarding response durations in spoken language, we turn to other fields, such as written production and motor control, to provide informative analogies. In written production, reliable effects on durations have been observed but the field similarly suffers from the absence of clear predictions from the available models, limiting interpretations. Since word durations are the result of motor programming and execution, evidence from motor control is particularly relevant. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that planning and execution stages overlap in time, with response planning continuing even after the initiation of the motor response, making variations in durations arise from either planning or execution processes. In addition, they propose a gating mechanism to launch response initiation. Similar dynamics could be easily assumed in language production, which could help bridge the gap from response selection to response execution and extend current models of language production to account for motor execution and predict word durations. We end by outlining pending questions for the field of language production, and some recommendations to tackle them in the future.",

          "abstract": "Neuromodulation was utilized here to investigate the distinct involvement of two recognized cortical hubs for semantic integration (the left anterior temporal lobe, lATL) and inhibitory control (the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, rDLPFC) in creative problem-solving. Participants were presented with a list of category-exemplar words, selectively recalled some of them, and then solved a set of RAT problems. Selective retrieval was introduced to trigger inhibitory control over competitors. Critically, some RAT problems could be solved with words from the previous phases of the experiment, including words that might be less accessible due to inhibition. Other problems, however, could only be solved with unpresented words. Experiment 1 showed that anodal tDCS over the lATL had a negative effect on the production of correct responses to baseline RAT problems, but not on those that required inhibited solutions. Experiment 2 produced the reverse pattern with cathodal tDCS over the rDLPFC. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained before and after delivering tDCS, which also revealed specific tDCS-induced changes in frequency bands depending on the site of stimulation. Overall, these findings provide support for the involvement of semantic and control processes in creative problem solving that are linked to different brain networks.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Based on Fowler’s wide definition of faith as finding meaning in life, and progressing with his perspective on faith as a typology of hierarchically ordered styles that can optimally be assessed with the faith development interview (FDI), this study breaks new ground by investigating predictors and outcomes of faith development. \nMethods: This investigation is possible, because in two decades of mixed-method research with the FDI in the USA and Germany, we accumulated over 1500 FDIs including n = 324 longitudinal cases with at least one re-interview. Based on this longitudinal sample, this article presents results from quantitative analysis of faith development associated with a wide range of variables. \nResults: Results confirm assumptions that faith development predicts the rejection of the representation of God as authoritarian and predicts the rejection of xenophobia and other prejudice. Faith development also results in higher need for cognition, tolerance of ambiguity, and openness to revising one’s viewpoint. Predictors for faith development are high openness to experience, low frequency of payer and of experience of divine intervention. Predictors are also low agreement to the truth of texts and religious teachings (Religious Schema Scale, RSS), high agreement to the fairness, tolerance and rational choice schema (RSS) and to the xenosophic-dialogical schema (RSS) that features openness to the alien and strange. \nDiscussion: After two decades of faith development research, we thus can present predictive validity for the RSS and, based on this evidence, conclude that the RSS can be used to predict faith development.",

Our study addresses the two main limitations of existing research by (a) using a precise, LLM-based surprisal measure and (b) including the largest sample size to date by a factor of four. Although the expected syntactic priming effect was reliably observed, the present data provided strong Bayesian evidence against a prime-surprisal effect (which was also not significant in any frequentist analysis). These results confirm that the previous inconsistent results are not due to low sample sizes or inaccurate surprisal measurements. Crucially, the unreliable nature of the prime surprisal effect casts doubt upon the suitability of using this method for investigating error-based learning in future work.",

However, the mechanism underlying people’s willingness to exert effort in exchange for information remains unclear. Previous work has suggested that valence and uncertainty are two key factors influencing information-seeking, but few studies have tested if these factors are important when exerting physical effort in exchange for information. Additionally, it remains unknown whether different kinds of uncertainty, i.e., risk and ambiguity, have differential impacts. In the current study, we developed a novel information-seeking task to quantify the value of non-instrumental information using incentive-compatible physical effort to examine how effort changes as a function of valence and uncertainty. Across two studies (N = 123), we found that people’s willingness to exert effort positively correlates with outcome expected value under both risk and ambiguity. Additionally, people exert more effort when outcome distribution uncertainty increases in risky situations, but are insensitive to ambiguity, except when facing extreme ambiguity. Our results demonstrate an unexpected dissociation. Humans will\nengage in effort-based information-seeking, even for non-instrumental information, when facing risk. In contrast, they show a much lower willingness to expend effort to resolve non-instrumental ambiguity.",

Yet hidden at the core of such everyday routines are specific functional relationships between objects, such as a carafe and a mug, a knife and a loaf, or a key and a lock. G&amp;H’s article was a turning point in a long but sparse tradition of research that had considered such relations from a vision-science perspective (e.g., Scholl &amp; Tremoulet, 2000), as it steered many researchers — ourselves included — to explore questions in the burgeoning field now known as “relation perception.” This field advances the idea that, beyond objects, features, and locations, the visual system extracts and represents relations — properties that specify interactions or connections between objects, rather than each object’s characteristics.

          "authors": "Xiaohui Rao; Hanlin Wu; Zhenguang Garry Cai",
          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly proficient at engaging in human-like conversations, it is essential to understand how people process language generated by LLMs compared to language produced by humans. During language comprehension, people interpret incoming linguistic input by integrating it with their world knowledge (e.g., semantic anomalies can elicit an N400 effect in brain potentials) and linguistic knowledge (e.g., syntactic anomalies can lead to a P600 effect). Crucially, people adjust their language comprehension based on the perceived demographic attributes of the speaker, which has been shown to modulate both semantics-sensitive N400 and syntax-sensitive P600 effects. In two ERP experiments, we investigated whether people are sensitive to the fact that LLMs excel in linguistic formulation (i.e., consistently producing grammatically correct texts) but are prone to hallucination (i.e., occasionally generating nonsensical content). Participants were informed that they would be reading texts previously generated by either an LLM or a human. Experiment 1 revealed an N400 effect for semantically anomalous sentences compared to semantically coherent ones. Importantly, the N400 effect was smaller for LLM-generated texts than for human-generated texts. Furthermore, participants who more strongly believed that LLMs possess human-like knowledge exhibited a larger N400 effect. Experiment 2 demonstrated a P600 effect for syntactic anomalies in LLM-generated texts, with the effect being larger for LLM-generated texts than for human-generated texts (and not statistically significant in the latter). These findings suggest that people’s expectations about LLMs’ potential for hallucination and near-perfect grammatical competence modulate the way they comprehend LLM-generated texts. This research highlights the importance of considering perceived language model attributes when studying human language comprehension in the context of AI-generated texts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Access to mental health care is limited by financial, time, and resource restraints. Massive open online interventions (MOOIs), a form of online self-directed mental health interventions, work to address these barriers by providing evidence-based interventions to many individuals at little to no cost. The present meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of MOOIs to inform the development of future MOOIs for mental health. \n\nMethods: Following the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review of research investigating fully online and self-directed mental health interventions was conducted within the PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Academic Search Complete databases. Random effect models were used to calculate pooled effect sizes using mean differences for mental health outcomes to determine the efficacy of MOOIs. Person-level (age, gender, continental location) and program-level (control type, inclusion criteria, therapeutic orientation, treatment components, treatment format, time to follow-up, treatment duration) moderators were examined with mixed-effect or meta-regression models.  \n\nResults: The meta-analysis included 31 articles with 10397 participants. MOOIs (n = 5235) were more effective at reducing mental health symptoms versus controls (n = 5162). Small intervention effect sizes were observed for anxiety, depression, sleep, and stress at post-treatment. At follow-up, all mental health outcomes were null. Subgroup analyses indicated studies had a larger effect size at post-treatment if they had an inactive control (vs. active), were conducted in Europe (vs. other continental locations), and delivered the intervention through web-based formats (vs. mobile applications). No other moderators were significant. \n\nConclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrates the positive potential impact of MOOIs in reducing mental health symptomology across various populations. However, due to the limited findings, it cannot be concluded which intervention components led to the most favourable outcomes and for whom may benefit most from MOOIs. Further research should investigate which aspects of MOOIs lead to meaningful results to help design and implement more effective self-directed online interventions.",

          "abstract": "People represent many categories and their features as determined by intrinsic essences. These essentialist beliefs reflect biased views of the world that can hinder scientific reasoning and contribute to social prejudice. To consider the extent to which such essentialist views originate from culturally-situated processes, the present study tested the developmental trajectories of essentialist beliefs among children growing up in the United States and China (N = 531; ages 3-6). Essentialist beliefs emerged across early childhood in both communities, but their instantiation and trajectories varied across cultures. In the sample from the United States (but not from China), essentialist beliefs that categories and their features are fixed-at-birth and inflexible increased across age. On the other hand, in the sample from China, children held stronger beliefs that categories are objective and explanatory, and viewed them as more homogenous with age. Children sampled from these two contexts also showed variation in basic explanatory, linguistic, and inferential processes, suggesting that cultural variation in the development of essentialism across childhood might reflect variation in the basic conceptual biases that children rely on to build intuitive theories of the world.",

          "abstract": "Are distributional learning mechanisms capable of complex linguistic inferences\nrequiring compositional generalization? This question has become contentious with\nthe development of large language models, which mimic human language abilities in\nmany ways, but which struggle with compositional generalization. We investigated\na set of qualitatively different distributional models (word co-occurrence models,\ngraphical models, recurrent neural networks, and transformers), by training them\non a carefully controlled artificial language containing combinatorial dependencies\ninvolving multiple words, and then testing them on novel sequences containing\ndistributionally overlapping combinatorial dependencies. In this work, we show that\ngraphical network models and transformer models, but not co-occurrence space models\nand recurrent neural networks, were able to perform compositional generalization.\nThe work demonstrates that some distributional models can perform compositional\ngeneralization, and their success or failure turns on their ability of the models to\nrepresenting words both individually and as a part of the phrases in which they\nparticipated.",

          "abstract": "The present study investigates the development of single word processing and multiple word processing skills in French-speaking children from Grade 2 to Grade 6. One hundred and fifty children participated in two tasks: a Lexical Decision Task (LDT) and a Grammatical Decision Task (GDT). The LDT was used to test single word processing abilities whereas the GDT was used to test multiple word processing abilities. Signal detection theory analysis revealed that all children performed well in the LDT, whereas a different pattern emerged in the GDT, where only Grade 4 and Grade 6 children performed above chance in this task. Then, a cluster analysis was used to investigate the relation between LDT and GDT sensitivity. The analysis revealed two clusters that differed in reading fluency and sensitivity in both tasks. Children from Cluster 2, who exhibited the highest sensitivity in the LDT, were the only ones to perform on average above the chance level in the GDT. Moreover, a strong correlation (r = .64) between LDT and GDT performance was found in this group. Finally, we found that a sensitivity of 1.95 in the LDT almost perfectly predicted cluster membership. We estimated that such sensitivity is achieved at Grade 3, suggesting that the ability to process multiple word sequences first requires sufficient efficiency in processing words in isolation. Once this turning point is reached, single word processing skills support the development of multiple word processing, which could take several years to mature fully.",

          "abstract": "Despite the established efficacy of exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder, it is commonly underutilized by practitioners due to misconceptions and fears about negative outcomes. However, it is unknown if the general population holds similar misgivings. The current study attempted to gauge public perceptions of exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder using a series of surveys and vignettes in an online sample (n =495). Half of the sample was unfamiliar with exposure and response prevention. Respondents rated exposure effectiveness below many alternate interventions, some of which have been shown to exacerbate obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In general, participants viewed the examples of exposure therapy as traumatizing, dangerous, unethical, and ineffective at treating obsessive-compulsive disorder. These views were consistent for exposures related to contamination, responsibility for harm, and unacceptable thoughts, but not for “not just right” experiences. These results highlight the importance of efforts to inform the public of evidence- based treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPurpose. In March 2020, a unique situation unfolded wherein the UK government announced social restriction measures to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Various remained in place until April 2021, with older adults, who were considered clinically vulnerable, being placed under stricter restrictions. This study aimed to determine the impact of psychosocial factors, including loneliness, depression, and engagement in various recreational lifestyle activities, on hearing and cognitive function in younger and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nMethods. 112 older adults (62 female) aged 60-82 (M = 70.08, SD = 5.89), and 121 younger adults (85 female) aged 18-29 (M = 20.52, SD = 2.63) participated online between June 2020 - February 2022. Participants completed questionnaires assessing loneliness, depression, auditory and lifestyle engagement, and hearing ability, as well as behavioural tasks assessing auditory function and global cognition. All measures were completed 12 times at 4-week intervals. \nResults. Linear mixed effects analyses found that, of the variables examined, increased loneliness was a significantly associated with poorer auditory function. There were no main effects of time during the pandemic on auditory or cognitive outcomes. However, the interaction between time and age group significantly impacted global cognition; in younger adults, global cognition decreased overtime, whereas older adults displayed an unexpected positive change. \nConclusions. These data show that there are associations between loneliness and auditory function but provide a lack of support for the impact of time experiencing auditory deprivation, or other psychosocial factors, on hearing and cognitive function. Such observations may be underpinned by motivational differences, learning effects, or sample biases. Future research may wish to investigate these factors further, to determine how psychological factors like loneliness impact hearing and wider brain function across diverse participant groups.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly transformed numerous facets of both private and professional life. Understanding how people evaluate AI is crucial for predicting its future adoption and addressing potential barriers. However, existing instruments measuring attitudes towards AI often suffer from conceptual and psychometric limitations. To address this gap, this study introduces the nine-item Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence in Work, Healthcare, and Education (ATTARI-WHE) scale. Using a diverse sample of N = 1,083 respondents from Germany, the psychometric properties of the instrument were evaluated. The results demonstrated low rates of missing responses, minimal response biases, and a robust measurement model that was invariant across sex, age, education, and employment status. These findings support the use of the ATTARI-WHE to assess AI attitudes in the work, healthcare, and education domains, with three items each. Its brevity makes it particularly well-suited for use in social surveys, web-based studies, or longitudinal research where assessment time is limited.",

          "abstract": "Excess clothing consumption severely harms the environment, through greenhouse gas emissions, resource degradation and water pollution. For consumers, however, the trade-off between this environmental impact and the convenience of “fast fashion” is hidden at the point of purchase. We present a pre-registered, experimental test of two clothing eco-labelling systems using a large, representative sample of consumers (N = 1,200). Participants used a simulated online clothing store, with some chosen at random to receive their selected items. They were randomised to see (i) a binary label, informed by existing policy, applied to the most sustainable products, (ii) a colour-coded, graded “eco-score” applied to all products, or (iii) no label. Compared to the control condition, participants exposed to binary label chose 10% more sustainable products. Eco-score participants, however, chose 20% more, and were twice as likely to exclusively buy the most sustainable products. There was no effect on the number of items purchased, implying a shift towards more sustainably produced clothing. Exploratory analyses revealed that the effects were driven by greater salience of the eco-score system and that effects were stronger among those most concerned about the environment. Those who saw the eco-labels reported the same level of shopping satisfaction and willingness to wear selected clothes as those in the control condition. Additional findings revealed a general underestimation of clothing production's environmental impact and strong support for implementing the eco-score both online and in-store. The results have implications for enabling informed consumer choice in the clothing market.",

          "abstract": "People's subjective conceptions of truth and honesty have undergone significant changes in recent decades. Parts of society increasingly favour the sincere expression of personal belief,\nhowever inaccurate, over verifiable facts. This trend has been accompanied by increasing norm violations by political elites which have been identified as a significant contributor to democratic backsliding. Those two trends highlight the need for a thorough examination of the nexus between norm violations and conceptions of honesty. We present a series of preregistered studies that examined the conditions under which people acquiesce to democratic norm violations and politicians’ dishonesty. We find that when participants are asked to take a perspective of honesty that emphasises sincerity over accuracy, which we call ``belief-speaking'', they are more willing to accept norm violations by politicians than if participants take a perspective that emphasizes accuracy as a criterion for honesty, which we call ``fact-speaking''. When a fictitious politician is presented as telling untruths, tolerance of norm violations is reduced compared to when the politician is presented as truthful. The findings highlight the need to develop a better understanding of how individuals interpret and respond to political leaders’ behaviours, especially within the evolving landscape of  perception and the ensuing threats to democratic stability.",

This study aimed to address these inconsistencies through two preregistered replication experiments, examining the role of relational mobility as a potential moderating factor across different cultural contexts. Contrary to initial findings, our results from Experiment 1 in Japan (n = 254), Experiment 2 in Japan and the Netherlands (n = 263 and 300, respectively), and an exploratory statistical modeling revealed a consistent pattern where guilt led to compensation directed at the victim, sacrificing own resources, irrespective of the country or levels of perceived relational mobility.",

Science Adventures (SA), one of a handful of such programmes in the UK, serves as an exemplary model, bringing primary school aged children and their families in the UK to university campuses during school holidays to participate in interactive, science-focused educational activities, whilst simultaneously contributing to live research studies. Here we provide a review of the current obstacles of carrying out developmental science and how initiative like SA can help mitigate the issues faced. This includes the practicalities of organising such events to building long-term reciprocal relationships with the community.

          "abstract": "Trust in mainstream institutions is declining while people are increasingly turning to alternative media and conspiracy theories. Previous research has suggested that these trends may be linked, but the dynamics of trust across multiple sources has received little investigation. Is trust a neutral process, where each source is judged independently, is it a zero-sum competition, where a loss for one side is a gain for the other, or does losing trust in one source in foster a more generalized sense of distrust? Across three experimental studies (N = 2,951) we examined how people react when a source makes a serious error, testing several potential models of trust dynamics. We found that regardless of whether the outlet is mainstream, counter-mainstream, or neutral, trust drops for the erring source but does not rise for its competitors. This was the case in the context of both food regulations and COVID-19 precautions. Such a pattern suggest that each source may be judged independently of others. However, in several cases, an error made by one source led to a loss of trust in all sources, suggesting that rather than choosing sides between competing sources, people are also judging the media landscape as a whole to discern if it is feasible to find trustworthy information. However, correlational data did also find that the more people saw a source as politicized, the less they trusted that source and the more they trusted its competitors.",

This study aimed to identify tattoo artists’ (TAs’) perspectives on the types, impacts, barriers, and facilitators of therapeutic tattooing for CSs and the impact of doing this work on themselves.\n\nMethods: Twenty-two international TAs who tattoo CSs were interviewed and resultant transcripts were analysed thematically. \nResults: The following themes emerged: Emotional Management of Artists, Emotional Transformation of CSs, Stigma and its effects on CSs, Artist Barriers, CS Barriers, Artist Facilitators, and CS Facilitators. The findings also identify a typology of cancer survivorship therapeutic tattoos.\n\nConclusion: This is the first study to identify barriers/facilitators of therapeutic tattooing, a typology of cancer survivorship therapeutic tattoos, TAs’ perspectives on therapeutic tattooing, and potential negative outcomes from this practice. The findings indicate that therapeutic tattooing can be both beneficial and harmful for CSs and TAs, that there is a need for better therapeutic tattooing training for TAs and healthcare providers (HPs), increased awareness of therapeutic tattoos, a reduction in barriers to the practice and greater collaboration between HPs and TAs. \n\nImplications for Cancer Survivors: Findings from this study have major policy implications for healthcare systems, non-profit organizations, and regulatory bodies, which could serve to empower cancer survivors to make more informed decisions about their bodies and support enhanced training and accreditation of this practice.",

After being assessed for SDO and street harassment tolerance, 136 Italian and 113 British heterosexual men viewed a video of a woman repeatedly subjected to street harassment. Participants reported beliefs about the emotions experienced by the victim and were again assessed for street harassment. Results revealed that street harassment tolerance both before and after the video was independently associated with lower cognitive empathy and higher SDO. These effects replicated across the two cultures. These findings suggest two possible attitudinal and cognitive targets for reducing street harassment tolerance across societies.",

          "authors": "Michaela Bocheva",
          "abstract": "It is well known that perception and cognition are systematically biased towards the recent past. That is, a decision about the current state of a perceptual feature (e.g., orientation) can be predicted based on a recent state of the same feature. Such serial dependencies have been demonstrated across perception, memory, and cognition, and have been jointly attributed to an adaptive mechanism meant to promote stability in a constantly changing environment. Here, we argue that this adaptive mechanism prioritizes past information on the most basic structural level, such that the strength of the attractive bias is modulated by the amount of structural coherence in stimuli. We presented visual patterns of varied structural disorder (randomness) prior to a recognition memory decision that required discriminating between trained and novel visual patterns. Both highly generic geometrical shapes and completely random patterns failed to elicit an effect on decisional response times. By contrast, we found recognition memory decisions to be significantly faster in trials where the irrelevant probe pattern was “optimally” random. This result suggests that decision-making is influenced by the past’s informational worth. More importantly, it suggests an optimal amount of uncertainty to facilitate future decisions.",

          "abstract": "Sexual misperceptions refer to instances in which individuals wrongly infer sexual interest from other people. Traditionally, such sexual misperceptions have been studied within the dating context among student samples primarily. Our research extends this line of research and examines sexual misperceptions in the workplace. In a two-wave survey (N = 212), we show that employees with a higher dominance motivation are more likely to perceive sexual interest in the behavior of a co-worker with a different gender, regardless of one’s own gender or formal power position. In a preregistered three-wave survey (N = 349) we further show that perceptions of sexual interest are positively associated with the likelihood to sexually harass co-workers, and that perceptions of sexual interest mediate the positive relationship between dominance motivation and sexual workplace harassment. We discuss theoretical and practical contributions of our findings as well as suggestions for future research.",

          "authors": "Zachary J Williams; D. Jonah Barrett; Carissa J. Cascio; Tiffany G. Woynaroski",
          "abstract": "Background: Between 50–70% of autistic individuals report clinically significant decreased sound tolerance (DST; i.e., difficulty tolerating sound in one’s environment) at some point in their lives. DST in autism comprises multiple distinct disorders, including hyperacusis (the perception of moderate-intensity sounds as excessively loud or physically painful) and misophonia (a neuropsychiatric condition in which specific “trigger” sounds cause excessive emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, and disgust), although few studies to date have distinguished these conditions from one another or studied their correlates independently. \n\nMethods: A sample of 936 independent autistic adults was recruited from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort. Hyperacusis and misophonia case status were operationalized using self-report survey items reflecting DST symptom endorsement and functional impairment. Univariate and multivariate Bayesian models were then used to examine the demographic and clinical correlates of each DST diagnosis (both alone and independently of the other condition) in the autistic adult population. \n\nResults: Hyperacusis and misophonia were strongly correlated. Accordingly, all significant correlates in univariate analyses were found to associate with both conditions. In multivariate analyses (including control for depression and generalized anxiety, which strongly related to DST symptoms), both disorders were independently associated with female sex; increased autistic traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and phonophobia symptoms; and increased likelihood of seeking medical care for DST. Most other significant correlates (primarily hearing-related or neurological symptoms/disorders) were found to be associated only with hyperacusis rather than misophonia, although misophonia was uniquely associated with anger symptoms and identification as a gender minority. \n\nConclusion: Both hyperacusis and misophonia explain substantial variance in clinical outcomes of interest in the autistic population and demonstrate utility as additional diagnoses for autistic adults who experience debilitating DST symptoms within clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether perceived racial and ethnic discrimination mediates the relationship between race and impulsivity, as measured by delay discounting, among adolescents aged 10–11 years.\nMethods: Utilizing data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study release 5.1, we analyzed a sample of 3,857 participants who completed the delay discounting task and perceived discrimination measures at the year-one follow-up. Delay discounting was assessed through a hypothetical monetary choice task, with the area under the curve (AUC) serving as the primary measure of impulsivity—lower AUC scores indicate higher impulsivity. Perceived discrimination was measured using an adapted Perceived Discrimination Scale. Linear mixed-effects regression models examined the direct effects of race, socioeconomic factors, age, and gender on impulsivity, as well as the mediating effect of perceived discrimination.\nResults: Black adolescents exhibited significantly lower AUC scores compared to White adolescents (p &lt; 0.05), indicating higher impulsivity. When perceived discrimination was included in the model, the effect of being Black on impulsivity was no longer significant, suggesting mediation. Perceived discrimination was associated with lower AUC scores (p &lt; 0.05), reflecting greater impulsivity. Males demonstrated higher impulsivity than females (p &lt; 0.001), consistent across models.\nConclusion: Perceived racial and ethnic discrimination significantly mediates the relationship between being Black and higher impulsivity in early adolescence. These findings underscore the importance of addressing discrimination to reduce racial disparities in impulsivity and associated risk behaviors. Interventions focusing on both systemic factors contributing to discrimination and enhancing individual coping strategies are crucial for promoting equitable developmental outcomes among minority adolescents.",

First of all， this paper discusses the essence of consciousness， puts forward the theoretical framework of subject angle， and points out that consciousness is the content change of subject angle， which corresponds to the structural change of entity one by one. Then， through concrete examples， such as animal conscious neural network， this paper expounds in detail how consciousness is related to the main structure， neural network structure and the objective world.

The content change of the subject angle corresponds to the structural change of the entity one by one. The change of internal structure of some complex entities can partially respond to external interaction. The change of entity structure， the corresponding change form in its subject angle is its subjective content. Even if a third-party entity can observe its change through induction， the angle change of the third-party entity and the main angle change of the entity structure cannot be exactly the same.\n2. 主体角度的唯一真实性\n主体角度的变化是对这个主体来说唯一真实的存在。两个实体在相互作用中，一个实体的主观角度来看，外界从空无产生了存在内容。这个过程中主体只能改变自身结构，主体角度的内容也是和自身结构变化一一对应。如果这个实体具有的内部结构可以对外界变化进行特征识别实现部分对应，那么其主观角度的存在内容就可以模拟相互作用中外界对其产生作用的事物。在具有显意识的动物中，这个主体角度的变化就是显意识。\n主体角度内容和所谓的第三方客观角度内容不同，因为第三方客观角度是抽象出来的一种对真实实体的抽象模拟形象，并不是真实实体的绝对客观形象，每个真实实体都具有无限多的角度形象，所以相当于是无形的。\n主体角度内容是实体能感应到的唯一真实存在，只是其客观对应的是自身的结构，如果模拟外界事物那就不是客观的了。\n3. 主体角度的非空间性\n所谓的客观空间只是一种对外部世界的抽象模型中的基础理解框架。这种世界抽象模型具有日常实践有效性，因此被认为是真实的。但是，主体角度对外界的一切内容都是模拟的，主体角度只代表自身的感觉。\n一些复杂的实体，通过视觉和触觉这种相互作用方式，根据长期互动积累的经验将自身感受状态映射为外界事物形象，以此形成所谓的客观世界。这个客观世界所具有的空间性，来自于思维对变化视觉景象和触觉变化存在一致性的抽象，这种抽象模型通过三个空间维度来解释外界变化，在一般的互动中非常有效，所以就被当做是真相。\n一切所谓的世界模型都是基于主体角度，对真实的无限维度本体进行模拟，所得到内容都是不真实的。主体角度只能对应自身变化，外界世界都是对变化建立的世界模型。",

          "abstract": "The role of the early life gut microbiome in children’s risk for psychopathology has gained increasing interest in recent years. Most research on this topic has focused on the first three to four years of life because this is a critical period for developing connections between the gut microbiome and the brain. Prior research has identified associations between variability in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in infancy and markers of temperamental risk for psychopathology, including negative affect. However, the specific microbes affected, and the directionality of these associations have differed between studies, likely due to differences in the developmental period of focus and assessment approaches. In the current preregistered study, we examined connections between the gut microbiome, assessed at two time points in infancy (2 weeks and 18 months of age), and negative affect measured at 30 months of age in a longitudinal study of infants and their caregivers. We found that infants with higher gut microbiome diversity and Veillonella abundance at 2 weeks of age, and higher Ruthenibacterium abundance at 18 months, showed more observed negative affect during a study visit at 30 months. These results suggest timing-specific associations between the gut microbiome and negative affect even within this early critical period.",

          "abstract": "The categorization of complex real-world stimuli, such as facial expressions, appears to vary greatly between people. This raises a crucial methodological challenge: how is it possible to elicit the mental representation of a complex category for a specific individual? Comprehensive category-elicitation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP) work well across populations, but  converge too slowly to be usable with individual participants. Here, we address the problem of slow convergence with a new method: combining MCMCP with an adapted Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) acting as a “gatekeeper”. We tested this approach in a new experiment (N=90) on facial affect comparing MCMCP with the “gatekeeper” (MCMCPG) against baseline MCMCP and other variants. MCMCPG converged substantially faster than the other methods, in about 10 minutes for our task, with showing more representative recovered faces than its competitors. Further analyses captured participants’ substantial individual differences in a categorization task at an individual level. And, uniquely, the resulting model generalized these individual differences to real-world faces outside of our training set. Our study demonstrates the potential of MCMCPG for investigating generalizable human representations of complex stimuli at the individual level and illustrates the power of integrating Artificial Intelligence into psychological experiments.",

          "authors": "Giovanni Federico; Ciro Rosario Ilardi",
          "abstract": "Technological cognition—the capacity of humans to generate and interact with technology—emerges from the interplay of multiple neurocognitive systems. This perspective article proposes an integrated model grounded in physical understanding, synthesizing recent advances in cognitive neuroscience. We argue that technological cognition arises from the coordination of semantic knowledge, technical reasoning, visuospatial and motor skills, and social cognition. Key brain regions implicated include the parietal lobes—particularly the superior and inferior parietal cortices—the inferior frontal gyrus, and the temporal lobes. These areas support functions ranging from tool use and mechanical problem-solving to conceptual understanding and social learning. We suggest that technological artefacts not only reflect but also extend human cognitive capacities, forming a dynamic exchange between individual cognition and the environment. This integrated approach may have significant implications for clinical practice, education, and policy, offering potential pathways for novel diagnostic technologies and inclusive innovation. We advocate for interdisciplinary research to further elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning technological cognition and to explore how different technologies may engage distinct cognitive processes and neural pathways. Understanding these mechanisms may foster a society better equipped to handle future challenges, ensuring that technological progress remains a shared human endeavor.",

          "abstract": "Remembering the unfolding of past experiences usually takes less time than their actual duration. In this study, we examined the extent to which this temporal compression in memory depends on the number and duration of events that need to be maintained in a sequence. Participants were asked to watch and then mentally replay short videos depicting one, two, or three continuous events (i.e., people performing continuous actions in an uninterrupted way), each lasting 3, 6, 9, or 12 s. We computed remembering duration and a temporal compression index for each event. Results showed that event remembering duration was close to the actual event duration for short events, but smaller for longer ones (i.e., temporal compression was not systematic but occurred selectively depending on event duration). Furthermore, events were mentally replayed more quickly when they were part of a sequence of several events than when they were presented alone, and this decrease in the duration of event recall with the number of events was more pronounced for longer events. These results suggest that working memory capacity in representing naturalistic events is limited by both the number and duration of events to be retained, which may in part explain why the unfolding of events is temporally compressed in episodic memory.",

However, a meta-analysis of studies exploring this link has not yet been conducted. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify employer attitudes and potential discrimination towards people living with psychosis.\n\nStudy Design\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining employer attitudes and hiring practices towards individuals with psychosis was conducted. Electronic databases were searched from inception to July 15, 2024. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on six studies meeting our inclusion criteria.\n\n\nStudy Results\nStudies included in the systematic review consistently found that employers view individuals with psychosis as less employable compared to those with other health conditions or no disabilities. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant medium to large pooled effect size (Hedges g) of 0.57 (95% CI [0.21 to 0.94], p = 0.010), indicating statistically significant discrimination. Subgroup analysis estimated that 76.00% (95% CI [62.90% to 89.09%], p &lt;0.001) of employers expressed negative attitudes towards hiring individuals with psychosis.\n\nConclusions\nThis first meta-analysis on the topic reveals statistically significant (p = 0.010) employer discrimination towards individuals with psychosis, contributing to poor employment outcomes. Findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address misconceptions and promote inclusive hiring practices. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating strategies to reduce workplace stigma and improve employment outcomes for people living with psychosis, potentially through adaptations of evidence-based supported employment models such as Individual Placement and Support (IPS).",

          "authors": "James B. Wyngaarden; Tania Giovannetti; Bart Krekelberg; David Victor Smith",
          "abstract": "Financial exploitation of older adults has become an increasingly urgent public health issue, with annual losses exceeding $10 billion in the US annually. This exploitation often stems from age-related cognitive deficits, such as impairments in working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are linked to deterioration of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A critical yet understudied component of age-related cognitive decline is confirmation bias—the tendency to interpret new information in a way that conforms to one’s pre-existing beliefs. As older adults focus more on present-oriented goals related to social and emotional satisfaction, their ability to recognize and respond to exploitative situations may decrease. This problem worsens with the progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, increasing vulnerability to fraud. Despite these links, little is known about how confirmation bias is associated with future cognitive decline and risk for fraud. Two main challenges impede progress: the lack of knowledge about the latent processes that shape confirmation bias in this population, and the reliance on correlations between brain responses and behavior that do not clarify causal mechanisms. To address these issues, this chapter provides an overview of confirmation bias and its connection to aging. It then addresses adverse effects of confirmation bias before highlighting strengths of noninvasive brain stimulation as a method of investigating these relationships further.",

Previous research has individually examined specific aspects of entrepreneurial (vs managerial) work, but limited studies have examined their effects holistically. Using a wide range of survey instruments, we took an exploratory data-driven approach to explore the entrepreneurial-managerial spectrum. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five latent factors driving variance in our data: Negative Emotions, Fulfillment &amp; Support, Creative Capacity, Collaborative Personality, and Decision-Making Avoidance &amp; Hypervigilance. When explored as a traditional dichotomy, our results found that entrepreneurs scored lower than managers in Decision-Making Avoidance &amp; Hypervigilance and Collaborative Personality. On the other hand, as a spectrum, data suggested an increase in Creative Capacity and a decrease in Decision-Making Avoidance &amp; Hypervigilance with increasing entrepreneurial experience.

This study examined the relationship between these individual differences and long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Externally learned values are acquired through externally guided decision making (EDM), in which feedback confirms decision accuracy, whereas intrinsically learned values are acquired through internally guided decision making (IDM), based solely on personal preferences without feedback. The participants learned the value of the four stimuli in an EDM task, and subsequently performed an IDM task with these learned stimuli and 11 new stimuli. Resting-state EEG signals were recorded before and after both the tasks. The results indicated that individuals with a higher alpha-range LRTC prioritize intrinsically learned values over externally learned values in the IDM. These findings were discussed in relation to individual differences in alpha wave-gating function and self-specificity of intrinsic brain activity contribute to the prioritization of self-related preferences in free choice.",

          "authors": "Ria H. A. Hoekstra; Jill de Ron; Sacha Epskamp; Donald Robinaugh; Denny Borsboom",
          "abstract": "The network theory of psychopathology posits that mental disorders are stable states of symptom activation that arise from networks of causally interrelated symptoms. Based on this theory, it can be inferred that, ceteris paribus, a person with a more strongly connected symptom network (i.e., a network characterized by more and stronger causal relationships), may have an increased risk of developing a mental disorder. Researchers have started to take an interest in idiographic networks to evaluate this theoretical position. However, there are good reasons to question whether the dynamics implied by these models make them suitable for evaluating the network theory. In this paper, we map the parameters of different types of idiographic network models to the network theory of psychopathology. In particular, we use stability landscapes to map the dynamics implied by the Ising model with a $\\{0, 1\\}$ and $\\{-1, 1\\}$ encoding, and the graphical vector autoregressive (GVAR) model onto symptom severity and the variability in symptom activation. Only the Ising model with the $\\{0, 1\\}$ encoding shows behavior consistent with the network theory. The Ising model with the $\\{-1, 1\\}$ encoding only partially aligns with the network theory, as increased network connectivity leads both the healthy and unhealthy state to become more stable. Contrary to popular belief, we illustrate that, in the GVAR model, temporal network connectivity is independent of symptom severity. Instead, in temporal network connectivity strongly relates to variability in symptom activation: more strongly connected networks are associated with more variance around the stable state. Our results suggest that more systematic investigations should precede linking psychological theory to statistical network models for empirical data. To this end, we present stability landscapes as a tool to gain insight into the dynamics of idiographic network models and as a means to link model-implied to theory-implied behaviour.",

To find out, experimental philosophers have presented participants with vignettes describing agents in deterministic universes and probed their intuitions about the free will and moral responsibility of these agents. However, these debates soon got embroiled around the difficulty of assessing whether participants correctly understood the vignettes and the concepts of determinism and free will, and the extent to which different comprehension errors plagued participants’ answers. In this chapter, we clarify those debates by using the results of a brand new study (N = 772) on participants’ intuitions about free will. We introduce readers to correlations, regressions, multiple regressions, mediation analyses, and multiple mediation analyses through the use of structural equation modeling to show how different techniques may give different interpretations of folk intuitions on free will. We explain how to run these different analyses in R and provide detailed R code.",

          "abstract": "Background\nDimensional models of adversity have primarily focused on proximal experiences (e.g., child abuse and neglect).  Adopting a more distal lens by assessing dimensions of neighborhood environments could help identify broader contextual features that influence psychopathology across the lifespan and mechanisms underlying these associations. The current study examines associations of dimensions of neighborhood environments with psychopathology symptoms along with potential emotion, cognitive, and neural mechanisms central to dimensional models of adversity.\n\nMethod\nThe ABCD sample included 11,868 participants aged 9-10 across 21 sites in the U.S. Associations were examined for neighborhood indicators of threat and deprivation with emotion processing (adaptation to emotional conflict, task-active ROIs for emotional n-back), cognition (EF and task-active ROIs for the stop-signal task), and neural function (rs-fc of amygdala to resting state network connectivity and within-network rs connectivity). Mixed effect models nesting within family and site assessed indirect effects for neighborhood and symptoms.\n\nResults\nIndirect effects of neighborhood deprivation across symptom domains through EF were observed. Neighborhood deprivation, but not threat, had an indirect effect on psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) through within-retrosplenial temporal and within-dorsal attention network connectivity. Indirect effects for only neighborhood threat were observed with attention difficulties/internalizing problems/PLEs, through default mode within-network connectivity, with PLEs through visual network within-network connectivity, and with PLEs/externalizing symptoms through amygdala to sensorimotor network connectivity. \n\nConclusion\nResults provide insights into neural and cognitive processes underlying observed links between different neighborhood components and psychopathology, with implications for prevention and intervention efforts at the individual and contextual level.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE) refers to the simplest form of conscious experience, characterized by the absence of time, self, and sensory content, where only pure awareness or consciousness remains. In this paper, we present a computational neurophenomenological account of minimal phenomenal experience within the active inference framework. We propose a generative mechanism that allows active inference agents to leverage capacities akin to those in generative adversarial networks, which use a dual framework of data generation and discrimination to improve perceptual accuracy. Our hypothesis posits that the brain continuously generates synthetic data to fill perceptual and cognitive gaps, and we provide a computational mechanism within the active inference framework to support this. We explore how synthetic data generation, when amplified by meditation, psychedelics, or other altered states, can the brain to ‘defabricate’ entrenched conceptual structures and approach pure consciousness at the limit. We provide simulations of an active inference agent embedded in a virtual environment, we demonstrate that recursive loops of synthetic data generation can lead to a breakdown in conceptualization — 'seeing as' — while enhancing the system’s ability to predict its own observation stream. We argue that this model can characterize the essential features of MPE, including contentlessness, epistemic openness, and the unique valence profile associated with minimal phenomenal experiences.",

However, to establish valid and reliable measures, there is a need to explore their psychometric properties in different research settings and language environments. For this reason, this study aimed to validate the Three Item Loneliness Scale (TILS) in the Czech Republic within a Slavonic language environment.\n\nMethods\nA sample of Czech adults (n = 3236) was used consisting primarily of university students. We utilized Classical Test Theory to assess TILS internal consistency, temporal stability, factor structure, and measurement invariance. Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to estimate the discrimination and difficulty of the TILS items and to estimate the measurement precision of the whole scale. Convergent validity was explored through the Spearman correlation coefficient using personality traits, depression, and anxiety.\n\nResults\nThe results showed satisfactory reliability and validity of the TILS in the Czech Republic. The scale's internal consistency and temporal stability were found to be satisfactory (Cronbach’s α = 0.81, McDonald’s ω = 0.82, r = 0.71). The parallel analysis supported the unidimensionality of the TILS with a high factor loading of items (λ = 0.61 - λ = 0.85). Moreover, measurement invariance indicated that the TILS measures loneliness equivalently between genders. The IRT results indicated that the highest measurement precision was reached in individuals with lower and above-average levels of loneliness. Significant correlations between the TILS scores, anxiety, depression, and personality traits supported the convergent validity of the scale.",

          "abstract": "Background: Subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms are fairly common in the general population but are linked to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. However, the genetic and environmental origins of these associations are unclear. This twin study examined the phenotypic and aetiological associations between subsyndromal hypomania with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions and related symptoms (e.g., self-harm).\n\nMethods: Participants were 4,932 twin pairs from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. Hypomanic symptoms were assessed using the parent-rated Mood Disorders Questionnaire when the twins were aged 18. Specialist diagnoses of 14 conditions and symptoms were ascertained from Swedish population registries. Phenotypic associations between hypomania and these conditions/symptoms were investigated and their aetiological overlap examined using the twin method.\n\nOutcomes/findings: Subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms were significantly associated with the diagnosis of all 14 conditions/symptoms. The highest odds was for psychotic disorders (odds ratio [OR]=1·48, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=1·33-1·64, p&lt;0·001) and the lowest was for eating disorders (other than anorexia) (OR=1·15, 95% CI 1·08-1·22, p&lt;0·001). The genetic correlations between subsyndromal hypomania and these diagnoses ranged from 0·12 (95% CI 0·04-0·33) for eating disorders (other than anorexia) to 0·58 (95% CI 0·28-1·00) for drug misuse. The highest non-shared environmental correlation was for psychotic disorders (0·52, 95% CI -0·02-0·92) and lowest was for body dissatisfaction (0·04, 95% CI -0·01-0·08). For bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity/Disorder, genetic and non-shared environmental correlations with subsyndromal hypomania were of a similar magnitude.\n\nInterpretation: The association between subsyndromal hypomania and the diagnosis of multiple psychiatric phenotypes highlights its important role in the developmental pathway to clinical disorders, its complex origins and that it may represent a quantitative trait for bipolar disorder, and various psychiatric phenotypes.",

However, such probes and their associated suspicion-mitigation efforts (e.g., excluding ‘suspicious’ participants) remain unstandardized and unvalidated. Through meta-analytic p-curves, we compared the evidentiary value of studies that reported the use of ‘suspicion’ probes versus those that did not, as well as studies that either retained or excluded ‘suspicious’ participants. We sampled 200 independent effects from psychology experiments that employed deception and were recently published in five eminent journals of experimental psychology: Cognition, Emotion, JEP: General, JPSP (all sections), and Psychological Science. Studies that reported the use of ‘suspicion’ probes (k = 100) had less evidentiary value and statistical power than those that did not report the use of ‘suspicion’ probes (k = 100). Furthermore, studies that excluded ‘suspicious’ participants (k = 50) had less evidentiary value and similar statistical power to those that retained ‘suspicious’ participants (k = 50). Though we cannot claim that these differences are causally-induced by ‘suspicion’ probes, our findings call into question the value of performing such probes and using them to exclude ‘suspicious’ participants in the context of hypothesis testing in experimental psychology.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the psychometric properties of the Farsi version of Parents' Beliefs about Children's Emotions Questionnaire (PBACE) in the Iranian setting. The PBACE is a self-report measure comprising seven subscales: Value of Anger, Cost of Positivity, Control, Parental Knowledge, Manipulation, Stability, and Autonomy. The psychometric properties of the PBACE, including reliability, content, convergent, and construct validity, and dimensionality, were assessed in a sample of 397 parents of children aged 5-11 years. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the factor structure of seven models and a general seven-correlated model, which showed good model fit for the PBACE and its subscales, except for the Parental Knowledge subscale. The poor fit of the Parental Knowledge subscale led to testing a six-correlated model without it, which demonstrated superior model fit compared to the seven-correlated model. Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR) indicated good content validity for the scale. Additionally, significant associations with children's emotion regulation established satisfactory convergent validity. Internal consistency, measured by the Omega coefficient, was acceptable for all subscales except Parental Knowledge, while the PBACE overall demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Findings from the bifactor model indicated that the measure could be considered unidimensional with some multidimensional features. Although the poor fit and lower Omega coefficient for the Parental Knowledge subscale suggest that it should not be used, the PBACE is recommended for research and clinical purposes in Iran due to its sound psychometric properties.",

Although several short-form APMs have been developed, they typically overlook the differences in cognitive components assessed by various items, potentially compromising the instrument's content validity. To enhance the consistency of the proportion of cognitive components measured in the short-form instruments compared to the complete APM, this study employed an automated item selection algorithm with cognitive component constraints within the item response theory framework—the revised maximum priority index—to develop a series of short-form APMs with varying item counts. By comparing them with existing short-form APMs, the newly developed instruments demonstrated good reliability while maintaining a nearly consistent proportion of cognitive components measured as in the complete APM. Finally, we recommend two short-form APMs containing 12 and 18 items, respectively, for subsequent use, based on the customary lengths of existing short-form APMs.",

          "abstract": "Healthy lifestyles are a cornerstone of optimal physical health, yet their contribution to optimal mental health is still an open question. This article investigated the relationships between three key health behaviors—sleep quality, physical activity, and dietary choices—and psychological well-being among young adults ages 18 to 25, a demographic known for disproportionately low levels of well-being. The research used three datasets: a cross-sectional survey (Study 1, N=1,032) and two daily diary datasets (Study 2, N=818; Study 3, N=236) of young adults living in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Multilevel regression analyses examined how these health behaviors simultaneously and synergistically predicted well-being at the between-person and within-person levels, while controlling for covariates such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and depressive symptoms. Additionally, Study 3 incorporated wearable device-measured physical activity to supplement self-report measures. The findings highlighted better sleep quality as the strongest predictor of well-being across all three datasets, followed by fruit and vegetable consumption, with significant associations between these health behaviors and well-being observed at the between-person and within-person levels. Physical activity also emerged as a reliable predictor of well-being, mostly at the within-person level. The use of device-measured physical activity confirmed similar patterns, reinforcing the validity of findings. Pathways linking health behaviors to well-being were mostly additive, except for a buffering pattern observed at the within-person level indicating that higher fruit and vegetable intake could potentially mitigate the negative impact of poor sleep on daily well-being. This article underscores the importance of the “big three” health behaviors in well-being among young adults, offering insights for future health interventions to improve positive psychological functioning in this population.",

          "abstract": "Causal inference and questions about timing are central to developmental science. Yet scientists are often limited to observational data, and conceptual, methodological, and computational barriers have prevented uptake of relevant methodological tools from other disciplines that are designed to improve causal inference. This paper provides a practical guide to implementing one powerful causal inference tool, marginal structural models (MSMs), to strengthen our ability to test causal questions about exposures/treatments that unfold over time. We draw on an illustrative example testing the potentially causal roles of dose and timing of exposure to economic strain from infancy through early childhood on children’s behavior problems in early childhood. We first introduce the advantages of MSMs for investigating causal questions over time. Specifically, we review the logic of ‘exposure histories’ and the potential outcomes framework, using sequential randomization as a conceptual tool. We then discuss inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) for addressing the threat of confounding over time. We then outline how to implement MSMs with observational data, before providing step-by-step guidance for using our novel, open-source R package, devMSMs. In our example, we create longitudinal IPTW balancing weights to attenuate a number of confounder-exposure relations. We then apply these weights to test an outcome model relating economic strain across infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood to future behavior problems. Finally, we estimate and compare the predicted causal effects of different developmental histories of high economic strain that vary in dose and timing and discuss substantive implications. We close with ongoing considerations.",

Recently, empirical investigations have shown that lay beliefs about free will and determinism represent stable and important individual differences. Despite a perennial interest in the sources of agentic belief, genetic and environmental influences on such beliefs have never been studied. We administered a battery of items assessing these beliefs to a unique sample of 394 adoptive and biological families with adult offspring to investigate the origins of agentic beliefs and their relationships. We found significant differences between adopted and biological offspring and between the parents of such children, particularly in beliefs about determinism. Biometric modeling revealed especially surprising results: unlike the vast majority of traits studied in family designs, agentic beliefs appear to be weakly or not at all heritable. Since genetic factors might be regarded as typical of the \"initial conditions\" in philosophical thought experiments about free will and determinism, it is especially ironic that beliefs about free will and determinism may be among the traits least influenced by genetic differences.",

          "abstract": "Avoidant processing of positive emotional information and facilitatory processing of negative emotional information are related to the experience of anhedonia and anxiety. However, how these cognitive processes inter-relate with self-report symptoms of psychopathology over time is unclear. The current study thus examined behavioral indices of perception, attention, and affective updating in relation to self-report measures of anhedonia and anxiety in dynamic network models at six separate time-points among participants preselected for a wide-range of depression symptoms (N = 101). Findings suggest that two different pathways are associated with emotional information processing over time: one represents an anhedonic circuit, and the second represents a two-node reward devaluation circuit. The first pathway reveals how anhedonia and cognitive functioning are related over time (and, potentially, across levels of analysis) and could inform future longitudinal studies of anhedonic individuals. The second pathway represents a theoretical advance in the conceptualization of reward devaluation by further demonstrating that attentional avoidance and perceptual avoidance of positivity are inter-related. Future studies and network analyses that evaluate anhedonia and devaluative processing of positivity, and that replicate these innovative methods, are needed to elucidate how avoidance of positivity and anhedonia are related as part of a causal system of self-reported symptoms and behavioral tasks.",

          "abstract": "Within-disorder heterogeneity complicates mapping neurobiological features of psychopathology to DSM conceptualizations. The present study explored patterns of diagnostic classification errors among disorders with commonly co-occurring features to examine this heterogeneity. We conducted classification analyses with the UCLA Phenomics Study database using a support vector classifier to differentiate disorders via whole-brain task-based functional connectivity, predicting that model misclassifications would provide insight about brain connectivity characteristics shared across disorders. We also explored whether symptoms and specific brain networks could account for misclassification rates. The classification model performed better than chance (44% accuracy, p = .01) and revealed that misclassification of schizophrenia (SCZ) as bipolar disorder (BD; 38%) and BD as SCZ (36%) was symmetrical. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was misclassified as BD at the highest rate (46%) and higher than the converse (17%). SCZ and ADHD were misclassified least (SCZ as ADHD 15%; ADHD as SCZ 22%). Considerable variance in misclassification of SCZ as BD (R2 = .83) and BD as SCZ (R2 = .71) could be accounted for by symptoms of both SCZ and BD. Permutation testing revealed disorder- and network-specific effects, with certain networks improving classification accuracy and others hindering it for specific disorders. An approach focused on classification errors replicated known disorder overlap, producing errors in the expected configuration. Further, it identified clinical and neural features within and across diagnostic categories that contribute to disorder misclassification and within-disorder heterogeneity. This approach may facilitate neurobiologically informed phenotypic differentiation within diagnostic groups.",

Dyads engaged in 10-minute neutral, conflict, and pleasant conversations while their autonomic physiology was continuously monitored. In conflict and neutral interactions, CHR youth exhibited contrarian coregulation. Contrarian coregulation was associated with elevated risk for psychosis, was linked to greater baseline psychosis symptomatology, and prospectively predicted increases in symptoms one year later.

          "abstract": "The Trauma Response Personality Indicator (TRPI) is an innovative framework that offers a comprehensive understanding of personality through the lens of trauma responses, cognitive functions, and interpersonal dynamics. By transcending traditional personality models, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), TRPI provides a nuanced approach to how individuals engage with their environments and themselves. This paper explores the core concepts of TRPI, emphasizing the significance of function pairings, the Big Five personality traits, and the dynamic nature of personality.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary AI models owe much of their success and discontents to connectionism, a framework in cognitive science that has been (and continues to be) highly influential. Herein, we analyze artificial neural networks (ANNs): a) when used as scientific instruments of study; and b) when functioning as emergent arbiters of the zeitgeist in the cognitive, computational, and neural sciences. Building on our previous work with respect to analogizing between ANNs and cognition, brains, or behaviour (Guest &amp; Martin, 2023), we use metatheoretical analysis techniques (Guest, 2024), including formal logic, to characterise two distinct tendencies within connectionism that we dub classical and modern, with divergent properties, e.g. goals, mechanisms, scientific questions. We also demonstrate how we, as a field, often fail to follow important lines of argument to their end --- this results in a paradoxical praxis. By engaging more deeply with (meta)theory surrounding ANNs, our field can obviate the cycle of AI winters and summers, which need not be inevitable.",

Fillon et al. (2024) challenged our findings, alleging methodological errors and an excessive degree of researcher flexibility, which they claim could lead to false-positive results. In this response, we critically examine Fillon et al.'s commentary, arguing that it exemplifies flawed meta-scientific critique. We demonstrate that their approach relies on a series of unsupported and misleading claims, including a misinterpretation of the literature, unjustified reliance on visual data inspection, speculative assumptions about religious influences on our findings, and a shifting of the burden of proof. Through rigorous re-analyses, we reaffirm the robustness of our original results and address the unfounded allegations regarding our methodological practices. We also critique Fillon et al.'s approach, highlighting the necessity of domain-specific expertise in meta-scientific evaluations and cautioning against the risks of speculative and defamatory criticism in academic discourse. This exchange underscores the importance of maintaining rigorous standards in both original research and its critique, ensuring that scientific debate remains grounded in evidence rather than conjecture.",

          "authors": "Sierra Ha; Joshua Gilbert; Erin Le; Connor Ross; Alice Lorch",
          "abstract": "Background:\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with inadequate screening rates even in urban areas with high concentrations of medical professionals. While medical guidelines recommend annual diabetic retinopathy screening for patients with diabetes mellitus, adherence to these recommendations remains suboptimal. This study evaluates the impact of a novel teleretinal DR screening program on screening compliance across urban community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Methods:\nWe conducted a quasi-experimental study comparing DR screening compliance between intervention and comparison community health centers before and after implementing a teleretinal screening program. Participants included patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with primary care providers at the studied sites. We defined compliance as completion of either teleretinal screening or a documented eye care professional examination within the previous 365 days. Monthly compliance rates were analyzed using two-way fixed effects regression and event study techniques.\nResults:\nThe study included 10,247 patients with diabetes mellitus who received care at six participating sites, generating 222 monthly compliance rate estimates. Baseline compliance rates before implementation ranged from 25% to 40% across sites. The two-way fixed effects regression analysis revealed that the screening program significantly increased DR compliance rates by an average of 7.2 percentage points (p &lt; 0.001). Event study analysis showed positive effects across all sites, though the initial improvement tended to diminish over time.\nConclusions:\nImplementation of a community-based teleretinal DR screening program significantly improved compliance with annual screening guidelines in urban communities. These findings support the broader adoption of teleretinal screening as an effective strategy for preventing DR-related vision loss in vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to assess long-term clinical outcomes and optimize program sustainability.",

          "authors": "Mikel Jimenez; Antonio Prieto; Anna Grubert; José Antonio Hinojosa; Pedro R. Montoro",
          "abstract": "While most research on the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) has focused on exploring the candidate event related potentials (ERP) components associated to visual awareness, much less is known about the temporal dynamics associated to those correlates. In the present study, we will measure the temporal dynamics of visual awareness as a function of the level of processing (LoP) of the stimulus and report condition (report vs. no-report). In the report condition, participants will perform a low-level (color identification: blue vs. red) or high-level (category identification: animal vs. object) task on colored stimuli that will be presented at threshold while reporting their awareness of the target (e.g., ‘seen’ or ‘unseen’). In the no-report block, participants will count the number of times that a task-irrelevant, but LoP congruent, stimulus appears within each block. The VAN (visual awareness negativity) and LP (late positivity) components of the ERP will be computed for each condition by pooling together aware and unaware trials. If awareness to different stimulus representations is temporally dynamic, we will expect an earlier low-level VAN compared to high-level VAN together with an earlier high-level LP compared to low-level LP, suggesting that the temporal course of the NCC is dependent on the level of processing of the stimulus and task demands. An absence of differences between low-level and high-level VANs, on the other hand, will suggest that awareness emerges “at once”, independently of the level at which the stimulus is processed. Regarding the LP, we expect two alternative scenarios. In the first one, we will observe reliable LPs only in the report condition and no LPs in the no-report condition. This will be in line with the proposal that the LP/P3 is not a correlate of awareness but reflects post-perceptual or task related processes. In the second scenario, reliable LPs might be observed in both the report and no-report tasks, but only for the high-level tasks. This will suggest that the LP is indeed a correlate of visual awareness which is exclusively modulated by high-level stimulus representations. In sum, here we will explore whether the NCC within the no-report paradigm are depend on the LoP of the stimulus and whether they are temporally dynamic, or alternatively, they are temporally invariant and independent of the LoP conceptualization.",

          "abstract": "The consciousness-collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics was explored as a weak measurement quantum Zeno effect in an optical diffraction apparatus. Fifty participants were selected via a worldwide search for individuals with experience in focusing their attention. Each was mailed an optical apparatus and provided with software to run an experiment to see if illumination recorded in a portion of the interference pattern would be affected when it was observed versus unobserved. Another portion of the interference pattern was recorded simultaneously but not observed at any time to provide a real-time control. A variety of environmental sensors and real-time encryption of the key data were among the methods built into the apparatus to help ensure data integrity.\nForty-seven participants completed their assigned experimental tasks, and two of three preregistered hypotheses were significantly confirmed. However, data from two participants were deemed probable outliers because they each achieved results over 7 sigma from chance. Those outcomes appeared to be due to misalignments in their optical systems, likely caused by rough handling during shipping. The two participants were sent new optical systems to provide replacement data, which upon review was assessed to be reasonable. Analysis of the revised dataset no longer supported the preregistered hypotheses, but an exploratory hypothesis based on skewness was significant. An exploratory time-series analysis found strong evidence that during observation periods interference progressively declined as compared to unobserved periods, in accordance with the proposal that human consciousness can act like a weak measurement quantum Zeno effect. In addition, performance by participants experienced in an outward focus of attention performed significantly better than those experienced with an inward focus of attention.",

          "authors": "Paul Linton; Nikolaus Kriegeskorte",
          "abstract": "We present a new illusion that challenges our traditional understanding of stereo vision. Traditional ‘Triangulation’ accounts of stereo vision back-project from points on the retina to points in the world. This requires that stereo vision incorporates how binocular disparities fall off with the viewing distance squared. By contrast, Linton proposes a ‘Minimal Model’ of stereo vision where perceived stereo depth is simply a function (most likely a linear function) of the amount of disparity on the retina. We present a new illusion (the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’) to adjudicate between these two approaches. The illusion consists of a smaller circle (at 40cm) in front of a larger circle (at 50cm), with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) (‘Triangulation’) or constant disparity (6.7cm) (‘Minimal Model’)? Observers choose constant disparity. This leads us to four conclusions: First, perceived stereo depth appears to be best captured by the ‘Minimal Model’. There is no scaling of disparity with distance. Second, doubling disparity appears to double perceived depth, suggesting that perceived stereo depth is proportional to disparity. Third, changes in vergence appear to have no effect on perceived depth. Fourth, stereo ‘depth constancy’ appears to be a cognitive (not perceptual) phenomenon, reflecting our experience of a world distorted in perceived stereo depth.",

Meta-awareness was also indicated to be another predictor, but did not remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons.\nAdditionally, we obtained estimates for the prevalence of sleep paralysis and false awakenings from lucid dreams, investigated the connection of sleep paralysis with lucid dreaming\nfrequency and induction technique use, and examined the four largest lucid dreaming communities in our sample in terms of community differences as well as most used techniques.\nResults revealed a small correlation between sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming frequency, but\nno significant relationship of sleep paralysis with induction techniques.

          "abstract": "The concept of emotional intelligence (EI) has gained significant interest in the scientific community in recent years. Despite its demonstrated impact on social and personal functioning, the neural bases underlying EI remain poorly understood. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of the existing literature on the neural correlates of EI. The search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases. A total of 849 studies were initially identified (after duplicates were removed), of which 34 met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the final synthesis. These studies employed various neuroimaging techniques such as lesion studies, grey and white matter structural MRI, task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI, and EEG. The findings of this review suggest that EI is supported by a complex and widespread brain network primarily implicated in the integration of cognitive and emotional processes, with significant involvement of structures commonly linked to social cognition. The literature mainly emphasized the role of the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and amygdala in conjunction with brain networks comprising these areas, such as the somatic marker circuitry and the social cognition network. Other brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cuneus, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, frontopolar gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and superior longitudinal fasciculus were also frequently mentioned. However, further research is needed to clarify the roles of some of these regions in EI. Limitations and future lines of research are discussed.",

Progress in one interoceptive domain does not imply progress in others, highlighting a need for more differentiated and modality-specific approaches. We review findings demonstrating weak correlations in performance across interoceptive tasks and modalities, as well as differential associations with clinical variables. We argue that while interoception remains a useful heuristic for organizing research, it does not correspond to a single clinical phenomenon.",

Study 2 (34 countries, N = 123,502) shows that subjective SES predicts obligation to sacrifice for future lives, especially in nations with less inequality. In Study 3 (N = 1,264 Americans), individuals randomly assigned more resources allocate more to future generations, though not proportionately more.

          "authors": "Domenic Groh",
          "abstract": "The Test-Retest Coefficient (TRC) is a central metric of reliability in Classical Test Theory and modern psychological assessments. Originally developed by early 19th-century psychometri-cians, it relies on the assumptions of fixed (i. e. perfectly stable) true scores and independent error scores. However, these assumptions are rarely, if ever, tested, even though their violation can introduce significant biases. This article explores the basis of these assumptions and exam-ines the performance of the TRC under varying conditions, including different sample sizes, true score stability, and error score dependence. Using simulated data, results show that decreas-ing true score stability biases TRC estimates, leading to underestimations of reliability. Addi-tionally, error score dependence can inflate TRC values, making unreliable measures appear reliable This study also derives new formulas for the biased estimation of the TRC, based on empirical results. These findings demonstrate that while the TRC may perform well under ideal conditions, even slight deviations from its assumptions can lead to significant inaccuracies. Therefore, the TRC may be unsuitable for practical applications, particularly when test condi-tions are uncontrolled, or traits vary over time.",

Participants completed a battery of assessments (psychosocial, neuropsychological, and physical functioning) at baseline and subsequently were randomly assigned to receive 20 hours of cognitive training via Games (stationary computerized tasks emphasizing executive functioning and exerciser self-certainty, and exergaming with dual-task components; n=118) or attention-control health educational Videos (n=115). Training was split across five 2-hr lab sessions (overall adherence=98.3%), followed by five 2-hr home sessions. Among Games, 81.4% fully complied with our exergaming protocol (lab &amp; home) and 88.4% completed the cognitive training protocol. Video engagement was assessed via accuracy to attentional checks (Ms=82.4% accuracy in lab, 82.0% accuracy at home). The primary outcome was physical activity engagement (PAE), a latent factor based on physical activity steps &amp; moderate intensity minutes derived from yearlong Fitbit step recordings, visitations &amp; classes, &amp; Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire). As hypothesized, Bayesian multiple-indicator, multiple-cause model analysis indicated a significant group effect (PAE score M±SD is 4.20±1.02 in Games and 3.77±0.92 in Videos; Cohen’s d=0.19 and one-sided p= 0.03) after adjusting for a set of background variables.

          "abstract": "We present a retrieved-context theory of memory for items, associations, and their\ninteraction (CMR-IA). Our theory assumes an evolving representation of temporal context that binds to items and associations, allowing the rememberer to make judgments based on the occurrence of a mnemonic target within a particular context. In addition to the assumptions inherited from prior retrieved-context theories, CMR-IA assumes a conjunctive (Gestalt) representation for paired associates, increased attention to rare items, and variable thresholds for recognition decisions. We apply CMR-IA to key findings concerning recognition of items and associations, including effects of recency, similarity, receiver-operating characteristic curves, word frequency, differential forgettings of items and associations, and contiguity effects for successive probes. We also apply CMR-IA to cued recall phenomena, including serial position effects, distribution of correct responses and errors, contiguity effects, associative symmetry, and similarity effects. Finally, we ask whether CMR-IA can account for the dependencies between successive tests of item and associative memory. We show that combining a Gestalt associative mechanism with retrieved-context theory provides a good account for many empirical phenomena concerning item and associative memory. The analysis of successive memory tests highlights the important role of output encoding in our model.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Tiia-Maria Pasanen; Satu Helske; Giovanni Amerigo Giuliani; Simon Chapman; Jouni Helske",
          "abstract": "Countries with stronger support to gender equality tend to invest in policies supporting\nthe dual-earner family model or the earner/carer family model, while countries\nwith stronger support to conservative gender norms tend to have policies supporting\nthe male breadwinner family model. However, gender equality norms can be\nendorsed by the majority of the population at the national level, whilst conservative\nnorms could still be largely supported at the sub-national level, potentially leading\nto lower uptake of parental leave among fathers in more conservative areas.\nThis study seeks to examine shifting norms in fathers’ parental leave uptake\nin Finnish municipalities in the 2010s, around the first reform that gave fathers\nan independent right to a 6-week quota of “solo” parental leave. We applied a\nBayesian spatio-temporal model on administrative data from Finnish municipalities\nand estimated local norms based on voting data and content analysis of political\nmanifestos. Furthermore, we used the proportion of Swedish residents as a proxy\nfor cross-border policy influences from the neighbouring country Sweden, where\npaternal leave-taking has been a longer phenomenon.\nLocal support to de-familialising policies was found to predict higher leavetaking,\nbut only before the 2013 reform when fathers’ quota use shortened mothers’\nleave. The proportion of Swedish-speaking residents was found to be increasingly\nimportant for predicting paternal leave-taking. We interpret this result as a sign of\ncross-border influences from Sweden. Interestingly, uptake increased the fastest in\nthe most conservative region, probably due to its strong linguistic and cultural links\nto Sweden. Furthermore, we observed spatial dependencies between neighbouring\nmunicipalities, which supports our spillover hypothesis; that the interactions among\nfamilies nearby lead them to adopt new practices.\nThese results trigger new theoretical considerations concerning the role of gender\nnorms in affecting citizens’ behaviour in the family policy field and how these norms\ninteract with policy reforms, the role of national institutions in affecting welfare state\npreferences at the local level, and the importance of community socialisation.",

          "authors": "Jon Abbink",
          "abstract": "The severe armed conflict in Ethiopia since November 2020 – the start of an armed insurrection by a party (TPLF) in northern Ethiopia - has been framed and impacted upon by digital offensives and global media reporting in peculiar ways. Representations of the conflict events, actors and victims have had a divisive effect on political debate and cooperation in Ethiopia, thus fuelling communal divisions and preventing compromise. The arena of shared politics in federal Ethiopia was further fragmented, with a notable role played by influential global news media and the ‘social’ media. Their politic rhetoric went beyond strategies of persuasion into forms of partisan intimidation, misinformation, bias and even fiction. \nAs with all early 21th-century armed conflicts (cf. the Middle East, Myanmar, or Ukraine), the digital sphere and media manipulation on Ethiopia are shown to be essential domains of discursive battle, extending real life battles, and impacting on international diplomatic responses. The paper analyses some key aspects of the evolving conflict from the perspective of repeated digital ‘memes’ – ‘famine’, ‘genocide’, ‘blockade’, ethnic cleansing’ - and narrative frames – ‘underdog’, ‘self-defense’, ‘peaceful resolution’, ‘truce’ - produced by adherents of one or the other party in the conflict. \nThis contemporary (digital) political rhetoric subverts itself and creates a world of semi-fictitious appearances that perpetuate conflict. The problem of addressing ‘Sophist’ arguments is the same as in Plato’s time (cf. Gorgias), but current digital media allow political rhetoric to massively go beyond the conventions of shared discourse. \nUsing examples, I argue that, beyond the analysis of the digital and news media products themselves, new ways have to be found to ‘reality-check’ or reduce these products/representations to themes amenable for public discussion and eventual shared compromise (cf. Norris 2017: 630). This might help (re)building political rhetoric in a constructive, and not exclusively polemic, manner.",

          "abstract": "Parental leave uptake by fathers represents one pathway to redress the typically unequal division of early childcare. Following the Nordic schema, the Finnish leave system is designed around this concept to encourage leave uptake, but a substantial share of fathers refrain from it. Though there is a substantial body of literature on policy and individual-level motivators of leave uptake, the decision to take leave often occurs in the context of the workplace. Workplace factors are often cited as typical barriers to uptake. We systematically investigated how the most important workplace characteristics are associated with fathers’ parental leave decisions. We used administrative, linked employee-employer Finnish register data and a multilevel Bayesian approach to examine employed first-time fathers’ use of the father’s quota in 2013–2017. Contrary to our expectations, the probability of taking father’s quota did not vary by the gender composition of or gender wage gap within the workplace. Workplace educational level was important, but only for tertiary educated fathers. Increased competitiveness of the workplace lowered the probability of taking the quota. Our findings call for further study on the interplay of individual and contextual factors in fathers’ parental leave uptake.",

This oversight is regrettable as these factors often intertwine, particularly given the prevalence of socioeconomic deprivation among ethnic minorities compared to the White majority. In this study, we investigate the mediating and moderating effects between offenders' residential area deprivation and their ethnic background using an administrative dataset encompassing all offences processed through the England and Wales Crown Court. Our findings reveal the following: i) substantial ethnic disparities among drug offenders, but mostly non-existent across other offence categories; ii) area deprivation does not explain away ethnic disparities, but pronounced area disparities are found for breach and assault offences, wherein offenders living in deprived areas are penalised compared to their more affluent counterparts; and iii) ethnicity and area deprivation interact, but only for breach offences, with ethnic minority offenders being treated more harshly than white offenders when residing in deprived areas but favoured when they live in affluent areas.",

          "authors": "Arab World English Journal; Shuaa Hamad Althbaity",
          "abstract": "To cope with large information content in today’s multilingual Saudi Arabia, translation services are essential. Like any other industry, translation practice was heavily affected by technological advances. Professionals in the translation field use technology like Computer-Aided Translation (CAT) tools to complete their translation tasks. Freelance translators are not exempt from this. This study examines the utilization of CAT tools in the freelance industry in Saudi Arabia. Fulford and Granell-Zafra (2005) have proposed a model that incorporates both information and Communication Technology (ICTs)and CAT tools, facilitating a diverse array of activities such as document creation, information search and retrieval, communication, business management, marketing, procurement, and translation. While CAT tools support document creation, business management, and translation, ICT tools are responsible for the remaining activates . This research aims to thoroughly analyze the characteristics of Saudi freelance translators who use CAT tools, evaluate their usage of CAT tools, and acquire valuable insights into their overall attitudes towards CAT tool. The data was gathered using the survey method and distributed among 98 Saudi freelance translators. The data was analyzed using SPSS descriptive analysis and frequency tables showing percentages of each respondent. The results show that Saudi freelance translators employed general-purpose software like MS Word and MS PowerPoint, whereas less interest was given to special-purpose software which represent CAT tools . The vast majority of the participants agreed on the positive effect of CAT tools. Finally,it may be beneficial to conduct further research to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.",

          "abstract": "This study applies a discourse analysis framework to explore the portrayal of women in Maysloon Hadi’s novel (The Black Eyes) (2011), using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Norman Fairclough’s tri-dimensional model (1989) as the analytical foundation. It investigates the roles and challenges women face in the novel. While there is growing interest in the portrayal of women in literature, Iraqi literature—especially from the perspective of Iraqi women writers remains underexplored. Hadi’s *The Black Eyes* provides a unique case to examine this intersection. Despite the novel’s rich narrative, which offers insight into Iraqi women’s lives, there is a lack of comprehensive CDA to understand how its language constructs and communicates the multifaceted roles, challenges, and images of women. The research fills this gap by analyzing specific passages from the novel using Fairclough’s model. The findings reveal a nuanced portrayal of women and underscore the value of CDA in analyzing such works. Further research is recommended to apply CDA to other Iraqi literary texts for broader insight",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between reading strategies and Bandura’s (1986) theory of Reciprocal Determinism. Previous research acknowledged the concept of Reciprocal Determinism as an effective teaching approach, however, limited research has been done to consider how reading is influenced by learners’ personal factors, behavior and environment.  Based on four Research Questions,  the study explores the perceived use of reading strategies by 225 undergraduates who completed a critical reading course at a local university.  These learners of English as a Second Language responded to an online questionnaire adapted from Mokhtari and Sheorey’s (2002) Survey of Reading Strategies.  Based on the learners’ ratings of the reading strategies, namely Global Reading Strategies, Problem-Solving Strategies and Support Strategies, the findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between the learners’ perceived use of reading strategies and the three factors of Reciprocal Determinism, namely Personal Factors, Behaviour and Environment indicating a cyclical effect that infuences learners’ reading comprehension.  This exploration of reading strategies through this theory has pedagogical implications on how reading is taught to scaffold and help learners increase metacognitive awareness and self-efficacy. Overall, this study contributes to a further understanding of the importance of taking into account the three factors in a reading environment and the relationship between reading strategies and RD.  Future studies could be an extension of how the cyclical effects of Reciprocal Determinism and reading strategies could be strategically integrated into the teaching of skilled and unskilled readers and in other learning domains",

          "abstract": "Project-Based Learning (PBL) can potentially enhance learners’ oral proficiency. However, little evidence supports how PBL improves learners’ complexity, accuracy, and fluency, particularly for learners with different proficiency levels. This study examined the changes and linguistic features of varying proficiency learners’ complexity, accuracy, and fluency within a PBL context. It involved a homogeneous group of 45 Chinese college learners, categorized into high (N=15), medium (N=15), and low proficiency learners (N=15). Their oral complexity, accuracy, and fluency were assessed using speaking tests before and after PBL. The changes in their oral performance were evaluated using objective measures of complexity, accuracy, and fluency. The transcripts were also used to analyze the linguistic features of different proficiency learners. The results indicate that PBL significantly enhances syntactic complexity as learners’ proficiency levels increase. Significant differences were observed in lexical complexity, pronunciation accuracy, and self-repairs between high and low-proficiency learners. However, no significant differences were found in syntactic accuracy and speech rate across high, medium, and low proficiency learners. The findings also indicate that different proficiency learners reveal various linguistic features of syntactic complexity, syntactic accuracy, and self-repairs in their oral performance. This study provides implications for educators to design project-based activities for different proficiency learners to improve their complexity, accuracy, and fluency.",

The study adopted a quantitative method to analyse the ICNALE written essays v2.4 using CPIDR v5.1 software. The study aimed to identify the level of propositional idea density in the writing of English native speakers and Asian learners of English and to examine the effect of the type of English, the theme type, the proficiency level and nationality on propositional idea density. The study is one of the very few studies about propositional idea density in ESL and EFL contexts. Many statistical analyses were performed on CPIDR results using jamovi v2.3 software, and the results of the tests revealed that the propositional idea density in native speakers’ essays was higher than that in Asian learners’ essays. Moreover, the results showed that there was a statistically significant difference among all the participants based on the theme types of part-time jobs and smoking, among native speakers based on occupation type (students, teachers, others) and among Asian learners of English based on the type of English proficiency level and nationality. The findings of the study showed that propositional idea density is a psycholinguistic index of the amount of presupposed knowledge language users have on a specific topic. In other words, propositional idea density is a window to language users’ schemata. Additionally, the findings of the study can be considered an insightful contribution to contrastive interlanguage analysis.",

          "abstract": "The main aim of the study is to examine the impact of video games on vocabulary acquisition among Saudi university students, as well as what types of games are most effective and students’ perceptions of their use. A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving 100 students divided into control and experimental groups. Over twelve weeks, the experimental group used video game-based learning activities, while the control group followed traditional methods. Vocabulary gains were measured using pre-tests and post-tests. Qualitative data from questionnaires and interviews with the participants have supplemented the results. The findings show that the students who used video games reported greater engagement, motivation, and reduced language anxiety, appreciating the contextual learning and immediate feedback provided by video games. These findings support the use of video games as effective tools for vocabulary acquisition, offering an interactive and immersive learning experience. Students’ positive perceptions further highlight the benefits of integrating video games into language learning. Future research should investigate the long-term effects of video game-based learning and its influence on other language skills, as well as explore different game types in various educational settings.

Second, it addresses a gap in research by focusing on an underexplored context: online legal English classes for Arabic-speaking learners, a topic which has not been widely researched. Applying Conversation Analysis to fragments from the online class, the findings reveal that code-switching serves as a vital resource for learners in comprehending complex legal concepts by drawing on their first language (L1) knowledge (in this case, Arabic). It also facilitates word searching, collaborative learning, and effective negotiation of meaning, aiding in the overall second language (L2) acquisition process.",

          "abstract": "The present research deals with the phenomenon of hedging language, mainly focusing on the context of spontaneous verbal interactions. The main aim of the study is to analyze the occurrence of hedges in English spoken discourse as captured in the Spoken British National Corpus 2014. The research process deals with the differences in the usage of approximators and shields existing among men and women across different age groups and levels of education. The research methodology involves creating six sub-corpora, measuring hedge dispersion, examining selected hedges to ascertain their hedging function within the context and calculating frequencies within each sub-corpus. The research outcomes point to the prevalence of shields in spoken discourse. Plausibility shields are commonly used while attribution shields show lower usage. Adaptors contribute to mitigating certainty in utterances, whereas rounders play a less prominent role. These findings emphasize the nuanced interplay between linguistic strategies and speaker characteristics in spoken communication and highlight the importance of cooperative principles in discourse.",

It communicated three research inquiries: 1) How do 30 English Education Departments’ research productivity levels represent 288 Academics in East Java’s private universities? 2) To what extent do EFL academics’ participate in different research-related activities? 3) What drives the EFL academics’ interest in conducting research? Understanding these matters is critical for improving research production and personal performance. The Study utilized a Quantitative descriptive approach by analyzing evidence of overall productivity scores in the Sinta Database. In addition, an online survey was issued to point out academics’ involvement in research and the drives beneath their participation. The findings indicated that the research productivity among 30 English education departments was mainly low. Academics intensively engaged in writing, citing, conducting, and reading research. However, publishing research in recognized international journals indexed by Scopus or Web of Science, publishing in accredited national (Sinta Tiers one and two), and proposing intellectual property rights received less scrutiny. Their research drive was primarily for professional development, knowledge contribution, and self-awareness; research is a component of their job, alongside teaching and community services. However, promotions, governmental positions, and professional allowances were less motivating. The findings emphasize the significance of targeted funding and mentorship to facilitate publications, promote technical advancement, and stimulate the pursuit of intellectual property rights to enhance research productivity.",

          "abstract": "This research study aimed to investigate how and what are the affective factors, main challenges, and recommendations among Saudi female EFL students in developing emotional intelligence for learning English. The study used a survey questionnaire to collect data from 80 participants, which were then analyzed using statistical methods. The results showed that higher levels of EI were positively correlated with better English language proficiency. The study also found that certain affective factors, such as empathy, self-awareness, and emotional regulation, were particularly important in predicting ELL outcomes. The different affective factors are assessed on different grading scales. Considering the statistical analysis, it could be determined that factors related to the English language, such as social skills, motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic), emotional regulation, effective communication, empathy, self-confidence, self- and cultural awareness, and resilience, have a positive and affirmative influence on the beliefs of English language learners. On the other hand, when analyzing the main challenges faced by Saudi female EFL students in developing emotional intelligence for learning English a majority of students favored that it is challenging to use EI to manage stress and emotions while learning a second language. Therefore, cultivating EL could maintain motivation and enthusiasm for learning English. The study pointed out that learning a second language is a challenging task, and it becomes even more difficult when one has to navigate and adapt to cultural differences. The study strongly favored the integration of the affective factors in teaching as well. Research suggested that a supportive and encouraging environment, positive feedback and constructive criticism could enhance the EI of Saudi female EFL students learning English. With the use of EI, students felt supported and encouraged, and they were more likely to feel confident in their abilities and take risks in their language learning.",

Thus, this mixed-methods study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the impact of the POA on Chinese university students’ motivation for English learning. The quantitative results demonstrated significant improvements in both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation among the students instructed by the POA. The qualitative data supported these findings, revealing that the structured stages of the POA, along with its core principles, created a supportive and engaging learning environment. However, the study also highlighted challenges, such as the potential for students to feel overwhelmed by the demands of the approach. The importance of this study lies in its demonstration that the POA is a practical and effective method for enhancing motivation in English language learning, with significant implications for broader educational reforms aimed at creating more supportive learning environments.",

Yet, teachers’ perceptions of pragmatics and teaching pragmatics has yet to be closely investigated in the context of Moroccan higher education and therefore remains uncharted in literature. To address these gaps, the present study explored how Moroccan university professors view pragmatics and pragmatic teaching. It also explored how they use their pragmatic knowledge in the classroom. A total of 10 university professors (6 males and 4 females)  from two public universities (Moulay Ismail and Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah) in Morocco participated in the current study. Quantitative data were collected by completing an anonymous questionnaire, while qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Participants expressed their perceptions and described experiences of the importance of teaching pragmatics, issues related to culture and identity in teaching English as a Foreign Language, and materials and tasks in teaching pragmatics. The findings yielded that linguistic knowledge is as essential as pragmatic knowledge. Thus, striking a balance between pragmatic and grammatical competence and teaching them simultaneously is crucial. Learners with advanced grammatical knowledge may fail to use the target language appropriately. As such, the results indicated that some teachers are unaware of the importance of introducing pragmatics to students in the early stages of learning English. Their skills are enough to be good at transmitting cultural knowledge and suitable language competence to students. Practical implications for future research and practice are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the dissemination of cultural content, focusing on the transmission of Norse mythology and Orthodox Christian religious values within Romania, a culture with no historical connection to Norse mythology. By statistically analysing data collected from digital platforms such as TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), the research examines the differences in the presence and language of posts related to culturally specific content (Orthodox Christianity) and non-specific content (Norse mythology). The findings reveal that cultural content with strong institutional and historical support, like Orthodox Christianity, shows a higher prevalence and consistency in its digital dissemination, often transcending language barriers. Conversely, Norse mythology, lacking such support in Romania, demonstrates a more fragmented and inconsistent digital presence. The study also uncovers the influence of social media algorithms on the retrieval and representation of cultural content, highlighting significant quantitative and qualitative differences in search results between different users. These findings suggest that while the IoT facilitates global cultural exchange, it also introduces challenges in preserving the authenticity of cultural content in digital environments. The implications of this research extend to understanding the mechanisms of cultural hybridisation and the potential for digital platforms to both preserve and transform cultural heritage.",

The research aims to understand how these technologies influence language learning and identify how these tools are used across varying proficiency levels. The significance of the study lies in its potential to inform educators and highlight the role of using technologies in language learning. Based on data collected from a survey of 151 students (ranging from A2 to C2 proficiency levels), the findings indicate that students across all proficiency levels actively engage with NMT and ChatGPT. Across all proficiency levels, NMT and ChatGPT are used primarily for word translation. However, higher proficiency students use ChatGPT for complex tasks (such as mistake correction or summary writing). Moreover, the study emphasizes the positive attitudes of Gen Z learners toward technology as a flexible and valuable educational resource. The motivation to use technology stems from the desire to learn new vocabulary, comprehend English content, and enjoy flexible learning. Therefore, the study recommends that educators adapt teaching strategies to include these technologies, considering the different proficiency levels of students. Future research should focus on the long-term impacts of technology use on language acquisition.",

I examine discourse on AI in relation to notions of futurity and expertise. While these have been studied qualitatively through analysis of government memos and news media, cutting edge innovation discussed on social media that has not garnered mainstream attention remains understudied. As utilized by cultural sociologists, computational text analysis offers new possibilities in the study of meanings and framings. However, short texts remain understudied due to limitations in existing methods and approaches. I contend that short text limitations can be overcome by focusing on the meaning of sentences as opposed to the meaning of words and I demonstrate the utility of such an approach through two-stage topic modeling in my study of AI, particularly around how notions of futurity and domain-specific expertise are operationalized. This project demonstrates how AI has reshaped notions of expertise with a focus on medicine and ethics amidst new and contested understandings of what a future with AI looks like.",

          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises—or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Emphasizing theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power while avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. Through this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to offer new insights into the social world and its complexities.",

By engaging students in independent DiD analyses on a specific research question, in this case related to local governance, the study uncovers a broad range of effect sizes and diverging conclusions reported by the analysts, highlighting the subjective nature of analytical choices and their potential impact on research outcomes. This variability underscores the importance of critical thinking and methodological rigor in social science education. The implications extend beyond pedagogy, suggesting that causal inference methods with significant researcher discretion such as DiD designs benefit from robustness analysis with multiple independent analysts.",

          "abstract": "Calorie labeling is a popular policy to address the obesity epidemic, but it has had little empirical success. Under the premise that willful avoidance of information plays a role in this result, we propose a novel approach—pre-nudges—to make consumers more receptive to calorie information. Unlike nudges, which are used to directly influence a choice, pre-nudges are used to directly influence how consumers react to the nudge itself (the calorie label). In line with predictions from our theoretical analysis, we test two pre-nudges in the context of menu labeling: one aims to increase self-efficacy, and the other one highlights the long-term health risks of overeating. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, we find that both pre-nudges reduce calorie information avoidance. Overall, our paper suggests a possible role for pre-nudges in addressing the obesity epidemic—one of the largest public health issues globally—and illustrates the potential usefulness of pre-nudges more generally",

          "abstract": "Cultural ecosystem services are non-material benefits people obtain from ecosystems; yet the indirect inspirational values of biodiversity, including both ecosystems and biological organisms, in creative literary works remain underexplored. This study investigated occurrences of biodiversity in the lyrics of Japanese popular songs based on monetary estimation, as an exploration of the inspirational value of biodiversity. I analyzed the lyrics of the top 50 songs from the Japanese CD singles chart over 22 years (1999–2020), extracting nouns related to ecosystems and organisms. The extracted words were classified into ecosystems and taxonomic groups, and the total sales amount of songs related to each class was calculated. Statistical analyses compared the occurrences and total sales amounts of songs containing biodiversity. Finally, I investigated the effect of richness of ecosystems and biological organisms within a song on its sales amount, using generalized linear mixed modeling to assess the prevalence of songs inspired by biodiversity. Out of 1,100 songs, 403 songs included references to ecosystems or biological organisms, with plants being the most frequently mentioned. Ecosystems that are familiar to Japanese people and biological organisms which they frequently encounter in their cultural and daily lives contributed to aesthetic inspiration in the lyrics of Japanese popular songs. Most importantly, I indicated that the existence of a single biological organisms within a song lyric can enhance its sales amount, namely prevalence to people. My result implies that the inclusion of a less well-known biological species within a song can indirectly inspire people, increasing recognition and willingness to conserve it.",

          "abstract": "Science communication plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust in science amid complex societal challenges. This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors. It introduces the CASSCO (Complex Adaptive System of Science Communication) model, which integrates complex adaptive systems theory with game theory to analyze strategic interactions in science communication. The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between institutional and organizational roles across three communica-tion modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios - citizen science and generative AI – the study demonstrates its potential for predicting non-linear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications, model limitations, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "Social stratification is interested in unequal life chances and assumes the existence of a hierarchy of more or less advantageous occupations. Yet occupations are not easily translated into a linear hierarchical measure. Influential scales combine multiple indicators and lack intuitive interpretation. We present a new scale based on occupations’ earnings potential (OEP). The OEP scale measures the median earnings of occupations and expresses them as percentiles of the overall earnings structure: If machine mechanics earn the national median wage, their OEP is 50. We construct national OEP scales using annual microdata pooled over several decades for Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and US. Consistent with the Treiman constant, these national scales are highly correlated over time (r=0.90) and across countries (r=0.80), justifying the use of one common OEP scale. When applied to another European database, the common OEP scale explains a quarter of the variance in earnings – and performs as well for countries used to construct the scale as for countries not used. Moreover, it is associated with the causes (education) and consequences (social mobility) that theory expects it to be. OEP provides a simple, clear and parsimonious indicator of economic advantage that can be meaningfully interpreted.",

          "abstract": "We propose a theoretical framework to explain fertility declines over the past two centuries around the world. The framework suggests that low-fertility countries already entered and will persist in a fertility equilibrium in the foreseeable future. What distinguishes our theoretical framework from the previous ones is the centrality of women in our model. The woman has a different interest in fertility decisions from others including her male partner. In most human history, her input in fertility decisions was minimal. As the premodern regime begins to crumble, women gradually become aware of other life choices and obtain reproductive autonomy. These changes inevitably lead to falls in fertility. The falls are ultimately driven by the push for broad gender equality and would continue and not be permanently reversed until they meet pronatalistic forces in a below-replacement environment where the antinatalistic and pronatalistic forces balance out into a fertility equilibrium.",

          "abstract": "This paper compares processes of labour market entry and early career stages in Britain and West Germany. It starts by looking at the characteristics of the respective institutional structures in which human capital is formed and allocated. The two national systems of formal institutions can be regarded as generating particular modes of co-ordination between education and the labour market, that is that the labour market integration of young people follows different rules in the two countries. A frame of reference is provided by a general model that distinguishes between a horizontal, a vertical and a temporal dimension of the process of integration into the labour market. These dimensions are further pursued in empirical terms: here, major aims of the paper are to assess the effects of formal qualifications on the quality of first jobs and to analyse the multi-dimensional stability of entry positions in early careers. In Britain, co-ordination is, to a larger extent, achieved by criteria of timing, in addition to the hierarchical grading of qualifications; in Germany the latter, as well as substantive occupational skills, play a major role. There have also been important historical changes in these dimensions, especially in the UK.",

          "abstract": "As populations age and informal caregiving becomes more widespread, the health consequences of providing care are becoming a key concern for societies. Sociological theories of stress appraisal and role strain posit detrimental consequences to the health and wellbeing of caregivers. Conversely, role enhancement theory holds that caregiving can have positive health consequences. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) collected among adults aged 50 years or older with a follow-up period of up to 20 years (2002-23, N ca. 20,000 persons), we examine associations between transitions into and out of caregiving, and two key health outcomes which have been understudied as consequences of caregiving, namely: allostatic load and cognitive functioning. We estimate asymmetric fixed-effects models which model changes in health outcomes as a function of transitions into and out of caregiving while accounting for unobserved between-person heterogeneity. Our results show that caregiving is associated with better cognitive health for both men and women, but not with improved biomarker-based allostatic load. Results do not differ by caregiving intensity, irrespective of which amount of time is defined as intense caregiving. Our findings provide support for role enhancement theory, suggesting that caregivers benefit in terms of cognitive functioning, even if a biomarker-based approach to measuring stress-related health outcome does not corroborate an overall health benefit. We formulate implications for policy-making and directions for future research.",

The effectiveness of the PAD model was rigorously evaluated through comparative experiments involving test scores and a specialized Likert scale questionnaire, which examined changes in students’ self-directed learning, practical application skills, and value cultivation before and after the intervention. Results indicated that students engaged with the PAD model not only achieved higher test scores but also demonstrated enhanced self-directed learning, improved practical application skills, and developed more substantial value qualities.

          "abstract": "The Court of Justice frequently redrafts the questions submitted to it by the national courts in the \ncontext of the preliminary reference procedure. The practice is known as reformulation, and \noftentimes determines a change to the substance of the question, which is referred to in this article as  substantial reformulation. The Court justifies its use in the need to provide a useful answer to the \nnational court. This article empirically investigates how the Court uses the submissions of the parties \nand other materials in the case to substantially reformulate. To do so, it builds a framework of analysis  to observe the possible influence of the parties in the changes to the dispute and the justifications used  by the Court. The analysis relies on a unique dataset of 380 hand-coded preliminary rulings on interpretation.\nThe findings confirm that substantive reformulation at the Court is frequent and significant. In \nreformulating the dispute, the Court draws on the materials submitted by the parties, and their \ninfluence can be traced to the questions actually replied to by the Court. Yet, the influence of the \nparties in setting the boundaries of the dispute must not be overstated, as it remains fully within the \nCourt’s control when to reformulate and which materials to use to do so. Furthermore, it is difficult \nto identify patterns in the Court’s use of substantial reformulation. Providing a sufficient answer is a \nconvenient excuse, but it does not seem to fully explain the findings of the article.

A stationary two-mode Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model is specified to obtain the distribution of actors' memberships in subgroups. Subgroups emerge from actors' decisions to join one or more subgroups. Cohesion of these subgroups is modeled by actors' strong preference to be in the same subgroups as their network contacts. The model is estimated using the Method of Moments, with target statistics derived from the prior assumptions. Evaluation statistics are defined to measure the cohesion and variability of the generated systems of subgroups. As a proof of concept, we model cohesive subgroups in a high-school friendship network, where students are assumed to belong to unobserved peer groups. The results indicate that actors form cohesive subgroups of varying composition, characterized by denser overlaps when actors prefer multiple memberships with their network contacts.",

Homelessness has increased especially in areas with greater shortages of affordable private rental housing (relative to demand from low income households). \n\nThe research, ‘The changing geography of homelessness in Australia (2001–21) and its structural drivers’, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from Swinburne University of Technology, Launch Housing and RMIT University, investigates the changing geography of homelessness in Australia from 2001 to 2021 and the role of structural factors, such as poverty and supplies of affordable rental housing, in shaping this geography. \n\nHomelessness was also higher in areas with smaller supplies of social housing relative to demand. The research suggests that an increase in social housing will further significantly reduce homelessness.\n\nIn areas with a greater shortage of affordable rental dwellings, a higher percentage of Specialist Homelessness Service clients are returning for support after having been assisted. As the majority of people experiencing homelessness tend to remain in the same area, localised responses to homelessness are really important. Homelessness services and affordable housing options need to be expanded in areas where they are needed, and not just where existing services are located.\n\nIn order to provide housing to clients who accessed a Specialist Homelessness Service in 2021–22, the research estimated that around 158,000 one- to two-bedroom dwellings and 25,000 three-or-more-bedroom dwellings are needed nationally.

          "abstract": "Neuroscience is traditionally considered a branch of biology, with interdisciplinary influences from a wide range of fields including psychology, computer science, engineering and mathematics. As a result, a computational approach to neuroscience has emerged that analyzes human brain activity as the superposition of signals that yield complex rhythms and nonlinear dynamics. The computational approach assumes that normative properties, such as value, meaning and purpose, that are highly relevant to humanity are somehow emergent from these otherwise mechanical interactions. Here, I propose that brain dynamics reflect an organic whole that, in the words of Iain McGilchrist, is “inextricably linked with values, meaning and purpose.” This proposal suggests that brain activity can be investigated as a “kind of music:” a global, emotive form, the shape of which contains nested information regarding vital physiology and embodied emotionality. Using electroencephalography (EEG) as an example, and drawing on the field of musicology, I review historical and recent evidence that reveals how neurodynamics can be seen more like music or an artistic creation: multi-scale, context sensitive, dynamically evolving, and intrinsically meaningful. This “neurodynamics of music” hypothesis is investigated using a geometric framework that includes rhythms and nonlinear dynamics, but where those properties must be understood in the context of the vital metabolism of living organisms. Vital, homeostatic and emotional signals underpin the recurrent play of anticipation and fulfillment in life, brain activity and from which, differentiated meaning is sculpted from the global whole. Neuroscience can benefit from the tools of the humanities informing its analytic methods, theoretical assumptions and interpretive frameworks. Through reengagement with the musical heart of neurodynamics, we may be more inclined to see our brains, our minds, and ourselves, as creatively meaningful, purposeful and alive.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive focus on the rise in midlife mortality in the U.S. in recent years, the implications of this trend for children’s exposure to parental death—or bereavement—remain minimally explored. In this study, we introduce a new approach to estimate trends in children’s exposure to co-resident parental death in the U.S over the past 25 years (1999-2023). Our methodological approach relies on a fusion model and data simulation that joins recent population and mortality data to estimate children’s exposure to co-resident parental death. The results reveal a subtle rise in parental death each year since the early 2010s: in 2023 alone, more than 300,000 children experienced a co-resident parent’s death. The results further demonstrate that the long-running, steady increase in the annual number of parentally bereaved children accumulates to more than 2.4 million children under 18 in 2023 having ever experienced a parent’s death—representing approximately 3.2% of the child population. The results further demonstrate race and ethnic disparities, with non-Hispanic Indigenous children especially at risk of parental death. Together, the results attest to the need for a comprehensive policy response to support parentally bereaved children, and the need for further scholarly recognition of this uniquely consequential childhood adversity.",

          "abstract": "Elections are the key mechanism through which voters hold elected officials accountable. The partisan composition of local, state, and national legislatures and governments, in turn, influences key policy choices and public goods provision. Yet studying issues of representation, government responsiveness, and partisan politics across different levels of government, in particular at the local level, has been difficult. We often lack comprehensive, comparable, and harmonized election results at small-scale units such as municipalities. This paper introduces a new panel dataset of local, state, and federal election results in Germany at the municipality level with coverage for the past decades. Our data includes turnout and partisan vote shares for all major parties. We harmonize the data to address municipal boundary changes and to account for mail-in districts, providing researchers with a consistent panel of municipalities in their 2021 boundaries as well as corresponding municipal and county boundary shapefiles. Our dataset will facilitate new research on representation and responsiveness across all levels of government and how political dynamics have changed over time.",

          "authors": "Jinchi Li; Eric Zhao; Zhixiang Li",
          "abstract": "Accurately predicting football match outcomes is valuable for stakeholders such as fans, analysts, sports betting companies, and team strategists. In this study, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for predicting football match results by transforming numerical features into contextual inputs. Key features include historical match results, player ratings, coach ratings, and other relevant conditions, which are processed by the LLM to predict the match winner. We compare the performance of LLM-based predictions with traditional machine learning (ML) models, including random forest and XGBoost. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs achieve comparable accuracy to these conventional ML techniques. Additionally, the LLM offers a significant advantage in that it requires no model training, simplifying implementation and reducing computational costs. This makes LLMs a promising, resource-efficient alternative for football match prediction, presenting new opportunities for AI-driven sports analytics.",

          "title": "Analysing A Selection of Family Policies from the Perspective of Resilience",
          "authors": "Mary Daly; Merve Uzunalioglu; Holly Shorey",
          "abstract": "This report undertakes an analysis of social policy provision in the six rEUsilience countries from the perspective of resilience and the role of social policy. The analyses are based on a theoretical framework which defines resilience as families’ capacity to adjust to situations of risk without negative outcome and interprets social policy as having both protective functions, such as support available throughout family-based transitions, and promotive functions, such as adequate income support, in affecting the conditions for families to be resilient. The report prioritises the protective aspects. It therefore considers how policy supports transitions for all parents between care and employment and how policy treats three particular types of family situation that the research identifies as needing extra support: parenting alone, caring for a children with a disability or illness, and coping with a migrant background. Consequently, five areas of policy are analysed: parenting-related leaves, early childhood education and care (ECEC), provisions for lone-parent families, provisions for families coping with a disability or illness on the part of a child, and provisions for families with a migration background adjusting or integrating into the new country.\n\nIn response to the question of the extent to which the national and EU policy systems support families to be resilient, the analysis highlights a number of important findings. First, some policy fields seem to be better equipped, or further along the road, than others in helping families to be resilient. The policies oriented to transitions - parental leaves and ECEC – generally seem to be better developed then those for family situations with heightened risk. Second, conditions that exclude people from benefits and services reduce policies’ effectiveness (from a resilience as well as other perspectives). Third, where the EU has set legal benchmarks most countries meet them, and so the significance of the EU as a policy agent is confirmed. But where the EU only makes ‘soft recommendations’, they do not seem to penetrate deeply into the national systems. Fourth, the recognition that some families need more has not fully penetrated the policy systems. One big issue is that of equivalence in support for lone-parent families vis-à-vis those with two parents. The dearth of information on and system knowledge about certain types of families, especially those coping with child illness and migrant families, is a general weakness found across countries.",

          "authors": "Peter Søgaard Jørgensen; Louis Delannoy; Sofia Maniatakou; Carl Folke; Michele-Lee Moore; Pero Olsson",
          "abstract": "Social and environmental challenges are combining to form a polycrisis with potential to delay or reset many sustainability efforts. These risks raise questions about what capacities will be needed for advancing sustainability during a time of interlinked crises. Here, we evaluate the adequacy of adaptive and transformative capacities for navigating the polycrisis. Specifically, we perform a rapid assessment of their potential for addressing the 14 recently proposed Anthropocene traps. We find that ten Anthropocene traps have characteristics that challenge in total 17 of 23 adaptive and transformative capacities. On the other hand, 10 of 23 capacities - with an overrepresentation of transformative capacities - have general potential to prevent formation and progress of traps. Coevolutionary struggles between the expression of a capacity and the progression of traps are widespread. Importantly, transformative and adaptive capacities complement each other in the types of Anthropocene traps they most frequently address, with transformative capacities targeting global traps and adaptive capacities the emergent structural traps related to connectivity and pace of change. We end by proposing five unifying processes that can serve as an organizing framework for consideration of other sustainability and crisis capacities.",

          "title": "Estimating Unknown Cut-points in Regression Discontinuity and Kink Designs",
          "authors": "Benjamin F. Reese",
          "abstract": "Regression discontinuity designs (RDD) and regression kink designs (RKD) are popular identification strategies across the social sciences. The relatively weak assumptions required for identifying a causal effect with RDD/RKDs make the designs attractive quasi-experimental methods for causal inference. One limitation of RDD/RKDs is that they rely on an exogenously given and previously known treatment rule. To overcome this limitation, economists (Porter &amp; Yu 2015, Hansen 2017, Boehnke &amp; Bonaldi 2019, and Tanu 2020) and computer scientists (Herlands et al. 2018) have begun to develop methods and tests that can find unknown discontinuities. However, these tests are either largely theoretically focused, computationally intensive, inconvenient to implement, or otherwise do not fit the specific needs of applied political scientists. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel, more flexible, and extremely easy to implement approach to estimate unknown cut-points in both RDDs and RKDs. It is the first method that can detect unknown thresholds in both RDDs and RKDs. I call this method the unknown cut-point regression discontinuity/kink design (UCRDD/UCRKD). It works by uniformly dividing an assignment variable into quantiles to create a distribution of “candidate” cut-points. Each candidate threshold is then tested in a RDD model (Imbens &amp; Kalyanaraman 2012) to find the “best” cut-point, the cut-point that has the largest substantive effect and highest degree of statistical significance. Researchers can use UCRDD/UCRKD to find “tipping-points” in behavior; to determine obscured or non-public policy criteria; and as a diagnostic tool to determine if there are other significant thresholds in their traditional RDD/RKD. In the application section, I apply UCRKD to assess how to define the concept of a minority district and to estimate the treatment effect of minority districts on electoral support for minority candidates.",
