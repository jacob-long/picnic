          "abstract": "Journal editors play a key role in shaping research practices by deciding whether journals adopt policies related to open science and transparency. Despite sustained advocacy for open science, adoption of these policies remains highly variable across social science journals. This proposed qualitative study will use semi-structured interviews to examine how social science journal editors make decisions about adopting open science-related policies at their journals. Guided by the COM-B model of behaviour change, we will explore editors’ perceived capability, opportunity, and motivation to implement open science related policies at their journals. The study will investigate twelve open science policies and practices, with primary focus on data and code sharing and computational reproducibility, open content peer review, and naming the handling editor on published articles. Additional practices include open identities in peer review, materials sharing, preregistration, and publishing registered reports, null results, direct replications, and post-publication critique. Editors will be recruited through an international online community for social science journal editors, and purposely sampled to capture diverse disciplines, journal economic models, and perspectives. Interview data will be analysed using deductive content analysis informed by the COM-B model alongside inductive thematic analysis. By providing rich descriptive evidence on editors’ experiences, reservations, and constraints, this study aims to inform approaches to promoting open science policy adoption at journals.",

          "abstract": "The rigorous treatment of uncertainties in global environmental assessments is essential to characterise the scientific state of the art and to inform policy. Recognizing this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has adopted a standardized assessment framework to promote transparency and consistency in reporting the level of confidence in its key findings — most prominently those featured in the Summary for Policymakers. However, applying this framework is challenging and often leads to confidence statements based on expert judgment rather than a transparent and replicable process. Here we recommend an updated framework for assessing uncertainties that is suitable for lines of quantitative ex-post policy evaluation evidence that inform Working Group II and III reports. The framework uses evidence synthesized from systematic reviews to support robust and transparent confidence statements and to provide a clear and traceable rationale for conclusions. Where such synthesized evidence is lacking, we offer practical guidance and outline intermediary steps for improving confidence assessments. Our approach provides a concrete and replicable pathway to enhance the level of transparency and the reliability of scientific assessments that inform climate policy.",

          "authors": "Maximilian Fascher; Krysztof Krasowski; Markus Muehlhan",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Neural drug cue reactivity (DCR) is a central paradigm in addiction neuroscience for probing how drug cues acquire excessive motivational salience in substance use disorders (SUDs). However, the field faces challenges in clinical translation, replicability, and within-group designs are susceptible to visual confounding due to stimulus matching. A complementary approach is to examine case-control contrasts to identify SUD-specific neural architecture while mitigating effects of task-design variability. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify convergence effects in the contrast drug &gt; control cues between SUD and control groups. ALE results were supplemented by assessing behavioural domains, meta-analytic connectivity profiles, robustness to publication bias, and study-level modulators using penalised logistic regression. Results: The ALE analysis revealed one reliable convergence cluster in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), associated with reward, reasoning, and social cognition. Penalised logistic regression indicated that contributions to this cluster were less likely in alcohol DCR studies and were sensitive to matching conditions for human content. vACC DCR effects contrasted with neutral control cues were invariant across abstinence periods, whereas DCR contrasted with natural reward cues declined with longer abstinence. Conclusion: This meta-analysis replicates context-sensitive SUD-specific DCR convergence in vACC regions intersecting reward pathways and the default-mode network yet limited support for striatal centredness. The review recapitulates these results by discussing current challenges in balancing personalisation and standardisation, the use of motivationally inert versus salient comparators, and argues for careful deliberation when inferring evidence for hyperreactive reward responses.",

          "authors": "Christopher Esch; Farid Fares; Elisabeth Kals; Christina Ursula Pfeuffer",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used for decision-making, but its perception compared to human decision-makers remains underexplored, especially in educational contexts. In this study, we investigated the influence of the decision-maker (AI vs. human) on fairness perception, trust, and emotional responses in participants (N = 329) who are allocated university course topics. While the allocation process was identical, participants were either told that a human lecturer or an AI made the decision based on the same pieces of information. Furthermore, we manipulated whether the corresponding decision-making process was explicitly communicated as fair or whether no comment was made regarding the process’ fairness. Finally, we assessed how favourable students rated the outcome of the allocation process. Against our hypotheses, Bayesian evidence indicated that neither the decision-maker nor whether the decision-making process was communicated as fair had an impact on students' fairness perception, trust, or emotional responses. Students’ evaluations of the university course topic allocation process were strongly associated with the favourability of the outcome.  Given that an AI can better optimize allocations according to students’ preferences than human decision-makers, these findings support a broader implementation of AI-based decision-making in the context of allocation decisions at university.",

          "abstract": "When crisis strikes, does the presence of real and immediate threat compel us to think realistically about the future? Or does the distress in such situations lead us to prioritize emotional relief and hope? In this study, we examined how individuals formed predictions amidst a severe national crisis, the October 7th attacks and ensuing war in Israel. Analyzing data from 1,029 Israeli participants, we find evidence for wishful thinking: at a group-level, participants tended to assign higher probabilities to outcomes they considered preferable, and  lower probabilities to outcomes they feared. These effects were more pronounced among optimists. These findings document the existence of optimistic distortions even in an environment where personal consequences were salient. The study’s implications extend to both individual judgment as well as institutional decision-making, emphasizing the need for strategies that counteract bias while recognizing the positive psychological functions of optimism during crisis.",

          "authors": "Carlos Yong-Qing Hsu Speck",
          "abstract": "Music is a cultural universal, yet the conceptual boundary between “music” and “non‑music” remains theoretically unsettled. This study used behavioral measures to examine the perceptual judgments of listeners from Brazil, China, and the United States as they classified short sound excerpts and rated their perceived musicality. Participants (N = 103) completed an online survey featuring 24 two‑second stimuli drawn from 11 sound categories, including traditional music from 130 societies and non‑musical sounds from established auditory taxonomies. Descriptively, the mean proportion of “music” classifications was 0.51, with substantial category‑level variation: traditional vocal and non‑vocal music received the highest endorsement rates, whereas speech and environmental sounds received the lowest. Musicality ratings showed a parallel pattern. Inter‑participant agreement, quantified using Krippendorff’s α, was moderate at the aggregate level (α = .73) but generally low within categories.\n\nTo complement these descriptive patterns, mixed‑effects models were used to assess whether sound category or country predicted responses while accounting for participant‑ and stimulus‑level variability. Both models revealed large, reliable effects of sound category: the two traditional music categories were far more likely to be judged as music and received substantially higher musicality ratings than all other categories. No other category differed significantly from the reference, and country effects were small or nonsignificant. Together, the descriptive and inferential results indicate that listeners share strong intuitions about prototypical musical sounds, but judgments become highly heterogeneous for ambiguous cases, suggesting that the concept of music may be graded and context‑dependent rather than sharply bounded.",

          "authors": "Natalie Hernandez",
          "abstract": "Standard measures of abortion attitudes, such as the American National Election Survey’s four-point scale, do not capture public opinion on the dimensions that structure the post-Roe abortion policy landscape. While these traditional measures rely on broad, categorical distinctions, contemporary policy debates increasingly hinge on two specific factors: the reason for seeking an abortion and the gestational age of the fetus. To address this mismatch, I develop an original survey instrument that measures opinion along these dimensions. Using data from a large-scale survey (N = 69,752), I show that continuing to use the ANES scale introduces partisan-driven, nonrandom measurement error. Specifically, Democrats and Republicans who select the same ANES response hold systematically different policy preferences, and respondents with comparable policy preferences select different ANES answer choices depending on their partisanship—with Democrats anchoring their answers to a more permissive baseline. These findings underscore the risk of relying on broad-based attitudinal scales that do not evolve alongside the policy debates they are meant to capture.",

          "authors": "Richard Cowden; Kaye Cook",
          "abstract": "Research on the psychology of divine forgiveness has expanded in recent years, yet most studies rely on cross-sectional designs and generalized measures that do not capture how forgiveness-related processes unfold following specific instances of personal wrongdoing. Guided by a Christian-sensitive relational spirituality model of personal sin, the present study used an incident-anchored longitudinal design to explore two central processes involved in experiencing reconciliation with God—engaging in repentance with God (ER) and experiencing absolution from God (EA)—over a 16-day period beginning within 24 hours of a self-identified wrongdoing. U.S. Christian adults (N = 175) who met the inclusion criteria completed assessments on days 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Multilevel growth model comparisons favored a logarithmic trajectory for both processes, indicating rapid early increases that tapered over time. Although these two processes unfolded in parallel, ER was higher on day 1 and EA increased more steeply over time. Baseline relational spirituality variables predicted individual differences in trajectories of change: ER increased more steeply among participants reporting lower day 1 divine struggles, whereas EA increased more steeply among those reporting higher day 1 communion with God and lower divine struggles. Prospective within-person associations suggested asymmetric temporal dynamics for ER and EA: positive within-person deviation in ER more clearly preceded higher subsequent EA than the inverse, and positive within-person deviation in EA (but not ER) modestly predicted higher subsequent communion with God. These findings further our understanding of how experiences of divine forgiveness unfold following specific incidents of personal wrongdoing.",

          "abstract": "Classifying whether an auditory signal is music or speech is important for both humans and computational systems.  Although previous literature suggests that music and speech are easily separable categories, common experimental approaches may bias findings toward this distinction by relying on stimuli from different sound sources and predefined response labels. Here, we use stimulus material from the dùndún drum–a speech surrogate that can signal either speech-related or musical content. We first replicate standard speech-music categorization results (N=108). Then, we depart from the typical experimental procedure by asking new participants (N=180) to sort and label the stimulus material, without predefined categories. Hierarchical clustering of participants’ stimulus groupings reveals multiple organizing dimensions, with the speech–music distinction reliably present but secondary under label-free conditions. By reverse-engineering the relationship between sorting behavior, acoustic features, and semantic labels, we characterize how speech–music categorization relates to other salient perceptual dimensions and how its behavioral prominence depends on task constraints.",

We critically discuss the FDA approval document and the approval trial. In the approval trial, efficacy was not clinically meaningful, statistical significance uncertain, and there were significantly more adverse events with escitalopram than with placebo. Relative to placebo, children and adolescents exposed to escitalopram were more likely to become suicidal than to experience a clinically relevant improvement in anxiety. Overall, the harm/benefit ratio seems problematic for escitalopram for pediatric GAD.",

          "abstract": "Background \nVisual distortions (VDs) are frequently reported but insufficiently characterized in early psychosis and may reflect alterations in perceptual processing. Computational accounts emphasize aberrant precision-weighting of sensory evidence and prior expectations, but most empirical work has used simplified laboratory stimuli. It remains unclear whether these mechanistic accounts generalize to more naturalistic perceptual contexts. \n\nMethods\nWe developed virtual reality (VR) tasks simulating VDs in photorealistic scenes and explored associations between VD perception and psychosis-relevant traits in a non-clinical sample. 120 healthy adults completed three tasks designed to probe complementary aspects of perceptual inference: (1) a naïve detection task (NDT) assessing expectation-driven false percepts of unspecified visual changes; (2) a perceptual uncertainty task (PUT) testing how detection under ambiguous sensory evidence is shaped by recent trial history; and (3) an adaptive two-interval forced-choice task (2-IFC) quantifying bottom-up sensitivity to psychosis-like VDs. Psychosis-relevant traits were assessed using validated questionnaires of delusional ideation, anomalous perceptual experiences, and schizotypal traits. \n\nResults\nHigher levels of delusional ideation and schizotypy were associated with stronger expectation effects, reflected in increased false percepts in the NDT trial without changes and enhanced detection of near-threshold distortions when these trials followed distortion-present trials in the PUT. These traits were also linked to reduced 2-IFC perceptual sensitivity to VDs, particularly brightness changes.\n\nConclusions\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of VR-based VD assessment and provide initial evidence that individual differences in VD perception relate to psychosis-relevant traits. Results suggest contributions from both diminished sensory sensitivity and increased reliance on expectations in naturalistic perceptual contexts.",

Four consecutively sampled stroke survivors (mean chronicity=18 months, SD=10) with mild (n=3) or moderate (n=1) cognitive impairment received 35 hours of CICT. CICT combined two empirically supported approaches: Speed of Processing Training (SOPT) and behavior change techniques from Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) adapted to transfer gains from in-lab cognitive training to daily life. The latter featured IADL training following shaping principles and a suite of behavioral techniques, called the Transfer Package, to promote participation in cognitively-based functional activities outside of the lab. Outcome measures assessed cognitive processing speed (Useful Field of View, UFOV) and IADL performance outside the treatment setting (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, COPM). All three participants with valid UFOV data displayed meaningful improvements after treatment in cognitive processing speed (M=64%, SD=40, d'=1.58). All three with COPM data reported meaningful improvements in satisfaction with IADL performance (M=2.87, SD=1.5, d'=1.91). Values of d' ≥0.57 are large. Per structured interviews developed for this study, the IADL improvements present after treatment lasted for at least a year. These promising findings warrant further study.",

          "abstract": "Many people adjust their speech to accommodate listeners who may face comprehension difficulties, including older adults and non-native speakers, giving rise to registers such as Elderspeak and Foreigner-Directed Speech. In the current pre-registered study, we investigated whether non-autistic speakers similarly modified their speech in interactions with listeners who disclosed they were autistic. We used the Map Task paradigm; 33 participants (mean age = 36 years) gave verbal instructions to a confederate in two conditions: one in which the confederate disclosed being autistic and the other in which they did not. Participants did not show evidence of linguistic accommodation toward the autistic listener on any of the linguistic measures we coded for, including speech rate, syntactic complexity (e.g., MLU), semantic complexity (e.g., type-token ratio) and discourse features (e.g., repetitions). Although there was no average difference on these measures between the autistic and non-autistic listener conditions, exploratory analyses showed that more positive attitudes toward autism were associated with lower degree of accommodation to the autistic listener on one measure, MLU. No associations were found between level of contact and degree of accommodation. These findings suggest that an autism label alone does not cue linguistic accommodations, and that more positive attitudes towards autism may reduce the likelihood of linguistically accommodating autistic listeners.",

          "authors": "Vishakha Shukla; Angela Xiaoxue He; Sudha Arunachalam",
          "abstract": "Most autistic children have language delays, which can result in challenges with comprehending narratives. We explored how unscripted narratives produced by parents might be tuned to support their child’s language comprehension, and how children visually follow along with their parents’ speech. Data from English-acquiring 18 autistic (48-78 months) and 18 language-matched non-autistic children (32-50 months) and one of their parents were analyzed (n = 36). We examined variables related to topic identification and maintenance, including how often parents mentioned the narrative’s topic, how they referred to it (e.g., “the pig” vs. “it”), and how much children looked at it. Results indicated many similarities between groups, but also some key differences: parents of autistic children produced shorter narratives and talked about the primary character proportionally more than parents of non-autistic children. In both groups, children looked at the primary character more than other characters, and the parent’s proportion of topic reference was positively associated with children’s proportion of looking at the primary character. Similar patterns arose with the full sample of autistic children, which includes children who had not been able to be matched on language (n = 32). These findings suggest that parent input to autistic children may be tuned to support challenges that autistic children might experience, such as slower language processing or distractibility by unrelated story elements, and, given this tuned input, autistic children were successful, at least in the sense of looking at the primary character, in following along with the narratives.",

          "authors": "Adrian Meule; David R. Kolar",
          "abstract": "People with emetophobia (specific fear of vomiting) are prone to experience disgust and tend to interpret feelings of disgust as signs of imminent vomiting. Accordingly, they typically avoid situations they believe might increase the likelihood of vomiting or expose them to others vomiting. Because of this, vomit-related stimuli are often used as part of exposure exercises during treatment. To examine relationships between emetophobia symptoms, disgust, and avoidance behavior in more detail, the current study tested 126 participants (77% female) who completed self-report measures on emetophobia symptoms, disgust propensity, disgust sensitivity, and state disgust, and performed a behavioral approach test (BAT) involving a vomit-like substance in the laboratory. Higher emetophobic symptomatology related to higher disgust sensitivity but did not relate to disgust propensity. Both emetophobic symptomatology and disgust sensitivity—but not disgust propensity—related to higher state disgust before the BAT. In contrast, higher disgust propensity—but not emetophobic symptomatology or disgust sensitivity—related to larger increases in state disgust from before to after the BAT and to higher avoidance of the vomit-like substance. Results suggest that people with emetophobia may not be more easily disgusted by external stimuli than people without emetophobia but their subjective feelings of disgust are driven by their expectations and their tendency to evaluate the experience of disgust more negatively. This implies that the aim of exposure exercises should not be reducing vomit stimuli-induced disgust intensity but modifying patients’ expectations and interpretation of feelings of disgust.",

          "abstract": "Cologna et al. (2025) compared perceived scientist trustworthiness across 68 countries/regions and examined its associations with individual- and country-level factors. While the authors reported that the scale did not satisfy metric and scalar measurement invariance, their subsequent cross-national/regional comparisons and regressions were nonetheless conducted using weighted means of observed item scores, implicitly assuming cross-country/region comparability at the observed-score level. Using the publicly shared dataset, we re-evaluated these conclusions by systematically applying measurement alignment under four analytical paths: pooled-sample versus country/region-specific confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), each estimated with and without weights. Across all specifications, cross-national/regional CFA supported configural and metric invariance but failed to establish scalar or strict invariance. Importantly, under the analytical path most closely corresponding to the original study (pooled CFA with weights), only the competence and openness factors yielded admissible aligned solutions within the four-factor model. Using aligned latent scores for these two dimensions, country/region rankings changed for 62 of the 68 countries/regions. Substantive conclusions also differed: associations between perceived scientist trustworthiness and science-related populist attitudes or social dominance orientation were near zero or non-robust, whereas attitudes toward science remained strongly and positively related. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that cross-national/regional comparisons based on observed-score averages may be misleading when measurement equivalence is not established, and that latent-variable approaches such as alignment provide a more defensible basis for international inference.",

          "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with early, regionally selective neurodegenerative changes that may affect socioemotional functioning before atrophy becomes widespread. This study examined whether structural brain alterations in MCI relate to facial emotion recognition performance. Sixty adults (30 MCI, 30 healthy controls), aged 50-86 years, completed neuropsychological testing, the Facial emotion composite Task, and structural MRI. \nOur results revealed no significant gray matter volume differences between groups. Cortical thickness analyses identified two regions with reduced thickness in MCI: the right superior parietal lobule and the left posterior insula. Results revealed that greater regional volume predicted better sadness recognition in MCI, whereas this association was negative in healthy controls. These findings suggest that early MCI involves selective thinning in association cortices supporting attention and salience processing. The sadness-specific interaction indicates that patients with MCI may draw on structural reserve within the superior parietal lobule to support recognition of subtle negative expressions, highlighting early parietal involvement in socioemotional decline.",

          "authors": "Emily Kubin; Christian von Sikorski",
          "abstract": "Political scandals can shape entire elections and political structures within society. Scholars have long pointed to different strategies politicians can use to respond to such scandals—finding strategies like denying may be more effective than apologizing. However, a recent trend suggests politicians increasingly respond to accusations of scandal by emphasizing how they (or their political in-group) have been victimized. These victimhood strategies may be highly effective by garnering sympathy and reducing blame, but have yet to be studied in political scandal research. Across 3 studies in the United States (N = 2,541), we show that when politicians respond to scandal accusations by emphasizing their own (or their political in-group’s) victimhood, participants see them as more moral and less responsible for the scandal. Additionally, people are more sympathetic to politicians emphasizing victimhood as compared to apologizing and control conditions. Victimhood strategies do not reduce competency evaluations—potentially making these strategies especially effective. While responding by highlighting victimhood is less effective than denial, victimhood strategies positively benefit reactions to scandalized politicians with people from across the ideological spectrum. Further these strategies work similarly well for male and female politicians. These findings underscore how responding to scandal with victimhood can significantly and positively influence the publics’ perceptions of a scandalized politician—highlighting the powerful influence of victimhood in political scandal research.",

          "abstract": "The constructs of emotion, affect, and emotion regulation are widely emphasized as central to psychological health and well-being. Although the conceptualization of emotion is a matter of much debate, two key features pervade affective frameworks despite diversity in theories and disparate usage of terms: (a) the assumption of an innate and universal valence-determining process, and (b) a conceptual approach involving the grouping of multimodal responses into unitary emotion states, often viewed as genetically inherited patterns with situation-specific aims. These features heavily inform psychotherapy theories and popular framings of psychological experience. I first subject these features to a critical examination. I then demonstrate how they can obscure more critical and meaningful targets and foster unwarranted assumptions, potentially contributing to iatrogenic effects and limited treatment efficacy, suboptimal intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning, and concerns pertaining to social control and justice.\n \nKeywords: affect, emotion, valence, emotion regulation, intervention science",

          "abstract": "There are unique challenges to recruiting and retaining couples in relationship research. This study used a mixed-methods approach to understand characteristics that predict participation in a dyadic relationship study. We recruited a racially diverse sample of 59 undergraduate students to complete a set of quantitative measures.  Of these participants, 26 completed a semi-structured qualitative interview, and 17 completed repeated-measures surveys. Of the 59 initial participants, 30 (51%) were willing for their partner to take part the study. We found evidence that both relationship perceptions and mental health symptoms influenced participation. Individuals who reported using domination during conflict with their partner were less likely to participate in the qualitative interview. Discrimination was negatively associated with likelihood of participation in the qualitative interview, but was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Relationship quality, separation during conflict, and anxiety symptoms were positively associated with one’s likelihood of willingness for their partner’s involvement in the study, and there was a negative association for depression symptoms. Interpersonal trauma exposure was negatively associated with willingness for partner involvement but was not statistically significant (p=0.07). Participants were asked to describe their thoughts about dyadic research participation. We found that an individual’s perceptions of their partner’s interest and availability to participate were additional factors that predicted willingness for their partner to be involved in the study. Despite the involved nature of repeated-measures research, participants identified few perceived barriers to survey completion. Our findings add nuance to the field’s understanding of who participates in relationship science research, but also why these individuals choose to take part. The results also highlight methodological implications for consideration when conducting relationship research.",

          "abstract": "Neurolinguistic research on syntactic processing has utilized Node Count, the number of structure-building steps executed at each word, to investigate how the effort invested in structure building affects brain activity. However, several recent studies cast doubt on the presumed link between Node Count and processing effort; they observe negative correlations between Node Count and reading times. Addressing this disagreement, we analyze information-theoretic measures and reading times using three large-scale naturalistic datasets in English across different grammar formalisms: phrase-structure grammar, dependency grammar, and combinatory categorial grammar. This study establishes a dual nature of Node Count: we conclude that it indexes two opposing forces—processing facilitation due to predictability in immediate regions and processing inhibition due to contextual semantic integration in spillover regions. We also demonstrate that Node Count has a unique psycholinguistic value as an index of human prediction, since its facilitatory effect explains reading time variance beyond that captured by a Transformer-based language model. These results highlight the role of structural representations in human language processing and underscore the need for a careful interpretation of the observed correlations between Node Count and brain activity in neurolinguistic studies.",

          "abstract": "Estimating the minimum sample size needed to reach a target performance in machine learning models is a recurring problem in applied research. Unlike many traditional statistical settings, where tools such as GPower can provide closed-form answers, machine learning rarely offers analytic formulas for sample-size planning. In this article, we propose a Monte Carlo simulation approach that uses empirical learning curves and power-law fitting to estimate the required sample size for a given, fixed modeling pipeline. The method uses a Monte Carlo resampling design with a fixed test set, evaluates several training sample sizes through repeated stochastic runs, then: (1) builds learning curves, (2) fits a power-law model to extrapolate, and (3) identifies the sample size that satisfies explicit criteria for mean performance, probability of success, and stability. We implement the procedure in R through the ml_sample_size() function in the easyML package, supporting both classification and regression with common algorithms (e.g.,Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, GLM) for tabular data typical in the social, health, and \nbehavioral sciences. A key limitation is that the recommended sample size n∗ is conditional on the chosen hyperparameter configuration. When hyperparameter tuning is planned, n∗ should be treated as a lower bound, and additional observations may be needed to reflect the added complexity tuning typically introduces. Finally, we provide applied examples using simulated and real datasets to show how the method can support prospective study planning.",

This research tests whether trust in neighbors plays a similar role. Methods: Analyses using data (N = 1,762) from the Midlife in the U.S. study tested whether SES (educational attainment, income, and assets) and trust in neighbors interacted to predict two indices of metabolic syndrome, a marker of cardiovascular and diabetes risk. These two metabolic syndrome indices were the number of dimensions on which participants met clinical risk cutoffs and a diagnosis. Results: SES interacted with neighborhood trust to predict the number of dimensions on which risk cutoffs were met (b = 0.08, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.14], p = 0.014). Lower, but not higher, SES participants met risk cutoffs on fewer dimensions when they had higher trust in their neighbors. The same pattern emerged for the diagnosis outcome, although in this case, the significance of the SES x trust in neighbors interaction depended on the covariates included. Conclusions: Living in neighborhoods where individuals trust each other may protect the health of individuals with lower SES, and investing in programs that build trust among neighbors may reduce health disparities.",

This vocal diversity was also reflected by the distinct acoustic features of typical versus atypical vocalizations. Finally, we demonstrate that co-occurring visual context has profound impact on the perception of real-life laughter and crying vocalizations, especially when vocal cues are ambiguous.

          "authors": "Kamil Safader",
          "abstract": "Persistent differences between autistic and neurotypical cognition are widely documented across perception, reasoning, communication, and social interaction, yet existing explanations remain fragmented across disciplinary levels. This paper proposes a unified account grounded in predictive processing, information theory, representational format, and phenomenology. It explains these differences as systematic consequences of how cognitive systems regulate and selectively attenuate information prior to explicit inference. We argue that the critical distinction does not concern the capacity for prediction as such, but the manner in which predictive systems attenuate low-probability, high-information signals. Informational attenuation is introduced as a common organizing mechanism linking multiple explanatory levels. At the computational level, it defines a principled trade-off between informational fidelity and predictive efficiency, grounded in information-theoretic relations between probability, surprisal, and compression. At the algorithmic level, this trade-off is implemented through precision weighting and thresholding processes that determine which signals are propagated, suppressed, or preserved. At the representational level, differential attenuation shapes predictive format itself, biasing cognition toward either inductively compressed content or explicitly maintained formal structure. At the phenomenological level, the same mechanisms account for systematic differences in experiential organization, explaining why some forms of cognition are characterized by transparency and immediacy, while others involve heightened explicitness and structural salience. At the social and interactional level, differential attenuation explains how inductively stabilized norms support epistemic stability—and why structurally oriented agents may experience such normativity as opaque, underdetermined, or coercive. By linking these levels through a single mechanistic principle, the proposed framework avoids both reductionism and explanatory fragmentation. Autism is thereby understood not as a localized cognitive deficit nor as a loose collection of symptoms, but as a coherent reconfiguration of predictive instantiation and informational priorities.",

We test this prediction in a pre-registered experiment (N = 1,949 Americans) by leveraging the ability of artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs) to engage in evidence-based back-and-forth dialogues. Participants allocated $1 between their favorite charity and a highly effective charity (the Against Malaria Foundation), before and after a conversation with an LLM advocating for the effective charity, a static LLM-generated persuasive message, or a control conversation. The LLM conversation\nsignificantly increased effective donations (45.9%), a significantly larger increase than the static message or control, as well as shifting moral attitudes.

This review presents a new transdiagnostic preventative framework for conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC). The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours - including emotional awareness and regulation of distractions, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with adaptive patterns of connectivity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self, which are associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to adaptive connectivity patterns in mentalizing, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

Additionally, we investigated whether interpersonal values explain this relationship. The findings demonstrated that all Machiavellianism and psychopathy were positively correlated with dislikeability, mediated by the value of distance, whereas no significant negative association with likeability was observed. Uniquely, narcissism was positively related to popularity, with no mediating factors identified, and negatively associated with unpopularity, with this relationship mediated by dominance value. Given that values affecting peer social status are more malleable than traits, they may serve as promising targets for early intervention aimed at preventing social rejection and helping adolescents develop more adaptive strategies to gain peer attention and acceptance.\n\nKeywords:\nDark Triad, popularity, unpopularity, likeability, dislikeability, interpersonal values, sociometric network",

          "abstract": "Gender minority stress theory is the premier theoretical framework for understanding the health and well-being of transgender and non-binary people. However, a theoretical disconnect exists within this field: the Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Measure (GMSRM), widely used to assess gender minority stress, is rooted in latent variable theory, assuming that different stressors (represented as items on the GMSRM) are statistically unrelated, once their given latent variable is accounted for. However, gender minority stress theory proposes that these stressors cause one another, specifically, that distal stressors cause proximal stressors. To address this inconsistency between theory and measurement, we interrogated the assumptions of latent variable models and considered a relatively new measurement framework psychometric network analysis. Our analysis of GMSRM data from 1006 trans* individuals revealed that the GMSRM is better represented by a psychometric network, rather than multiple latent variables, uncovering complex, direct associations among items across its subscales. These findings highlight the need to align measurement approaches with theoretical assumptions to better understand how social stressors impact transgender and non-binary populations.",

Extant youth AL research is hampered by reliance on developmentally-insensitive measurement conventions originating from adult AL studies. This study assessed the developmental utility of four AL measurement strategies with data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N=1303 early adolescents). The traditional count of out-of-range AL biomarkers and an alternative summation of biomarker z-scores had low internal consistencies and were weakly correlated with psychosocial variables. Exploratory factor analysis failed to identify AL factors. Latent profile analysis yielded one “Normative” (average biomarker levels) profile and three distinct AL profiles that were associated with different putative psychosocial risk factors and sequelae. These findings suggest that, instead of downward extension of adult AL conventions, alternate approaches capturing the heterogeneity of biopsychosocial development may most effectively identify accelerated biological aging among early adolescents.",

          "authors": "Christina Artemenko; Mine Avcil",
          "abstract": "Arithmetic processing is represented in a fronto-parietal network of the brain. However, activation within this network is thought to undergo a developmental shift from domain-general cognitive processing in the frontal cortex towards domain-specific magnitude processing in the parietal cortex. This assumption is primarily based on findings in children and young adults. In this registered report, we set out to replicate the proposed fronto-parietal activation shift in arithmetic processing and, for the first time, to explore how neural development of arithmetic continues during aging. This registered report focuses on the behavioral and neural correlates of arithmetic and arithmetic complexity across the lifespan, i.e., childhood, when arithmetic is first learned; young adulthood, when arithmetic skills are well established already, and old age, when individuals have lifelong arithmetic experience. Therefore, brain activation during mental arithmetic was measured in children, younger adults, and older adults using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Arithmetic complexity was manipulated via carry and borrow operations in two-digit addition and subtraction. The results provide evidence that increasing arithmetic complexity is associated with increased activation in the fronto-parietal network across all age groups. Even though behavioral carry and borrow effects decrease during development, suggesting improvements in place-value processing, the underlying categorical and continuous processing characteristics and brain activation remain relatively stable. Thus, this study provides evidence against a developmental fronto-parietal shift in arithmetic processing across the lifespan. While frontal activation may decrease from childhood to adulthood, parietal activation does not show a corresponding increase. Overall, these results suggest that arithmetic skills acquired in childhood are maintained throughout the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Song et al. (2016) proposed a framework to build trainable excitatory-inhibitory recurrent neural networks with user-specified biological mechanisms. These models allow researchers to simulate a miriad of neural, cognitive and behavioral hypothesis through neural circuits, making them one of the most powerful simulation tools for theoretical cognitive modeling nowadays. In the present study we find that using ReLU on weights (not nodes) to set the excitatory and inhibitory populations (Dale's principle) leads to a catastrophic loss of connections beyond user control, compromising its reproducibility and comparability. We explain the reasons behind this connectivity pruning and study its impact through a reproduction of a recent simulation study about activity-silent working memory based on Song et al. (2016)'s framework. We show that ReLU leads to a loss of up to 95% of connections, makes connectivity patterns dependent on the task and biological features of the model, impairs training and modifies neural dynamics in unpredictable ways. Moreover, we show it makes training substantially less efficient and prone to performance issues. As an alternative, we found that Absolute Value function to rectify weights is notably more efficient and avoids connectivity pruning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Family history is a well-established transdiagnostic risk factor for psychiatric disorders, while perceived social support is a protective factor. However, it remains unclear whether social support reduces the associated risk conferred by family history across a range of psychiatric conditions within a single, large cohort.\n\nMethods: We used data from the NIH All of Us Research Program (N=276,261; age M=56.97, SD=16.97; 61.4% female). Logistic regression analyses examined associations between family history of five disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, schizophrenia), perceived social support, and electronic health record-based diagnoses (outcome variables). Models tested main and interaction effects, controlling for demographics.\n\nResults: Family history of a matched disorder was the strongest predictor for each diagnosis (ORs from 1.63 95% CI [1.59, 1.67] for depression to 3.53 95% CI [3.00, 4.13] for PTSD); significant cross-disorder effects supported a transdiagnostic model. Higher social support was associated with lower risk across all disorders (ORs from 0.942 95% CI [0.932, 0.953] for bipolar to 0.986 95% CI [0.980, 0.991] for anxiety). A statistically significant interaction between family history and social support was found for depression (OR=0.981 95% CI [0.965, 0.997]) and anxiety (OR=0.979 95% CI [0.960, 0.999]), where higher social support exhibited a higher estimated effect in those with family history.\n\nConclusions: While family history and low social support are cross-disorder risk factors, the moderating effect of social support on familial risk appears to be specific to depression and anxiety. Clinical assessments should incorporate family history, and interventions bolstering social support should be tested for their potential to reduce the risk of depression and anxiety in those with high familial risk.",

Our results highlight substantial differences in data collection, preprocessing, and analytic steps that are largely not explained by sample age, publication year, or resting paradigm.

Previous gaze-tracking research suggests body dissatisfaction is related to greater attentional bias towards lower-weight bodies. Here, we aimed to partially replicate and extend previous work to verify this association by using realistic body stimuli and a validated scale of body dissatisfaction. Sixty, mostly young, women from the general population underwent eye-tracking whilst viewing picture pairs of women’s bodies morphed to be lower- and higher-weight. Attentional bias was measured as percentage fixation duration, fixation count and first fixations on lower-weight compared to higher-weight bodies. There was weak evidence that all women fixated for longer on lower-weight bodies and that participants with higher body dissatisfaction spent less time fixating on lower-weight bodies, contrary to our hypotheses and to previous findings, but this effect was not robust to adjustment for age and BMI. This lack of replication suggests this association is not robust in non-clinical populations. Instead, an overall bias towards lower-weight bodies could contribute to higher levels of body dissatisfaction and risk of mental health problems in younger women. Future studies measuring attentional biases in realistic settings and in clinical populations with eating disorder symptoms are needed.",

We found prevalent under-reporting and wide-spread modifications of procedural details. We identified 244 distinct scores used to quantify IGT outcomes, 177 of which appeared only once in our sample. To quantify the potential impact of this flexibility, we performed a multiverse analysis using 205 scores on an open IGT dataset. Correlations among these ranged from rs = -0.942 to 0.998 with a median r = 0.022, suggesting that different scoring strategies can produce extremely different study outcomes. Given these findings, without substantive information about which specific procedural and scoring choices were employed, results from the IGT are rendered uninterpretable.

This has led to tensions in the literature, variations of interpretation of extremism, and synonymously treated terminology. This raises the question of whether research, interventions and policy are truly examining and targeting extremism. To address the lacuna in literature and policy, an investigation of a definition of extremism representative of the variety of cultures is needed. A systematic search was undertaken to identify the definitions of extremism used in policy for each country in the United Nations. As definitions or descriptions were found, overarching categories were coded. The top 12 categories, out of the 24 found, were utilised to form an overarching definition of extremism. The categories found were then grouped by the researcher, into a behavioural component, a logistical component or a motivational component of the definitions of extremism. A cluster analysis was then undertaken on the three components, resulting in six clusters labelled for the behavioural component, two for the motivational, and five for the logistical. This resulted in a secondary consideration of cultural differences amongst countries interpretations of extremism. This review of policy definitions takes the first step into understanding extremism on an international level through the creation of a representative definition, whilst still accounting for cultural variations. \n\nKeywords: extremism, United Nations, definition, culture, review.",

However, these methods are not always feasible to use and have their own share of problems. In the current study, we systematically investigated how the choice of response scale for subjective reports affects the validity and reliability of participants’ responses. We designed a computer task in which we manipulated the degree of objective control that participants had across trials. Participants reported their experienced sense of control after each trial. Across five experiments, we compared responses on five scales: a linear visual analogue scale (VAS), a percentage VAS, a 7-point Likert, a 4-point Likert, and a binary scale. In two additional experiments, we compared the directionality of the linear scale. The results were remarkably similar for all except the binary scale: participants demonstrated the tendency to underestimate their level of control, especially for intermediate levels of objective control, and the between-block reliability of responses indicated a very high level of reliability. In addition, we propose that our task can be used as a measure of individual differences and developed metrics that can be extracted from participants’ responses. Our findings demonstrate that contrary to the dominant opinion, explicit reports are characterized by high reliability, and we provide practical recommendations for the choice of a scale for measuring sense of control.",

We find no impact on our primary preregistered outcome (an aggregated index of mid-to-high-frequency brain activity) or our secondary preregistered outcome frontal gamma power. In additional analyses that were part of our pre-registered analytic plan, we find that preschoolers in the high-cash gift group have higher alpha power than those in the low-cash gift group, but no differences in theta, beta, or gamma power.

          "abstract": "Psychologists are often asked to inform concrete actions (\"Should we ban social media?\") but tend to focus on vague questions (\"Does ‘time spent on social media’ predict well-being?\"). There is a mismatch between the causal effects researchers care about and the associations and correlations they compute. In this article, we highlight the consistency assumption as a foundational requirement for causal inference that can bridge this mismatch and make statistical estimations causally interpretable. Consistency shows how causal effects are interpretable only when (a) the causal effect of interest—the causal estimand—is described precisely enough that it does not bundle different versions of the treatment that have different effects, and (b) the way that the treatment variable changes in the data matches this effect of interest. We clarify these requirements and illustrate how to state and assess them in settings common in psychological research, with a focus on indirect experimental manipulations and multidimensional constructs. Making this step explicit helps researchers articulate their estimands more transparently and is a prerequisite for other concerns such as confounding and model specification.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive science has historically evolved by incorporating new disciplines in response to advances in science and technology. We argue that the growing emphasis on naturalistic perception and cognition marks another such interdisciplinary moment, particularly in the auditory domain. Cognitive neuroscience and audio engineering share a common object of inquiry—sound—and a common receiver—the human auditory system—yet they have largely evolved in isolation. This separation now constrains progress in both fields. Auditory neuroscience often relies on simplified stimuli that weaken spatial and scene-level cues central to real-world hearing, while audio engineering frequently depends on industry conventions that lack grounding in neural and cognitive evidence. Building on classic work in auditory scene analysis, contemporary models of spatial hearing, and the broader rise of naturalistic paradigms in neuroscience, we propose that bridging these disciplines is not merely a technical improvement but a methodological and epistemological imperative. We introduce the sonic loop: a bidirectional framework in which spatial audio approaches, as implemented in contemporary immersive audio formats, enable technically rigorous yet ecologically valid neuroscience, while neural and behavioral data provide principled constraints for perceptually optimized audio engineering.",

          "abstract": "In the presence of pain, performance during imposed workload motor tasks may be maintained at the cost of a higher perceived effort (PE). This study investigated how experimentally induced thermal pain and naturally occurring muscle pain influence force production during a fixed PE task. Forty young adults performed intermittent isometric handgrip contractions at light (13/100) or hard (50/100) PE intensities across two visits. Each visit included an experimental condition, featuring thermal pain in block 1, and a control condition, with non-painful warm stimulation in block 2. Participants completed 10 blocks (five repetitions of block 1 and block 2), with force production and muscle electromyography continuously recorded. Participants rated thermal and muscle pain after each block. Force production was higher during thermal pain compared to control, with no interaction with PE intensity. Regression analysis showed that each one-unit increase in muscle pain (0–100 scale) corresponded to a reduction in peak force (0.37N), mean force (0.25N), and force integral (0.80N·s). During a fixed perceived effort task, thermal pain prompts an increase in force production, possibly reflecting attentional mechanisms related to exercise-induced hypoalgesia. In contrast, muscle pain is associated with reduced force output, likely because more force would perpetuate more muscle pain. Therefore, the type of pain has a varied effect on force production during voluntary motor tasks. This study questions the well-accepted inhibitory effect of pain on force production and encourages future research to use fixed PE tasks to fully appraise the effects of different type of pain on force production.",

          "abstract": "Background: The number of children and adolescents worldwide who experience complex trauma is increasing, while early interventions in this age group are largely absent. Past research has demonstrated that Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) group treatments are effective in treating acute trauma in children. However, evidence for children suffering from complex trauma is lacking so far.\nObjective: The objective of our approach is to address this gap by providing a novel specialized EMDR protocol for group treatments of children and adolescents (maximum age range: 7–17 years) who have experienced complex trauma. A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in the remote areas of Kisumu, Kenya, to evaluate the EMDR Trauma Management Protocol (EMDR-TMP).\nMethods: The efficacy of EMDR-TMP was evaluated through a randomized treatment versus waiting-control group design in Kenya, based on 103 children (11–14 years) suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants were randomly assigned to either a treatment-first group or a waiting-control group. PTSD symptom severity was assessed using the Children and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS). Additional questionnaires were employed to assess depressive symptoms, anxiety, and behavioral problems.\nResults: After EMDR-TMP treatments, Subjective Unit of Distress (SUD) scores showed a marked reduction, approaching a score of almost zero after therapy. In the CATS, both the differences between pre- and post-tests and the comparison of treatment-first and waiting-control group demonstrated a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms to a non-clinical value after EMDR-TMP therapy. Behavioral symptoms were reduced significantly after two months follow-up.\nConclusion: Results indicate that EMDR-TMP can reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms and associated behavioral issues in children and adolescents to a nonclinical value. As this method provides for an individualized treatment of complex trauma in small group settings, it is an efficient means whenever there are many children in urgent need of treatment.",

          "abstract": "The evidential link between Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a matter of on-going debate. Foody et al. (2013) is frequently cited as evidence for ACT’s concept of Self-as-Context and as evidence for the ties between ACT’s middle level clinical terms and the more basic account of language and cognition provided by RFT. However, the failed replication study by Foody et al. (2015) typically goes uncited. Given their importance, I critically re-evaluate the results of both articles. I found several issues, the most important of which was that the central claim does not correspond with the reported analyses. When I extracted summary statistics from both studies and used them to conducte a multiverse analysis, that mapped directly onto the original claim (i.e., that the hierarchy condition reduced distress more than the distinction condition), null results were found under every set of conditions. Taken together, results illustrate how weak or flawed research practices and uncritical citation of results can hinder cumulative science and evidence based clinical practice.",

          "authors": "Philipp Sterner; Eunsook Kim; David Goretzko",
          "abstract": "Psychology is increasingly interested in the prediction of constructs via machine learning (ML) models, for example, predicting a person’s personality or intelligence. To measure these constructs, psychologists often draw on questionnaires. In supervised ML, these measurements are then used as target variables (i.e., the “ground truth”) for model training. It is currently paid only little attention to psychometric issues and biases that might be carried over from measurements in the training data to the final model used for predictions. One potential bias is a lack of measurement invariance (MI) of the questionnaire data across groups that are used as target values for supervised learning. If non-invariant measrurements are used for model training, this might bias the predictions of the final ML model. Specifically, people from two different groups with the same true score on a construct might receive different predicted scores by the model. In this article, we assess the impact of a lack of MI in target variables on ML predictive performance and investigate approaches to counter this impact. We address this question by a comprehensive simulation study in which we derive target values from (a) single-group models (i.e., ignoring non-invariance) and (b) alignment optimization (i.e., handling non-invariance). Results show that single-group factor scores make ML models reproduce measurement bias in their predictions. Aligned factor scores can improve prediction performance if measurements are non-invariant, but only if certain conditions are met. We discuss implications for psychological applications of ML as well as directions for future research.",

We propose that support for redistribution may not only depend on the magnitude of inequality but also on how inequality is experienced in everyday life. Across three studies (N = 1,111), we examined whether different types of inequality help revise this paradox. In Study 1, participants described salient experiences of inequality. Content analysis revealed two distinct inequality types—Structural and Lifestyle—associated with different emotional responses. In Study 2, new participants rated these experiences, judging Structural Inequality as more unequal and unfair than Lifestyle Inequality. In Study 3, experimentally manipulating inequality type showed that Structural more than Lifestyle Inequality triggered support for redistribution through anger and perceived unfairness. These findings demonstrate that everyday experiences of inequality carry distinct emotional and political consequences, clarifying when inequality motivates support for redistribution, and when it does not.",

          "authors": "Niki Pennanen; Robin Welsch; Christian Guckelsberger",
          "abstract": "Generative AI tools for image creation are now mainstream, yet we know little about when and why observers judge them as “creative”. Previous human-robot interaction research suggests that revealing the creation process can raise perceived machine creativity and points that observer differences may moderate this effect. We take these observations from physical robots to the bigger domain of virtual text-to-image diffusion systems by manipulating perceptual evidence (PE), i.e., interface-visible cues about the generation process. We report two preregistered online experiments looking into PE and observer individual differences. Study 1 (N=298) used a within-subjects manipulation comparing Product (final image only) to Product+Process (adding a short animation of the denoising process). Study 2 (N=295) added a between-subjects tutorial (diffusion vs. control) in a 2x2 mixed design. The tutorial briefly explained how diffusion models generate images, intended to raise system-specific literacy. Contrary to previous work, confirmatory analyses found no average effect of showing Process on creativity, and no tutorial effect. Exploratory analyses revealed that general AI literacy moderated the PE contrast, i.e., at lower literacy, observing process tended to lower creativity ratings; at higher literacy, it tended to raise them. Moreover, attitudes toward AI and art interest were positively associated with creativity ratings. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses indicated potential reasons for the lack of overall PE effect. Taken together, these converging quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that individual differences systematically shape creativity judgments of text-to-image GenAI and, in our setting, exert stronger and more reliable influence than PE alone. For design, this implies that process visualizations could help some audiences more than others. Interfaces that adapt to literacy and attitudes, or that pair process views with contextual explanation calibrated to user background, could be more likely to shift judgments than one-size-fits-all depictions of generation.",

          "abstract": "People systematically deviate from rational Bayesian standards in belief updating, displaying biases such as base-rate neglect and conservatism. Two very different types of model aim to explain these biases: simple heuristics and stochastic sampling approximations of the Bayesian solution, like the Bayesian Sampler. However, neither approach alone accounts for the variety of responses. Here we explore a hybrid Heuristic-Anchored Bayesian Sampler (HABS) which integrates simple heuristics with a Bayesian sampler. In this framework, a simple heuristic provides an initial estimate, which may then be refined through a Bayesian sampling process to approximate the ideal Bayesian posterior. Behaviour thus depends on the size of the sample: if no samples are drawn, a heuristic response is produced, but adding samples will introduce noise while increasing average  judgment accuracy. Analyses of data from a new experiment (N=200) and re-analysis of data from Stengård et al., 2022  revealed that, in most conditions, this integrative approach outperformed purely heuristic or purely Bayesian models in explaining how people update their beliefs in the medical diagnosis task. Our findings suggest that people flexibly combine mental shortcuts and approximate Bayesian processes, illuminating why some responses appear purely heuristic while others reflect approximate Bayesian updating.",

Across four samples spanning the ages of 4 to 80 (total N = 1,842), we measure people’s moral exclusiveness toward human outgroups and non-human animals in both attitudes and related behaviour. Replicating existing findings, we demonstrate that adult men are more morally exclusive than women in both attitude and behaviour. Crucially, we identify adolescence (13–18 years) as the key window for development: older male adolescents are more morally exclusive than younger male adolescents, while there is no such difference for female adolescents. Linked to this is an increase in social dominance orientation with age in males. We further find the onset of gendered moral exclusiveness: while males are already more morally exclusive than females at the age of 6 and such gender differences persist throughout childhood and in adulthood, they are not yet evident in younger children.",

This study aimed to understand the extent to which pre-conception maternal perceptions of pain are associated with future parental perception of their infant’s response to injury.\nMethods. Participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) self-reported pre-conception maternal perceptions of pain at age 18.  When they became parents, they reported their infant’s responsivity to injury (N=84) and uncomfortable procedures (dirty nappy, N=73) at 6 months old. Logistic regression examined the association between pre-conception perceptions of pain and infant responsivity to injury and uncomfortable procedures, controlling for maternal pre-conception anxiety.\nResults. Analysis indicated an almost four-fold increase in parental perception of infant reactivity to injury where parents held perceptions of pain as harmful at age 18 (OR = 5.95, p = .001). There was no evidence that parental perceptions of pain at age 18 influenced the likelihood of reporting their infant could be calmed if fussing about a dirty nappy (OR = 1.34, p = .686). \nConclusions. This study indicates that pain schemas in young adults may pose a risk of parental reinforcement of, and attention to, pain, and greater perceived infant responsivity to pain.

          "abstract": "The congruency effect, characterized by faster and more accurate performance in congruent compared to incongruent trials, has been consistently observed in various conflict tasks. However, the search for common underlying attentional control processes reveals significant differences between conflict tasks, as evident from different time courses of the congruency effect (i.e., delta functions) and a lack of correlations in performance across different conflict tasks. To address these issues, the Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks (DMC) has been employed to explicitly model congruency effects and explain different delta function shapes. However, estimating the parameters of the DMC using standard iterative methods faces computational challenges. In this study, we leverage Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) with deep learning to address these limitations. We use different prior distributions, levels of model complexity, and automated hyperparameter optimization within a principled workflow. ABI produces well-calibrated posteriors across a wide range of trial counts, estimating individual-level parameters as accurately as iterative methods, while requiring only a fraction of their runtime once the initial training phase is complete. Additionally, we selectively manipulated irrelevant information strength in a flanker task to assess the sensitivity of DMC parameters to experimental effects. As expected, the amplitude of the automatic process was influenced by stimulus spacing in a flanker paradigm. However, the effect on the peak latency parameter depended on the choice of model parameterization and prior hyperparameters. Taken together, we demonstrate the viability of ABI as a scalable, accurate alternative to conventional estimation techniques and provide a reproducible workflow for future cognitive modeling studies.",

At the scale level, the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity were assessed. Results: The measure demonstrated reasonable item sensitivity, non-redundance, construct validity, and convergent validity at the item level. At the scale level, the measure demonstrated a bifactor factor structure that was invariant at the metric level across the Czech, Slovak, and English versions. The total scale and the subscales demonstrated reasonable reliability and convergent validity. Conclusions: The Czech and Slovak versions of the SRS-3-B are valid process measures.

          "abstract": "This article examines how collective memories of historical victimization and present-day immigration threat perceptions are associated with public support for restrictive immigration policies. Focusing on Greece, a country scarred by legacies of war, forced displacement, and longstanding geopolitical rivalry with Turkey, we develop an interdisciplinary framework that integrates Securitization Theory with psychological research on collective victimhood and historical moral lessons. Drawing on original, representative survey data and OLS regression analysis, we show that while both present-day immigration threat perceptions and Perpetual Ingroup Victimhood Orientation (PIVO) are significantly associated with support for restrictive immigration policies, PIVO – the belief that one's group is perpetually a victim – emerges as the strongest statistical predictor. These findings challenge presentist biases in (de)securitization research, uncovering the relevance of symbolic structures and historical consciousness in how audiences evaluate security claims. In Greece, public support for restrictive policies is conditioned by a broader macrosecuritizing logic rooted in national trauma and civilizational struggle, where moral lessons of reciprocity and humanitarian obligation coexist with defensive scripts linked to historical grievance. This article advances a history-sensitive approach to (de)securitization research and highlights the role of psycho-cultural dispositions in the durability of migration securitization in contexts marked by unresolved historical tensions.",

Critically, we observe a selective interaction between retrieval practice and enactment in the handshape dimension: testing improved handshape accuracy only when learners physically enacted the signs, suggesting that motorically complex articulators require the combined support of retrieval-based reinforcement and procedural motor rehearsal. In contrast, dimensions with lower motoric complexity (e.g., location, movement, orientation) showed additive or independent contributions of retrieval and enactment. Together, these findings show that retrieval practice extends to visual–manual language learning, but its effectiveness varies by phonological complexity and motor demands. The results highlight the importance of considering embodied processes in theories of retrieval-based learning and offer practical implications for optimizing sign language pedagogy.",

This model succeeded despite having only a perceptual embedding space of stimuli. However, looking may be influenced by non-perceptual considerations. Using the same data, we found that adults’ behaviors challenge a key assumption of a perceptual-only account: since the perceptual distance between two items is symmetrical, behavior guided only by perceptual space should also be symmetrical. Yet, adults did not treat changes in different directions as mere reciprocal transformations. For instance, adults looked longer at magical appearance than disappearance. We suggest that image-computable models of looking behavior would benefit from representations of objects, in addition to perceptual features of images.",

In this study, 196 children aged 2–5 years, with and without ADHD risk, completed a Minion go/no-go task while fNIRS measured bilateral frontal–temporal and parietal activity. Subject- and group-level analyses revealed that at-risk children showed stronger recruitment of bilateral frontal cortex and greater frontal–parietal integration than typically developing peers, suggesting increased reliance on these networks for inhibitory control. These findings underscore the importance of early identification of neural markers of cognitive control difficulties and support the use of go/no-go paradigms in early neurocognitive screening. Replication with multimodal methods and increased task difficulty for older toddlers is needed, as neural activation was low across groups during both high- and low-frequency trials.",

          "abstract": "Conflict adaptation refers to the adjustment of cognitive control to reduce interference on subsequent trials. Its neural mechanisms are often studied by assessing the congruence sequence effect (CSE) in face–word Stroop tasks during neuroimaging. The present study aimed to address two key methodological issues when using standard response conflict tasks in fMRI settings: Ensuring the involvement of cognitive control in the CSE and demonstrating its temporal stability across varying inter-trial intervals. In a set of five experiments, using an adapted version of the face–word Stroop task, participants performed either a gender categorization (Experiment 3) or responded to the learned identity of four faces while ignoring the printed name (all other experiments). We specifically incorporated recent advancements in confound minimization to exclude effects of feature integration and contingency learning, included a priming component to further increase the involvement of cognitive control, and used a variable range of inter-trial intervals to test for potential applicability in fMRI research. Although a robust Stroop effect was consistently observed in all experiments, a strong CSE emerged specifically in the gender categorization task. In the confound-minimized face–word Stroop variant, a significant CSE occurred only under specific conditions (e.g., sufficiently long target presentation, bi-manual responses) and was accompanied by substantial inter-individual variability. Therefore, while we observed a reliable CSE in a confound-minimized face–word Stroop task with long inter-trial intervals, the increased methodological rigor that improves precision and interpretability also adds complexity and yields smaller and more variable effects. This trade-off constitutes an important consideration for future fMRI adaptations of the Stroop task seeking to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the CSE.",

Across two studies (N = 220 and N = 388; university students), Brier Skill Scores showed that decisions were best explained by a model that treated positive valence as uniform across emotions (Study 1), and logistic regression showed that positive valence outperformed emotion-specific preferences in accounting for choice behaviour (Study 2).

          "abstract": "Efficient use of visual working memory (VWM) is essential for storing and manipulating information to optimize moment-by-moment visual cognition under a capacity constraint. Yet, how such efficiency is achieved remains a vexing problem. For instance, when observers leverage perceptual organization to group multiple identical objects to retain more visual content, they can do so by grouping items proportional to the redundancy in perceptual inputs or by leveraging a separation-based strategy to maximize identical visual inputs from those that contain at least some discrepancy. Conventional evidence based on behavioral output or univariate event-related potentials (ERPs) could not distinguish these possibilities, motivating the current study to use a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) approach based on a published dataset to address this issue. In a VWM change detection task with scalp EEG recording, participants tried to remember visual arrays containing all-same, partial-different, or all-different orientation bars. Time-resolved decoding revealed early neural differentiation, around 200 ms after stimulus onset, between the all-same condition and the other conditions, suggesting that perceptual grouping benefits emerge early and exhibit a separation-based pattern. Cross-condition decoding further confirmed that visual arrays containing partially-different arrays were represented more similarly to the all-different arrays than to the all-same ones. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual grouping in visual working memory operates through a separation-based neural differentiation, in which full perceptual redundancy enables early compression into compact neural codes while partial perceptual redundancy preserves separable representations to reduce interference.",

          "authors": "Isabelle Ruedisueli; Carla Marienfeld; Casey Tiefenthaler; Allison Lee; Alicia Harvey-Vera; Steffanie A Strathdee; Joseph Friedman",
          "abstract": "The prevalence and health consequences of methamphetamine use disorder have risen across the United States, including methamphetamine-induced psychosis (MIP). A promising, novel approach to address MIP is the use of ‘chill packs’, a psychiatric harm reduction intervention for people using methamphetamine. Chill packs consist of several low-dose olanzapine tablets (an antipsychotic medication) that can be self-administered in the event of methamphetamine-induced insomnia, anxiety, paranoia, delusions, or other dysphoric symptoms. One recent study assessed the effectiveness of an implementation of chill packs by the San Francisco Department of Health and found that repeat psychiatric emergency visits dropped by 32% after two-months and 13% after six-months. While these findings are promising, more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and generalizability of this intervention. Here we provide a narrative review of indirect evidence and contextual information for related dynamics, including: the epidemiology of MIP, clinical data supporting the use of olanzapine versus other antipsychotics for MIP, evidence supporting as-needed use of antipsychotics in the outpatient setting, as well as ethnographic and other data describing the potential for misuse of olanzapine and other antipsychotics. Overall, the literature supports that the prevalence of MIP is rising sharply, causing increased psychiatric burden. This is also linked to overdose risk among patients that use illicit fentanyl or other sedatives to “come down” after periods of heavy methamphetamine use. Olanzapine has demonstrated comparable efficacy for treating MIP to other antipsychotics with enhanced short-term sedative effects, despite a higher burden of long-term metabolic side effects. Olanzapine has very little documented misuse risk, although other agents in its class, especially quetiapine, have higher street value. Qualitative research highlights that some groups already self-administer olanzapine as a ‘trip killer’ to manage distressing psychiatric side effects from illicit drug use.  Overall, we find substantial indirect contextual evidence supporting further trials to evaluate chill packs as a harm-reduction intervention for MIP, and provide recommendations for research needed to fill gaps in the literature for this promising, albeit new and little-studied intervention.",

          "abstract": "Imagining experiences that might occur in our personal future, i.e., future thinking, is a fundamental ability in healthy psychological functioning. Research over the last few decades indicates that a range of different psychopathologies are related to impairments and biases in future thinking. This includes changes in the content, valence, phenomenological characteristics, and the affective responses that arise from this process. This paper provides a narrative review of current evidence of dysfunction in future thinking in psychopathology, and interventions that focus on future thinking among people experiencing psychopathology. Lastly, it provides a range of suggestions for future research to further our understanding of when and how future thinking dysfunction occurs, how it perpetuates psychopathology, and how we can leverage future thinking to improve people’s mental health.",

          "abstract": "Information seeking has long been a behavior of interest to communication researchers and theorists. Most work on information seeking relies on self-reports that may not correspond to behavioral observations. In this paper, we examine the theoretical and methodological assumptions underlying information seeking research in communication. To explore these assumptions empirically, we compare linked self-report and digital trace data on health information seeking (HIS) over two weeks in a sample of U.S. adults (N=999). Top-level estimates of HIS were similar (39% self-report; 34% digital trace), but there was minimal overlap in those estimates. Measurement correspondence increased for high-volume seekers (≥20 searches). The present study offers an initial attempt at connecting self-reported information seeking with digital trace behavioral observations. Identifying ways to optimize the correspondence between information seeking theory and measurement, while recognizing the unique affordances and limitations of different communication traditions in such studies, should be a priority moving forward.",

          "abstract": "Secrets are on people’s minds more than they are held back in conversation. Research suggests that such mind-wandering to secrets can be problematic for well-being, yet the mechanisms behind this link are still unclear. To better understand what may underlie the harm of mind-wandering to secrets, we conducted two studies. First, in a 14-day daily diary study (Study 1, N = 240) we investigated what people think about when mind-wandering to their secrets, and how these thoughts come to mind in daily life—spontaneously or deliberately. Second, in a 7-day experience-sampling study (Study 2, N = 207) we probed the directionality of relationships between the two types of mind-wandering and affective experiences about secrets. Across studies, when secrets came to mind spontaneously, but not deliberately, people reported feeling greater negative emotion both in the moment (Study 1 and 2) and approximately 2 hours later (Study 2). Our findings point to spontaneous mind-wandering to secrets as a primary player in the well-being costs of secrecy. Further, we offer the first investigation into spontaneous and deliberate mind-wandering to the same target thought in daily life, capturing the temporal dynamics between mind-wandering and emotional well-being. By yielding insights into the way secrets weigh on people’s minds, this research suggests possible ways to manage the well-being costs of secrets, and perhaps other ongoing concerns, in everyday life.",

Research often relies on broad categories of use, such as screen time, or on isolated platform features, leaving the functions of behaviour underspecified. Here we introduce Digital Behaviourism, a functional approach grounded in operant conditioning that explains digital behaviour through the contingencies linking antecedents, behaviours, and consequences. Rather than classifying behaviour by its form (e.g., scrolling, posting), Digital Behaviourism identifies four functions: exploration, social esteem, entertainment, and escape, that describe the reinforcement processes maintaining behaviour in context. By shifting attention from the form of behaviour to its function, Digital Behaviourism can enable more precise analysis, generate testable hypotheses, and inform effective, contextually sensitive intervention. We argue that behaviourist tradition already possesses the conceptual tools to understand digital life and offer an approach for applying them to the engineered environments where behaviour increasingly unfolds.",

This paper argues that rather than converging on a shared answer, society is likely to enter a period of confusion, uncertainty, and deep disagreement. Drawing on recent empirical evidence, I show that both experts and the public are already divided on the possibility of AI consciousness and the moral status of digital minds. I argue that this division is driven by structural features of the issue, including the difficulty of conceptualizing and measuring consciousness, conflicting economic, political, and emotional incentives, and a disconnect between AI systems’ internal architectures and their outwardly human-like behavior. Such disagreement creates risks of political polarization, regulatory instability, geopolitical tension, and an increased risk of ultimately misattributing moral status. I conclude by outlining strategies for improving expert coordination, fostering constructive public discourse, designing AI systems to reduce moral confusion, and reducing exclusive reliance on consciousness in moral and policy decisions.",

          "authors": "Amy Louise Atkinson; Rebecca K. Maguire; Jennifer Thompson; John Nicholas Towse",
          "abstract": "Research with adults has led to the proposal of a gating mechanism between long-term memory and working memory, with information from long-term memory entering working memory only when it is beneficial. Across three experiments, we examine functioning of the gating mechanism in children using a novel cross-modal working memory task. In Experiment 1, 7-11 year-old children and adults were presented with four images of animals paired with auditorily presented sounds. Image-sound combinations were congruent with existing knowledge (e.g. cow-moo), incongruent (e.g. cow-baa) or involved neutral pseudowords (e.g. cow-jad). After a short delay, participants were presented with a sound and asked to report the paired image. Replicating previous research, adults showed superior accuracy for congruent pairings, with evidence of no difference between neutral and incongruent pairings. Children’s performance was qualitatively distinct, exhibiting both a congruency boost (congruent &gt; neutral) and an incongruency cost (neutral &gt; incongruent). Effects were replicated in children when set size was varied (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 then increased the interstimulus interval to account for children’s slower processing speed. Here, a congruency boost was consistently observed, with some evidence that an incongruency cost emerged at the lower set size. Taken together, these findings provide clear evidence that long-term memory benefits working memory performance in children. Crucially, however, children appear more sensitive to incongruent information from long-term memory relative to adults. We argue, therefore, that any gating mechanism is not fully developed in 7-11 year old children.",

          "abstract": "Do you believe the world will come to an end within your lifetime, and does that belief change the way you see existential threats to humanity? One-third of Americans answer yes to the first question; we venture to answer the second question here. Stories about the end of the world are historically and globally prevalent and come in many flavours. End of world beliefs have been hypothesized to shape processes of risk perception and social behaviour that have implications for how societies respond to existential threats. Despite their cultural significance, current understanding of the psychology of these beliefs is lacking. In this article, we present the results of six pilot studies (N = 2,079) and one pre-registered study (N = 1,409) that establish a psychological framework for end of world beliefs. A measure of end of world beliefs was created and validated across six religious populations (Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and nonreligious). We find that end of world beliefs are common, vary along psychologically meaningful dimensions, and are uniquely predictive of people’s risk perception, risk tolerance, and willingness to support extreme action to address the five most pressing global existential risks (i.e., economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal, and technological). Results are interpreted in light of current models of risk perception and the cultural evolution of worldviews. Aligning with sociological and historical analyses, we argue that belief in apocalyptic narratives—irrespective of their accuracy—is consequential for how populations confront concrete risks, including those that threaten humanity today.",

          "abstract": "The motivation intensity theory suggests that the perception of effort (PE) reflects the self-monitoring of resources and is used to self-regulate goal-directed actions. These processes are typically studied separately in the motor or cognitive domain. Here, we tested the effect of cognitive demand on PE in two psychomotor tasks (experiment 1) and we examined the effect of prescribing a target level of PE intensity on performance (experiment 2).\nIn experiment 1 (n=20), we used fixed tempo during two upper-limb psychomotor tasks (Box and Block test and pointing task) with PE as dependent variable. In experiment 2 (n=20), we used fixed PE during a self-paced pointing task with PE as independent variable. In both experiments, heart rate, respiratory rate and electromyographic signal of biceps and triceps brachii were monitored. Cognitive demand was manipulated (low, moderate, high) via a Stroop task, determining which block to move or target to reach.\nResults showed that in experiment 1, PE increased with increased cognitive demand to maintain performance in both tasks. In experiment 2, higher cognitive demand during self-paced pointing at fixed PE led to decreased performance. Heart rate proved most sensitive to cognitive demand changes among physiological variables but failed to reflect the increase in cognitive demand from low to moderate in experiment 1.\nThese results confirm the possibility of using the PE to prescribe and monitor the intensity of a psychomotor task. This study opens perspectives to investigate the unicity of effort and challenge the assumed duality of cognitive vs motor effort.",

          "abstract": "The encoding of locations in world coordinates is often called spatiotopy; it captures how we experience the layout of things around us. The visual system, on the other hand, appears to rely on retinotopic representations. The search for some critical area of the brain that recovers locations in world coordinates from the sequence of fixations as a spatiotopic map, has not met with much success. Here we review earlier suggestions that replace spatiotopic maps with the tracking or remapping of a small number of attended targets to keep their positions updated on retinotopic maps (e.g., Wurtz, 2018; Golomb &amp; Mazer, 2021). This remapping process achieves a simulation of spatiotopy – the target locations are updated and motion responses to the shift of the retinal image are suppressed and discounted. Importantly, we propose that each attended target’s identity is connected to the locations of its features in early visual cortex through a steerable autoencoder network that shifts the feature activity to the target’s new location with each saccade, explaining the many reports of trans-saccadic integration. This autoencoder process is not limited to the remapping function but is part of the overall architecture of the visual system, acting to link target properties together, even as the target or the eyes move.",

Initial analyses of NIMH-required instruments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, DSM-V Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure) revealed unexpectedly low distress scores, contrasting with qualitative narratives describing significant suffering. Through integrated analysis, we identified discrepancies between symptom endorsement and lived experiences, highlighting cultural and contextual factors influencing distress expression. Guided by transdiagnostic frameworks, we developed the Integrated Distress Score (IDS) by combining items from depression, anxiety, stress, and coping measures. \nResults: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a second-order model with strong fit indices (RMSEA = 0.046; CFI = 0.981; TLI = 0.979). External validity was demonstrated through associations with discrimination, social support, and economic insecurity. IDS scores differentiated subgroups qualitatively categorized as “Hidden Stressed and Distressed” versus “Stressed but not Distressed,” capturing heterogeneity in distress and resilience. \nConclusions: Findings underscore the insufficiency of universal symptom-based tools for newcomer populations and advocate for culturally responsive, transdiagnostic approaches that integrate qualitative insights. This work contributes a pragmatic measure for evaluating intervention outcomes and offers conceptual implications for moving beyond categorical diagnoses toward dimensional, context-sensitive models of mental health. Future research should refine and validate IDS across diverse newcomer groups and sociocultural settings.",

          "abstract": "Effort influences decisions to initiate and sustain physical and cognitive tasks. Although the perception of effort is central to human behaviour, its underlying mechanisms—especially in the cognitive domain—remain poorly understood. Building on knowledge from physical exertion, this article introduces the concepts of effort and effort perception through a multidisciplinary lens, integrating insights from exercise sciences, (neuro)physiology, and psychology.\nWe begin by highlighting the inconsistent definitions of effort in the literature and propose a transdisciplinary definition: the intentional engagement of physical and cognitive resources to perform—or attempt to perform—a task. We then review methods for measuring effort, emphasizing the current limitations of physiological and performance-based variables. We argue that, when adequately contextualized as a unique perception dissociated from other exercise-related perceptions, the self-report of effort currently provides the most viable way to investigate effort.\nNext, we explore theoretical models explaining effort perception in physical tasks, focusing on the corollary discharge model as a promising theoretical framework. While this model offers valuable insights, it does not fully account for exerting effort during cognitive tasks. We suggest refining the corollary discharge model to encompass cognitive exertion, thus breaking the traditional silos between the physical and cognitive domains.\nFinally, we outline key challenges for future research: defining “resources” more clearly, developing reliable measurement tools for effort and its (neuro)physiological correlates, and determining whether effort perception is domain-general or domain-specific. We end by discussing the broad implications of our new account of effort for performance, health, and behavioural science.",

While humans infer mental states and traits from specific facial regions and their expressions, such idiosyncratic gaze patterns may shape how individual features contribute to the overall impression of a face. We hypothesized that an individual’s habitual fixation behavior biases their impression of a face to be aligned more closely with the region they most often foveate. To test this idea, we analyzed fixation patterns on faces in a scene viewing task and independent perceptual judgments regarding valence, arousal, trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness for whole faces and face parts. A linear mixed-effects model confirmed that habitual fixation proximity to eyes, nose, and mouth explained individual differences in how well ratings for whole faces were aligned with those for the corresponding isolated feature. Building on this finding, we ran a second experiment to test whether individual differences in face fixations can predict diverging impressions of trustworthiness in appropriately manipulated images. Observers reported which of two consecutively presented versions of a subtly manipulated face they perceived to be more trustworthy. Consistent with our hypothesis, individuals who tend to fixate lower down or higher up were biased to prefer versions of the face with a more trustworthy bottom or top, respectively. Together, our findings indicate that individual differences in gaze systematically shape and explain our sometimes diverging impression of a face.",

          "abstract": "The formation of a subjective sense of confidence often requires the integration of signals from multiple sources of evidence. This is of particular relevance when one needs to determine with a high degree of certainty whether a multisensory stimulus is present or absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this ability to map evidence strength from multiple modalities into a single confidence value is therefore central to the study of  metacognition. To this end, we asked healthy adults to detect the presence or absence of near-threshold stimuli that could be visual, auditory, or both, and then rate their confidence. In two pre-registered experiments (N = 48 and N = 54), audiovisual stimuli were better detected than unimodal ones, but were not associated with better metacognitive performance. Surprisingly, participants were more confident in their absence than presence judgments. To explain these results, we fitted a Bayesian evidence accumulation model in which sensory evidence is available for presence only, rendering decisions about absence dependent on counterfactual inference. The model reproduced decision patterns by assuming that a stimulus was perceived if sensory evidence from either modality exceeded a threshold (a disjunctive integration rule). In contrast, it reproduced confidence judgments by assuming that high confidence requires that the two modalities align (conjunctive for presence, disjunctive for absence). Together, these findings reveal that distinct computational mechanisms drive perception and confidence when detecting near-threshold multisensory signals.",

Here, we argue that the idea that stimuli are similar to the extent that they are likely to have been generated by the same process unifies these spatial and featural accounts as special cases. We formulate this notion of generative similarity in terms of Bayesian inference over hierarchical generative processes and show how it can illuminate key ideas from the literature including the universal law of generalization, feature contrast models, exemplar and prototype theories, and metric violations in semantic organization. Moreover, just as previous work on similarity drew on connections to multi-dimensional scaling and additive clustering, generative similarity provides a new way to construct representations of stimuli by drawing on contrastive learning, a modern machine learning procedure for learning representations by pushing similar stimuli together and dissimilar stimuli apart. We show how this approach can provide a way to translate hierarchical generative processes into spatial representations that support human-like abstraction and generalization, even in complex domains that are parameterized by probabilistic programs.",

Focusing on behavioral selection occurring within individuals, I propose a theory-driven strategy for the construction and evaluation of specific behavioral selection models and sketch its empirical application using example data from a published learning experiment.",

          "abstract": "Antisocial Personality traits (ASPT) are characterized by emotional detachment, impulsivity, and disregard for social norms, yet their neural underpinnings remain incompletely understood. The present study employed a multimodal neuroimaging approach to identify structural and functional brain patterns associated with antisocial personality traits in a large healthy sample to test the hypotheses that ASPT are associated with reduced default mode and affective networks functionality and structural integrity. Using joint Independent Component Analysis (jICA), we integrated fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) measures from 205 participants. Three independent components (IC5, IC7, and IC9) jointly predicted antisocial scores on the Personality Styles and Disorders Inventory (PSDI). Specifically, reduced fALFF–GM–WM expression in IC5 (Default Mode Network, DMN) and IC7 (affective network), as well as increased expression in IC9 (sensorimotor–reward network) were associated with higher antisocial traits. A supervised machine learning method known as Transformer-based foundation model pre-trained on millions of synthetic tabular datasets confirmed the generalizability of our findings. Correlation analyses further showed that antisociality was linked to low Agreeableness, low Conscientiousness, and high Trait Anger and Anger-Out, consistent with deficits in empathy, self-control, and emotional regulation. Together, these findings suggest that antisocial tendencies reflect a distributed dysfunction across self-referential, affective, and sensorimotor–reward systems, providing a network-level framework for understanding the neural architecture of ASPT.",

          "abstract": "The generation effect refers to the advantage in memory for self-generated information compared to information that is received from another source (e.g., through reading). The multifactor account posits that generation improves the processing of the specific information a learner uses to complete the task, and the generation effect will be observed if the memory test depends on the recruitment of that information. Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

          "abstract": "During visual search for targets defined by a specific feature, a representation of this feature (an attentional template) is already activated during search preparation. This has been shown in many experiments that used the contingent attentional capture paradigm. Here, we employed this paradigm to investigate the nature of such preparatory target templates during search for conjunctively defined targets. A globally recruited sample of participants searched for targets defined by a single feature (a particular colour, orientation, shape, or size), or by a conjunction of two features from different dimensions. Search displays were preceded by cues with target-matching features, and spatial cueing effects triggered by these cues were measured to test whether a corresponding preparatory search template was active. Contingent attentional capture effects were found for all four dimensions during single-feature search. When targets were defined by a conjunction of colour and either orientation, size, or shape, capture effects were present only for the non-colour dimension, but were consistently absent for colour, suggesting that no preparatory colour templates were activated. In contrast, both shape and size cues triggered reliable and additive contingent capture effects during shape/size conjunction search. These results show that preparatory templates for target features from different dimensions can be activated independently and in parallel during conjunction search, but that colour templates may only be triggered reactively.",

          "abstract": "Serial dependence, a behavioral phenomenon where information from previous trials biases current trial reports, is pervasive in working memory tasks. There is growing interest in its mechanisms, and recent work has shown that individuals with schizophrenia and anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis exhibit reduced serial dependence in simple delayed-response tasks. Modeling and experimental evidence suggest that serial dependence stems from the interplay between persistent neural activity and short-term synaptic plasticity in cortical circuits, with neural reactivations in between trials increasing serial dependence. A computational model that implements this hypothesis showed that a reduction in short-term plasticity, potentially due to NMDAR dysfunction, can replicate the observed reduction of serial dependence in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and schizophrenia, compared with healthy subjects. Yet, its neurophysiological predictions remain untested. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to test if these patient groups have reduced neural reactivations, as the model predicts. Our findings confirm the absence of memory reactivations in schizophrenia and anti-NMDAR encephalitis. We show that this result does not depend on motor-related activity. Further, while memory codes are specifically impaired in these patients, the perceptual component of the code is as robust as in healthy participants. Overall, we report empirical evidence supporting a mechanistic model of serial dependence, which links reduced neural reactivations with diminished serial dependence in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

          "abstract": "The ideas about the origins and role of motor variability have been revised in recent years after realizing that a strictly peripheral origin is not sufficient to explain many observed aspects of brain function. Among these, time processing is emerging as one of the least studied functions where motor variability might have a critical role. Time processing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds includes the phenomenon of sensorimotor synchronization (SMS), where both sensory and motor timing processes play in parallel, likely overlapping in time. The most common and simple task to study SMS is paced finger tapping, where a person taps in synchrony with a periodic sequence of brief stimuli as in keeping pace with music. The main observable is the asynchrony, that is the time difference between every response and the corresponding stimulus along the sequence. Here we report that the variability of asynchronies in a paced finger-tapping experiment (N = 44) is correlated with the variability of the tapping force such that participants with smaller force variability have a better timing precision—but only in the absence of auditory feedback from the taps. We explain our observation by describing a potential mechanism based on empirical and theoretical results that bridges the gap between timing variability and force variability. Our results suggest that the tactile feedback in the presence of auditory feedback is mostly irrelevant in the perceptual determination of the occurrence time of the tap.",

          "abstract": "Although borderline personality disorder (BPD) is more frequently diagnosed among sexual minority individuals than heterosexual individuals, it is unclear the degree to which this disparity reflects differences in symptom expression, diagnostic bias, or some combination of the two. Among treatment-seeking adults with BPD (N = 121, Mage = 28.4; 76% female; 89% White; 57% sexual minority), we examined differential item functioning (DIF) and group differences in symptom severity using self-reported and clinician-administered BPD measures (ZAN-BPD-SR, ZAN-BPD-CR, SCID-5-PD). Although there was no evidence of DIF for any self-reported item, sexual minority participants endorsed self-injurious behaviors (B = .63, p = .01), stress-related paranoia or dissociation (B = .62, p = .01), efforts to avoid abandonment (B = .53, p = .02), and unstable relationships (B = .54, p = .03) more often than heterosexual participants on average, contributing to greater past-week total symptomatology (B = 3.88, p &lt; .01). Clinician-administered items assessing self-injurious behaviors exhibited uniform DIF and were “easier” to endorse for sexual minority participants. Further, assessors rated self-injurious behaviors for sexual minority participants more often over the past week (B = .51, p &lt; .01) and past two years (OR = 3.58, p &lt; .01) than heterosexual participants, and affective instability over the past two years (OR = 4.00, p &lt; .05). These results suggest that patients and assessors interpreted most BPD items similarly, while emphasizing the need for nuanced examination of symptomatology and cultural competence in clinical practice to ensure accurate evaluation of BPD across diverse groups.",

          "abstract": "Slider scales, a type of visual analogue scale, are commonly used as a response format in smartphone-based ambulatory assessment studies. This may be due to several advantages of slider scales, including the use of a metric scale compared to an ordinal Likert scale and the intuitive use of slider scales on touchscreens. However, research on the comparability of Likert and slider scales remains scarce, especially in the context of ambulatory assessment (i.e., intensive longitudinal data). To address this gap, we conducted a three-week ambulatory assessment study with four measurement occasions per day, in which we experimentally manipulated the response format (Likert vs. slider scales) between groups. Our final sample consisted of 21,730 measurement occasions nested in 406 participants. We tested for measurement invariance across response-format groups and compared their psychometric properties, including reliability, within-person variability, and validity. Results indicated measurement invariance across groups, with equal factor loadings at the within-person level and equal factor loadings, intercepts, and indicator-specific residual variances at the between-person level. In addition, we found no significant differences in reliability or validity and only minor differences in within-person variability. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of ambulatory assessment studies and offer recommendations for future research.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual systems adapt through individual experience across the lifespan, an ability referred to as plasticity. To understand perceptual plasticity, a promising avenue is to investigate how perception is shaped by cultural experience, as a process deeply embedded within collective practices of cultural production and social learning. The current review synthesizes findings from recent behavioral experiments investigating cross-cultural variation in rhythm perception. Specifically, these studies show that fundamental perceptual processes, such as event timing and rhythm categorization, display shared features but also systematic differences across cultural groups. Critically, these differences correlate with statistically prominent and socially relevant features of cultural production, revealing how perceptual systems are tuned to their music-cultural environments. Yet, how can cross-cultural differences in perception be related back to the collective practices that produce the diversity of cultural environments in the first place? To bridge this gap, we propose perceptual niche construction as an evolutionary approach that positions culture as both a source and a product of perceptual plasticity. That is, cultural experience tunes individual perception, yielding culturally diverse perceptual processes. These processes, in turn, create selection pressures shaping cultural production across nested timescales, resulting in diverse cultural environments. This approach presents implications for research in psychology and neuroscience, notably in proposing to operationalize culture as communities of learning and practice. Moreover, it highlights the relevance of contextually situated research, in view of accounting for the dynamic nature of culture-driven perceptual plasticity.",

Previous work using binocular rivalry has shown that manipulating participants’ facial\nmovements shapes visual awareness of rivalrous facial expressions, but the underlying\nmechanism remains unclear. Does facial muscle configuration selectively enhance perception\nof matching expressions, suggesting sensorimotor simulation, or does it more broadly affect\nemotional stimuli in general, consistent with the facial feedback hypothesis? To investigate\nthis, forty female participants from a Western university population held a chopstick\nhorizontally between their teeth (activating smile-associated muscles) or had their facial\nmovements unrestricted during binocular rivalry between competing images. We tested two\nrivalry conditions: one included face stimuli and the other included two non-facial objects,\nensuring that facial and non-facial stimulus pairs were matched for arousal and valence ratings.\nParticipants rated the smiling face (M=2.3) and flower (M=1.8) as more positive than the\nneutral face (M=0.2) and storage item (M=-0.3) on a -3 to +3 scale. We measured the duration\nof each stimulus’s dominance in visual awareness during 60-second rivalry periods. Notably,\nthe chopstick manipulation increased dominance duration for both facial and non-facial stimuli\nrated as positive—the smiling face (+2.5s, d=0.38) and flower (+2.1s, d=0.35)—while\nneutrally-rated stimuli showed no change. These results provide initial evidence that facial\nmuscle configuration can bias visual awareness for positive content across stimulus classes,\nsupporting the role of facial feedback.

          "abstract": "Of all the conceptual distinctions that humans can detect in their environment, only a limited set are encoded in grammars, with striking cross-linguistic consistency. Attributes such as numerosity,\nanimacy, and its subdivisions (e.g., sex) recur across languages, structuring grammatical systems in similar ways. This raises the question of whether human cognition is intrinsically biased toward\nlearning these contrasts and using them to organize grammar, or whether their presence can be explained by usage and cue frequency in experience. We address this question using categorization and artificial lexicon learning experiments that contrast animacy with color, a perceptually distinct attribute that is never grammaticalized. In a non-linguistic task (Exp 0), both attributes were spontaneously selected as categorization cues. Novel grammatical systems mapping exclusively onto animacy (Exp 1) or color (Exp 2) were learned equally well. In Exp 3, where cues to the two attributes were equally frequent and ambiguously related to learned words, participants selected either contrast with comparable frequency. Crucially, the two semantic oppositions interacted, with a tendency of color distinction to be encoded more robustly within the animate category. This pattern mirrors cross-linguistic tendencies, where higher-order animacy categories host richer grammatical specifications.\nThese observations reveal an implicit bias in emergent grammatical systems, in which animacy functions as a privileged organizing dimension. We suggest that this bias arises from the salience and\nreal-life frequency of animacy, which provide a reliable foundation for communicative and processing efficiency in grammar and in the broader architecture of language.",

We argue that these barriers systematically constrain the translation of promising interventions into meaningful societal change. By synthesizing insights across disciplines and evaluating intervention practices through the SCOPE lens, we identify limitations in measurement, generalizability, implementation, and ethical consideration. We conclude by offering recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and institutions to design, evaluate, and deploy interventions that are robust, context-sensitive, and socially responsible.

Yet, we show that in social media news contexts, confidence is counterintuitively anti-diagnostic: it signals lower-quality information while also predicting greater diffusion. Using computational linguistics and machine learning, we analyze over 20 million posts across eight major online platforms. Posts expressed with greater confidence are more likely to link to lower-quality, more misinformative news domains, even controlling for user baselines, toxicity, and political lean. At the same time, confident posts also receive more engagement.

These features heavily inform psychotherapy theories and popular framings of psychological experience. I first subject these features to a critical examination.

          "abstract": "Background: To counter increasing youth mental health problems, it has been suggested to invest in broadly accessible parenting programs. To date, few online parenting programs exist and the majority provide universal rather than personalized advice. This preregistered randomized controlled trial tested a novel digital parenting intervention, composed of self-monitoring of parenting, a data-driven parenting report, and 6 weeks of online parenting tips to stimulate need-supportive parenting.\nMethods: This preregistered study compared post-intervention parenting (proximal outcome) and adolescent affective well-being (distal outcome) of 321 families in a control condition (100 daily diaries), with 225 families in an intervention group who additionally received a feedback report and add-on parenting tips from day 50 onwards. The report and tips were either universal (n = 107) or personalized (n = 110). This trial was registered at the CCMO: NL-009451 on 19-02-2025 [https://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/57487]\nResults: Throughout the study, parents became less need-supportive, but adolescents experienced their parents as more need-supportive. Both parents and adolescents observed decreased overparenting over time. Parents in the control group reported becoming less autonomy supportive and warm (pre-post intervention) which was not found in the intervention groups. Adolescents in the universal intervention group perceived an increase in structure over time and an increase in negative affect (mainly irritability). No significant group differences were detected however (p’s &gt; .06). Hence, an additional 6 weeks of parenting tips and a feedback report (our intervention) did not outperform the impact of 100 days of self-monitoring.\nConclusions: Digital self-monitoring of parenting, combined with data-driven feedback and online parenting tips, seems to make parents more critical of their own parenting, but leaves adolescents more satisfied with the need-supportiveness of their parents. Moreover, this online parenting intervention, designed to target need-supportiveness, might counter harmful overparenting practices.",

Participants completed baseline and immediate post-training questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, IPT-SSI knowledge, attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy, and willingness/apprehension to deliver IPT-SSI. Post-training user experience ratings and open-ended qualitative feedback were also collected. \nResults: MHPs showed significant pre–post gains in IPT-SSI knowledge (baseline M = 1.13, SD = 0.96; post M = 3.37, SD = 0.92; t(71) = 18.38, p &lt; .001) and self-efficacy (baseline M = 2.27, SD = 1.13; post M = 3.49, SD = 0.95; t(71) = 8.90, p &lt; .001).

Willingness to accept clients for IPT-SSI increased (baseline M = 3.22, SD = 1.48; post M = 3.60, SD = 1.08; t(71) = 2.40, p = .019, d = 0.28), whereas changes in apprehension did not reach to significance. User experience ratings were high and qualitative feedback highlighted perceived advantages in psychological safety, accessibility, and real-time guidance, alongside concerns about over-scaffolding and the limits of text-based realism. \nConclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that AI-powered clinical simulators—especially those incorporating embedded supervision—may serve as scalable, practice-forward tools to support psychotherapy training. A brief AI-supported program was associated with substantial gains in MHPs' perceived knowledge and self-efficacy and with improved attitudes and willingness to deliver IPT-SSI - key barriers to SSI implementation.",

          "abstract": "Background: The majority of mental illnesses emerge before the age of 25. It is well established that those who are most vulnerable and most in need of mental health support are least likely to access services or take part in research. \n\nAims: Adopting an intersectional lens, this research aims to elicit the experience regarding mental health of young people who feel under represented \n\nMethod; People aged 16 – 24, living in England, who were currently experiencing or had experienced poor mental health in the preceding year were recruited from both NHS waiting lists (in Oxford, Sheffield, Cornwall and Liverpool) and nationally on social media and via charities. 248 people completed an online questionnaire, of which 117 took part in an initial screening call and 81 were interviewed. Unstructured interviews that adopted a narrative inquiry approach were conducted either in person or on online, and audio recorded then transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a combination of thematic and framework analysis. Young people with relevant lived experience consulted on the implementation of the research and recruitment, and peer researchers contributed data collection and data analysis. \n\nResults: Participants engaged with unstructured narrative inquiry interviews, often anchoring their experiences either in their schooling, or in a series of adverse childhood events. Three overarching themes were extracted from the data; the impact of connection, (in)validation, proactively coping and preventive opportunities. These themes highlighted the variation in health literacy and how mental health experiences are understood, as well as whether existing services were experienced as accessible and helpful. Participants were proactive with adopting coping mechanisms in the absence of support and identified times of transition as providing an opportunity for improved support. \n\nDiscussion: There are implications for policy and practice in how mental health is talked about and recognised amongst young people. It is important that young people are empowered to talk about their experiences, and that attempts to seek help or access care are not met with invalidation. Times of transition (particularly around schooling) are opportunities where support could be better offered in a preventative way. \n\nStrengths \n-\tLarge diverse set of lived experience data \n-\tYouth-led involvement strategy for implementing the research programme\n-\tInclusive and intersectional approach \n-\tOpen methodology that enabled participants to set agenda\n\nLimitations \n-\tAbility to represent large diverse data set within existing analytic frameworks\n-\tUnstructured narrative interview methods potentially challenging for some neurodivergent people and those with communication needs.",

          "abstract": "Psychology is frequently described as theoretically fragmented, yet the field lacks scalable tools for quantifying whether theories consolidate or remain contested over time. We introduce a discourse-based approach that tracks theory reception by classifying how published articles position themselves relative to a target theory—whether they explicitly support it, oppose it, rely on it tacitly, or engage ambiguously. Using structured literature retrieval and full-text processing, we apply this approach at scale with the aid of a large language model (LLM) used as an annotation support tool, while anchoring all classifications in expert-defined stance categories. As a case study, we analyze 472 articles engaging with memory-decay theory published between 1958 and 2023. LLM-assisted stance classifications show strong agreement with expert judgments using only the article abstracts (Cohen’s κ ≈ .80–.83). Across six decades of publications, stance distributions exhibit no systematic increase in tacit acceptance, no sustained decline in opposition, and no consistent drift toward consensus, suggesting theoretical stagnation. Taken together, this work provides a reusable workflow for tracking theory reception over time using features of scientific discourse. All materials required to reproduce and adapt the pipeline—including code, search strategies, screening criteria, and article-level stance labels—are openly available.",

However, it is unclear to what extent this problem may distort important empirical findings with respect to conspiracy theories. In this Registered Report, we recruited a demographically representative quota sample of the New Zealand population (N = 810), and probed sincerity by two methods: Presenting a farcically bizarre conspiracy theory and explicitly asking respondents if they had been insincere in any of their responses. We found that respondents classified as insincere according to either of these methods displayed substantially higher levels of conspiracy theory endorsement. Respondents who displayed signs of insincerity were also much more likely to endorse contradictory conspiracy theories. Furthermore, we found that the relationships between endorsement of conspiracy theories and well-established predictors (paranoia, belief in a dangerous world, cognitive reflection, and trust, but not anxiety) had significant interactions with insincerity. While some uncertainty remains about the validity of the methods that we used to detect insincerity, our findings suggest that insincere responses may distort empirical findings relating to belief in conspiracy theories.

Although ED is theorized to develop through caregiving experiences, contextual effects on ED in developmental populations have rarely been investigated, particularly among youth who have experienced disruptions in early caregiving relationships. To illuminate the development of ED, we explored how adolescents’ momentary emotion differentiation (mED) varies across socio-emotional contexts and whether these patterns differ following exposure to severe caregiving-related early adversities (crEAs). Adolescents (N = 81; ages 10–17) with/without crEAs completed a 7-day ecological momentary assessment (4–5 surveys/day), reporting emotions and social contexts. At the trait level, no significant differences in ED emerged following crEAs after controlling for covariates. Consistent with prior research on community samples, higher anxiety/depression was associated with lower negative trait ED across groups. At the momentary level, negative mED decreased following negative parent-related contexts compared to other contexts. However, the standard deviation of these momentary emotions indicated that negative parental contexts were followed by a phasic intensification restricted to a few negative emotions. Importantly, exposure to crEAs attenuated these contextual effects. These data offer initial investigation for the complex ways in which early disruptions to caregiving relationships may shape adolescents’ emotion differentiation.",

          "abstract": "The symptom dynamics in schizophrenia often exhibit complex, non-linear temporal patterns, alternating between relatively predictable and disorganized states. Conventional diagnostic frameworks often struggle to capture these evolving dynamics, prompting the development of diverse modeling approaches aimed at describing symptom trajectories more faithfully. Among these approaches, dynamical systems theory provides a particularly powerful framework for addressing temporal dependencies, non-linear interactions, and state-dependent transitions. Recent advances in longitudinal data collection and analysis, including improved temporal resolution and computational methods, now enable both the construction of interpretable models that distinguish distinct trajectories of symptom evolution and the extraction of informative dynamical features. This narrative review synthesizes the growing body of work applying dynamical systems theory to schizophrenia spectrum. It highlights convergent insights across studies while explicitly distinguishing between conceptually motivated models, emerging computational approaches, and empirically validated frameworks. This narrative review also addresses current limitations, including methodological constraints, issues of feasibility, and the need for further longitudinal and clinical validation. The aim is to provide a coherent conceptual framework for understanding schizophrenia as a dynamic process, to promote cross-disciplinary dialogue, and to guide future research in translational computational psychiatry.",

          "authors": "Vikas N O'Reilly-Shah",
          "abstract": "Consciousness science has generated diverse theoretical frameworks, each offering insights into different aspects of conscious experience. However, this diversity has created a fractured landscape: theories operate at different explanatory levels, and a principled account of how conscious phenomena arise from specific neural computations remains largely absent. This work argues that State Space Theory (SST) can serve as a unifying mechanistic framework for consciousness science. SST proposes that consciousness arises from hierarchical delay coordinate embedding (DCE) - the reconstruction of dynamical system structure from time-delayed signals - implemented through recurrent cortical circuits ('DCE engines'), with gain modulation determining which reconstructions achieve system-wide influence. SST identifies these dynamics with consciousness itself, not merely as correlates. We draw on recent empirical and theoretical work to demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal, including empirical demonstrations that recurrent networks learn via embedding and mathematical results linking recurrent dynamics to embedding theory. We identify how major cognitive theories map onto this architecture mechanistically: parallel DCE engines correspond to Dennett's competing \"drafts,\" global broadcasting reflects gain-amplified propagation, recurrent processing enables the temporal integration DCE requires, and the attention schema emerges as a higher-order reconstruction of gain modulation dynamics. SST's fundamentally process-based character provides immunity to the unfolding argument and resolves the temporal paradox facing causal structure theories. The framework generates a number of falsifiable predictions related to topological structure of perceptual dynamics, temporal vulnerability windows, and selective disruption of recurrent timing. SST thus offers a computational foundation for consciousness research that grounds existing theories mechanistically while generating empirical commitments.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded directly into social media platforms, enabling users to request real-time fact-checks of online content. Using an exhaustive dataset of 1,671,841 English-language fact-checking requests made to Grok and Perplexity on X between February and September 2025, we provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of how LLM-based fact-checking operates in the wild. Fact-checking requests comprise 7.6% of all interactions with the LLM bots, and focus primarily on politics, economics, and current events. We document clear partisan asymmetries in usage. Users requesting fact-checks from Grok are much more likely to be Republican than Democratic, while the opposite is true for fact-check requests from Perplexity -- indicating emerging polarization in attitudes toward specific AI models. At the same time, both Democrats and Republicans are more likely to request fact-checks on posts authored by Republicans, and - consistent with prior work using professional fact-checkers and crowd judgments - posts from Republican-leaning accounts are more likely to be rated as inaccurate by both LLMs. Across posts rated by both LLM bots, evaluations from Grok and Perplexity agree 52.6% of the time and strongly disagree (one party rates a claim as true and the other as false) 13.6% of the time. For a sample of 100 fact-checked posts, 54.5% of Grok bot ratings and 57.7% of Perplexity bot ratings agreed with ratings of human fact-checkers, which is significantly lower than the inter-fact-checker agreement rate of 64.0%; but API-access versions of Grok had higher agreement with fact-checkers than did not significantly differ from inter-fact-checker agreement. Finally, in a preregistered survey experiment with 1,592 U.S. participants, exposure to LLM fact-checks meaningfully shifts belief accuracy, with effect sizes comparable to those observed in studies of professional fact-checking. However, responses to Grok fact-checks are polarized by partisanship when model identity is disclosed, whereas responses to Perplexity are not. Together, these findings show that LLM-based fact-checking is rapidly scaling, is generally informative although far from perfect, while also becoming entangled with polarization and partisanship. Our work highlights both the promise and the risks of integrating AI fact-checking into online public discourse.",

          "abstract": "What constrains working memory capacity? Classic theories place visual working memory close to perceptual systems, with fixed limits. Yet, emerging evidence shows that visual working memory capacity is increased for real-world objects compared to simple or abstract stimuli. The present study demonstrates that this memory advantage arises from semantic understanding of real-world objects – contrary to classic perceptual accounts of this cognitive system. Using counterfeit objects generated by generative adversarial networks that match real objects in terms of object form and visual similarity, we show that improvements in behavioral performance and increases in neural delay activity emerge solely for semantically meaningful, real objects.  Correlation analyses indicate that subjective familiarity ratings predict memory for real objects, whereas stimulus colourfulness predicts memory for artificial objects, suggesting distinct mechanisms support memory for different stimulus types. Thus, conceptual knowledge exerts strong effects on visual working memory, significantly extending current theories that emphasize low-level perceptual features.",

          "abstract": "Background: Digital phenotyping offers opportunities to capture real-time behavioral and physiological markers associated with mood disorders. For example, sleep and physical activity are two key behavioral exposures consistently shown to reduce risk for depression and anxiety symptoms. However, feasibility and acceptability challenges, particularly relating to device burden and data reliability, remain barriers to upscaling sample sizes.\n\nObjective: This mixed-methods feasibility study evaluated the acceptability, usability, and data completeness of passive monitoring of sleep and physical activity via a smart ring and active ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of mood and contextual factors via a smartwatch in adults from the general population.\n\nMethods: Participants wore a consumer-grade Oura smart ring to passively track sleep and physical activity for 2 weeks while concurrently completing brief mood EMAs on a study-issued smartwatch. Feasibility metrics included device adherence, EMA completion rate, and patterns of missingness. Acceptability was assessed through semi-structured interviews. Exploratory analyses examined associations between daily mood, sleep and physical activity.\n\nResults: Adherence to both devices was high, with participants wearing the ring consistently and completing most EMA prompts (mean compliance = 90%, range = 90.1%\n75.0%-100%). The smartwatch delivered a higher number of prompts than originally scheduled and showed some variability in timing of prompts. Furthermore, qualitative interviews indicated strong preferences for the smart ring, described as comfortable and unobtrusive, while the watch was experienced as bulky, with participants reporting difficulties managing two devices. There was no difference in the patterns of data missingness by time of day or day of the week. Mood ratings demonstrated reasonable variability, but exploratory associations between mood and either physical activity or sleep were not detected, likely due to limited power.\n\nConclusions: Passive monitoring via a smart ring was highly feasible and acceptable, whereas smartwatch EMA was less popular with participants, suggesting that smart rings might be better used in conjunction with smartphone-based EMA. Future studies should consider rings for scalable passive data collection and ensure robust EMA scheduling mechanisms. Scaling this protocol up into larger samples is likely required to evaluate mood–behavior associations.",

Using vignette studies, small-group videos, and actual text-based chat conversations, and including a baseline condition with no information on confrontation, we disentangled potential negative effects of serious confrontation from positive effects of humorous confrontation. Contrary to predictions, neither confrontation type reliably reduced perceptions of sexist norms (H1). However, across all three studies, humorous confrontation consistently repaired threats to women's standing (H2) while maintaining group cohesion (H3), and preserving the offender’s status. Together, these findings shift the focus from individual-level benefits and costs to group-level consequences of confrontation, broadening conceptions of effectiveness beyond norm change and personal backlash risks to include the preservation of group functioning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Much of prior literature examines potentially traumatic event (PTE) exposure as a cumulative risk, though PTEs may not have an equal impact on substance use (SU). Methods: In the current study, we test McLaughlin &amp; Sheridan’s (2016) model in a sample of 11,800 community youth (ages 9-15 years old) enrolled in the nationwide, longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to examine the impact of PTE types on SU. We analyze concurrent associations between PTE types (physical abuse, domestic violence, community violence, emotional neglect, poverty, and institutionalization / deprivation) and substance use (pooling alcohol, cannabis, or nicotine) and prospective associations whereby exposure to different PTE types predicts SU one year later (self-medication hypothesis). Results: For concurrent associations, we find emotional neglect and physical abuse were significantly positively related to SU. In terms of prospective associations, institutionalization / deprivation, emotional neglect, and physical abuse significantly positively predicted SU. A majority of associations between PTE types and SU were accounted for by other PTE types and time-varying covariates (e.g., internalizing/externalizing symptoms). The association between PTEs and SU during adolescence varies across PTE types. PTEs categorized as physical abuse and emotional neglect are more likely to lead to SU. Conclusions: Findings suggest that surveillance for SU is especially warranted in youth experiencing emotional neglect and physical abuse relative to other PTEs. Future research should examine more types of PTEs along a wider age span to replicate findings.",

          "authors": "NA; Amanda Kay Montoya; Samantha F. Anderson",
          "abstract": "Moderated mediation models are commonly used in psychological research and other academic fields to model when and how effects occur. Researchers must choose which paths in the mediation model are moderated when specifying this type of model. While the ultimate goal is to specify the model correctly, researchers may struggle to determine whether to err on the side of including too many moderated paths (maximalist approach) or including too few moderated paths (minimalist approach). This registered report examines how the specification of moderation impacts statistical power, type I error rate, and parameter bias for the index of moderated mediation. In a systematic review of papers published using moderated mediation over the course of one year, we found that six model specifications account for 85\\% of published moderated mediation analyses and the median sample size was 285. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the impacts of model specification on power and type I error rate, and results were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression. In reference to the data-generating process, the data analysis model can either be correctly specified, over-specified, under-specified, or completely misspecified. Over-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power to detect a significant index of moderated mediation compared to correctly specified models and relatively low parameter bias. Under-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power than correctly specified models but unacceptably high parameter bias. Completely misspecified models were hypothesized to have inflated type I error rates and unacceptable parameter bias. Based on these results we recommend researchers lean more toward maximalist approaches to avoid parameter bias, but acknowledge that this comes with a cost in statistical power.",

To use advanced machine learning techniques to develop a concise and comprehensive screening and monitoring tool for psychiatric disorder risks and evaluate its reliability and validity. \nDesign, setting, and participants. We obtained three datasets of outpatient participants at a psychiatric hospital in China who completed the 567-item Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). We used the first dataset (N=6,704) for model training, testing, and internal validation to obtain a shortened version (100 items) using the stacked generalization ensemble of several machine-learning techniques. We validated the shortened scale against two prospective pristine datasets (N=928, unpreregistered; N=484, preregistered). \nMain outcomes and measures. The Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC of ROC) to measure validity and Cronbach’s Alpha to measure reliability.\nResults. We reduced the length of the MMPI-2 by over 82%, from 567 to 100 items. The shortened scale can measure ten target conditions with at least 85% AUC and a Cronbach’s Alpha 0.97. We implemented the shortened scaleinto a mobile-friendly web application.\nConclusions and relevance. An advanced machine-learning approach can significantly reduce a long scale to a shortened one while retaining high validity and reliability.  This shortened scale can not only help alleviate pressure on healthcare systems burdened by the increased number of patients with mental health concerns but also allows for regular health monitoring or screening by individuals.",

          "abstract": "In today's increasingly interconnected world, the ability to anticipate future developments has become more critical than ever. While individual predictive abilities are often limited by cognitive biases, the wisdom of crowds—the aggregation of human judgments—has shown remarkable success in improving prediction accuracy. Group discussion can have mixed effects on this success. On one hand, it can enhance collective intelligence through information sharing; On the other hand, it may also undermine crowd wisdom by introducing social pressures that reduce independence and diversity of thought. Using data from a community forecasting site, we developed an interpretable, predictive model to investigate how structural and linguistic-psychological characteristics of discourse affect crowd accuracy. A simple model with 14 independent variables explained 28.6% of the variance in group prediction accuracy on a held-out test set. Notable predictors included a high comments-to-predictions ratio and informal language use (e.g., profanity, religious references, speech disfluencies), which correlated with increased crowd error. Emotional language also played a role, with the use of exclamation marks associated with increased prediction error, while anxiety-related language and detachment showed a modest association with decreased error rates. These findings demonstrate how discourse markers can serve as early indicators of potential crowd prediction failures, offering a practical tool for calibrating collective intelligence and enhancing forecasting accuracy.",

          "authors": "Rajarshi Majumder; Ignazio Ziano; Robert Mai",
          "abstract": "During inflationary periods, consumers tend to focus on nominal price changes when making consumption decisions, often overlooking the changes in their real purchasing power, a phenomenon known as money illusion. What do consumers think when comparing how they and other consumers make decisions under inflation? Consumers might believe they make economically better decisions than others. However, consumers fail to realize that their choices are more distorted by money illusion than they expect others’ decisions to be. This research uncovers a consequential disconnect: the imprint of money illusion on consumers’ decisions persists despite consumers asserting to prioritize real over nominal value, more so than they believe others do. In nine studies (N = 3075), the self-other difference in the money illusion effect is examined across different decision contexts (buying, selling, salary evaluation). Results show that these self-other differences are more nuanced, varying based on (i) the type of economic decision (pronounced in buying decisions and attenuated in selling decisions) and (ii) the temporal reference point (evident when considering the inflation effect retrospectively and attenuated when considering it prospectively). This research extends the social comparison literature into the domain of inflation, with findings that inform price-setting decisions and perceptions of job appeal.",

Alterations in emotional experience are central to theory, but prospective-longitudinal studies of real-world affect dynamics are scarce. Leveraging a hierarchical-dimensional approach, we examined associations between momentary emotional experience and broadband and narrow internalizing symptoms in a risk-enriched sample of 234 emerging adults followed for 2.5 years. Bayesian models demonstrated that low tonic levels of positive affect (PA) were uniquely associated with worsening Well-being symptoms, a core feature of depression, social anxiety, and trauma disorders. Baseline differences in tonic negative affect were associated with the severity of future anxious-arousal symptoms, but not with longitudinal change. Variation in reactive affect and exposure to everyday positive and negative events were unrelated to symptom trajectories. These observations highlight the centrality of tonic PA to the development of a key transdiagnostic symptom and set the stage for developing more effective intervention strategies.",

          "abstract": "The concept of work ability has generated much interest in the scientific literature. However, there are still certain aspects that remain unclear with regard to this concept's dimensions and how it interacts with other variables. The goal of this study was to systematically review studies that analyzed predictors of perceived mental work ability, based on the theoretical framework of the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) and the European Framework for Psychosocial Risk Management PRIMA-EF. Moreover, we also analyzed whether the studies selected for evaluation addressed work ability as a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. Searches were performed in the Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycInfo and PsyArXiv databases with a ten-year limit. Of a total of 1811 potentially eligible studies, 77 were selected based on the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that the studies conceptualized this construct as perceived work ability and did not include the term mental in their definitions. Of the variables analyzed, those related to personal resources and workplace resources predicted greater perceived work ability. Conversely, age, job demands, psychosocial risks and the absence of both personal and workplace resources were negative predictors. However, with regards to age, positive relations were found when the mental dimension of perceived work ability was analyzed separately. It is noteworthy how limited the body of research is on some personal variables (personality traits and emotional states, aptitudes and physical/cognitive performance, and psychological capital) and attitudinal variables (satisfaction and commitment), as well as certain job and workplace characteristics (industry, job type, type of contract, and type of workday). Finally, an elevated percentage of studies analyzed perceived work ability as a unidimensional construct, resulting in a less precise evaluation of this concept. Practical implications and future lines of research were also addressed.",

          "authors": "Andrew D Wilson",
          "abstract": "Movement control faces a problem of redundancy. In general, there are more degrees of freedom available to solve a task than the task requires. This ‘degrees of freedom’ problem has been reframed as a ‘motor abundance’ feature (Latash, 2012), where the redundancy enables crucial flexibility. The balance between flexibility and control has been proposed to depend on synergies, which are lower-dimensional organisations of movement dynamics into systems that solve the task at hand. There are now several movement analysis methods designed to search for the signatures of synergies (the uncontrolled manifold, Scholz &amp; Schöner, 1999; tolerance-noise-covariation, Cohen &amp; Sternad, 2009, and others) and a great deal of empirical evidence that synergies feature in movement control. However, while all of these analysis methods rely on notions of ‘task’ to constrain movement solutions, they do not come with a formal theory of what a task is or how tasks are perceived. This paper proposes the hypothesis that tasks should be formalised as task-dynamical affordances, and that perceiving these via specifying information is how they constrain synergy formation (effectivities). I lay out the hypothesis, and detail a research programme to investigate the hypothesis, with reference to existing work on throwing.",

          "authors": "Chaoxiong Ye; Qianru Xu; Liu Qiang; Edward K. Vogel",
          "abstract": "Human observers remember some images more reliably than others – a phenomenon often attributed to image memorability, a stimulus-driven property that predicts consistent memory outcomes across individuals. While memorability has been studied in the context of long-term memory, recent evidence suggests that it also shapes visual working memory (VWM), potentially enhancing how visual inputs are retained over short timescales. Yet, this apparent behavioral benefit could arise from differences in perceptual processing or stimulus comparison at test, rather than from processes specific to VWM. Behavioral measures alone cannot resolve this distinction, because performance in change-detection tasks is influenced by perceptual comparison and decision-related factors at test. To isolate when memorability influences VWM, we combined a lateralized change-detection task with time-resolved electrophysiological measures that index memory-related activity during the retention interval, independent of test-related processing. Participants remembered faces with high or low image memorability while scalp EEG was recorded. Behaviorally, we replicated the memorability benefit in VWM performance. Neurally, we examined contralateral delay activity (CDA) in posterior electrodes as an index of VWM retention. Memorability modulated CDA amplitude during the early phase of retention, before signal stabilization, with only weak or no reliable differences observed later in the delay period. Importantly, variation in early CDA amplitude directly predicted participants’ improved task performance. These findings suggest that image memorability strengthens the transformation of perceptual inputs into durable VWM representations before stable retention is established. Yet, this transient encoding-related advantage does not appear to significantly change the total amount of information maintained at a fixed set size. Thus, memorability likely shapes how VWM is formed, rather than how much is ultimately retained.",

The association between polygenic scores for fussiness and brain phenotype was studied in an independent cohort, the developing Human Connectome Project (N=264).\nMain outcome and measures: Parent-reported infant fussiness in the first postnatal year\nResults: Infant fussiness showed a significant SNP-based heritability (h2SNP; 8.18%; SE, 0.78%). Infant fussiness shared common genetic architecture (genetic correlation, rg) with toddler emotionality (rg, 0.40; SE, 0.08, P=1x10-6), toddler shyness (rg, 0.25; SE, 0.07, P=2x10-4), adult neuroticism (rg=0.14, SE, 0.04, P=5x10-4), adult BMI (rg, -0.12; SE, 0.03; P=2x10-4), and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (rg, 0.21; SE, 0.08; P=1x10-2). The polygenic score for infant fussiness was positively associated with both the volume of frontal white matter and volume of the medial temporal lobe in newborn infant brains (FWE P&lt;0.02). The European-ancestry GWAS identified a genome-wide significant variant on chromosome 13, rs1504440 that was mapped via chromatin interaction to SLITRK5, which is expressed in the central nervous system and involved in neuronal development. Multi-ancestry analyses identified three further genome-wide significant loci.\nConclusions and relevance: Infant fussiness is common and can be a source of concern for parents and clinicians. Our results, which show that infant fussiness is associated with genomic variation, may help both parents and healthcare providers understand this behaviour. The common genetic variation associated with fussiness is also associated with later toddler temperament, adult personality and some aspects of physical health, and with infant brain structures involved in emotional regulation.",

          "abstract": "A major target for evidence accumulation models of decision-making has been the development of a joint account of confidence, accuracy, and latency. While successful extensions to confidence have been made, there remains a lack of consensus as to how confidence is generated and there have been few comparisons between existing models. In this work, we developed and compare three different mechanisms for confidence generation in the linear ballistic accumulator framework (S. D. Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008). These take the form of a.) multi-alternative decisions among all of the confidence options as a competitive race, b.) the balance of evidence between the response alternatives (the multiple threshold race; Reynolds et al., in revision), and c.) confidence being inversely proportional to the amount of subjective time that has elapsed in the decision, which is measured as a separate accumulation process. Each theory was tested against two experiments that manipulated the number of confidence options in a decision (Experiment 1) or the amount of time pressure (Experiment 2). All theories cleared the empirical hurdles, but there were also subtle differences between each of the theories in their ability to address the data: although all models showed generally adequate parameter recovery, the Confidence Accumulator failed to produce theoretically sensible parameter shifts across confidence-scale conditions whereas the Timing theory was unable to address fast low-confidence patterns in individual participants; meanwhile, both the MTR and the Timing theory had questionable plausibility in addressing the double-increase pattern of confidence.",

          "abstract": "Early literacy and numeracy are strongly related across development, but the mechanisms underlying their association remain debated. In this study, we adopted a mutualism-based framework, focusing on longitudinal couplings between cognitive and/or academic domains including word reading, mathematics, and various cognitive skills in 205 Dutch children followed across five waves from kindergarten (mean age: 5.43 years) to Grade 2 (mean age: 7.41 years). Ten domains were assessed, including phonological skills, vocabulary, symbolic comparisons, applied math, verbal and visuospatial working memory, fluid reasoning, RAN, word reading fluency, and arithmetic fluency. Growth curve analyses revealed that higher initial skill levels in several domains, including phonological skills and RAN, were associated with steeper growth rates in word reading and arithmetic. Moreover, we found positive associations between growth rates across various domains, providing partial support for what we introduce here as the ‘developmental manifold’: the notion that the rate of growth (slope) in one cognitive/academic domain is positively associated with slopes in other domains, across early childhood. Regression analyses further indicated that word reading fluency in Grade 2 was predicted by intercepts (but not slopes) in phonological skills, arithmetic and RAN, beyond the autoregressive effects of prior word reading development. Conversely, arithmetic fluency in Grade 2 was only predicted by autoregressive effects of prior arithmetic. Together, our findings demonstrate the crucial importance of longitudinal, multi-domain measurements to understand the developmental interplay between cognitive/academic domains more commonly studied in isolation.",

          "authors": "Katja Rewitz; Wanja Wolff; Maik Bieleke",
          "abstract": "Boredom is a dynamic motivational state that signals disengagement and promotes behavioral change. Despite the centrality of temporal dynamics in conceptualizations of boredom, little empirical work has examined how it unfolds over time during sustained performance and how these dynamics relate to behavioral outcomes. To address this gap, we tracked boredom throughout an incremental cycling ergometer task that was performed until voluntary disengagement. We assessed changes in boredom and examined how boredom dynamics related to perceived physical and cognitive effort and task performance. Individual boredom and effort trajectories were decomposed using functional principal component analysis (fPCA). Whereas physical and cognitive effort showed largely homogenous increases over time, boredom exhibited pronounced interindividual variability, reflecting stable individual differences in overall boredom level and temporal boredom trends. The temporal trend in boredom, but not the boredom level, was associated with performance: greater alignment with decreasing (rather than increasing) boredom trends predicted longer persistence, even after controlling for perceived physical and cognitive effort. These findings corroborate the notion that boredom is not an ‘average’ experience; rather, it is a dynamic process whose temporal unfolding varies systematically across individuals and is directly linked to task persistence. This study provides novel empirical evidence for boredom dynamics, highlighting the value of tracking dynamic subjective experiences to understand task engagement and performance, and of incorporating temporal aspects into contemporary theories of boredom.",

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning revealed that touch aligned partners’ arousal states, enhanced Receivers’ sensitivity to emotional cues, and strengthened prefrontal inter-brain synchrony (IBS).\nCrucially, mediation analyses showed that, prefrontal IBS predicted Receivers’ arousal estimates, which in turn predicted their emotional sensitivity ($d'$), unveiling a touch-specific indirect pathway mediated by arousal alignment.\nTime-resolved analyses  revealed that neural activity in the Sender's prefrontal cortex, particularly inferior frontal gyrus, preceded Receiver neural responses by approximately 16 s. \nThese findings reveal a neural mechanism by which embodied contact sequentially aligns emotional states through prefrontal coupling. \nBy elucidating how touch embeds emotional meaning within a shared neural space, our findings advance an embodied account of human communication and provide a biological foundation for developing emotionally attuned, socially embedded artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how the brain combines object information from vision and touch is essential both for theories of multisensory perception and for designing perceptually coherent interactive displays. While vision often dominates object perception, haptic input provides direct access to three-dimensional object structure. However, the object features encoded by vision and touch at any one time are often not congruent raising the issue of how the senses combine object information into a coherent representation. We used visuo-haptic shape conflict paradigm in an object categorisation task, which was implemented in virtual reality (VR), to address this question. Participants freely categorised novel 3D-objects explored using vision and touch in which an image of the 3D-object was presented in a virtual environment during haptic exploration. We introduced a shape conflict in which the shape of the virtual object parametrically differed from the shape of the physically explored version across six levels of similarity. We found that participants maintained stable category representations across all levels of conflict. However, category decisions relied predominantly on information encoded through haptics with increasing shape conflict. This dominance might reflect a modality appropriateness bias or reduced sensory reliability of visual cues to object recognition in VR. Sensory dominance led to consistent categorisation performance rather than trial-by-trial cue reweighting. These findings have implications for understanding cross-sensory conflict on object categorisation and for predicting the perception of objects in VE and augmented reality displays.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1980s, neuroscientific studies of volition have examined participants’ subjective experience of when the intention to move arises. A common approach involves participants watching a fast-rotating clock, performing a spontaneous movement (e.g., a button press), and then reporting the clock position when they experienced the onset of intention (W time). However, previous evidence suggests that W times might be inferred rather than reflect the true onset of conscious experience. We tested 240 participants in an online version of the clock task using an order (O) mode of recall. After each movement, a stationary clock hand appeared at a predetermined position, and participants indicated whether they had decided to move before, after, or right now relative to the displayed time. Crucially, participants in the deception group were told that the stationary hand reflected an AI system’s prediction of their decision, whereas those in the control group were told the clock position was random. Participants in the deception group selected right now more often than those in the control group, indicating that W reports can be easily biased and may not correspond to a distinct introspective event. This effect was strongest when the bias was small (75 ms) and positive (i.e., when the clock hand appeared slightly later than the participants’ “veridical” W estimate), which we interpret as a symptom of shortcomings of the clock method in general. Overall, our findings suggest that participants can adopt deceptively biased cues, supporting the interpretation that W times are, at least in part, inferred judgments rather than direct readouts of conscious intention.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly strong claims about\ntheir human-level linguistic competence and, by extension, their relevance for understanding natural\nlanguage and cognition. While a growing interdisciplinary literature has used behavioural tests and\npsychometric tools to assess LLM performance, particularly in linguistics, such comparisons raise\nsubstantial conceptual and methodological concerns. This paper examines what current semantic\nlimitations in LLMs reveal about the nature of meaning in natural language. Drawing on empirical\nfindings from psycholinguistics, the analysis shows that, despite fluent surface-level performance,\nLLMs systematically lack core aspects of semantic competence, including real-world grounding,\ncommunicative intent, and stable grammatical judgment. These limitations are then situated within\nbroader theoretical frameworks from the philosophy of cognitive science, focusing on Miracchi’s\nreformulation of the Frame Problem and the Relevance Realisation framework. Together, these\napproaches highlight the central role of embodied agency, environmental embeddedness, and socio-\ncultural context in human meaning-making, and clarify why current computational architectures\nstruggle with semantic relevance. The paper concludes by arguing for a bio-cultural conception of\nlanguage, suggesting that the semantic gaps observed in LLMs are not merely technical\nshortcomings but rather reflect fundamental differences between algorithmic systems and human linguistic\ncognition.",

However, it has also been suggested that not everyone experiences equivalent benefits of engaging with gratitude activities, and there have been calls to better understand the moderators of such effects. In Study 1, we explored the effects of writing a gratitude letter, relative to a neutral letter, on changes in positive and negative affect, and observed that the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect was exacerbated in participants with elevated life satisfaction. Study 2 sought to replicate the findings of Study 1 whilst minimising demand characteristics, but failed to observe the moderating effect of life satisfaction. In Study 3, we sought to investigate whether these mixed findings could be explained by demand characteristics. We observed that priming participants with information about the benefits of expressing gratitude ameliorated the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect, but life satisfaction did not moderate this priming effect. On the basis of the findings from these three studies, we conclude that life satisfaction does not moderate the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect, but further work should be undertaken to better understand the conditions under which gratitude writing is most effective. Further, we suggest that demand characteristics are an important consideration for both researchers and interventionists delivering gratitude interventions.",

Results revealed that the intrapersonal dimension of personality functioning—reflecting difficulties in self-perception and self-regulation—was the most central factor, strongly associated with neurotic narcissism, gelotophobia, and hostile attributions, particularly in ambiguous relational contexts. Bridging nodes included hostile attributions in relational situations with different levels of in ambiguity, gelotophobia, and both neurotic and antagonistic narcissism, highlighting the interconnected nature of cognitive biases and maladaptive personality traits.

In an online cross-sectional study, recreational drug users (N= 649) were asked about sociodemographic data and their consumption behavior, with a particular focus on polysubstance use. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify different types of polysubstance users. The clusters obtained were then tested for diversity using chi-square tests. The cluster analysis revealed three polysubstance use groups that differed in the frequency of mixed use, underlying motivations, and the presence of risk-minimizing strategies. The study showed that consumers who use multiple substances do not constitute a homogeneous group and differ in various characteristics. Taking these individualities and diversities into account must serve as the basis for health promotion to address consumers in a targeted manner.",

          "abstract": "Long-term planning in complex uncertain environments is computationally demanding and can significantly exceed an agent's information processing capacities. Hierarchical planning offers an elegant solution by dividing problems up and conquering them through distributing computation across state spaces and time. However, hierarchical representational abstraction comes at a cost—it can discard information necessary for optimal decisions, reflecting a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality. We formalized the adaptive meta-control of this trade-off using a meta-decision-making framework. Applied to a novel navigation task, our model predicts the circumstances under which the benefits of hierarchical planning outweigh the costs. We confirmed our predictions by means of two preregistered human experiments: participants adaptively shifted toward hierarchical planning when (1) the task space was larger, (2) the task horizon was longer, (3) available computational resources were limited, and (4) the environment contained uncertainty. This adaptive adjustment of planning strategy was manifest not only in initial planning choices, but also in the temporal distribution of computations, evidenced by reduced decision quality and longer reaction times at subtask boundaries. The adjustment was accurately captured by our meta-decision-making model. Our findings indicate how humans dynamically adapt their planning strategies in response to environmental demands, uncovering the resource-rational principles governing adaptive hierarchical abstraction in human planning.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive evidence on the detrimental effects of despotic leadership, less is known about when and why employees might respond with constructive, relationally motivated behaviors. Integrating Conservation of Resources (COR) theory with emerging views on affiliative coping, we theorize that despotic leadership may paradoxically elicit prosocial behavior by triggering communion striving, a relational goal orientation aimed at restoring belonging and interpersonal safety. Importantly, we argue that this indirect pathway is contingent upon job insecurity, which heightens the perceived threat of resource loss and intensifies affiliative motivation. Across a three-wave field study of 495 employees in China. We found support for a moderated mediation model: despotic leadership indirectly increases prosocial behavior via communion striving, with this effect amplified under high job insecurity. These findings challenge the unidimensional view of toxic leadership as purely destructive and illuminate the strategic, context-sensitive ways employees cope under threat. Implications for leadership theory, motivation science, and workplace well-being are discussed.",

Data were analysed together using reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were identified that described what is important for Autistic young people’s QoL: (1) I need others to understand me and \"accept me for who I am\"; (2) Connecting deeply with others is \"integral to my happiness\"; (3) Through my strengths and passions,  \"I feel a sense of achievement\" and I develop self-worth; (4) Having agency to navigate my environments \"in ways that work for me\" helps me manage my own needs; (5) When \"people ask me what I want to do, and they listen\", I feel valued and empowered. This study adds to the literature regarding the conceptualisation of QoL for Autistic young people, by eliciting directly the views of Autistic young people.

          "abstract": "Background. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) offers a promising dimensional framework to understand psychopathology, but its developmental applicability and the placement of eating disorders (EDs) within it remain unclear. This study aimed to map the hierarchical structure of youth psychopathology, with a specific focus on EDs, across late childhood into early adolescence. \nMethods. We used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, to conduct exploratory (BassAckward) and confirmatory factor analyses on symptoms of 13 mental disorders at ages 9-10 (baseline; N=11,867), 11-12 (2-year; N=10,972), and 13-14 (4-year; N=8,355). We examined the hierarchical factor structure and tested for sex invariance at each timepoint.\nResults. A higher-order structure with Internalizing and Externalizing factors was identified across timepoints. However, the lower-order structure showed developmental differences. EDs consistently emerged as a distinct lower-order factor nested within the Internalizing spectrum. The phenotypic association between ED and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) factors was notable (r ≈ .45–.50). While some specific factors such as oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and OCD were identified, the composition of anxiety-related factors changed across timepoints. Notably, the derived factor structures demonstrated measurement invariance across biological sex at each timepoint.\nConclusion. Our findings support a developmentally sensitive HiTOP model in youth, where ED constituts an Internalizing subfactor by late childhood, with stronger symptom associations in early adolescence. The hierarchical approach captured both stability and meaningful developmental differences, underscoring the importance of integrating a developmental perspective into structural models of psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a statistical method that allows researchers to quantify how well the hypothesized factorial structure of a psychological measure fits the associated data. Fit indices are statistical measures that evaluate the factorial structure by quantifying the degree of model/data fit or misspecification. Researchers generally use traditional or fixed cutoff values of fit indices to judge the appropriateness of their CFA models. However, many authors have discussed the limitations of using these cutoffs, given that they cannot be generalized to all models. Recently, McNeish and Wolf (2023) developed the Dynamic Fit Index (DFI) approach, which generates cutoff values of fit indices that are tailored to the characteristics of a specific model. In this tutorial, a CFA of the Attainment of School Achievement Goal Scale (A-SAGS) was conducted using the lavaan package in R. Next, cutoff values for the fit indices were generated using the dynamic package in R. The model fit of the A-SAGS was mostly satisfactory when interpretations were based on fixed cutoff values. However, the hypothesized model did not reach the dynamic cutoff values, prompting a more thorough investigation into the possible sources of model misspecification. The DFI approach is easily implemented, highly promising, and offers researchers valuable insights as they attempt to improve the construct validity of a given psychological measure.",

Although behavioural and self-report trait measures of curiosity have rarely been assessed within the same study, recent years have seen the beginning of such an endeavour, and this integration could permit cross-pollination of ideas and hypotheses for future research. After providing a brief review of behavioral and self-report measures of curiosity, I summarise how current evidence supports only mild overlap between the two measurement methods, with positive relations depending on the particular task measure and particular facet of trait curiosity chosen. Divergence between task and trait measures could suggest different cognitive/emotional mechanisms supporting the need to know. Employing multiple personality trait measures with behavioural tasks can help to gain an understanding of the boundaries, inconsistencies, and similarities between different measurements of curiosity.",

A failure to embrace open science practices may lead to concerns about the trustworthiness and reliability of its research outputs. This study explored the current use of open science practices among BA researchers, focusing on the adoption, underlying motivations, concerns, and support needs across seven specific open science practices.\nMethods: We distributed an exploratory survey through professional networks, conferences, and social media and received a final N = 83 (early career researcher (ECRs) N= 41). The survey covered six domains: general use, frequency, importance, engagement, concerns, and support needs related to open science practices.\nResults: Most respondents reported positive attitudes toward open science, with preregistration (75% of total N) and data sharing (65% of total N) as the most commonly used practices. Descriptively, ECRs placed greater importance on these practices than their established counterparts, suggesting a potential generational shift. ECRs primarily reported concerns about insufficient knowledge and fear of errors, while established researchers emphasized workload and a lack of incentives. Both groups highlighted the need for increased time, resources, institutional support, and training.\nDiscussion: Although our findings are descriptive and limited by self-selection and sample bias, they offer initial insights into how open science is perceived and practised in the field.

          "abstract": "People spend up to half of their waking life spontaneously wandering alone through a vast landscape of thought, recalling past experiences and recombining them to peer into an uncertain future. These spontaneous thoughts are not merely breaks from our otherwise goal-oriented lives. Instead, they may serve important functions. Here, we focus on the function thoughts may play in people’s emotional lives. We test whether expansive thought dynamics, in which thoughts move broadly across conceptual space, support emotional change. Across two studies, we measured if stable or state-dependent expansive dynamics predict how well an individual will recover from a negative mood. Participants in Study 1 (N = 759) underwent a negative or positive mood induction via memory-recall and then verbalized their spontaneous thoughts for 10 minutes. Participants in Study 2 (N = 233) verbalized their spontaneous thoughts for 5 minutes on 21 consecutive days, with an average of 4 days preceded by a negative mood induction. To quantify the expansiveness of thought streams, we computed four complementary measures that characterize how thoughts relate to one another and unfold over time: structural expansiveness, novelty, divergence in subsequent thought similarity, and momentum away from the recalled memory. Results revealed that more expansive thought dynamics predicted greater improvements in emotion, specifically when people were in negative emotional states. Expansive thought dynamics were associated with more frequent transitions into, and greater persistence within, emotionally neutral states. Together, these findings suggest that expansiveness operates as a homeostatic mechanism, helping people return toward their emotional equilibrium.",

In this article, we examine how open science practices can help address these disparities by improving transparency, accessibility, and \ncollaboration in basic and translational research involving multilingual populations. We discuss the barriers faced by early-career researchers working in this area and describe how openly available resources can address these challenges while facilitating replication, innovation, and cross-study comparisons. By improving access to data from historically underrepresented linguistic communities, innovative analytic procedures, and multilingual assessment tools, open science enables more accurate identification of language disorders, earlier intervention, and more equitable academic outcomes for bilingual and multilingual children.",

Person-oriented approaches allow analysis of heterogeneous profiles of learners. The purpose of the proposed work is to (a) describe latent profiles of language and literacy skills in Spanish-English bilinguals and (b) determine how age and educational context predict profile membership.\nMethod: We administered assessments of English decoding and semantics (Assessment-to-Instruction; A2i, Connor et al., 2022) as well as parallel experimental assessments of Spanish decoding and semantics (Authors, 2021) to 855 Spanish-English bilingual children in PreK to second grade. A multilevel LPA model was fit with differing numbers of latent classes. The fits of the models were compared using information criteria and approximate likelihood ratio tests to determine the optimal number of latent classes.\nResults: The LRM-LRT and VLMR-LRT indicated that, for kindergarten and first grade, a 3-class model was optimal. Classes seem to be ordered in their means, with Class 1 having the lowest means, Class 2 having slightly higher means in at least one language, and Class 3 having the highest means. For 2nd grade, a 5-class model with more differentiation between high and low performers was the best fit.\nConclusion: Bilingual children’s English and Spanish skills developed primarily in tandem, suggesting cross-linguistic sharing of knowledge across domains. Educational context was related to skills in both languages, with children in dual language education tending to cluster into higher-performing profiles.",

To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted two complementary studies. Study 1 tested whether engaging in a game, compared with a non-game interaction, influences how same-sex strangers perceive each other’s value and relational closeness across repeated encounters. Although both constructs changed over time, gaming did not produce stronger or faster shifts than the comparison activity. Study 2 used an agent-based evolutionary model to explore the conditions under which gaming could spread in a population as a tactic for ally selection. The simulations indicated that gaming is favored when players possess above-average skill and when environmental risk coevolves with population skill; otherwise, gaming tends to drift or disappear. Together, these studies suggest that the social effects of gaming are context-dependent and may not emerge uniformly across game types or interaction settings. The modeling results highlight that risk, skill, and reliability of performance cues are key parameters for understanding the potential evolutionary role of gaming in alliance formation. Future work should integrate long-term interactions, participants’ skill levels, and different game ecologies to clarify when gaming strengthens social bonds and when it does not.",

          "abstract": "Gender minority stress theory is the premier theoretical framework for understanding the health and well-being of transgender and non-binary people. However, a theoretical disconnect exists within this field: the Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Measure (GMSRM), widely used to assess gender minority stress, is rooted in latent variable theory, assuming that different stressors (represented as items on the GMSRM) are statistically unrelated, once their given latent variable is accounted for. However, gender minority stress theory proposes that these stressors cause one another, specifically, that distal stressors cause proximal stressors. To address this inconsistency between theory and measurement, we interrogated the assumptions of latent variable models and considered a relatively new measurement framework psychometric network analysis. Our analysis of GMSRM data from 1006 trans* individuals revealed that the GMSRM is better represented by a psychometric network, rather than multiple latent variables, uncovering complex, direct associations among items across its subscales. These findings highlight the need to align measurement approaches with theoretical assumptions to better understand how social stressors impact transgender and non-binary populations.",

Data from the National Couples’ Health and Time Study (NCHAT) found differences in coping patterns by sexual orientation, which may have implications for health disparities. The current analyses expand upon these findings to examine immune correlates of coping in a subset of 653 NCHAT participants in the Stress Biology sub-study (NCHAT-BIO). Assays for inflammatory markers [interleukin(IL)-6, C-reactive protein(CRP)] and cellular immune function (Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels) were conducted. Group differences were observed in positive coping, with gay/lesbian respondents reporting the highest levels, followed by plurisexual and heterosexual respondents. Differences in negative coping were also observed, with the highest levels among plurisexual respondents, followed by gay/lesbian and heterosexual respondents. Controlling for age, BMI, sex, and health conditions, negative coping was associated with higher CRP with no moderating effects by sexual orientation. These data provide novel evidence linking greater negative coping with inflammation, per higher CRP, with similar magnitude of association regardless of sexual orientation. Although no significant group differences in inflammatory markers were observed in relation to sexual orientation within this sample, greater negative coping among sexual minority adults could contribute to such effects at the population level. Improving coping via intervention has the potential to benefit not only psychological well-being, but also physiological functioning, particularly among individuals with greater negative coping patterns.",

          "abstract": "Music listening induces a pleasurable urge to move, termed groove, which the active inference framework explains as a motivation for bodily movement that emerges to refine beat and metrical predictions under rhythmic uncertainty. If this is the case, does bodily movement modulate the groove sensation? We asked 42 participants to rate urge-to-move and pleasure after withholding movement or tapping on the onbeat or offbeat within a four-beat meter while listening to melodies with three degrees of syncopation. At the low degree of syncopation, urge-to-move and pleasure ratings were higher in both the onbeat and offbeat tapping conditions compared with the no-tapping condition. Furthermore, relative to the offbeat and no-tapping conditions, onbeat tapping increased groove-related ratings by enhancing neural and behavioral entrainment to the beat, as reflected in the steady-state evoked potentials in electroencephalography and intertap interval variability, respectively. These findings support the active inference account, which posits that bodily movement enhances groove sensation by refining beat and meter predictions.",

Participants read 40 bisyllabic French words selected to maximise vowel-duration contrasts. Vowel durations were extracted using an automatic alignment tool and manually verified. A linear mixed-effects model assessed group differences in word-level PVI while adjusting for demographic and linguistic covariates. Prevalence estimates were based on a clinical cohort of 52 patients. The model showed significant effects of Group and Age. Participants with AOS produced lower word-level PVI values than both CTRL and non-AOS patients. Age was positively associated with PVI. The estimated prevalence of AOS among patients with acute left-hemispheric stroke was 15%. The findings indicate that the word-level PVI captures reduced durational contrast in French-speaking patients with post-stroke AOS. These results support research on the PVI as a complementary acoustic measure in early post-stroke assessment.",

          "abstract": "Infants learn language through their linguistic experiences, but most of this research has focused on what infants hear from adult caregivers. However, children do not exclusively interact with adults. In the US and around the world, children spend time with other children, and hear speech from these other children. Child-produced speech shares properties with infant-directed speech produced by adults (higher in pitch and slower in duration), and research suggests that infants preferentially attend to adult-produced infant-directed speech. We tested whether 9-14-month-old infants with and without older siblings prefer to listen to male and female adult infant-directed-speech or male and female child-produced speech. Results suggest that infants, regardless of prior experience, attend to child-produced speech, and that infants also attend similarly to male and female adult-produced speech. Results are discussed as they relate to the types of speech we should consider in our theories of language development.",

          "abstract": "According to PIAAC studies, a significant proportion of adults in Poland demonstrate low literacy skills, yet no accessible, standardized tool exists to diagnose these deficits. To address this gap, we developed CZYTEST, an online, self-administered assessment of functional reading comprehension tailored to the lower end of the adult literacy spectrum. We describe the test’s theoretical framework, item construction, and psychometric validation based on a representative sample of Polish adults (N = 400). The assessment utilizes functional texts (e.g., medical leaflets, job ads) with items tackling comprehension and was calibrated using a two-parameter logistic (2PL) Item Response Theory (IRT) model. Results confirmed the tool’s unidimensionality and high reliability (α = .88). Using Gaussian mixture modeling and external criteria (e.g., self-reported reading difficulties), we established empirically derived cutoff scores that effectively distinguish struggling readers from those with functional proficiency. Findings demonstrate that reliable, unproctored online assessment of low-literacy adults is feasible using ungoogleable items. CZYTEST provides a scalable, ecologically valid solution for identifying functional illiteracy in research and practice.",

          "abstract": "Determining the grounds for moral status attributions is important for policy-making, especially regarding animal welfare and AI regulation. We tested the common claim that consciousness is key for such attributions. Across 1,493 respondents (793 confirmatory sample), we surveyed whether consciousness is considered necessary and/or sufficient for moral status, and whether its contribution can be distinguished from valence and cognition. We triangulated moral dilemmas, attribution questions, and direct questions about the relationship between consciousness and moral status. Contrary to many theoretical accounts, although moral status was strongly associated with consciousness attributions, consciousness was not perceived as either necessary or sufficient for moral consideration. Instead, our findings suggest that shifting the focus to the relative contribution of consciousness to moral status might be more beneficial. Integrating these insights into current discussions is important for fostering decision-making processes that are transparent, democratic, and mindful of the plurality of public attitudes.",

          "authors": "Maximilian Fascher; Krysztof Krasowski; Markus Muehlhan",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Neural drug cue reactivity (DCR) is a central paradigm in addiction neuroscience for probing how drug cues acquire excessive motivational salience in substance use disorders (SUDs). However, the field faces challenges in clinical translation, replicability, and within-group designs are susceptible to visual confounding due to stimulus matching. A complementary approach is to examine case-control contrasts to identify SUD-specific neural architecture while mitigating effects of task-design variability. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify convergence effects in the contrast drug &gt; control cues between SUD and control groups. ALE results were supplemented by assessing behavioural domains, meta-analytic connectivity profiles, robustness to publication bias, and study-level modulators using penalised logistic regression. Results: The ALE analysis revealed one reliable convergence cluster in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), associated with reward, reasoning, and social cognition. Penalised logistic regression indicated that contributions to this cluster were less likely in alcohol DCR studies and were sensitive to matching conditions for human content. vACC DCR effects contrasted with neutral control cues were invariant across abstinence periods, whereas DCR contrasted with natural reward cues declined with longer abstinence. Conclusion: This meta-analysis replicates context-sensitive SUD-specific DCR convergence in vACC regions intersecting reward pathways and the default-mode network yet limited support for striatal centredness. The review recapitulates these results by discussing current challenges in balancing personalisation and standardisation, the use of motivationally inert versus salient comparators, and argues for careful deliberation when inferring evidence for hyperreactive reward responses.",

Although participants are instructed to imagine the visual and kinesthetic sensations associated with the movements, they may verbally rehearse the instructions rather than generating an imagery, manipulating it according to the instructions, maintaining it, and subsequently inspecting it. To examine the involvement of action imagery and verbal rehearsal, participants completed the Final Position Judgement Task once in a baseline condition and once under articulatory suppression in a within-subjects design. The involvement of action imagery and verbal rehearsal was evaluated based on self-reported strategy use, associations with working memory components and behavioral measures of action imagery ability, as well as task performance. Accuracy in final position judgements was related to visuospatial sketchpad capacity but unrelated to phonological loop capacity. Most participants relied on visual rehearsal, whereas verbal rehearsal served a supporting role but did not benefit performance in final position judgements. Articulatory suppression appeared to impair action imagery rather than enhancing its use. Together, these findings support the use of the Final Position Judgement Task as an objective measure of action imagery ability, provided open-source alongside the manuscript.",

However, these methods are not always feasible to use and have their own share of problems. In the current study, we systematically investigated how the choice of response scale for subjective reports affects the validity and reliability of participants’ responses. We designed a computer task in which we manipulated the degree of objective control that participants had across trials. Participants reported their experienced sense of control after each trial. Across five experiments, we compared responses on five scales: a linear visual analogue scale (VAS), a percentage VAS, a 7-point Likert, a 4-point Likert, and a binary scale. In two additional experiments, we compared the directionality of the linear scale. The results were remarkably similar for all except the binary scale: participants demonstrated the tendency to underestimate their level of control, especially for intermediate levels of objective control, and the between-block reliability of responses indicated a very high level of reliability. In addition, we propose that our task can be used as a measure of individual differences and developed metrics that can be extracted from participants’ responses. Our findings demonstrate that contrary to the dominant opinion, explicit reports are characterized by high reliability, and we provide practical recommendations for the choice of a scale for measuring sense of control.",

A total of 211 participants completed the CDQ, with 111 of them also completing the Formal Characteristics of Behaviour – Temperament Questionnaire, Revised Version. Analyses included statistical methods, artificial neural networks, and cluster analysis. Character profiles were consistent with CTC's theoretical assumptions. Most CDQ scales showed good reliability (α &gt; 0.7), except for endodynamism (α = 0.561). Analysis supported accurate prediction of dynamism levels based on character profiles. However, results related to age were inconsistent. Temperament correlated with dynamism only partially and with low to moderate strength. The findings support CTC's assumptions, distinguish it from temperament traits, and indicate that the CDQ is a generally reliable tool. Further refinement of the endodynamism scale and investigation into the link between dynamism and age are needed.",

To address this gap, we analyzed 77 in-depth interviews with cash transfer recipients and their household members in rural Malawi and Lesotho. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we created four themes: 1) cash transfers help address basic needs but are not enough for structural change, 2) grandmothers share cash transfers within intergenerational networks of care, 3) cash transfers bring psychological relief and restore dignity, but difficulty and uncertainty in obtaining them create stress, and 4) stigma and jealousy arise from community perceptions about the deservingness of ‘sky-falling’ and ‘satanic’ money. Recipients consistently noted improvement in food security, while effects on mental health and social relationships were more mixed. We argue that recipient-centered reports complement and strengthen quantitative evidence about the impacts and mechanisms of cash transfers. We discuss specific policy recommendations, such as larger and more predictable payments, better communication, and sensitive disbursement options, gender-sensitive support, and more active monitoring of psychosocial and community effects in order to mitigate potential negative impacts. Finally, we argue there is a need for a more ambitious focus on development as the key path to poverty eradication.",

Previous research has mainly focused on procrastination in specific situations and has rarely examined stability and change in procrastination over long periods of time. In the present study, we conducted an 18-year longitudinal study of procrastination. We report on stability and change in procrastination as well as its associations with conscientiousness and neuroticism, and long-term correlates using self-reports starting from high school graduation, in a large sample of young adults (N = 3,023) in Germany. We found that procrastination was slightly less stable than the Big Five, tended to decrease with age, and that higher procrastination was associated with delayed entry into the workforce. Procrastination overlapped with but was distinct from conscientiousness and neuroticism. We also found strong links between changes in procrastination and changes in conscientiousness and neuroticism over time. Finally, both initial levels and trajectories of procrastination predicted consequential long-term correlates up to 18 years after the first measurement, including academic, workplace, relationship, health, and pandemic-related outcomes. In sum, this long-term longitudinal examination of procrastination highlights patterns of stability and change in procrastination and demonstrates its relevance for important life outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Coherent speech remains focused on the topic at hand, avoiding irrelevant or tangential comments. Discourse coherence often declines with age and this has been linked to declines in cognitive control processes that regulate activation of knowledge and ideas. The present study tested whether external topic reminders could improve coherence by reducing reliance on internal control processes.\nMethods: 77 young and older adults produced spoken discourse in response to topic prompts. In the baseline condition, the topic prompt was removed when the participant began speaking. This was compared with conditions where a reminder was presented on screen, either throughout their response or only during the last 30 seconds.\nResults: Both age groups produced more coherent, topic-focused responses when they had access to a topic reminder. Late reminders had an additional proactive impact on participants’ speech, increasing its coherence even before the reminder appeared. This proactive effect was short-lived in the older group but more sustained in the young group.\nDiscussion: When speaking, people must maintain the current discourse goal (i.e., intended topic), in order to prioritise relevant information and inhibit irrelevant ideas. Topic reminders boost activation of the discourse goal, reducing the need to maintain this through internal control. Furthermore, people proactively strengthened goal activation when they anticipated a later reminder, but older people were less effective at maintaining this throughout their response. Together, these results suggest that internal maintenance of discourse goals is less effective in older people, though they do benefit from external cues that support topic maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Shape processing is crucial for higher-level visual functions such as object recognition. Yet, isolating high-level vision from low-level shape influences remains challenging. Typically, studies rely on simple, symmetric stimuli and labor-intensive psychophysical measurements to control for perceptual shape similarity. However, natural objects are often asymmetric, and researchers currently lack efficient methods or validated stimulus sets for these complex shapes. Here, we present an image-based method that autonomously generates perceptually uniform shape sets composed of novel, asymmetric, animal-like shapes. We focus on circular shape spaces, where the angular distance between two shapes corresponds to their perceived similarity. Our method employs a search for circular arrangements of shapes that maximize perceptual uniformity according to ShapeComp, an image-computable shape similarity metric based on 100+ descriptors that is highly predictive of human shape similarity for naturalistic shapes. Through multi-arrangement experiments, we validated that our method produces circular shape sets that align with human similarity judgments. By comparison, uniform and circular shape sets according to alternative shape spaces (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks or Radial Frequency patterns), but not according to ShapeComp, were not necessarily perceived as uniform and circular. We provide five newly validated circular shape sets derived from intricate naturalistic shapes, along with MATLAB code facilitating the generation of an unlimited number of sets that can be tailored to experimental needs beyond circular configurations. By offering efficiency and adaptability, our method allows to systematically explore higher-level influences on object perception while minimizing the time and resources required to construct controlled, complex shape stimuli.",

This relation is in contrast with the view that both statistical power and reliability depend similarly on the measurement error. In this view, robust but unreliable phenomena can be considered as a reliability paradox. The mathematical relation and possible independence of statistical power and reliability have been discussed in the statistical literature for decades. A common misconception related to the relationship between statistical power and reliability is that absolute reliability (measurement error) is often confounded with relative reliability (ratio of the true score variance and the total score variance). The present work reviews and discusses how measurement error and individual differences influence the relative reliability and robustness of a phenomenon. It discusses why relative reliability and robustness are partly related and why they are generally independent. Following these considerations, it is summarized how measurement error and group heterogeneity can be potentially manipulated to optimize for the reliability and robustness of a measured phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "People who view food-wasting behaviour as immoral tend to waste less. This observation raises the question of whether appealing to moral values can shift how individuals think about food waste and how willing they are to address it. The present preregistered experiment (N = 1006) tested this possibility by examining whether persuasive video messages grounded in the Morality-as-Cooperation framework influence psychological responses to food waste. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of seven value-based appeals: highlighting Family, Group, Reciprocity, Heroism, Deference, Fairness, or Property concerns; or one of two control conditions. Each moral message was presented in both positive and negative framing and delivered by one of two actors.\nOutcomes included judgments of the wrongness of food wasting, intentions to reduce waste, support for policy measures, and willingness to learn more or engage in related actions. Preregistered analyses showed no overall effects of the moral messages. However, mediation analyses showed a consistent pattern of opposing effects. Across outcomes, moral appeals were associated with lower perceived message relevance, which in turn predicted weaker moral concern, policy support, and behavioural intentions. At the same time, when controlling for perceived relevance, several moral messages—particularly those grounded in Family, Deference, Heroism, and Property concerns—exerted positive direct effects on outcomes.\nOverall, the findings show that moral appeals in food waste communication can be a double-edged sword. Moral messages have the potential to motivate stronger responses, but only when people find them personally relevant. When they do not, the same appeals may undermine their own effectiveness. This emphasizes perceived relevance as a key ingredient in successful moral communication about food waste.",

Unstructured interviews that adopted a narrative inquiry approach were conducted either in person or on online, and audio recorded then transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a combination of thematic and framework analysis. Young people with relevant lived experience consulted on the implementation of the research and recruitment, and peer researchers contributed data collection and data analysis. \n\nResults: Participants engaged with unstructured narrative inquiry interviews, often anchoring their experiences either in their schooling, or in a series of adverse childhood events. Three overarching themes were extracted from the data; the impact of connection, (in)validation, proactively coping and preventive opportunities. These themes highlighted the variation in health literacy and how mental health experiences are understood, as well as whether existing services were experienced as accessible and helpful. Participants were proactive with adopting coping mechanisms in the absence of support and identified times of transition as providing an opportunity for improved support. \n\nDiscussion: There are implications for policy and practice in how mental health is talked about and recognised amongst young people. It is important that young people are empowered to talk about their experiences, and that attempts to seek help or access care are not met with invalidation. Times of transition (particularly around schooling) are opportunities where support could be better offered in a preventative way. \n\nStrengths \n-\tLarge diverse set of lived experience data \n-\tYouth-led involvement strategy for implementing the research programme\n-\tInclusive and intersectional approach \n-\tOpen methodology that enabled participants to set agenda\n\nLimitations \n-\tAbility to represent large diverse data set within existing analytic frameworks\n-\tUnstructured narrative interview methods potentially challenging for some neurodivergent people and those with communication needs.",

To prevent avoidable harm to patients, including adverse effects and withdrawal effects, it is important to understand potential overprescribing of antidepressants. This study aims to explore how primary care prescribers rationalise antidepressant prescribing and deprescribing decisions, and which contextual factors influence these decisions. \nMethod\nWe interviewed 16 primary care professionals, general practitioners (GPs) and mental health practitioners, across England. Semi-structured interviews consisted of discussing prescribing and deprescribing vignettes, followed by questions exploring participants approaches to antidepressant decision making. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. \nResults\nFour main themes emerged around antidepressant medicines optimisation: patient characteristics, illness factors, prescriber characteristics, and healthcare service factors. Patient characteristics encompassed aspects of the patient, their life and ideas that could contribute to prescribing choices. Illness factors included consideration of depression symptoms, associated symptom risks and previous treatment experiences. Prescriber characteristics involved expertise, guideline adherence, risk aversion and decision fatigue arising from prescribing. Healthcare service factors captured constraints of the services format and availability of alternative treatments.\nConclusion\nOur findings suggest that prescribing decisions are impacted by a combination of psychosocial and environmental factors. Decision biases like risk aversion and decision fatigue can also impact prescribing practice. Health service constraints were perceived as limiting decision freedom through misaligned demand for and availability of non-pharmacological treatments, and insufficient decision support for deprescribing.

          "abstract": "Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) frequently encounter significant barriers to seeking treatment, with these obstacles often greater for cisgender women and transgender individuals. Negative consequences of AUD are particularly severe in these groups, yet research on their specific treatment barriers is lacking. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the Barriers to AUD Treatment Questionnaire (BAT-Q) and  exploratorily examine differences in reported barriers among 112 cisgender men, 154 cisgender women, and 98 transgender individuals who had considered AUD treatment in the past five years. Exploratory factor analysis identified seven reliable domains of barriers: social stigma, comorbid problems and negative care experiences, limited care accessibility, fear of limited inclusivity and discrimination, limited social support, socioeconomic constraints, and negative expectations of care. While comparisons among groups yielded preliminary insights these findings should be interpreted with caution, as confirmatory factor analysis have not yet been conducted. However, transgender individuals reported higher barriers than both cisgender men and women across all domains except socioeconomic constraints. Both cisgender women and transgender individuals experienced greater stigma-related barriers than cisgender men. Higher alcohol and drug use severity predicted greater overall treatment barriers in all groups. Notably, poorer perceived socioeconomic status and low social support were more strongly associated with barriers among women than among cisgender men or transgender individuals. These findings underscore the need for gender-affirming and accessible AUD services. The BAT-Q provides a promising new tool for identifying and addressing specific barriers to treatment, although further validation of its structure is warranted to strengthen the interpretation of group differences.",

          "abstract": "We investigated the timing of turn-taking in matched autistic compared to non-autistic pairs of adult speakers. Turn-taking—the organisation of who speaks when—is the fundamental mechanism of communicative interaction, and has been found to be remarkably fast and robust across different groups of speakers. We build on the only previous study of turn-timing in conversations between autistic adults, while also conducting the first within-speaker comparison of turn-timing across different conversational contexts. We recorded 18 autistic and 28 non-autistic speakers in matched dyads, conversing in three sequential conversational contexts. We analysed 10,251 turn transitions using the measure of Floor Transfer Offset (comprising silent and overlapping transitions). Bayesian inferential modelling was used for statistical analysis. Our results show longer silent gaps 1) in autistic speaker pairs and 2) in the task-based conversational context. The finding of longer silent gaps in autism does not align with the only previous study on conversations between autistic adults. We discuss the importance of investigating naturalistic, face-to-face interaction and question the idea that there is a single, fixed target for conversational turn-timing. We argue that speaker pairs skilfully adjust their turn-taking rhythm to match both interpersonal and situational factors.",

          "authors": "Eren Gunseli",
          "abstract": "Adaptive cognition requires determining when previously stored information must be re-engaged to guide behavior. Prevailing accounts of working memory and cognitive control propose that contextual change cues the retrieval or reactivation of relevant information, reinstating stored representations into working memory when the task model changes. Here, I show that reactivation depends not on change per se, but on the stability of the change. In an EEG experiment, participants performed visual memory tasks using repeatedly presented items. The task rule was either repeating or consistently varying across trials. While contralateral delay activity (CDA) declined with memory repetition, reflecting reduced working memory engagement, this reduction was unaffected by whether the task rule consistently changed or repeated. Thus, when variability itself was consistent, it was learned as a stable context, no longer prompting reactivation. Reactivation, therefore, is not triggered by change itself but by the failure of contextual stability, revealing that consistent variability is learned as a stable context.",

          "authors": "Edoardo Saija; Susanna Pallini",
          "abstract": "Cultural and educational contexts, particularly within positive psychology, have traditionally conceptualized happiness in terms of well-being, emphasizing the pursuit of positive affect through the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of negative affect. This orientation risks pathologizing normative emotions such as sadness, implicitly discouraging their expression. A paradigm shift may therefore be warranted in which psychological health is defined not by the predominance of positive emotions, but by emotional flexibility, the capacity to experience, regulate, and integrate a full range of emotions in accordance with situational demands.\nWithin this framework, sadness is conceptualized along two distinct dimensions: state sadness, a context-dependent and transient response that mobilizes adaptive processes supporting reflection, attachment-related signaling, and socio-emotional learning; dispositional sadness, a stable temperamental propensity characterized by pervasive dejection, diminished affective recovery, and reduced contextual sensitivity. While state sadness is functionally embedded within the attachment system and facilitates proximity-seeking and relational repair following loss or separation, dispositional sadness represents an inflexible emotional style associated with increased vulnerability to internalizing psychopathology. Recognizing sadness as a potentially adaptive and developmentally salient emotion, rather than as a priori evidence of dysfunction, has important implications for clinical practice and caregiving contexts, helping to mitigate the premature medicalization of emotional suffering.",

          "abstract": "Background Parent-implemented interventions (PIIs) are well established for improving developmental outcomes in autistic children. As evidence for overall efficacy has accumulated, the field has increasingly shifted toward understanding for whom, and through which delivery formats PIIs are most effective. These questions are pressing in non-Western contexts, where access to professional services is limited, culturally appropriate interventions are needed. This RCT, one of the largest of its kind in China, addressed this gap by comparing two scalable delivery formats of a culturally adapted social communication program (speech-language therapist (SLT)-led online groups vs. flexible Self-study format) and examining differential intervention responses and sustained engagement.\n\nMethods A total of 112 Chinese-speaking autistic children aged 24–60 months with limited spontaneous expressive language were randomized to a 20-week SLT-led or Self-study intervention. Autism severity, social functioning, and communication skills were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 12 months after baseline. Parental stress, competence, and strategy use were also measured. Child, parent, and family characteristics predicting differential outcomes and engagement were examined. \n\nResults Both formats improved children’s expressive and receptive language and enhanced parental self-efficacy while reducing stress. Individualized analyses indicated greater benefits of the SLT-led format for children from lower-income families and those with greater developmental needs, whereas families with stronger baseline functioning showed comparable gains in the Self-study format. Attrition was higher in the Self-study format and was associated with lower child engagement and reduced parental capacity for independent implementation.\n\nLimitations The study was powered primarily to detect within-format effects, which may have limited sensitivity to identify subtle between-format differences. Parental strategy use was measured using a general interaction coding scheme rather than intervention-specific behaviors. Higher attrition in the Self-study format warrants cautious interpretation, although sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of findings.\n\nConclusions: This study provides evidence for a culturally grounded PII that improves developmental outcomes in autistic preschoolers while enhancing parental self-efficacy and reducing stress. While both formats were effective, SLT-led support appeared particularly beneficial for families with greater needs, whereas the Self-study format was better suited to families with stronger baseline capacity, underscoring the importance of tailoring intervention formats to family characteristics.",

This study examined whether young carers have poorer mental health than peers and explored inequalities by gender, ethnicity, special educational needs (SEN) status, income, parental composition, and support systems.\n\nMethods: We used the COVID Social Mobility and Opportunities cohort study, 2021-2023, a probability sample of &gt;13,000 young people aged 16-18 in England, we assessed self-reported young caring and mental health outcomes, including psychological distress, anxiety, depression and chronic mental illness. Modifiers were ethnicity, gender, household income, special educational needs (SEN) status, parental composition, perceived school support for mental health, peer support and social support. \n\nResults: Young carers reported 1.69 higher odds of chronic mental illness (95% CI: 1.35-2.12), and more depressive (B=0.20, 95% CI: 0.07-0.33) and anxiety symptoms (B=0.15, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.29). Associations did not vary by gender, ethnicity, SEN status, parental composition or income. Young carers with high peer support had more depressive symptoms than young carers with low peer support. Young carers with high social support had lower odds of a mental illness than young carers with lower social support. No differences were observed by school support.\n\nConclusions: Young carers had poorer mental health which did not vary across key axes of inequality. Addressing their mental health is crucial to prevent a cycle of care need. Increasing societal awareness, and fostering empathy and support may help improve young carers’ mental health.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a well-known algorithm used to assess the similarity between signals of varying lengths. Initially developed for automatic speech recognition, DTW has found applications in psycholinguistics, particularly in analyzing gesture form similarity. An open question in this domain is how effectively DTW captures gesture form similarity. Here, we validate DTW against human annotations of gesture form similarity across two multimodal interaction corpora and explore its utility as an automatic, continuous measure of gesture form similarity. Our findings reveal weak to moderate correlations between DTW distance and the number of gesture features---such as hand shape, movement, orientation, and position---suggesting that DTW serves as a useful proxy for gesture form similarity. Additionally, we highlight the importance of qualitative analysis of raw data and DTW predictions in enhancing DTW's predictive accuracy. Our study offers a rigorous validation of DTW as a measure of gesture form similarity and presents a detailed framework for preprocessing motion tracking data and calculating DTW distance. While none of the methods is perfect, the combination of automatic and manual measures provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and measuring gesture form similarity.",

          "authors": "Arkady Zgonnikov; Merijn van Niekerk; Yke Bauke Eisma; Joost de Winter",
          "abstract": "Merging onto a highway is a safety-critical task resulting in a large number of traffic accidents; fundamental research into merging behavior of human drivers can help reduce this toll. Two cognitive processes critical to merging, attention allocation and decision making, have been extensively studied in real-world and simulated driving scenarios. However, how these processes interact during highway merging remains poorly understood. While the relationship between attention and decision making has been widely examined in cognitive science, this work has largely relied on simple decision-making paradigms involving choices between static items on a computer screen, which limits the understanding of more dynamic and naturalistic decisions such as in driving. To address this gap, we investigated the relationship between attention and decision making in a simplified highway merging task. In a video-based experiment, participants (N=24) repeatedly made merging gap acceptance decisions based on the dynamic information about the distance and time-to-arrival to the end of the merging lane and the gap to the target-lane vehicle available in the front view and the side mirror, respectively. Participants' decisions, response times, and eye movements were recorded. We found that decisions to accept a gap were considerably faster than decisions to reject a gap. Decision outcomes and timing depended on the distance to and time-to-arrival of the target-lane vehicle, but also on the time pressure due to approaching the end of the merging lane. Most importantly, under high time pressure, a greater proportion of time spent looking at the side mirror was associated with a lower probability of accepting the gap. This finding indicates that differences in visual information sampling can be closely linked to decision outcomes when time budgets are constrained. \nOur results provide initial empirical insights relevant for future cognitive modeling of the interplay between decision making and attention during highway merging; this may help inform early-stage exploration of driver monitoring and support systems for partially automated driving.",

          "abstract": "Background: Short-form video platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) have experienced unprecedented growth globally, with particularly rapid adoption in South Asian developing economies like Nepal. However, concerns regarding algorithmic exposure to inappropriate content and mental health impacts remain understudied in these contexts, where digital literacy and regulatory frameworks are still evolving.\n\nObjective: This study provides the first comprehensive multi-platform comparison of public discourse surrounding explicit content exposure, age-related concerns, and mental health implications of short-form video platforms. We address the content-specific research gap identified by Nguyen et al. (2025) through large-scale secondary data analysis, with particular attention to the unique challenges facing developing digital economies like Nepal where English serves as the primary digital lingua franca.\n\nMethods: We collected 221,764 user-generated records from five sources: Google Play Store reviews (160,000), Apple App Store reviews (12,086), Reddit posts (48,606), Trustpilot reviews (800), and YouTube comments (18,539). After relevance filtering and deduplication, 8,435 records mentioning content concerns, age-related issues, or mental health were analyzed using VADER sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling.\n\nResults: Analysis revealed highly polarized sentiment (45.0% negative, 42.3% positive, 12.7% neutral) with platform-specific variations. Instagram exhibited the most negative sentiment (M = −0.096), while TikTok showed slightly positive sentiment (M = 0.025) despite receiving the most discussion (49.6% of relevant content). Five dominant themes emerged: (1) child safety and parental concerns, (2) algorithmic content recommendation issues, (3) personal usage experiences, (4) account moderation and banning, and (5) mental health and attention span concerns.\n\nConclusions: Our multi-platform comparison reveals significant platform-specific variations in user sentiment, with Instagram exhibiting the most negative discourse (M = −0.096) despite TikTok dominating discussion volume. These findings align with and extend Nguyen et al.'s (2025) meta-analytic findings on short-form video's cognitive and mental health correlates. The results highlight the need for platform-specific content moderation strategies, transparent algorithmic practices, and age-appropriate safeguards—particularly critical in developing economies like Nepal where digital adoption is outpacing regulatory and educational infrastructure.",

Articles from the scoping review and experts’ open-ended responses were analyzed using natural language processing techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, word clouds) alongside qualitative categorization.\nThe findings revealed a wide range of predictions, spanning from utopian to dystopian scenarios. Utopian visions emphasized interdisciplinary, multimethod, and evidence-based research with strong societal and political impact, leveraging advanced technologies to support personalized learning as well as mental health and social-emotional development. Dystopian scenarios expressed concern that educational psychology and quality education could become marginalized, politically constrained, inaccessible to many learners, or replaced by automated systems. Experts also identified concrete action points aimed at fostering desirable developments and preventing unfavorable futures.",

Existing research mainly relies on retrospective parent- or child-reports of parental lying, does not differentiate between types of lies, and uses cross-sectional designs. This longitudinal population-based cohort study (N = 801) tested a novel systematic coding scheme to observe parental lying to children at age 3 during three structured behavioral control tasks in the laboratory. This study then examined prospective associations with observed child lying at age 4 (n = 537), and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 5 (n = 729), and callous-unemotional traits at age 9 (n = 563). We reliably observed four types of parental lies to influence children’s behavior (i.e., instrumental lies) and parental lies to foster imagination or fun. Most parents (94%) told at least one of these lies, whereas only few lied often. Prospective associations were examined for the four types of instrumental lies. None of the parental instrumental lies were associated with child lying or internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Parental instrumental lies involving false promises or exaggerated positive consequences were related to fewer callous-unemotional traits. This study shows the feasibility of using structured observations to measure different types of parental lying to children and demonstrates that the casual parental lies we observed were not associated with harmful child development and, in some cases, may even be associated with positive developmental outcomes.",

Drawing on emerging evidence, I describe how even modest contamination can shift estimated public opinion, compress attitudinal extremes, and create self-reinforcing feedback loops in which AI-influenced “human” data become inputs to future models and future measurement. Because detection is an asymmetric arms race that researchers are structurally positioned to lose, I recommend a shift from bot-hunting to infrastructure redesign: contamination-aware inference and sensitivity analyses, clearer distinctions between exploratory convenience samples and high-assurance confirmatory sampling, and journal/platform incentives that treat data authentication as shared scientific infrastructure in an AI-saturated research ecosystem.",

This so-called human self-domestication hypothesis (HSD) has been used to explain the parallel sophistication of language through a cultural mechanism, including the early emergence of rudimentary grammars capable of combining single words, with these compounds being perhaps extensively used for derogatory purposes in replacement of direct physical aggression. Complex language is a tool for achieving technological advancements, since it enables a more efficient transmission of know-hows to others. In this opinion paper, we hypothesize that this noticeable swearing behaviour might have contributed in direct and indirect ways to the improvement of human technology. Directly, because swearing has been shown to enhance dexterity and fine motor skills. Indirectly, because decreased stress levels and reduced anxiety, as typically resulting from swearing, enable one to engage in more efficient deep thinking, more efficient language use, and more productive work within a community.",

          "abstract": "Maladaptive social behavior can be considered both a cause and effect of pathological anxiety. These difficulties may arise from both the cognitive demands of social interaction, such as managing uncertainty, and the distinctively social demands of interactions, such as managing social friction. Previous work has linked generalized anxiety (GA) to reduced learning from aversive events, particularly under uncertainty, and social anxiety (SA) to fear of negative evaluation. However, these distinct hypothesized effects have not been previously dissociated within a single experimental framework. In the current study, we used a novel task, the Asymmetric Social Exchange (ASE) game, to study how people reason under uncertainty about the hidden intentions of others and weigh the real personal costs and benefits of accepting interpersonal inequality, a major source of social friction. In a large sample of online participants (N = 723), we tested the hypothesis of a double dissociation between anxiety subtypes in behavior. Behavioral and computational modeling supported this: GA, not SA, was specifically related to perturbed learning under uncertainty through aversive overgeneralization. By contrast, SA, not GA, was related to increased sensitivity to social friction, increasing acceptance of unfair, disadvantageous outcomes. Our study combined a novel social decision-making task with computational modeling to identify dissociable cognitive mechanisms underlying GA and SA phenotypes.",

Twenty-four strategies are identified,\nmost of which are field-general. Patterns in their use suggest a partially organized hierarchy of\ninterconnected strategies and substrategies, contrary to the view that heuristics are simply tried in random\norder. Strategies at four different size and time scale levels are described, including larger Modeling Cycle\nPhases of model generation, evaluation, and modification, each of which can utilize many smaller Tactical\nHeuristics as substrategies, e.g., analogy, or testing predictions from the model. These in turn can utilize\nGrounded Imagistic Processes, such as imagistic mental simulation, an important alternative to deduction\nfor evaluating a model by running it. The framework links higher level, serially organized processes with\nlower level, imagery-based processes. Its intermediate degree of organization is neither anarchistic, nor\nfully algorithmic. Possible benefits of organization are narrowing the search space involved and balancing\nsources of model construction and criticism for productive creativity.

The functions of these cognitive modes have been characterized based on analyses of their task-induced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) changes over many tasks, but in the context of the HCP Social Cognition task, their BOLD changes were interpreted as: (1) mentally projecting into social narratives (DM-B), (2) allocating external attention to task-relevant components (MD), (3) processing non-verbal communication (LAN), (4) focusing on visual features of the social stimuli (FVF), (5) suppressing auditory attention due to increased visual attention (AAR), and (6) re-evaluating for possibly missed social patterns (RE-EV). Thus, our results confirmed the activation of DM during ToM, but also specified the contributions of five additional cognitive modes. An application of this work is that the six sets of mode-aligned functional patterns can serve as separate inputs for machine learning algorithms aimed at subtyping patients with psychiatric conditions to advance toward precision psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Scientific communication faces a dual crisis: exponential publication growth overwhelms human readers, and fragmented research practices block automated synthesis. AI-assisted writing exacerbates the volume problem, producing papers faster than they can be read. Behavioral and social sciences in particular suffer from incomparable stimulus databases, jingle–jangle measurement fallacies, and demographic blindness that conceals effect heterogeneity. Current AI tools aid comprehension and summarization yet cannot aggregate findings from incommensurable studies and risk amplifying biases when trained on unstructured, unverified text. We propose restructuring scientific papers for dual audiences: front-loaded narratives for time-pressed human readers, paired with machine-readable appendices containing executable code, standardized metadata, and ontologically mapped constructs. This design turns papers into queryable research environments where readers can interrogate data and rerun analyses, and where structured appendices enable automated verification of statistical methods and AI-assisted peer review grounded in executable rather than narrative claims. Such papers become nodes in continuously updated evidence networks: each publication automatically contributes effect sizes to real-time meta-analyses, with corrections and retractions propagating through dependent analyses. Widespread adoption will require institutional recognition of structured documentation as essential scholarly output and computational infrastructure that serves both human comprehension and machine analysis.",

          "abstract": "Open science practices provide early-career researchers in special education with resources, mechanisms, and infrastructure to mitigate structural barriers that have constrained research that is critical for providing equitable educational support for bilingual and multilingual students. Bilingual and multilingual children in U.S. schools are at increased risk for misdiagnosis and, consequently, misallocation of special education services due to limitations in our understanding of language development across heterogeneous multilingual profiles and a lack of linguistically appropriate and culturally responsive assessment tools. In this article, we examine how open science practices can help address these disparities by improving transparency, accessibility, and \ncollaboration in basic and translational research involving multilingual populations. We discuss the barriers faced by early-career researchers working in this area and describe how openly available resources can address these challenges while facilitating replication, innovation, and cross-study comparisons. By improving access to data from historically underrepresented linguistic communities, innovative analytic procedures, and multilingual assessment tools, open science enables more accurate identification of language disorders, earlier intervention, and more equitable academic outcomes for bilingual and multilingual children.",

Drawing on the Dualistic Model of Passion, we investigated age-, experience-, and gender-related variations in harmonious passion (HP) and obsessive passion (OP), and examined how HP and OP related to weekly solitary practice. Data were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of 682 elite trainee aged between 15 and professional classical musicians recruited in Canada and the United Kingdom, and analyzed using multivariate regression and structural equation modeling approaches. Results indicated distinct developmental patterns for the two forms of passion and their links to practice. HP varied as a function of age and experience, whereas OP remained largely stable and was higher among men. With respect to practice, OP, but not HP, was positively associated with weekly solitary practice, and this association strengthened with age. An interaction between age and experience further showed that age-related variations in practice depended on accumulated expertise, such that practice increased with age primarily among less experienced musicians while remaining relatively stable among highly experienced musicians. Together, these findings highlight the existence of distinct developmental pathways linking HP, OP and practice behaviour across the musical lifespan.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons connected to the rise of the Internet and our current political environment, societies around the world are facing an existential crisis–a lack of empathy. Today, people are increasingly struggling to be empathetic to others in their communities and in society more broadly. In the current research we (a team of academic researchers and practitioners) attempt to tackle this problem of decreasing empathy by testing and evaluating a school-based intervention program developed by Narrative 4 in American high school classrooms (N=380, 10th and 11th graders) using an experimental approach (i.e., comparing Narrative 4 programming to a control condition). This 10-session program focused on building empathy, perspective taking, and active listening skills (among other skills) through narrative storytelling exercises. Results indicated the program was successful in promoting students’ reported empathy, perspective taking, curiosity to diverse ideas, and active listening skills as compared to the control condition. Additionally, this greater empathy led participants to report more pro-sociality (e.g., greater willingness to be civically engaged, more respect for others in their classroom and community more broadly) and less affective polarization towards those who disagree with them on politics. At the end of the program, participants also reported positive experiences with the program. Taken together, this research highlights the merits of Narrative 4 programming for promoting empathy and pro-sociality among high school students, the merits of academic and practitioner partnerships, and a promising narrative-based intervention for promoting empathy in society.",

          "abstract": "In this article, I aim to provide an overview of various guidelines and considerations that practicing psychologists in the U.S. must take into account when working with and for undocumented clients, particularly within the hostile political context of 2026. Through compiling empirical research sources, APA statements, and guidelines from professional organizations like the National Immigration Law Center, I provide various best practices broken down by sections of the APA Ethics Code. These include guidelines with relations to language proficiency and interpreter services, ICE raid preparation competencies and protocols, and confidentiality considerations, among others. I also include recommendations for the APA and other psychological institutions, such as creating more formal professional practice guidelines for psychological work with undocumented immigrants and providing more explicit material support to practicing psychologists who engage in justified and ethical civil disobedience when ethics and law come into conflict. While this article is by no means a complete collection of considerations, and is in full transparency written by a first year doctoral student with limited clinical experience, I hope it can serve as an initial guide and jumping off point for researchers and practitioners to develop more fleshed out guidelines. I believe this activity is vitally important given the current threats facing undocumented and immigrant populations within the United States under the second Trump administration, and I hope that this manuscript is helpful.",

          "abstract": "Background: Existing research has identified areas of strength and challenge in relation to autistic attention. However, there remains a limited phenomenological account of how autistic adults experience their attention in their everyday lives. This is important for developing an understanding of autistic attention which is not based only on comparisons to neurotypical benchmarks. \n\nMethods: Thirteen autistic adults took part in semi-structured interviews, making use of photo elicitation to explore their experiences around attention. Participant responses were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis\n\nResults: Three Group Experiential Themes (GETs) were developed: Interruption is Devastating, Interest Engagement as a Sanctuary, and Attentional Normativity. Participants described their attention as a sequential, deeply engrossed process. They reported that interruptions, especially from other people, were profoundly challenging, often leading to a collapse of their focus and an exhausting state of vigilance (GET1). Time spent deeply focused on interests was described as a sanctuary, providing both joy and replenishment of cognitive resources depleting through navigating inaccessible environments (GET2). Participants described navigating entrenched normative expectations about how attention should function which particularly impacted their experiences in employment (GET3).\n\nConclusion:  This work provides rich, contextualised insights into the phenomenology of autistic attention. We highlight elements across themes which resonate with the monotropism theory of attention. We consider how creating inclusive environments, particularly in the workplace, requires challenging normative expectations around attention.",

          "abstract": "Co-speech gestures, which are spontaneous hand movements speakers produce when they talk, strongly enhance listeners’ cognitive processing of the spoken messages across development. Yet, the mechanisms by which gesture supports memory processing, particularly in interaction with speech, remain poorly understood, limiting the intentional use of gesture to improve learning outside of lab settings. Here, we ask whether certain gestures are consistently better remembered across people, independent of prior experience with the stimuli (the memorability effect), and if so, what semantic meaning and visual form features explain this effect. We created 360 10-second audiovisual stimuli by video recording 20 actors producing natural, unscripted speech and gestures while pretending to explain Piagetian liquid conservation to a child. Online participants completed a study–test memory task with video-only, audio-only, and audiovisual versions of the stimuli. Participants showed memory consistencies in all three conditions, and memorability for gesture+speech (audiovisual stimuli) was predicted by the memorability of both its gesture and speech components. We then quantified features of the gestural stimuli using 3 methods: trained coders, automatic computational analysis, and online crowdsourcing. Gestures are more memorable when they convey more information, and are most memorable when originally produced with memorable speech. Together, these findings reveal nuanced interactions between gesture and speech during memory processing, providing new insights into the memory mechanism underlying gesture’s benefits on learning and communications.",

Yet insights into their effects remain fragmented due to variations in theoretical frameworks, outcome measures, and game designs.\n\nObjectives: This systematic review synthesizes experimental and intervention studies examining the effects of video games on prejudice and intercultural competence, aiming to identify patterns across game types and outcomes.\n\nMethods: Studies were identified through database searches using predefined inclusion criteria. Eligible studies employed an experimental design with a control group and outcome measures targeting prejudice (e.g., attitudes, stereotypes, intergroup bias) or intercultural competence (e.g., empathy, knowledge, culturally appropriate behaviour). Twenty-four studies met these criteria and were organized into four analytical groups: (1) collaborative gameplay, (2) player–character interaction and embodiment, (3) comparisons of different games with bias-related content, and (4) comparisons of game- versus text-based formats.\n\nResults and Conclusions: Across studies, video games showed potential to improve intercultural competence and prejudice-related outcomes. Effects were most consistent for collaborative and player–character interaction and embodiment game designs; by contrast, the impact of games with bias-related content depended on their moral framing, and comparisons of games with text suggested that interactive formats can have positive effects but demand careful experimental control. We identify strengths and limitations of the current body of research and discuss future research directions and practical implications.",

However, quantifying the\ntemporal structure of spontaneous thought remains challenging due to limited behavioral paradigms and analytic tools that preserve its continuous, multidimensional nature. Here, we\nintroduced Density Map-Based Predictive Modeling (DMPM), a framework that characterizes spontaneous thought dynamics elicited by the Free Association Semantic Task (FAST) within\nvalence–self-relevance–time (VST) space. DMPM summarizes each individual’s thought stream using rating and vector density maps that capture both where thoughts concentrate and how they\ntransition over time. Across multiple independent datasets (total N = 392), DMPM yields robust, generalizable predictions of positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA). Feature analysis indicated that affectivity is reflected not only in the content of thoughts, but also in transition dynamics, with self-relevance as a key organizing dimension. Furthermore, higher DMPM-predicted positive affectivity was associated with lower salivary C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting a link between thought dynamics and inflammation. Together, these findings establish a scalable, interpretable approach for quantifying spontaneous thought dynamics and relating them to transdiagnostic affective traits and potential physiological correlates.",

Contrary to this hypothesis, I propose the Wanderers Hypothesis for Geometry, which states that: Human geometry is largely rooted in navigation-like mental processes that approximate Euclidean geometry and are shared by humans and nonhuman animals. Humans uniquely may access this geometry with natural language and use it flexibly in novel contexts, ultimately supporting our capacity for formal learning.

We describe the design and implementation of a novel stakeholder-driven initiative to build a peer-led online support group for people with BPD. \n\nMethods: This manuscript does not present a traditional research study or follow an implementation science framework. Instead, it documents a radical, community-led model of care development—one that expands the possibilities for stakeholder-led innovation in mental health services. People with BPD and their families recognized an unmet need and co-created an intervention; researchers later joined to help assess program outcomes and capture impact. We describe support group design, peer facilitator training, and adaptation to online format during the COVID-19 pandemic using narrative format. We quantify changes in attendance over time (one-way ANOVAs) and participant demographics and satisfaction (n=598 survey respondents). \n\nResults: A two-year peer-driven process identified core principles and designed a peer-led support group. In the first 26 months, 138 peer-support sessions met (1383 total attendees) with significant increases in registered participants, program attendance, and waitlists. Participants were geographically diverse, likely to attend one session (72%), and reported high satisfaction. Many had never received BPD treatment (44%) or met someone else with BPD (48%).\n\nConclusions: This program demonstrates an example of stakeholder-led design of a sustainable program for people with BPD. The sustained demand we observed underscores the need for accessible empowering support for people with BPD.",

Phenomenological control is an evolved capacity to deceive ourselves so as to support socially useful beliefs. It allows one to strategically construct subjective experiences that misrepresent reality despite contradictory evidence in order to meet goals. It is so good at its evolved function that researchers of it have often found themselves being deceived: The participants in their studies feel energies, special states or parts of themselves that are taken to be constitutive of the mechanism of construction rather than what the mechanism constructs. \n\nKey points:\n\n•\tHypnosis is just one context in which phenomenological control is used; others include spirit possession, many spiritual experiences, esoteric martial arts, everyday experiences and psychology experiments\n\n•\tPhenomenological control is a metacognitive trick one plays on oneself: No other abilities are gained nor lost\n\n•\tFor example, hypnosis does not improve memory, strength, nor attentional capacity\n\n•\tIt can nevertheless be clinically useful in, for example, making pain go away by itself, precisely because it involves the motivated transformation of subjective experience\n\n•\tNo special state is needed to explain how or when phenomenological control is used\n\n•\tThere are enduring individual differences in the capacity for phenomenological control that have yet to be explained",

Outcomes in ATDs are often recorded as count data with repeated measurements nested within cases. Although generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) have been systematically examined for analyzing nonnormal outcomes in multiple-baseline designs, their application and statistical properties for ATDs remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a large-scale Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of GLMMs in terms of bias, mean square error, coverage rate and type I error rate for estimating immediate effects and trend changes in two prototypical ATDs. In addition, we present two empirical demonstrations using real ATD datasets with a focus on illustrating design-matrix coding, interpretation of parameter estimates, and reporting practices that jointly consider immediate effects and trend changes. Finally, we provide recommendations for analytic procedures for applied researchers based on findings from the simulation study and empirical demonstrations. We hope this article equips SCED researchers with essential guidance for appropriately analyzing count data from ATDs using GLMMs and outlines directions for future methodological work exploring the full potential of GLMMs and their extensions for the analysis and meta-analysis of ATD data.",

With the population of single adults quickly growing it is important the mechanism that relates singlehood to worse mental health outcomes is better understood. We conducted a scoping review to summarise the literature on the relationship between singlehood and mental health, and to evaluate the extent to which ultimate level perspectives are included in the current research. Of the 181 papers, from the PsycINFO databases, included in this review the consistent finding was that single individuals reported worse mental health oucomes. An inductive thematic analysis of these sources was used to identify patterns within the literature, with four clusters of commonly associated data items reflecting different singlehood identities (Widowed &amp; Lonely Women, Never-Partnered &amp; Childless Women, Male Involuntary Singles and Low-Socioeconomic Status Single Parents). Similar mental health outcomes were found for single men and women but the factors influencing this relationship were sexually differentiated in ways consistent with evolutionary theory. Childlessness and age were found to be more important in the outcomes of single women, compared to sexual access and voluntariness of singlehood in the outcomes of single men. With only a small number of exceptions, the literature broadly ignores ultimate levels of analysis and evolutionary explanations for the negative impacts of singlehood and accompanying sex differences. We provide a detailed discussion of how evolutionary theory could be used to shed light on the extant literature and call for future research to consider ultimate as well as proximate perspectives.",

Eighty-eight health professionals completed the scale of ten proposed items assessing perceived pros and cons of engaging with health and healthcare equity work, along with a measure of Anti-Racist Efficacy (ARE) (Eschmann et al., 2023). Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the latent structure of the scale and its predictive validity. A two-factor model retaining eights items with correlated pros and cons showed excellent fit (χ²(25)=32.98, RMSEA=.061, CFI=.982). Pros and cons were strongly and inversely related (r=−.90, p&lt;.001), consistent with decisional balance theory. When modeled as latent predictors, pros showed a strong positive association with anti-racist self-efficacy (ARE) (β=.82, p=.037), whereas cons was not significant. Together, the factors accounted for 20% of variance in efficacy.

          "authors": "Irene Pagliai",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a cross-linguistic idiom norming study based on 150 pairs of Italian and English idioms with similar meanings. Idiom pairs are categorized as lexical (LL), semi-lexical (SL), and post-lexical (PL) based on translatability (Beck, 2020), and annotated to indicate shared syntactic constituents. The variables explored include familiarity, meaningfulness, and objective knowledge (Experience-Based Variables, EBVs), alongside literal plausibility, decomposability, and transparency (Content-Based Variables, CBVs; Hubers, Cucchiarini, Strik, &amp; Dijkstra, 2019). The aims of the present work are multifaceted. First, a replicability check is intended, verifying if idioms show consistent correlational patterns across Italian and English. Second, it examines whether a correlational continuum exists for each CBV, with LL idioms expected to show stronger correlations than SL and PL ones. Finally, the study deepens the comparative perspective on CBVs through exploratory statistical modeling of cross-linguistic rating differences. Results show that correlational patterns are largely replicated between Italian and English, also for variables notoriously difficult to assess. The cross-linguistic correlational continuum is found for all CBVs, and model results show that the difference between Italian and English CBV ratings increases from LL to PL idiom pairs for each CBV, confirming the translatability continuum.

          "authors": "Jonathan Kelly; Michael Dorneich; Stephen Gilbert",
          "abstract": "Cybersickness remains a persistent challenge limiting the usability of virtual reality (VR), yet commonly used subjective measures such as the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and the Fast Motion Sickness (FMS) scale are often difficult to interpret in terms of user outcomes. In particular, there is limited guidance on how specific values on these scales relate to user tolerance or the likelihood that users will discontinue a VR experience due to discomfort. This work addresses this gap by calibrating cybersickness severity interpretations against early termination of a VR experience. In Study 1 (N = 183), participants played an immersive VR game for up to 20 minutes and were free to terminate the experience at any time. Using a Behavioral Risk Banding (BRB) framework, logistic regression linked a modified 0-10 version of the FMS (FMS-10) and post-exposure SSQ scores to dropout probability, yielding behaviorally grounded risk severity bands (mild, moderate, severe, extreme). Survival analyses then showed how these bands mapped onto tolerance over time, revealing a transitional region marked by heightened individual variability. Study 2 (N = 304) evaluated the robustness of these categories across variation in VR content and mitigation context by applying the Study 1 thresholds without re-estimation. Although absolute dropout risk varied, the ordering and behavioral meaning of severity categories were preserved. Together, these results provide a practical, behaviorally grounded framework for interpreting cybersickness ratings in terms of user tolerance and usability across VR contexts.",

          "abstract": "The proposed model offers a unified process-oriented and developmental framework for the emergence of reflective emotion regulation across childhood. It delineates three core steps—awareness, evaluation, and regulation of emotions—together with the requisite competencies: emotion knowledge, norms and values, and a repertoire of regulation strategies. Early in development, caregivers assume primary responsibility for these processes through co-awareness, co-evaluation, and co-regulation. From a transactional perspective, the model delineates how specific caregiver practices shape children’s situated emotional experience and behavior and support the gradual transition from co-regulation to self-regulation of emotions. While the model receives initial empirical support, it also identifies key avenues for future research, including the need for culture-sensitive extensions of positive development.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

There is a critical need to appraise the evidence supporting these programs, particularly whether they benefit students in crisis intervention and prevention. This need is particularly urgent given documented misapplication and overuse of physical restraint, which is a common component of these programs. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the research in support of crisis management programs that target PK-12 students with disabilities who display challenging behavior in educational settings. We conducted database searches, ancestral searches, and website searches of organizations that produce crisis management programs to identify published and unpublished studies evaluating the programs. Our search process yielded just six studies evaluating five of 23 commercially available crisis management programs. Given the scarcity of supporting studies, none of the programs meet currently established thresholds for evidence-based practice in special education. Our review identifies a critical need for rigorous research on these programs to inform practice and policy, ensuring student safety and wellbeing. Consumers should exercise caution in adopting these programs based on claims made by the programs’ producers.",

          "abstract": "Neurofeedback (NF) has been proposed as a tool to support and expand access to meditation practice. Despite growing interest, no comprehensive review has examined neurofeedback in meditation-based interventions (NF-MED) across the full spectrum of practices. Here, we conducted a scoping systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines, mapping the NF-MED field across both clinical and non-clinical contexts, with three aims: (1) assess the current state of NF-MED studies, (2) evaluate whether NF-MED facilitates meditative development, and in particular toward advanced meditation, and (3) provide methodological recommendations for future work. Our analysis shows that the field is dominated by proof-of-concept studies and marked by substantial heterogeneity in design, implementation, and outcome measures, which hampers the assessment of efficacy and applicability of NF-MED. While NF-MED has been shown to consistently modulate neural activity, evidence for corresponding improvements in behavior, phenomenology or transferable meditative skills remains limited. Additional research is thus essential for determining whether NF-MED can help practitioners overcome common meditative barriers, such as anxiety and self-doubt, and whether NF-MED can accelerate meditative development across the training spectrum from novice to advanced meditators.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive coding theory, perception arises from the interplay between top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory input. In the auditory domain, this interplay can lead to illusory experiences—for instance, when phonetic similarities between languages cause listeners to mishear foreign lyrics as familiar words in their native language. This study investigated how linguistic priors influence auditory perception during song listening. Participants read sentences in English or Italian before hearing English song excerpts, then rated how well the lyrics matched the text. Crucially, some of the Italian sentences were phonologically similar to the English lyrics, resulting in a cross-linguistic auditory illusion in which listeners reported the content of the lyrics matched that of the Italian text. EEG analysis showed that two neural markers of surprise—P200 amplitude and gamma-band activity—were heightened while listening to songs that were not perceived to match the preceding text, reflecting the violation of expectations. In contrast, these markers were attenuated in illusory trials, suggesting reduced prediction error despite the lack of semantic match. Time-frequency analysis revealed an early gamma response followed by beta-band dominance in the illusory condition, consistent with initial sensory mismatch followed by top-down assimilation. Together, these findings show that phonologically plausible but false linguistic priors can induce auditory illusions and modulate predictive processing during song perception.",

          "abstract": "People differ in their ability to distinguish visually similar items, a domain-general ability known as o (Richler et al., 2019). While o typically involves extracting invariant object properties, we investigated whether it also relates to long-term memory for episodic information extrinsic to object identity, specifically, object location. We further examined whether this relationship is influenced by stimulus meaningfulness, a factor known to enhance long-term memory, by using both high- and low-meaning stimuli. Participants completed a location memory test, a series of visual object-recognition tasks assessing o, and other cognitive covariate measures. Results showed a positive correlation between o and location memory, which was stronger for high-meaning than for low-meaning stimuli. This suggests that semantic content may enhance the link between object recognition and episodic location memory. Importantly, these effects remained after controlling for age, gender, low-level visual perception, working memory, and general intelligence. Our findings indicate that domain-general object recognition ability contributes to episodic memory by supporting the binding of meaningful objects to their spatial context. This challenges traditional cognitive boundaries by integrating current knowledge about individual differences in perception and memory, with semantic meaning acting as a significant moderator.",

          "abstract": "Substantial efforts have been made to develop comprehensive dictionaries of personality traits in many languages. Nevertheless, given that what is important and salient in individuals’ lived experience might be changing over time, this raises the question about the long-term usefulness of ‘off-the-shelf’ dictionaries developed decades ago. In the current study we used a bottom-up approach to create a large population-specific lexicon of personality terms. We subsequently examined the overlap and sensitivity to extract implicit personality of this dictionary compared to an established trait dictionary in the same language. Overall, we found that the two dictionaries only showed limited overlap with a pronounced divergence in emotionality (Neuroticism) and social aspects (Agreeableness) of personality. In addition to this, we found that while the implicit personality extracted from self-descriptions using the established dictionary showed alignment with participants self-rated personality, especially in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, the population-specific dictionary showed a significantly greater alignment between implicit and self-rated personality. In summary, our current study highlights the need to extend our thinking about the psycholexical hypothesis, moving away from assumptions of time invariant language encoding to more explicitly recognizing the temporal dynamics underpinning the expression and use of personality trait terms.",

          "abstract": "Background: Most individuals who could benefit from psychological intervention remain untreated due to limited funding, workforce shortages, and the slow implementation of scalable, evidence-based short-term treatments. Even when effective single-session interventions (SSIs) are available, Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) training remains a critical bottleneck. Recent advances in Artificial Humans and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable AI-powered clinical simulators that offer standardized, repeatable practice with immediate feedback. In this study, we developed and evaluated a novel AI-supported \"triadic\" training architecture for mental health professionals learning single-session Interpersonal Psychotherapy Intervention (IPT-SSI).\nMethod: In a single-group pre–post design, MHPs (N=72) completed a two-hour blended training comprising a didactic workshop (90 minutes) and an experiential, supervised text-based AI simulation (30 minutes). Participants completed baseline and immediate post-training questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, IPT-SSI knowledge, attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy, and willingness/apprehension to deliver IPT-SSI. Post-training user experience ratings and open-ended qualitative feedback were also collected. \nResults: MHPs showed significant pre–post gains in IPT-SSI knowledge (baseline M = 1.13, SD = 0.96; post M = 3.37, SD = 0.92; t(71) = 18.38, p &lt; .001) and self-efficacy (baseline M = 2.27, SD = 1.13; post M = 3.49, SD = 0.95; t(71) = 8.90, p &lt; .001). Attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy improved (baseline M = 3.15, SD = 1.27; post M = 3.67, SD = 0.83; t(71) = 4.16, p &lt; .001, d = 0.49). Willingness to accept clients for IPT-SSI increased (baseline M = 3.22, SD = 1.48; post M = 3.60, SD = 1.08; t(71) = 2.40, p = .019, d = 0.28), whereas changes in apprehension did not reach to significance. User experience ratings were high and qualitative feedback highlighted perceived advantages in psychological safety, accessibility, and real-time guidance, alongside concerns about over-scaffolding and the limits of text-based realism. \nConclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that AI-powered clinical simulators—especially those incorporating embedded supervision—may serve as scalable, practice-forward tools to support psychotherapy training. A brief AI-supported program was associated with substantial gains in MHPs' perceived knowledge and self-efficacy and with improved attitudes and willingness to deliver IPT-SSI - key barriers to SSI implementation.",

Therefore, it has been proposed that presumed ToM difficulties experienced by individuals with autism may be attributed to difficulties with deictic relating. However, rigorous studies testing whether altered deictic relating is associated with autism are lacking. To this end, we conducted two experiments (Nexp1 = 134, Nexp2 = 120) in which we tested the relationship between autism traits and performance on different types of relational responding, including deictic relating, in a general population sample. In Experiment 1, we investigated the relationship between autism traits and performance on eight types of relational responding via an improved version of the Relational Abilities Index (RAI). In Experiment 2, we adjusted the deictic relating scale to include stimulus functions more directly relevant to perspective-taking. Contrary to our predictions, deictic relating did not correlate significantly with autism traits. Moreover, none of the other RAI subscales correlated reliably with autism traits. These findings question the claims made by RFT about the relationship between autism and relational responding and warrant a reassessment of the accuracy of this position.",

          "abstract": "Consumers often encounter products featuring assorted components, such as bags of flavored popcorn or flower bouquets. How do they judge the quantity of each component to form overall preferences? Across twelve pre-registered studies, this article shows that spatial positioning significantly shapes judgements of relative quantity. The findings reveal a proximity-to-center bias: When evaluating products with assorted items, consumers tend to perceive a given type of item as more numerous when it appears closer to the center of the display, even when actual quantity is lower. This bias impacted both hypothetical and real choices. Consumers preferred products where the packaging positioned more of the type of item that they liked most, such as a specific popcorn flavor, closer to the center. Remarkably, this preference persisted even when the actual quantity of their favored type was lower. These results suggest that these biases are rooted in selective attention, specifically to the center of the product display. This research highlights the intricate relationship between spatial positioning, quantity judgments, and consumer decision-making, offering valuable insights for product design and display strategies.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to develop a phenomenology of the experience of self and its transformation through the interrelated experiences of form, substance, and essence. The objectives are two fold: (1) to articulate a structural vocabulary for describing how selfhood is lived, fragmented, and transformed, and (2) to demonstrate how this framework might illuminate and facilitate the resolution of identity conflict. The paper integrates relevant philosophical and psychological theory to articulate the experiential dynamics of self. This analysis yields a tripartite model composed of form (the physical and/or social dimension of identity), substance (the affective and psychological dimension), and essence (the integrative foundation of human meaning). In this model of selfhood, transformation occurs by integrating form and substance with essence. The analysis yields a phenomenological structure for understanding both intrasubjective and intersubjective reconciliation. An illustrative application of the model to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict demonstrates how collective identity fragmentation mirrors individual division and how transformation can emerge through renewed mutual recognition. The model emphasizes that transformation is not the elimination of conflict but its transfiguration through deeper relational awareness. By providing a conceptual vocabulary and analytic framework, this approach contributes to psychological theory on identity, selfhood, and the resolution of both internal and collective conflict.",

However, its effectiveness in authentic educational settings—particularly in mathematics and with respect to content transfer—remains understudied. We estimated the causal impact of retrieval practice on student performance in higher education, focusing on task-specific learning gains and content transfer (near vs. far). Participants were three cohorts of first-year business administration students in a gateway mathematics course (n1 = 636 in 2022/2023; n2 = 584 in 2023/2024; n3 = 571 in 2024/2025). Students completed weekly online retrieval practice exercises, with randomized assignments to different problem sets. Performance was assessed through three quizzes and a final exam. We estimated the local average treatment effect (LATE) using an instrumental variable approach combined with individual fixed effects. Retrieval practice improved quiz performance by 4–5 percentage points. Effects were strongest for isomorphic problems, then near-transfer problems, and only limited for far-transfer problems. On the final exam, retrieval practice yielded an 8-percentage-point LATE in one cohort, with smaller, nonsignificant gains in the others. The temporal distance between retrieval practice and quizzes did not systematically moderate outcomes. Our findings provide causal evidence that retrieval practice enhances mathematical learning in higher education by promoting a deeper conceptual understanding and facilitating near, and, in some cases, far content transfer.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) are increasingly used to study affect dynamics such as intraindividual variability and inertia. These parameters are often interpreted as substantive individual differences, yet they may be biased by stable response style tendencies, in particiular extreme response style (ERS). In the present study, we investigated whether ERS is systematically associated with affect dynamics estimated from multiple experience sampling method (ESM) datasets (total N = 1,254). Using a joint Bayesian IRTree–location–scale modeling approach, we estimated person-specific ERS alongside affective variability and inertia across multiple ESM datasets and synthesized study-level associations using a meta-analytic approach. We find that higher ERS is consistently associated with greater intraindividual variability. In contrast, we find no evidence that ERS was related to affective or emotional inertia. These results suggest that commonly used measures of intraindividual variability may partly reflect systematic response behavior rather than solely genuine affective fluctuations. Ignoring ERS may therefore bias variability estimates obtained from location–scale and related multilevel dynamic models. Overall, this study highlights the importance of accounting for response styles when modeling affect dynamics and interpreting person-specific variability parameters in ILD research.",

The survey collected data on initiative type, delivery, target age group, supporting evidence used, evaluation, and challenges. Respondents were encouraged to share supporting materials, which were then reviewed by experts to assess the initiative content, supporting evidence, and evidence of evaluation. Additionally, publicly available resources were found through online searches.  \n\nResults \nFifty-seven local authorities responded (44% response rate), with 52 reporting at least one vaping prevention initiative, and 41 reporting multiple initiatives, totalling 169 initiatives. The most common initiative types were school-based campaigns and online information resources, primarily targeting ages 11-16 years. Only 9 local authorities provided information about the effectiveness of their initiatives, and 4 had been adapted based on feedback or data collected. Common challenges included limited engagement from schools, inconsistent messaging about vaping, lack of resources, and absence of national guidance.

          "abstract": "In contemporary digital environments, visual storytelling has emerged as a central strategy through which brands communicate meaning and build relationships with audiences. Instagram, as a predominantly visual social media platform, offers a unique context in which imagery, narrative structure, and consumer psychology converge. This paper explores how narrative imagery on Instagram shapes brand perception by influencing emotional responses, perceived authenticity, trust, and consumer engagement. Drawing on psychological theories of narrative processing, visual persuasion, and affective response, the study examines how cohesive visual narratives, symbolic elements, and sequential imagery contribute to the construction of brand identity. The analysis suggests that strategically designed visual storytelling not only enhances attention and memorability but also fosters deeper cognitive and emotional associations with brands. These associations, in turn, play a significant role in shaping consumer attitudes, purchase intentions, and long-term brand loyalty. By situating Instagram-based visual narratives within established psychological frameworks, this study highlights the strategic value of narrative imagery as an effective branding tool in contemporary digital culture.",

          "abstract": "Background: Climate change increasingly affects the conditions under which physical activity is practiced, posing new ethical, environmental, and practical challenges for physical activity professionals. This study examined physical activity professionals’ felt needs related to climate change, as expressed through lived professional challenges and dilemmas, and explored key competencies and educational strategies for training.\nMethods: A qualitative design was employed. Fifteen (7 females) physical activity professionals practicing in the province of Québec, Canada, participated online in (i) a 1h Climate Fresk game, a gamified collaborative workshop on climate change, followed by (ii) a ~45 min focus group. Thematic analysis was conducted following a structured six-phase analytical framework. \nResults: The physical activity professionals were French speaking; 80% of them had been practicing for ≥5 years in the public (n=5, 33%) or the private (n=10, 67%) sector. Eight key themes emerged, categorized into three overarching sections: (1) barriers and dilemmas in practice, (2) required competencies to adapt practice, and (3) educational design and delivery strategies. Physical activity professionals identified environmental and logistical constraints, ethical and safety concerns, and social pressures as key barriers affecting their ability to promote safe practice. They emphasized the need for climate-specific knowledge, adaptive and communication skills, and supportive, non-judgmental attitudes. Educational recommendations centred on the behaviour-oriented, and reflective learning approaches, encouraging both professional adaptability and environmental responsibility. \nConclusion: These findings offer a guide for integrating climate change–related competencies and pedagogical approaches into physical activity professionals’ education and training programs to support climate-resilient physical activity practice.",

          "authors": "Evelina Leivada; Fritz Guenther; Camilla Masullo; Paolo Morosi; Marit Westergaard",
          "abstract": "Bilingualism can be thought of as an intensive mental gym for language control. However, the moderators that underlie bilingual adaptations are a matter of ongoing investigation. Degree of similarity in mental, linguistic representations between the languages of a bilingual has been argued to differentially condition recruitment of control mechanisms and, as such, would embody a contributing factor to relevant neurocognitive adaptations. While ample evidence exists for this claim, its empirical coverage is limited because testing in cognitive science disproportionally represents communities that speak big, Indo-European languages, thus potentially providing a biased view of bilingual cognition. In this work, we assess the role of language distance as a key moderator of bilingual adaptations through a large-scale aggregation analysis of 510 experiments. To measure distance, we develop a multi-metric approach, using state-of-the-art databases, such as Grambank, and tapping into different levels of linguistic granularity. Aggregating data from 56,173 participants who speak 79 different languages, spanning 11 language families and a language isolate, we find sparse evidence for a distance effect at the population level. Certain language pairs stand out as promising hosts for bilingual adaptations, but their representation in the sample is not robust enough to enable strong conclusions, attesting to the need to employ more representative samples. Our results suggest that language distance is a complex variable that has the potential to address the perennial question of what makes bilinguals distinct.",

          "authors": "Holly Kate Barnett; Lara Warmelink; Sophie J Nightingale; Faraz Ahmed; Trevor J. Crawford",
          "abstract": "Misinformation and disinformation are increasingly used to deceive individuals online. Identifying such deception can be particularly challenging for older adults. It is therefore crucial to understand how older users navigate online spaces. Despite the development of several interventions aimed at enhancing people’s ability to detect misinformation, their effectiveness among older adults remains underresearched. This systematic-narrative review identified interventions which target the psychological mechanisms contributing to online vulnerability and focused on their effectiveness among adults aged 50+. Searches were performed across PsycINFO, ERIC, Academic Search Ultimate, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google, and Policy Commons. Of the 1058 results retrieved, 16 articles were eligible for inclusion. Data regarding the implementation and outcome of interventions were extracted, enabling us to perform a narrative synthesis analysis. Aligning with previous research, three primary intervention types were identified: bunking, boosting, and nudging. Interventions provide mixed effectiveness among older adults but bunking programmes appear to be the most effective by facilitating discernment of both true and false content. Several interventions contributed to negative side-effects among older adults, such as an overconfidence in detection ability and decreased sharing of true information. Overall, psychological interventions provide a promising mechanism to support digital deception detection, but age-specific approaches are necessary to protect older users from the harms of false information online.",

          "authors": "Michał Misiak; Agata Dominik; Michalina Babiec; Hubert Ludwiczak; Marta Świątek-Prycik",
          "abstract": "People who view food-wasting behaviour as immoral tend to waste less. This observation raises the question of whether appealing to moral values can shift how individuals think about food waste and how willing they are to address it. The present preregistered experiment (N = 1006) tested this possibility by examining whether persuasive video messages grounded in the Morality-as-Cooperation framework influence psychological responses to food waste. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of seven value-based appeals: highlighting Family, Group, Reciprocity, Heroism, Deference, Fairness, or Property concerns; or one of two control conditions. Each moral message was presented in both positive and negative framing and delivered by one of two actors.\nOutcomes included judgments of the wrongness of food wasting, intentions to reduce waste, support for policy measures, and willingness to learn more or engage in related actions. Preregistered analyses showed no overall effects of the moral messages. However, mediation analyses showed a consistent pattern of opposing effects. Across outcomes, moral appeals were associated with lower perceived message relevance, which in turn predicted weaker moral concern, policy support, and behavioural intentions. At the same time, when controlling for perceived relevance, several moral messages—particularly those grounded in Family, Deference, Heroism, and Property concerns—exerted positive direct effects on outcomes.\nOverall, the findings show that moral appeals in food waste communication can be a double-edged sword. Moral messages have the potential to motivate stronger responses, but only when people find them personally relevant. When they do not, the same appeals may undermine their own effectiveness. This emphasizes perceived relevance as a key ingredient in successful moral communication about food waste.",

          "authors": "Hao Qin; Rafael C. Gonçalves; Courtney Michael Goodridge; Natasha Merat",
          "abstract": "Partially automated driving (PAD) systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in consumer vehicles. While drivers are obliged to monitor the roadway and the system during PAD, they do not always comply with this requirement and may engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). Literature has emphasized the detrimental effects of visual–manual NDRTs on drivers’ capability to takeover control from PAD while reporting negligible effects of non-visual NDRTs (e.g., hands-free phone calls) and cognitive load. However, most studies focused on alerted scenarios, with takeover requests lowering drivers’ reliance on anticipation and cognitive load, masking the effects of cognitive load. Related work also examined PAD conditions alone, neglecting the combined effects of automation and cognitive load on drivers’ responses. To address the gaps, we conducted a driving simulator study examining the influence of cognitive load, induced by a 2-back task, on driver-initiated responses to urban traffic hazards (e.g., crossing pedestrians, oncoming vehicles) during both manual driving and PAD. The timing and quality of driver-initiated responses were analyzed separately for each hazard with detail. Results showed that (i) cognitive load effects manifested most when drivers encountered hazards with lower perceptual salience (e.g., a pedestrian gradually approaching the roadway); (ii) driver-initiated responses during PAD were less proactive and relied more on cognitive control; and (iii) this shift led to higher situational criticality and heightened susceptibility of responses to cognitive load during PAD. Together, these findings underscore an elevated safety risk associated with cognitive load during PAD, especially in scenarios requiring cognitively demanding, driver-initiated intervention.",

          "abstract": "Reading is a pervasive and cognitively demanding activity that underpins modern human culture. It is a prime instance of a class of tasks where eye movements are coordinated for the purpose of comprehension. Existing theories explain either eye movements or comprehension during reading, but the critical link between the two remains unclear. Here, we propose resource-rational optimization as a unifying principle governing adaptive reading behavior. Eye movements are selected to maximize expected comprehension while minimizing cognitive and temporal costs, organized hierarchically across nested time scales: fixation decisions support word recognition; sentence-level integration guides skipping and regression; and text-level comprehension goals shape memory construction and rereading. A computational implementation successfully replicates an unprecedented range of findings in human reading, from lexical effects to comprehension outcomes. Together, these results suggest that resource rationality provides a general mechanism for coordinating perception, memory, and action in knowledge-intensive human behaviors, offering a principled account of how complex cognitive skills adapt to limited resources.",

          "abstract": "Figurative and prior knowledge can each connect unfamiliar concepts to familiar experience to support learning, yet how they jointly shape real-time concept learning remains underspecified. The prior-knowledge scaffolding account predicts that learners primarily recruit domain-relevant semantic associates, whereas embodied-cognition accounts predict that figurative language promotes learning by eliciting sensorimotor simulations of a source domain and drawing attention to grounded information. We tested these competing hypotheses and their predictions in a visual-world eye-tracking study in which 104 Mandarin-speaking adults learned novel science concepts from spoken explanations that were either literal or figurative. Participants viewed three competitors per trial: a prior-knowledge associate, a sensorimotor-rich synonym linked to the figurative source, and an unrelated distractor. Learning outcomes were assessed with immediate and delayed judgments. Gaze time courses were analyzed across interest periods and linked to decision processes via hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling. Literal explanations elicited a sustained fixation advantage for the prior-knowledge competitor, consistent with the prior-knowledge scaffolding hypothesis. Figurative explanations produced a distinct temporal signature: attention shifted toward the sensorimotor synonym when the source domain was introduced, and later reflected concurrent engagement of sensorimotor and prior-knowledge information, reflecting an online interaction. Individual-differences analyses indicated that stronger figurative sensorimotor engagement at source-word onset predicted better learning outcomes and more efficient evidence accumulation, whereas sustained late reliance on figurative information predicted poorer performance. These findings show that abstract concept learning is supported by dynamically coordinated knowledge sources rather than a single mechanism. Instructionally, the results suggest that figurative language is most effective when it is used to initiate learning and is then paired with cues that promote integration with relevant prior knowledge.",

          "abstract": "As exploratory network research continues to grow, there is heightened demand for confirmatory network analysis that can validate replicability and examine hypotheses. The quality of confirmatory testing depends critically on reliable fit index cutoffs that control type I and type II errors during hypothesis testing. However, conventional cutoffs developed by Hu and Bentler (1999; HB cutoffs) are inflexible and are vulnerable to sample and model characteristics, creating a demand for more flexible dynamic fit index (DFI) cutoffs that can be adapted to researchers’ specific designs. In this study, we attempted to develop a DFI algorithm for Gaussian graphical models, a widely implemented network model, and compared the performance of DFI cutoffs with HB cutoffs\nin terms of their specificity and sensitivity to misspecifications. In simulation studies based on both synthetic and empirical networks, DFI provided more flexible cutoffs with a transparent, fixed power/specificity to detect correctly specified models and was often more sensitive to misspecifications, especially in empirical networks. The DFI for network models provides a more reliable and flexible criterion for confirmatory network analysis, thereby marking an essential advancement in theory and hypothesis testing in network research. The algorithm has been implemented in an open-source, user-friendly R package, netDFI.",

          "abstract": "Network models in time-series and panel data have been powerful tools to investigate the dynamical relations among variables. A common goal of empirical research is to compare the networks of different groups, such as treatment and control, to understand how the dynamical relations are shaped by grouping variables. However, existing methods for comparing n = 1 idiographic networks are restricted to global tests, which lack the capacity to identify the precise location of edge heterogeneity. Furthermore, there is a lack of easily applicable methods to compare networks from panel data where just a few time-points are available per person. We therefore present the invariance partial pruning (IVPP) approach, which first evaluates heterogeneity globally with the network invariance test, and then determine the exact locus of heterogeneity at the edge level with partial pruning. Through simulation studies, we discovered that network invariance test based on Akaike Information Criterion performed well. Bayesian Information Criterion performed similarly well but also showed insufficient power to detect smaller true differences at small sample sizes, and the Likelihood Ratio Test was prone to false discovery. Comparison with the fully constrained model revealed superior performance than comparison with the fully unconstrained model. Partial pruning successfully uncovered specific edge difference with high sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that IVPP is an essential supplement to the existing network methodology by allowing the comparison of networks from both time-series and panel data, and also allowing the test of specific edge difference. We implement the algorithm in the R-package IVPP.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is widely viewed as adaptive. Yet this control-based emotion regulation may carry hidden costs when individuals encounter personally meaningful reminders of past adversity. The present study examined these tradeoffs in a naturally occurring subsample of undergraduates with a history of parental divorce. Within a larger experiment, participants viewed sad film clips, including an unexpected divorce-relevant reminder, completed a movement-based Stroop task, and later reported the extent to which the reminder reactivated negative feelings from their own experience. As predicted, instructed reappraisal conferred short-term functional benefits on the Stroop task. However, at a longer timescale, individuals who reported habitually relying more heavily on reappraisal showed evidence of preserved reminder-evoked distress. In contrast, individuals higher in habitual acceptance showed a more normative pattern, such that those with divorces further in the past reported faint to no distress in response to the reminders. Together, these findings point to a central tradeoff in emotion regulation: reappraisal helps people maintain composure in the moment, yet repeated reliance on it keeps emotional echoes of past adversity alive. The divergent effects of these two emotion regulation strategies—reappraisal and acceptance—are discussed through cybernetic and comparator-based models of emotion regulation, where cognitive appraisal acts as a feedback process involving reference signals, error monitoring, and corrective adjustments while acceptance involves release of control.",

An automated recovery support system using personal sensing and machine learning may help identify when individuals are at elevated lapse risk. Cellular communication sensing may detect dynamic changes in lapse risk and can be contextualized with self-reported, risk-relevant information about contacts. \n\nObjective: We evaluated a machine learning model predicting next-day alcohol lapse among individuals in early recovery from AUD using contextualized cellular communication data and baseline demographic and AUD characteristics. \n\nMethods: A total of 144 participants (49% male; mean age=40; 87% non-Hispanic White) with a goal of abstinence provided cellular communication data and alcohol use reports via a 4x daily EMA for up to three months. Models were trained and evaluated using repeated k-fold cross-validation. \n\nResults: The best-performing model used an elastic net algorithm and retained 13 features (median posterior auROC=0.68, 95% Bayesian credible interval (CI; [0.64, 0.71]). A baseline comparison model including only baseline features retained five features and demonstrated nearly identical performance (median auROC=0.68, 95% CI [0.64, 0.71]). \n\nConclusions: Cellular communication data capture some risk-relevant signal for alcohol lapse but do not provide incremental predictive value beyond baseline measures. Several communication features were retained in the final model with moderately sized coefficients, suggesting that aspects of social communication may be important for understanding lapse risk. Although, limitations inherent to cellular communication as a sensing method may outweigh their added value.",

Instead, it documents a radical, community-led model of care development—one that expands the possibilities for stakeholder-led innovation in mental health services. People with BPD and their families recognized an unmet need and co-created an intervention; researchers later joined to help assess program outcomes and capture impact. We describe support group design, peer facilitator training, and adaptation to online format during the COVID-19 pandemic using narrative format. We quantify changes in attendance over time (one-way ANOVAs) and participant demographics and satisfaction (n=598 survey respondents). \n\nResults: A two-year peer-driven process identified core principles and designed a peer-led support group. In the first 26 months, 138 peer-support sessions met (1383 total attendees) with significant increases in registered participants, program attendance, and waitlists. Participants were geographically diverse, likely to attend one session (72%), and reported high satisfaction. Many had never received BPD treatment (44%) or met someone else with BPD (48%).\n\nConclusions: This program demonstrates an example of stakeholder-led design of a sustainable program for people with BPD.

          "abstract": "This paper presents the Insight Development Process (IDP), a theoretical framework of propositional insight development to facilitate its scientific investigation. This framework formulates three empirically-testable propositions: transience, self-lessness, and incongruence, each defined as a perceptual mode that individuals report during advanced insight meditation. These propositions parallel classical Buddhist descriptions of the “three characteristics,” but are articulated here in a form suitable for empirical investigation and ontologically neutral analysis. The IDP differentiates two forms of insight in relation to these propositions: (1) momentary insights, defined as brief pre-reflexive shifts in perception in which experience appears consistent with one or more propositions, (2) integrated insights, defined as more durable shifts in perception, cognition, or behavior that reflect an intuitive and implicitly accessible sense of one or more propositions. Based on these formulations, we hypothesize that increasing access to these perceptual modes constitutes the primary mechanism enabling momentary insights to arise. Drawing on descriptions of Theravada Buddhist insight meditation stages in classical texts, modern practice manuals, and first-person accounts across contemplative and non-contemplative contexts, we delineate eight insight stages, each specified in terms of its characteristic patterns of momentary insights and associated experiential features. Criteria are proposed for evaluating degrees of integrated insight. We outline temporal dynamics describing how momentary insights unfold and change across the eight stages. The IDP provides operationalizable constructs suitable for empirical research, supporting hypothesis generation about the cognitive, affective, and neural mechanisms of propositional insight, and the ways in which advanced insight meditation shapes consciousness and well-being.\n\nKeywords: advanced meditation, meditative development, insight stages, meditative endpoints, Insight Development Process, propositional insight",

          "abstract": "The present research adopts a mixed-methods approach to examine the boundaries between two anger variants: an anger perceived as moral, appropriate, and justified; and an anger considered wrong and unjustified. In Study 1, we analyze participants’ narratives about their past experiences of justified and unjustified anger using qualitative thematic analysis, closed-vocabulary, and open-vocabulary text processing methods. In Study 2, we use a prototype approach to differentiate justified and unjustified anger experiences across ten theory-driven dimensions. The results reveal crucial differences in cognitive and emotional components, as well as interpersonal outcomes associated with these anger types. Participants often considered their anger to be justified when a target’s actions were perceived as immoral, unfair, harmful, or violating norms. They viewed the target’s behavior as reflecting poor moral character, expressed absolutist judgments in their writing, and experienced concurrent hostile emotions. In contrast, participants perceived their anger as unjustified when it stemmed from unrelated frustrations, misunderstandings, or overreactions to trivial offenses. Unjustified anger narratives were often reflective, and demonstrated retrospection and self-directed emotions (e.g., guilt and embarrassment). The two anger types varied considerably in their relational impact: Justified anger commonly led to strained or severed relationships, while unjustified anger prompted efforts to repair bonds. Additionally, justified anger had a stronger overlap with hate and contempt appraisals. We discuss the implications of these findings for constructing theories capable of explaining diverse anger experiences as well as developing interventions to address the maladaptive behaviors associated with anger.",

          "abstract": "Students in compulsory education spend a considerable amount of time in the classroom interacting with peers and teachers, from whom they receive feedback and signals about their academic competencies. We develop a theoretical framework that integrates the role of teachers’ evaluations, the labeling effect, the categorical judgements model, the big-fish-in-little-pond, and the rational choice theory for understanding categorical inequalities generated within the school environment induced by classroom peer comparison. We argue that teachers, via attributing marks to students, create Teacher-Induced Student Hierarchy (TISH), and the perception of one’s position in this hierarchy affects\nsubsequent educational outcomes, but heterogeneously depending on students’ ascriptive characteristics. We exploit the idiosyncratic variation generated by differential teachers' grading standards across classrooms to identify the effect of TISH. The relative student's position in the classroom hierarchy, net of her absolute performance level, raises the probability of enrolling in the academic track, the expectation of university enrolment, and levels of academic competencies. We observed that boys and students from lower SES backgrounds, who typically have weaker academic standings, are more responsive to their placement in the TISH. Some of these effects seem to stem from the influence of TISH on some socio-emotional skills.",

Moreover, it is unclear whether peer effects operate similarly across institutional contexts. This study addresses these issues through a comparative analysis of Italy and Norway, two educational systems that differ markedly in competitiveness, tracking, evaluation practices, and gender norms. Using harmonized, population-wide administrative register data, we follow three full student cohorts from Grade 5 to Grade 8. This longitudinal design allows us to control for prior achievement—an advantage unavailable in international assessments such as PISA, TIMSS, or PIRLS. We estimate value-added school fixed-effects models that exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in peer composition. Across both countries, higher average peer achievement is associated with lower individual performance, consistent with social comparison mechanisms. Exposure to top-performing peers has negative effects, while exposure to low-performing peers has positive effects. These patterns are similar across countries and do not vary systematically by gender, suggesting that peer comparison processes are remarkably stable across institutional contexts.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation is often framed as marginally important to addressing climate change, and as socio-technically difficult and ineffectual. We combine theoretical and empirical analyses to show that adaptation—especially via economic development—is actually often the dominant driver of climate-sensitive societal outcomes, especially on smaller space and time scales. This aligns adaptation with markets and governance incentives. For these reasons, widely studied climate-sensitive outcomes such as crop yields, affluence, and damage and death rates from climate-related hazards have broadly and steadily improved over the past several decades, as have indirectly climate-sensitive outcomes such as mortality from violence and self-harm. These improvements provide important context to recent pessimistic studies of adaptation that focus on outcomes’ marginal sensitivities to climate. They also underscore the importance of economic development to human well-being, and they suggest that economically costly climate policies could harm climate-sensitive outcomes. Moreover, we show that the range of plausible greenhouse gas emissions scenarios has narrowed, providing greater clarity to the temperatures and types of impacts society must adapt to. Our analyses highlight where adaptation and development are currently underappreciated in climate change research and policy.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the African Cabinet Politics (ACP) dataset, a new comprehensive data collection on cabinet politics in Sub-Saharan Africa. The dataset covers 40 countries from their independence to the end of 2019 and provides monthly information on cabinet composition, ministerial appointments, dismissals, rearrangements, and individual ministers’ tenure in office. Offering comprehensive geographical and fine-grained temporal coverage as well as a Wikidata integration that provides extensive minister-level biographical information, the ACP dataset substantially extends existing data resources on cabinet politics. The paper illustrates the analytical value of the dataset through descriptive analyses and two empirical applications. First, it documents long-term trends in cabinet size and cabinet instability, showing a steady expansion of cabinets and volatility in cabinet changes over time. Second, it examines how political regimes affect the tenure of ministers, demonstrating that dominant-party regimes exhibit the most stable cabinets, while personalist dictatorships are characterized by high turnover, with military regimes and democracies displaying similar patterns. A further application revisits the evolution of female representation in African cabinets, showing distinct trajectories for democracies and autocracies that converge over time. Accordingly, the ACP dataset provides gives scholars a new opportunity to test and refine theories of elite management and executive governance in Africa.",

Contributing to levelling this understanding beyond Western liberal media spaces, the paper provides a panoramic snapshot of the state of public service fact-checking in the controlled media spaces of Southeast Asia (SEA): 31 qualitative interviews were conducted with fact-checkers and media professionals after the January 2025 US government turnaround on then existing foreign development programmes and while two major US Big Tech sponsors were reviewing their commitments to fact-checking. What stands out upon characterising the regional fact-checking movement, is the standardly accounted-for magnitude of this—until then—predominantly US-Euro pro-democracy and corporate support. That the regional free press and digital rights activist space has acted as the birthplace of the regional fact-checking movement is however often overshadowed. This misproportion supports the tacit but flawed assumption that fact-checking in SEA is a copy of the US newsroom model of fact-checking. In turn, this assumption, firstly, eclipses the regional movement’s foundational interest in safeguarding collective memory alongside its interest in countering populist politics, secondly, befogs a movement piggybacked by corporate interests, thirdly, fails to account for a fact-checking culture not originally centred around data for building quantitative objective truth.",

          "abstract": "Little causal evidence exists regarding the long-term impacts of natural disasters on crime. Using a balanced panel of county-level crime data spanning 1980–2020, this paper estimates the short- and long-run effects of hurricanes of varying intensities that affected U.S. counties between 1990 and 2010. Findings indicate that while minor hurricanes have little effect on crime, major hurricanes cause significant increases in property crime. In the decade following exposure to major hurricanes, property crime rates rise by 8.5% relative to the baseline mean, imposing an estimated per-capita social cost of $120 on treated counties. These effects are largely driven by evacuation orders and selective out-migration in the short run and by declining per-capita incomes in the long run. Furthermore, hurricane effects are disproportionately larger for counties with less disaster experience and lower incomes, which risk losing 1.4% and 2.2% of per capita GDP, respectively, due to hurricane-induced crime. Overall, the findings underscore the need for greater resource allocation toward vulnerable communities and increased investment in disaster resilience measures to mitigate the economic and social consequences of climate change.",

          "abstract": "This review article explores body mapping as a community-based, participatory method to introduce Feminist-Informed Yoga (FIY) to marginalized mothers with addictions in a mid-sized Canadian city. Drawing on my graduate research and volunteer experience, the article situates “mother” broadly to include anyone who identifies as a mother and defines marginalized mothers as those facing systemic barriers related to race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability. The article contextualizes the intersecting impacts of trauma, colonization, and systemic violence on these mothers and highlights how body mapping functions as a therapeutic and advocacy tool enabling the reclamation of cultural identity and self-care. FIY integrates trauma-informed, feminist principles with Indigenous and South Asian spiritual teachings to support holistic healing and empowerment. The article also discusses the importance of culturally grounded, trauma-informed care, addressing the ongoing challenges marginalized mothers face within health and social systems. Through the blending of body mapping and FIY, this work advocates healing as a political praxis that re-centers marginalized voices and knowledge in pursuit of justice and wellness.",

It challenges dominant academic norms, surfaces internalized oppression, and invites accountability and collective care. This work calls for academic spaces that support reflexive, embodied, and relational inquiry.

Using the recent Labubu phenomenon as a qualitative case study, this paper develops a conceptual framework for understanding how digital platforms, identity signaling, and memetic repetition interact to produce rapid consumer adoption. Drawing on literature from consumer behavior, cultural sociology, and attention economics, the analysis situates Labubu not as an isolated trend but as an illustrative example of broader dynamics shaping contemporary markets. The paper contributes a theoretical model of viral market formation and offers implications for marketers, researchers, and platform strategists seeking to understand cultural acceleration in digitally mediated environments.",

          "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

          "abstract": "Young people’s career aspirations are shaped by persistent gender divides, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which are in high demand and often associated with prestige and high wages. This study examines how the local prevalence of STEM occupations is associated with adolescents’ early aspirations for STEM careers. Drawing on data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), linked with district-level information on local labor markets (NUTS-3), we apply logistic regression models to explore gendered patterns of STEM aspirations. Findings show that boys are more likely to aspire to STEM careers in local contexts with a high prevalence of STEM occupations, which is mainly due to increased aspirations for non-academic STEM careers. By contrast, girls’ career aspirations do not significantly vary with local STEM prevalence, even in local contexts with relatively high shares of women employed in STEM. These results suggest that STEM-intensive local labor markets reinforce gendered patterns of STEM aspirations, especially among adolescents oriented towards non-academic career paths. Efforts to promote gender equity in STEM (e.g., school interventions) would benefit from incorporating strategies that address the segregating impact of local labor market structures.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has captured public attention. While MAHA espouses some positions supported by peer-reviewed research (e.g., ultraprocessed foods are harmful to health) it simultaneously promotes scientifically dubious claims (e.g., vaccines are dangerous). How can social scientists make sense of these incongruent positions surrounding public health, science, and risk? To answer this question, this paper systematically examines the discursive politics of MAHA’s political arm by analyzing official government communications published during the first year of the second Trump administration. It finds that key MAHA actors root their claims in a “populist science” that speaks the language of science while claiming to disembed knowledge systems from corrupt institutions that harm ordinary people. By constructing a dichotomy between “good” and “captured” science MAHA rhetorically consolidates control over what counts as legitimate expertise. MAHA’s political discourse strategically ignores peer-reviewed evidence linking chronic disease to social inequality, racism, and economic disparities, revealing MAHA’s alignment with nationalist, anti-regulatory politics. Rather than democratize risk governance, MAHA substitutes one set of institutional authorities for another. The paper demonstrates how science populism functions as a governance strategy that reconfigures the boundaries of legitimate expertise to align with nationalist and anti-regulatory politics.",

          "authors": "Hiroshi Honda; Hitoshi Kakidani; Motonori Tomita; Tetsuo Nakano; Hideki Tohda",
          "abstract": "Industrial biotechnology plays a central role in contemporary innovation systems; however, the professional positioning of industrial bioengineers within international engineering qualification frameworks remains insufficiently clarified. This study presents a data-informed institutional analysis of how industrial bioengineering is recognized within professional qualification systems by combining a comparative review of international qualification frameworks with quantitative analysis of membership statistics from Japan’s Professional Engineer system. The review indicates that bioengineering is most often positioned primarily within biomedical engineering, while comprehensive qualification categories encompassing genetic engineering, cell engineering, and industrial bioprocess engineering, such as those institutionalized in Japan, are rarely explicitly articulated at the international level. Moreover, analysis of division-level data across 20 engineering disciplines in Japan further shows that organizational engagement, measured by organization rates, exhibits a negative but statistically non-significant association with division size. This trend suggests that in large divisions where holding the qualification itself provides practical advantages, such as preferential evaluation in public procurement, incentives for active participation in professional organizations may be relatively weaker. In contrast, smaller divisions display greater variability in organization rates and appear more sensitive to qualitative institutional factors. Within this context, the biotechnology division is distinctive, exhibiting both the highest organization rate (59.4%) and the highest female representation (13.4%) among all divisions. These characteristics are consistent with the nature of industrial biotechnology, a field characterized by rapid technological advances and persistent ethical, safety, and regulatory challenges that require continuous human interaction and collective professional governance. Using Japan’s Professional Engineer (Biotechnology and Bioengineering) system as an implemented reference, this study highlights the importance of institutionalizing industrial bioengineering through professional qualification frameworks and encourages economies to consider similar approaches to support sustained professional engagement.",

          "abstract": "Embodied and relational approaches to socio-emotional development increasingly emphasize lived experience, interaction, and situated awareness, yet few frameworks systematically integrate movement-based practices with established psychotherapeutic theory. This theoretical review examines the convergence between Argentine Tango (tango) and Gestalt Therapy (GT), proposing an embodied, relational framework for socio-emotional development and relational awareness. Tango is conceptualized as an improvisational, dyadic practice that operationalizes core GT principles, including contact, field regulation, phenomenological awareness, experiential cycling, and creative adjustment. Drawing on empirical findings from psychology, neuroscience, and movement science, the review synthesizes evidence indicating that tango participation supports emotional regulation, empathy, social bonding, embodied awareness, and motor-cognitive integration. Through this synthesis, tango is positioned as a structured somatic laboratory for experiential GT processes and relational learning, offering a concrete context in which therapeutic mechanisms unfold in vivo. Despite promising outcomes, existing research remains predominantly outcome-focused, and systematic, process-oriented investigation of tango’s specific mechanisms of change is limited. This framework establishes a foundation for future interdisciplinary research and applied exploration of tango-informed GT practice across therapeutic, educational, and movement-based contexts.",

Drawing from necropolitics, carceral geography, and political ecology, I\npropose carceral socio-ecological violence as a framework for analyzing how incarceration\nproduces environmental violence that extends beyond confinement. Prisons contaminate\necosystems, dismantle community knowledge systems, and undermine the social cohesion\nrequired for collective survival. EPA compliance data from 232 facilities across thirteen states\n(2019–2024) reveal sustained and extreme violations: wastewater discharges exceeded federal\ntoxicity thresholds by 2,400%, and radiological contamination persisted for twelve consecutive\nreporting cycles. Over 72% of these violations occurred in communities facing structural\npoverty, racial segregation, and political disenfranchisement—elements of a broader strategy of\nstate-sanctioned abandonment. The essay examines the 2025 rollback of environmental\nprotections, including the closure of environmental justice offices, deletion of compliance and\nviolation records, and mass exemption of industrial polluters from federal law. In response, I\npropose a community-based Environmental Justice Governance Framework rooted in collective\nautonomy, including independent monitoring networks, direct community control over\nenvironmental and public health decisions, and decentralized resource infrastructures. Carceral\nsocio-ecological violence exposes how mass incarceration, environmental degradation, and\nepistemic erasure function as interlocking systems of racial control.

          "abstract": "In this study, we propose and evaluate a new framework for understanding “lowest-low” fertility in East Asia, emphasizing the link between the desire for children and marriage. Recognizing that delayed and declining marriage is the primary reason for low fertility in the region, we posit that marriage decisions are shaped by intentions or incentives (not) to have children. We evaluate this hypothesis using Japan as a case, a society where parenthood is an integral part of the “package” of normative family expectations accompanying marriage, especially for women. After confirming that attitudes toward marriage and fertility are strongly correlated, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of first marriage using nationally representative longitudinal data. We find that, net of marriage desires, (1) women and men with no desire to have children marry significantly later than those who desire children, and (2) uncertain attitudes toward parenthood are also associated with later marriage for men, but not women. The link between negative or uncertain fertility desires and delayed marriage among men is partially explained by their lower engagement in efforts to find a marriage partner. These results provide insights for policy discussions about declining fertility in East Asia, especially concerns that pro-natalist policies are mistargeted.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the characteristics of masculinity among Haitian immigrants in Brazil, identifying the challenges and opportunities for the expression of Haitian chivalrousness or kindness in a context of migratory subalternization. It focused on two objectives: to analyze the practice of masculinity of Haitian immigrant men in the Brazilian context, and to understand the role of experience reports in advancing the process of social integration of Haitian immigrants. The present research is a qualitative experience report involving 11 Haitian men living in the cities of Londrina- PR, Cascavel-PR, and Dourados-MS, as well as three immigrant wives. The theory of subaltern realism was used to critically ground the central theme of Subaltern Masculinity. The results reveal the importance of the concept of \"Haitian kindness\" in understanding Haitian masculinity, which is characterized by values such as respect for elders, honor, courtesy, and care for people. However, this kindness is often misinterpreted and contributes to the subordination of Haitian men in Brazil. It revealed the need for actions for social integration and cultural literacy that should be aligned with public policies to combat discrimination, subalternity and stereotypes in the Brazilian context. It is possible to conclude that teaching Haitian culture, mediated by Artificial Intelligence (AI), and implementing cultural training platforms can help to deconstruct prejudiced statements.",

          "authors": "Jefferson Pooley",
          "abstract": "This paper traces the history of the U.S. behavioral sciences movement: a self-understood vanguard of U.S. social scientists—all the mainline disciplines except economics—forged in shared World War II service, maintained through funder-enabled networks of the early Cold War, and characterized by a mix of nomothetic confidence and aspirational scientism, until the movement’s decline in the mid-1960s. The behavioral sciences, the paper argues, were a social and intellectual formation with a mission—a movement, in other words. They were U.S. sociologists, political scientists, psychologists, and anthropologists, joined by a small number of like-minded economists. Most them had worked alongside one another in the World War II propaganda and morale bureaucracy, and were soon brought back together in the early Cold War by foundations and the military funders. They defined themselves against what they saw as a pre-scientific, speculative, meliorist social science, and—to a significant if lesser extent—against the emerging mainstream of postwar economics. Their aim was to promote an alternative vision for social science, one characterized by scientific rigor, nomothetic theory-building, and a broadly empiricist picture of knowledge accumulation. They aspired to fold mathematics into their methodological toolkits. They embraced the view that team-based interdisciplinary projects centered on applied problems could contribute to theoretical progress. They were a small, tight-knit community of American social scientists, clustered at elite institutions and in relative generational synchrony. Their movement, owing to shifts in patronage, the scale of the U.S. university system, and revelations about clandestine ties to the U.S. national security state, was in sharp decline by the mid-1960s.",

          "abstract": "Traditional service-learning models often prioritize student learning over community impact, relegating community partners to secondary roles as educators and reinforcing power imbalances between universities and local organizations. This paper presents a critical service-learning model designed to address these limitations through two key innovations: (1) fully embedding a community partner as a co-designer and co-instructor, and (2) integrating professional project management to provide structured support during and beyond the semester. We examine the implementation of this model in a sociology course co-led by a faculty member, a community leader, and a staff member with project management expertise. The course equally emphasized academic learning, relationship building, and community-based work, balancing student outcomes with the community partner’s vision. Findings suggest enhanced student learning, deeper social justice engagement, and tangible community outcomes, although course organization, and continuity remained challenges. Nevertheless, this model offers a more ethical, reciprocal, and impactful framework for community-engaged learning.",

          "abstract": "This report was produced within COST Action CA21150 “Parental Leave Policies and Social Sustainability\n(Sustainability@Leave)”, Working Group 2, and provides a systematic assessment of knowledge gaps in\nEuropean research on parenting leave and social inequalities.\n\nParenting leave policies constitute a key pillar of social sustainability, with demonstrated relevance for\ngender equality, labour market participation, health, and child well-being. While European research on\nparenting leave has expanded significantly over recent decades, the available evidence remains\nfragmented and uneven. Drawing on a narrative review of more than 400 publications from 24 European\ncountries, this report maps which dimensions of inequality have been most extensively studied and\nidentifies where substantial blind spots persist across countries, social groups, and levels of analysis.\nThe review shows that research has focused predominantly on gender, particularly mothers’ employment\ntrajectories and fathers’ take-up of leave. By contrast, other crucial dimensions of inequality, including\nhealth, disability, well-being, citizenship, ethnicity, non-standard employment, and diverse family forms,\nremain marginal in the literature. In addition, most studies implicitly centre on parents in stable, standard\nemployment, resulting in limited evidence on the experiences of precarious workers, the self-employed,\nmigrants, and low-income families. These biases restrict the capacity of current research to evaluate\nwhether parenting leave policies reduce inequalities broadly or primarily benefit already advantaged\ngroups.\n\nThe report makes a central contribution by systematically linking policy design features (eligibility rules,\nbenefit levels, individualisation, flexibility) with policy outcomes (leave take-up and longer-term inequality\neffects) and by highlighting the need for more intersectional, multi-level, and comparative research. It\ndemonstrates that although a gender lens remains central to parental leave policies, future research\nshould adopt a broader perspective to examine how multiple inequalities intersect. Strengthening data\ninfrastructures, improving the measurement of leave use, and integrating qualitative and quantitative\napproaches are essential for advancing policy-relevant evidence.\n\nPolicy recommendations emphasise the importance of inclusive parenting leave designs that\naccommodate diverse employment trajectories, ensure adequate income replacement, and support\nindividual entitlements for both parents. The report also underlines the need for systematic monitoring\nof the EU Work–Life Balance Directive, not only in terms of legal compliance but with regard to its\ndistributional effects across social groups and countries. By identifying where evidence is missing, this\nreport provides a strategic agenda for future research aimed at improving the inequality-reducing\npotential of parenting leave policies in Europe.",

          "abstract": "In this pre-registered experiment, we describe how we use a full-fledged serious game, developed in collaboration with energy modellers, energy system experts, and game designers, as an experimental treatment in a large-scale population survey in Switzerland. While previous research has used serious games mostly for targeted and relatively small groups, we assess whether serious gaming has the potential to serve as an effective information tool for the broader population. More specifically, we test whether serious games can influence individual opinion formation on complex issues, such as the energy transition, arguing that the immersive nature of a serious game may be more effective than conventional information treatments in triggering learning effects and ultimately influencing opinion formation. Based on our results, we show that playing the game did not, on a general level, produce any significant effects on either efficacy or policy support. However, the game led to varying reactions among players and influenced support for expanding specific energy sources in accordance with the game’s implications. In light of these nuanced results, we discuss implications for researches and stakeholders.",

          "abstract": "Mixed-origin individuals constitute a key group in assimilation theory, but their socioeconomic attainments are curiously under-researched in the quantitative assimilation literature. Drawing on population-wide Norwegian register data, we analyze how children of mixed origin fare in education compared to children of two immigrant parents, using their native majority peers as a reference. When it comes to educational achievements, we find that children of mixed origin are located between a disadvantaged second generation and the native majority. However, once parental SES is accounted for, the second generation exhibits significantly higher achievements, revealing an advantage that is absent among children of mixed origin. When it comes to educational ambitions, the second generation is advantaged in both absolute and relative terms and, once again, we find no such advantage among children of mixed origin. There are essential variations across country backgrounds. Still, the overall pattern suggests that while children of mixed origin ‘catch up’ to natives in terms of educational achievements, they lose their ‘edge’ vis-à-vis the second generation, particularly in terms of ambitions. This conclusion has important implications for theoretical models of how assimilation processes unfold and warrants further research into patterns of assimilation among the growing mixed-origin population.",

          "abstract": "Data donation studies are increasingly used to enrich survey data with digital behavioral data, but evidence on who participates - and who does not - remains mixed and difficult to generalize. This study explores the potential of enriching an election survey with donated Google Search data during the 2025 German federal election. Using a Bivariate Probit Model with Partial Observability, we model participation as a two-stage process, examining both willingness to participate and actual completion. We further test whether explicitly naming Google in the invitation affects participation.\nIn line with prior work, younger individuals were more likely to opt in and complete the study. Gender differences were limited to willingness, and no systematic variation by education was observed. Naming Google in the invitation affected willingness, but not completion. Notably, we examine participation by party vote, contributing to a better understanding of participation by political leaning. Voters of the Green Party were more willing to participate and together with FDP voters, also more likely to complete the donation, controlling for age, gender, and education. This may indicate a political skew in donated data, as these voter groups tend to be younger, more liberal, and possibly more trusting of science.",

          "abstract": "Robotic surgical systems have advanced from assisted devices to semi-autonomous platforms capable of independent procedural actions. Yet healthcare organizations continue to manage these systems as conventional capital equipment, creating a widening gap between technological capability and administrative readiness. This paper argues that the dominant bottleneck in realizing value from surgical robotics is not clinical capability but managerial unpreparedness. Drawing on socio-technical systems theory, high-reliability organization principles, and dynamic capabilities frameworks, we propose that surgical robotics should be conceptualized as a complex adaptive system requiring coordinated governance across six interdependent domains: strategic oversight, financial management, workforce configuration, operational integration, risk and liability structures, and data governance. We introduce the Robotic Surgical Administrative Readiness (RSAR) framework to guide organizational assessment and strategic planning. Synthesizing recent literature on surgical robotics integration, the paper concludes that failures in robotic surgery will increasingly be managerial failures, and that healthcare technology management must evolve from a support function to a strategic governance role. We outline a research agenda for empirical validation and discuss policy implications for accreditation and capital oversight.",

          "abstract": "Mountain tourism in Nepal has expanded rapidly, particularly in the Annapurna region, raising concerns about environmental pressure and the sustainability of trekking practices. While trekkers’ experience has often been linked to satisfaction and pro-environmental behaviour, empirical evidence from Himalayan contexts remains limited. This study investigates the relationship between trekkers’ experience, satisfaction, and sustainable behaviour, and examines the role of guiding practices within the framework of Nepal’s trekking policies.\nThis study examines the relationship between trekkers’ experience, satisfaction, and sustainable behaviour in the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), Nepal, using empirical survey data. A quantitative, causal-comparative research design was employed, drawing on primary data collected from trekkers through a structured questionnaire administered in situ. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, multiple regression, and mediation testing. \nFindings indicate that trekking experience is positively associated with both satisfaction and sustainable behaviour. However, satisfaction does not demonstrate a statistically significant mediating effect between experience and sustainable behaviour in this dataset (Sobel test, p = 0.1205). The results also reveal a notable gap between government policy advocating compulsory guiding and actual trekking practices, with majority (64%) of trekkers undertaking treks without guides where a low resource mountain tourism infrastructure is clearly identified for implication of rules.\nThe study contributes to debates on sustainable mountain tourism by highlighting the importance of experience quality and governance mechanisms rather than satisfaction alone in shaping responsible behaviour. Policy implications are discussed in relation to guiding regulation, visitor management, and sustainability in high-altitude destinations.\nKeywords: Trekking experience; Sustainable behaviour; Annapurna",

This Perspective offers a behavioural explanation for this \nparadox. We argue that disjoint evaluation regimes operating at different levels of the scientific system \ngenerate a stable but epistemically inefficient equilibrium. Author-level evaluation is largely neutral \nwith respect to publication volume, whereas journal-level evaluation is sensitive to output volume \nthrough denominator-based performance indicators.\nThis structural asymmetry reshapes selection behaviour. Using a minimal illustrative model, we show \nhow variance-sensitive editorial evaluation predictably suppresses high-uncertainty contributions \nwhile favouring low-risk, centrally aligned work. The resulting equilibrium gives rise to a constellation of \nbehavioural adaptations, including upstream fragmentation, editorial conservatism, suppression of \nepistemic outliers, and convergence in both scientific content and narrative form.\nUnlike accounts centred on funding scarcity or individual risk aversion, this framework explains \nselective convergence as an outcome of routine evaluation dynamics rather than exceptional pressures \nor misconduct. By focusing on selection geometry rather than individual motivation, the Perspective \nprovides a unifying interpretation of persistent patterns in contemporary scientific production and \ncommunication.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we propose and evaluate a new framework for understanding “lowest-low” fertility in East Asia, emphasizing the link between the desire for children and marriage. Recognizing that delayed and declining marriage is the primary reason for low fertility in the region, we posit that marriage decisions are shaped by intentions or incentives (not) to have children. We evaluate this hypothesis using Japan as a case, a society where parenthood is an integral part of the “package” of normative family expectations accompanying marriage, especially for women. After confirming that attitudes toward marriage and fertility are strongly correlated, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of first marriage using nationally representative longitudinal data. We find that, net of marriage desires, (1) women and men with no desire to have children marry significantly later than those who desire children, and (2) uncertain attitudes toward parenthood are also associated with later marriage for men, but not women. The link between negative or uncertain fertility desires and delayed marriage among men is partially explained by their lower engagement in efforts to find a marriage partner. These results provide insights for policy discussions about declining fertility in East Asia, especially concerns that pro-natalist policies are mistargeted.",

          "authors": "Mike McLeod",
          "abstract": "The UK grassroots music venue sector faces an existential crisis, with venue numbers declining from 960 in 2014 to 810 by 2025, representing a 16% contraction over just eleven years. Whilst sector-specific reports document this decline through economic metrics and policy analyses, such fragmented approaches obscure the systemic nature of the crisis. This paper applies Ostrom's Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework to integrate longitudinal data from Music Venue Trust annual reports (2014–2025), parliamentary inquiries, and case studies into a comprehensive diagnosis of system vulnerability. The analysis reveals that venue fragility emerges not from isolated market failures but from cross-subsystem interactions: insecure property rights (93% tenancy with 18-month average leases) interact with gentrification pressures and noise complaint enforcement to create reinforcing feedback loops driving accelerating decline. Two critical feedback mechanisms are quantified: (1) a gentrification death spiral where cultural venues attract residents, raising property values and rents until venues close, eliminating the cultural amenity; and (2) an arena substitution effect where venue loss reduces touring route viability, concentrating performances in large venues and further eroding grassroots revenue. System dynamics modelling projects critical thresholds: below approximately 700 venues, regional touring becomes unviable; below 600 venues, the national touring circuit collapses entirely. The sector approaches these thresholds within 5–10 years under current trajectories. Governance analysis against Ostrom's design principles reveals fundamental institutional failures, scoring just 46% compliance, with critical gaps in proportional benefit-sharing (Principle 2: 0.5/3) and rights recognition (Principle 7: 0.5/3). Scenario modelling demonstrates that whilst financial interventions (levy, VAT reduction) provide necessary relief, only structural governance reforms—particularly community ownership models, statutory Agent of Change protections, and collective-choice arrangements—can shift the system from degradation to recovery pathways. This integrated SES analysis reveals leverage points invisible in sectoral studies and provides strategic guidance for adaptive governance interventions before irreversible tipping points are reached.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a formal methodological framework for diagnosing and addressing challenges within urban music ecosystems, with a focused application to small venue resilience. Building upon the integrated ecological framework for popular music studies established in Waxing Ecological (McLeod, 2024), this work translates ecological theory into a structured analytical protocol. I adapt and operationalise Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework—including its core subsystems, multi-tiered variables, and design principles for commons governance—to model the complex interdependencies characterising urban music ecologies. The methodology integrates insights from Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory to account for non-linear dynamics, emergence, and feedback. It provides researchers and policymakers with a replicable, stepwise process for system mapping, variable identification, resilience assessment, and the design of adaptive, polycentric governance strategies. While demonstrated through the critical problem of small venue sustainability, the framework is designed as a flexible diagnostic toolkit for a wide range of problem sets within cultural ecosystems, moving decisively from ecological metaphor to rigorous socio-ecological analysis.\n\nA companion paper (McLeod, 2026) demonstrates the full empirical application of this six-phase protocol to the UK's grassroots music venue ecosystem using Music Venue Trust longitudinal data (2014–2025).",

          "abstract": "The October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks against Israel (10/7) represented the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. However, almost immediately after the attacks, celebrations of the pogrom and protests against Israel broke out in cities around the Western world. The author argues that the upward sweep of antisemitism witnessed since 10/7 cannot be satisfactorily explained in terms of radicalization or simplistic stage models. By definition, radicalization is an increase in extremist attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions relative to default societal norms. Thus, the radicalization hypothesis implies that the output of radicalization (in this case, antisemitism) is not normalized. This is unambiguously contradicted by evidence collected from Jewish victims of antisemitism before and after 10/7. Taken together, the evidence indicates that antisemitism has been renormalizing long before 10/7 and it is that process which set the preconditions for its explosive rise witnessed after 10/7. There is a danger in misattributing the current wave of antisemitism to radicalization as such explanations can inadvertently serve to minimize the breadth and severity of the problem.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has captured public attention. While MAHA espouses some positions supported by peer-reviewed research (e.g., ultraprocessed foods are harmful to health) it simultaneously promotes scientifically dubious claims (e.g., vaccines are dangerous). How can social scientists make sense of these incongruent positions surrounding public health, science, and risk? To answer this question, this paper systematically examines the discursive politics of MAHA’s political arm by analyzing official government communications published during the first year of the second Trump administration. It finds that key MAHA actors root their claims in a “populist science” that speaks the language of science while claiming to disembed knowledge systems from corrupt institutions that harm ordinary people. By constructing a dichotomy between “good” and “captured” science MAHA rhetorically consolidates control over what counts as legitimate expertise. MAHA’s political discourse strategically ignores peer-reviewed evidence linking chronic disease to social inequality, racism, and economic disparities, revealing MAHA’s alignment with nationalist, anti-regulatory politics. Rather than democratize risk governance, MAHA substitutes one set of institutional authorities for another. The paper demonstrates how science populism functions as a governance strategy that reconfigures the boundaries of legitimate expertise to align with nationalist and anti-regulatory politics.",

          "abstract": "Human beings are universally vulnerable and depend on care throughout the life course, yet economic analyses typically start from assumptions of individual autonomy and overlook the relational conditions that sustain productive functioning. This Article introduces an analytical and diagnostic framework that distinguishes primary vulnerability, defined as observable care needs, from vicarious vulnerability, defined as the cumulative exposure borne by caregivers when care is weakly shared or institutionally buffered. Using harmonized cross‑national indicators, we construct transparent indices of primary vulnerability, vicarious vulnerability, and societal capacity to sustain care, and map their alignment across countries. The results reveal systematic mismatches between care needs, caregiver exposure, and institutional capacity, with caregiver burdens more frequently exceeding what existing systems absorb. The contribution is diagnostic rather than causal: by rendering caregiver exposure statistically visible, the framework provides tools for comparative research on productivity, inequality, and institutional design, and for identifying structural vulnerabilities that remain hidden in standard economic and development metrics.",

This Perspective offers a behavioural explanation for this \nparadox. We argue that disjoint evaluation regimes operating at different levels of the scientific system \ngenerate a stable but epistemically inefficient equilibrium. Author-level evaluation is largely neutral \nwith respect to publication volume, whereas journal-level evaluation is sensitive to output volume \nthrough denominator-based performance indicators.\nThis structural asymmetry reshapes selection behaviour. Using a minimal illustrative model, we show \nhow variance-sensitive editorial evaluation predictably suppresses high-uncertainty contributions \nwhile favouring low-risk, centrally aligned work. The resulting equilibrium gives rise to a constellation of \nbehavioural adaptations, including upstream fragmentation, editorial conservatism, suppression of \nepistemic outliers, and convergence in both scientific content and narrative form.\nUnlike accounts centred on funding scarcity or individual risk aversion, this framework explains \nselective convergence as an outcome of routine evaluation dynamics rather than exceptional pressures \nor misconduct. By focusing on selection geometry rather than individual motivation, the Perspective \nprovides a unifying interpretation of persistent patterns in contemporary scientific production and \ncommunication.",

          "abstract": "Menstrual education shapes how individuals learn to interpret bodily symptoms and decide when to seek care. In the United States, menstrual education often emphasizes hygiene, discretion, and endurance, while providing limited guidance on biological variability or indicators of abnormality. This study examines how these educational narratives influence perceptions of normal menstrual bleeding and contribute to delayed care-seeking and diagnosis.\n\nUsing a qualitative, multi-method design, we conducted five focus groups with college-aged women (n = 33) and semi-structured interviews with women diagnosed with endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (n = 12). Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to explore sources and content of menstrual education, normalization of pain and irregularity, and pathways to symptom recognition and diagnosis.\n\nParticipants described learning about menstruation primarily through family and school-based education that prioritized management and concealment over biological understanding. Pain and irregular bleeding were commonly framed as routine, leading many participants to interpret persistent or severe symptoms as normal variation. For those with diagnosed gynecological conditions, this misrecognition delayed care-seeking and contributed to prolonged diagnostic timelines. Limited menstrual health knowledge also shaped early clinical encounters, reinforcing reassurance and dismissal.\n\nThese findings highlight menstrual education as an upstream social process that structures symptom interpretation before individuals enter healthcare settings. Reframing menstrual education to emphasize biological variability and symptom legitimacy may support earlier recognition of abnormal symptoms and reduce diagnostic delay.",

While elite-level rhetoric—particularly among radical right actors—has grown more adversarial, it remains unclear whether similar affective divisions have emerged among citizens. Using cross-national survey data, this paper examines affective polarization over climate change in France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, and Poland. Mirroring real-world debates that pit stricter climate protection against economic prosperity, we assess mutual affect between individuals on either side of this division, and estimate polarization across the full attitudinal spectrum. Across all countries, we find significant affective polarization with a clear asymmetric pattern: pro-climate citizens express clear in-group warmth and out-group coldness, whereas pro-growth citizens show little affective opposition and in some cases even evaluate climate-oriented individuals more positively than their own group. Moreover, affective polarization among pro-climate respondents is not associated with reduced political tolerance. These findings suggest that mass affective polarization over climate action is less entrenched than elite discourse implies.",

          "authors": "Fabio Anobile; Alberto Costantiello; Carlo Drago; Massimo Arnone; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the connection between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and the risk of geopolitics, as defined by the Geopolitical Risk (GPR) index. The concept of geopolitical risk is conventionally defined as the direct result of political incidents, war, and international tensions. The current study argues that the concept should be understood in a more structural and sustainable manner, relating to the underlying forces driving geopolitical risk. The main research question is whether and how the three pillars of the ESG factors contribute to the explanation and understanding of cross-country and over-time variations in geopolitical risk. In an effort to avoid the information losses associated with the aggregate nature of the ESG index, the three factors are considered separately and the three pillars are analyzed individually. The empirical context is a balanced cross-country panel data set including 42 countries over the 2000-2023 time period. The data for the three factors is obtained from the World Bank dataset in an effort to standardize and compare the data in a cross-country and cross-time manner. The GPR index is used to measure the level of geopolitical risk and is defined by Dario Caldara and Matteo Iacoviello. The GPR index captures the level of geopolitical tensions based on the analysis of media signals. The combination of the three sources allows for the direct connection and correlation between the three factors and the internationally recognized GPR index. The paper uses an integrated methodological approach that combines the results from three different approaches. The first method uses panel data analysis in an effort to identify the average marginal effects while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The second method uses the technique of clustering in an effort to identify structural patterns and divide the countries into groups based on their unique characteristics and risk profiles. The third method uses machine learning regressions and nonparametric analysis in an effort to capture the complex relationships and interactions in the data. The three-step method is used for each pillar in an effort to ensure consistency and comparability. The results suggest that the three factors contribute to the GPR index in a unique manner. The environment and energy structure contribute to the GPR index as a risk multiplier, the social factor is related to the exposure to instability, and the governance factor is a central stabilizing factor. The paper makes a unique contribution to the literature by defining the concept of the three factors and their relationship to the GPR index in a unique and sustainable manner.",

          "authors": "Chia-Jung Tsai; Clemens Lechner; Dorothée Behr; Ulrike Efu Nkong; Anke Radinger",
          "abstract": "Comparable questionnaire translation is essential for drawing valid conclusions in cross-cultural survey research. Sound translation methodology, including the use of adequate personnel, is seen as crucial for reaching this goal (Harkness 2003). Recommended methodology should be empirically backed and stay tuned to latest developments, such as machine translation. Against this backdrop, to investigate the potential effect of varied translators’ backgrounds and machine translation on the statistical properties of surveys, we conducted an experiment in which an English questionnaire was translated into German by 16 professional translators and 16 social scientists; translations were subsequently fielded in web surveys. We introduced two translation conditions: translation from scratch and post-editing (machine translation corrected by a human translator). To investigate the quality of the survey data from these 32 translation versions (approx. 250 responses each), we use standardized mean distance and Cohen’s d with the official translation as a benchmark. We have four key findings: First, the resulting statistical means of the survey items vary, sometimes substantially, across translations. Second, post-editing is associated with a reduced gap between the survey data from the experimental questionnaires and the official translation, and it also lowers the variability among different translations. Third, when translating from scratch, social scientists are more likely to produce translations leading to statistical outliers of survey data. Fourth, post-editing can lead to systematic bias for both social scientists and professional translators if translation errors made by the machine are not identified and corrected. This study highlights to what extent decisions concerning the choice of translators and the integration of machine translation can impact the statistical properties of survey data. We offer evidence to implement recommendations for good practices in translation protocols to enhance data comparability in cross-cultural studies.",

I argue that the distinction between taking from the rich and giving to the poor is essential to understand the impact of disasters. I expect natural disasters to not spark demands to “soak the rich” because their unfair advantage is less visible than is the case after other economic shocks. I theorize natural hazards raise demands to redistribute to the poor because these events force close experiences with socio-economic others. Combining variation in exposure to Japan’s 2011 devastating earthquake with representative panel data, results are consistent with my propositions. Even though beliefs in the role of luck increased across the board, demands to redistribute from the rich decreased after the disaster and demands for pro-poor redistribution increased in affected areas. These findings set natural hazards apart from other types of economic shocks such as job loss, financial crises, or mass warfare.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how emotions shape the psychological processes underlying the correction of political misperceptions and how the source of corrective information interacts with these emotional dynamics. Using two scenario-based survey experiments conducted in the US and UK (N=3,610), we examine the effects of corrective information about the anthropogenic causes of climate change when delivered by either experts or citizens’ assemblies. We find that corrective information consistently elicits heightened negative emotions (e.g., anger, frustration, anxiety) and suppresses positive emotions (e.g., happiness, enthusiasm). Importantly, only two discrete emotions—anxiety and empathy—significantly predict greater willingness to revise misperceptions. Contrary to expectations, the source of corrective information does not produce differential emotional or behavioural effects. These findings advance understanding of the emotional mechanisms influencing misperception correction, highlight the nuanced role of specific emotions in shaping corrective behaviour, and contribute to the literature on citizen-centred political institutions and their public influence. Our results have broader implications for research on the emotional foundations of political beliefs and opinion formation in polarized contexts.",

          "abstract": "The paper analyses the breakup of Yugoslavia, the escalation of the Bosnian war, and the evolution of international peace diplomacy, in order to clarify the political and military conditions that led to the 1995 Dayton Accords. It argues that Yugoslavia’s collapse stemmed not from a simple state breakup but from the interaction of complex ethnic configurations, deep economic crisis, and nationalist mobilisation by political elites, especially hardline Serbian nationalism which shattered federal cohesion and made Bosnia and Herzegovina’s multiethnic landscape a focal point of violent contestation and international concern. Comparing Slovenia and Croatia, where ethnic homogeneity, limited territorial objectives, and early international recognition facilitated relatively short conflicts, with Bosnia, where highly mixed populations and overlapping territorial claims produced protracted, all‑out war, the paper shows why Bosnia required full‑scale external intervention. Humanitarian and strategic crises such as the Sarajevo siege, the Srebrenica massacre, and mass displacement exposed the powerlessness of traditional UN peacekeeping and the ineffectiveness of diplomacy without credible force. The study then traces how fragmented and militarily unsupported early initiatives by the UN, EU, and the United States gradually gave way, under the pressure of changing battlefield dynamics, sanctions, domestic politics in Western states, and U.S. congressional pressure to a more unified Western strategy that combined military pressure with coercive diplomacy. It highlights the decisive role of active U.S. engagement, which shifted from conflict management to conflict resolution and leveraged the interests of Milošević, Tuđman, and Izetbegović to push negotiations forward. Overall, the thesis concludes that the Bosnian conflict was structurally produced by intertwined domestic and international factors, and that an effective peace settlement became possible only when military and diplomatic instruments were aligned under a strategy capable of exerting clear coercive leverage, offering broader lessons about the possibilities and limits of international intervention in civil wars.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the underexplored impact of violence against politicians on citizens’ acceptance of violence and their willingness to engage in politics. By focusing on citizens, it addresses a critical gap in research, which has largely emphasized how violence affects politicians rather than the public. While existing studies demonstrate that political violence influences politicians’ behavior and discourse, impacting representative elements of democracy, there is limited insight into how such incidents shape citizens’ engagement after learning about violence. Although citizens generally condemn violence against politicians in the abstract, it remains unclear whether their own political engagement is impacted and varies based on the target of the incident. We theorize that the impact of violence against political figures on political engagement varies by (1) partisanship; (2) political role (elite or activist) and (3) the gender of the victim. Additionally, we examine the potential mediating roles of fear and anger on political participation. Based on a survey experiment in both Belgium and the Netherlands (n = 3.139) we find no demobilizing effect of learning about political violence. In fact, we find a small mobilizing effect when the target belongs to the political in-group of the party. This mobilizing effect is likely to be mediated by anger.",

Following new mothers for two years before and after their childbirth, we find a significant decrease in mothers’ employment in the quarters surrounding childbirth with a corresponding surge in reliance on safety net benefits. We also find that education, marital status, and income level were key determinants of shaping work and safety net usage patterns among first-time mothers. These shifts were especially pronounced among low socioeconomic status women, who demonstrate greater responsiveness in employment and safety net utilization around the time of birth. Our findings point to the importance of integrating both work and safety net program participation and demonstrate gaps where additional work-supports and safety net engagement would promote economic security.",

          "abstract": "Evaluation systems are central organizing institutions in science that coordinate consensus and drive epistemic trajectories. Scientific fields have traditionally relied on \"organic\" evaluation systems (e.g., peer review, citation) where consensus emerges gradually across multiple epistemic values. This paper highlights artificial intelligence research (AIR) as a potent counterpoint to this model. Drawing on interviews with key actors, computational analyses, and archival materials spanning AIR’s history (1956–2021), we examine how AI evolved from a discipline with weak organic evaluation into a field driven by benchmarking, a “formal” evaluation system that defines progress quantitatively as state-of-the-art accuracy on commercial tasks. We demonstrate that benchmarking came to dominate through an intricate symbiosis with deep learning: benchmarking rewards accuracy, which large-scale deep learning uniquely excelled at, while deep learning’s opacity made organic evaluation increasingly difficult. This symbiosis restructured the field organizationally, epistemically, and materially into a “monoculture” dedicated to scaling. While enabling breakneck progress, monoculture discouraged exploration of alternatives with different epistemic strengths. As AI spreads to other knowledge fields (from science to law to art) benchmarking will accompany it. Our findings thus highlight the risk that formalization of evaluation can lead to monoculture in other creative domains.",

          "authors": "Roberto Garrone",
          "abstract": "This paper situates contemporary geopolitical discourse within the political economy of uncertainty. It examines how fear, identity mobilisation, and narrative simplification function not merely as distortions of rational policy-making, but as instrumental resources through which institutions legitimate authority, mobilise resources, and coordinate behaviour under conditions of perceived systemic transition.\n\nDrawing on political psychology, international relations theory, and strategic studies, the analysis proceeds in three steps. First, it identifies recurrent cognitive and social patterns that tend to become salient under uncertainty, including worst-case reasoning, in-group consolidation, narrative dominance, and ambiguity reduction. Second, it examines how these patterns may be amplified to serve specific institutional objectives, such as emergency legitimation, deterrence signalling, and the normalisation of structural change. A contemporary illustration drawn from transatlantic tensions over Greenland is used to clarify how cross-domain linkage between security and economic instruments can accelerate these dynamics within alliance systems.\n\nFinally, the paper advances a theoretical synthesis spanning classical and contemporary war theory. It proposes that while the political nature of war identified by Carl von Clausewitz remains analytically relevant, its dominant mode of operation has increasingly shifted toward what is termed cognitive governance: the management of fear, expectations, and legitimacy at the population level. The paper concludes by outlining analytically derived, policy-relevant conditions under which institutions may preserve strategic realism while reintroducing reversibility into fear-based governance, thereby mitigating long-run risks of institutional erosion and permanent emergency politics. The paper does not provide empirical testing, causal estimation, or predictive claims; its contribution is analytical and conceptual.",

          "abstract": "International education research often emphasizes economic, academic, or structural factors shaping student mobility, yet such approaches insufficiently capture the psychological meanings students attach to prestigious foreign institutions. This qualitative study examines how Korean undergraduate and graduate students construct self-concepts and future-oriented identities when deciding to pursue higher education in the United States. Drawing on identity-based motivation theory, self-concept and possible selves, and consumer identity perspectives, the study conceptualizes elite U.S. universities as prestige brands that carry symbolic value beyond academic instruction. Based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with Korean students enrolled at U.S. universities, thematic analysis reveals that participants understood university choice as a means of enacting aspirational elite or global identities, signaling social status, and securing social recognition and belonging. Seven interrelated themes capture how educational decisions were shaped by relational self-concepts, collective family expectations, prior academic and cross-cultural experiences, perceived career security, desires for autonomy and meaningful learning, negotiations over cost and sacrifice, and the branding power of U.S. institutions as signals of global competence. The findings suggest that international higher education functions as an identity-driven practice embedded in cultural expectations, social comparison, and symbolic hierarchies. This study contributes an integrative perspective that advances understanding of motivation, stratification, and identity in international higher education decision-making.\n\nNote: This is a preprint version.

However, rising returns or increased return heterogeneity amplify inequality, particularly if participation gaps persist. Broadening financial market participation mitigates these effects and reduces long-term uncertainty in wealth inequality trends. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "authors": "Mehdi Khalighi",
          "abstract": "Workplace safety is a critical driver of operational efficiency and employee well-being, yet organizations often struggle to quantify its economic value. This study examines the cost–benefit dynamics of investing in occupational safety programs relative to the financial burdens associated with workplace injuries. Using quantitative analysis, industry benchmarks, and an applied case study, the research evaluates the return on investment (ROI) of proactive safety interventions. Findings demonstrate that comprehensive safety programs reduce the frequency and severity of workplace injuries while generating measurable financial benefits, including lower insurance costs, reduced absenteeism, and improved operational efficiency. Although safety initiatives require upfront investment, the results show that proactive interventions consistently outweigh injury-related costs and deliver substantial long-term economic advantages. The study further highlights the strategic importance of integrating safety management into organizational decision-making, emphasizing its role in enhancing economic performance, workforce sustainability, and organizational resilience.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Fahlstrøm",
          "abstract": "Objective: This article explains why fertility has remained persistently low across heterogeneous\nsocieties despite policy interventions.\nBackground: Across heterogeneous late-modern societies, fertility has converged to sub\nreplacement levels. Existing explanations emphasize shifting values, gender norms, social policy,\nor diffusion mechanisms, but they pay less attention to how non-parenthood becomes both\ncommunicatively legitimate and structurally probable. Luhmannian systems theory offers tools\nto analyze how increasing functional differentiation reshapes the conditions under which\nreproduction is decided and coordinated.\nMethod: The article develops a conceptual model informed by Luhmannian systems theory. It\nexamines how intimate interaction systems are structurally coupled with economic, educational,\nlegal, political, and medical systems, and how these couplings generate temporal\ndesynchronization between individual reproductive windows and institutional time. The analysis\nsynthesizes demographic trends and policy debates to illustrate the argument.\nResults: Functional differentiation decouples intimacy from multifunctional family roles and\nmakes reproduction structurally optional. As temporal misalignments deepen, the probability of\nsuccessful coordination for childbearing decreases, especially under high educational and career\ndemands. Because family policies operate as programs within other systems’ binary codes, their\nimpact remains modest and context-dependent and cannot fully re-synchronize divergent time\nstructures.\nConclusion: Persistently low fertility emerges from system autonomy and temporal\nmisalignment across function systems, which helps explain why durable fertility rebounds are\nunlikely under current structural conditions.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a new source for the study of the kinship networks and careers of local officials in China in the late Qing, that is the late 19th and early 20th century. These officials constituted a local bureaucratic and educational elite, but compared with elite officials, relatively little is known about their characteristics, including their family backgrounds and kin networks. To study them, we have constructed a new dataset from Tongguanlu rosters of officials that include their resumes, degree or other qualifications and rosters of their kin and are available for officials in a variety of locations in China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Information for officials includes not only the names and degrees held by patrilineal father, grandfather, and great-grandfather commonly recorded for elite examination degree holders that have been studied previously, but detailed information about uncles, great-uncles, male cousins, sons, and nephews, and basic information about female kin including mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers, daughters. In contrast with other sources that only include holders of elite exam degrees, Tongguanlu include holders of purchased Jiansheng and Tribute (Gongsheng) degrees, low-level prefectural degrees Shengyuan, and other qualifications. We provide background on the Tongguanlu as a source, describe how we constructed the dataset, summarize its contents, and then present results on the posts, qualifications, and kin networks of local officials. We show that holders of purchased degrees and low-level Shengyuan examination degrees were less likely than holders of higher degrees to come from families with a history of holding degrees, and that officials with regular appointments were more likely to have kin with degrees than officials with acting appointments, or who were expectant officials.",

          "title": "Releasing a Trojan Horse: How Government Parties Use Social Media to Influence the Opposition’s Agenda in Parliament",
          "authors": "Daniel Sandvej Eriksen",
          "abstract": "Agenda setting is pivotal to democratic politics and remains in constant flux. With the rise of social media, many argue that political communication has increasingly migrated to these platforms, overshadowing traditional venues like parliament. However, the interplay between social media and the parliamentary venue remains poorly underswtood, even though understanding this relationship is crucial for grasping behavior in both contexts. In this paper, I argue that agendas initiated on social media can find their way into parliamentary discussions. However, while discussion in parliament is among opposition actors’ prime means of confronting the government with its ideas, such discussions carry higher stakes for government actors, making parliamentary talk less cheap for them. This dynamic creates an unexpected opportunity: Government parties can leverage social media to initiate new agendas that opposition parties subsequently introduce into parliamentary debates. In contrast, opposition parties cannot similarly employ social media to force government responses in parliament. Utilizing an original dataset of over 5.5 million tweets by parties and politicians, 400,000 parliamentary questions, and 750,000 news articles from the United Kingdom and Denmark (2015–2022), I employ state-of-the-art automated content analysis techniques. The findings support the proposed ideas. Together, these insights underscore the dynamic interplay between digital platforms and the legislative venue, calling for a renewed understanding of agenda setting in a hybrid communication environment where the boundaries between social media and parliament are increasingly blurred.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms play a central role in shaping today’s information ecosystem, yet access to both their internal data and even publicly visible content remains tightly restricted for academic researchers. This stands in sharp contrast to other industries such as food and pharmaceuticals where researchers can independently study product ingredients and effects. As a result, academic research on social media faces an unprecedented dependency on industry-controlled data, increasing the risk of bias and potentially distorting the evidence needed for effective regulation and policymaking. Drawing on research from other disciplines, we examine how industry influence operates and how researchers’ reliance on platforms for data may amplify industry influence. We identify four challenges in collaborations between researchers and social media platforms: restricted data access, selective funding, hard-to-detect influence, and institutional entanglements. These challenges risk undermining the independence and transparency of research in a field of growing societal relevance. Addressing these challenges requires policymakers to regulate data access, as illustrated by the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which mandates data access for vetted researchers while safeguarding user privacy. In addition, new independent funding mechanisms could help ensure that research agendas remain free from platform interests. In parallel, the social science community must adopt stronger ethical standards and invest in “research on research” to detect and mitigate potential biases in policy-relevant research. With a dual approach – policy reforms and critical academic debates – we can ensure that research on social media platforms serves the public interest rather than platform priorities.",

However, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) may cause technological risks to materialize more rapidly than many climate impacts. This raises fundamental questions for the climate community. How should climate professionals address the potential for AI systems to automate cognitive tasks? How might dramatic technological transformation over shorter timescales affect the relative value of near-term versus long-term research priorities? Drawing on recent developments in AI capabilities, expert forecasting, and risk assessment, I suggest three broad scenarios to guide our thinking about AI development and its implications for climate research. Rather than advocating for any single response, I explore how climate professionals might thoughtfully prepare for multiple possible futures while maintaining commitment to addressing the climate crisis. The analysis considers potential adjustments to research communication, graduate education, and collaborative engagement with the AI safety community, while acknowledging the significant uncertainties inherent in technological forecasting. These questions have no easy answers, but they warrant serious consideration as the climate research community navigates unprecedented technological change alongside ongoing environmental challenges.",

          "abstract": "This article examines critical mineral supply chains through a geo-economic and governance-oriented lens, drawing on Global Value Chain (GVC) theory and insights from asymmetric interdependence. It argues that supply vulnerabilities extend beyond geological endowment and extraction, increasingly reflecting coordination failures across transnational value chains, particularly at midstream and downstream stages involving refining, processing, logistics, certification, and regulatory alignment. While existing scholarship has largely treated hydrocarbon corridors and critical mineral supply risks as separate domains, limited attention has been paid to corridor-based governance arrangements capable of coordinating extraction, transit, processing, and market access across Eurasia.\nThe study adopts a qualitative, policy-oriented methodology combining conceptual analysis, review of institutional and policy frameworks, and an embedded case study of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC serves as an institutional reference to examine how geographically connected actors, including Central Asian producers, Azerbaijan, Türkiye, and European markets, have managed asymmetric interdependence through long-term cooperation, intergovernmental frameworks, and coordinated state and commercial participation.\nBuilding on these insights, the article develops a corridor-based governance perspective for Eurasian critical mineral supply chains. It conceptualizes the Eurasian Critical Minerals Corridor not as an existing institutional structure, but as an analytical framework for examining how variable-geometry cooperation can structure interdependence, reduce exposure to value-chain vulnerabilities, and support more resilient supply arrangements. In doing so, the article advances a governance-centered interpretation of critical mineral supply chains and demonstrates how institutional lessons from energy corridors can inform policy debates on critical mineral security and the political economy of the energy transition.",

          "abstract": "Personal networks influence health and mortality at the individual level, but less is known about how population-scale social network structure relates to mortality. This study examines how US county-level social network structure relates to mortality disparities. Using measures from 21 billion Facebook friendships, we investigate how two structural features of population social networks – cohesiveness and diversity – are associated with age-standardized and age-specific mortality rates. Bivariate results show that measures of social network structure rival smoking rates, median income, and educational attainment in their association with mortality rates. Social network structure remains predictive of mortality even after controlling for traditional measures like socioeconomic status and rural/urban classification. Network diversity is\nassociated with lower mortality in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Network clustering is associated with higher mortality bivariately, but this association reverses after controlling for county-level demographic and socioeconomic factors, revealing a protective effect masked by confounding. Age-stratified analyses further complicate this picture, showing that clustering predicts lower mortality among adults aged 15-64 but higher mortality among those 70 and older. These findings highlight social network structure as an important dimension of place-based health disparities, one not fully captured by conventional measures of socioeconomic composition or spatial segregation.",

Empirische Forschung, insbesondere zu sogenannten „Nachrichtenwüsten“, zeigt, dass der Rückgang von (lokalem) Journalismus mit geringerer Wahlbeteiligung, steigender politischer Polarisierung, sinkendem politischen Wissen sowie schwächerer politischer und wirtschaftlicher Kontrolle einhergeht. Dieser gesellschaftliche Nutzen entsteht in wesentlichen Teilen durch positive Externalitäten und führt zu einer Unterversorgung mit Journalismus. Die Digitalisierung hat dieses Problem verschärft, da sie traditionelle Erlösmodelle (insbesondere durch Werbung und Anzeigen) untergräbt und die wirtschaftliche Verwertbarkeit journalistischer Inhalte erschwert.

          "abstract": "The majority of the widely-discussed “sex recession” reflects a symmetric rise in virginity \naffecting both genders equally. A companion paper, however, documented an additional \nasymmetric component: a post-2012 widening of the male-female gap in sexlessness among the \nsexually experienced. This study investigates the distributional mechanism underlying that \nasymmetric gap using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The analysis focuses on \nnever-married, sexually experienced adults aged 25-34—old enough to have accumulated \nmeaningful partner histories, young enough to reflect contemporary market dynamics, and \nrestricted to those actively in the dating market; similar male-specific redistribution appears in \nbroader sexually experienced samples, indicating the pattern is not driven solely by marital \nselection. Among this population, I find a male-specific collapse of the “moderate middle”: the \nshare of men with 3-5 lifetime partners fell from 30.3% to 21.5% (-8.8 percentage points) \nbetween 2006-2010 and 2015-2017. This loss bifurcated: +4.4 pp shifted to the 1-2 category \n(exclusion) and +4.4 pp shifted to 6+ (concentration). Women’s distribution remained stable. \nThe upper tail (10+ partners) actually declined slightly for both genders, suggesting \nconcentration operates specifically in the 6-9 range—not through extreme accumulation. \nBecause this redistribution occurs within the middle of the distribution rather than the extreme \nupper tail, it is poorly captured by standard inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficients) and to \nanalyses focused on top-end accumulation. This distributional pattern—middle collapse rather \nthan upper-tail growth—has gone unrecognized in prior work. The asymmetric gap decomposes \nevenly into exclusion and concentration.",

          "authors": "Max Reichert; Alzbeta Bartova; Tom Emery",
          "abstract": "This study examines when parents across Europe begin using formal childcare and how the timing of entry is socially stratified by socioeconomic resources, employment, and informal care availability.  Childcare services are central to work–family reconciliation and gender equality. Existing research focuses primarily on whether families use childcare, largely overlooking when they do so. But timing matters because institutional entitlements only translate into real opportunities when households can convert them into use at specific points after childbirth. Using harmonized EU-SILC data from 22 European countries (2003–2020), this study estimates age-specific probabilities of formal childcare use during the first four years after birth. An analysis with matched longitudinal data complements thus study to assess the stability of childcare use once initiated. Formal childcare use rises steeply with child age but displays pronounced social stratification. Higher maternal education, stronger labor-market attachment, and higher household income are associated with substantially earlier entry into formal care. Informal childcare acts as a key substitute, delaying formal entry. Cross-national differences in usage levels and timing are large. Longitudinal results show that once families enter formal childcare, exit is rare. Inequality in childcare use is fundamentally temporal. Advantaged parents convert institutional entitlements into earlier and longer use, while less resourceful households enter later, reinforcing cumulative inequalities in employment trajectories and early childhood environments.",

While these developments have loosely defined what constitutes the modern subfield of evolutionary archaeology, we argue that many of its premises fail to sufficiently engage with insights from fields such as ethnoarchaeology or explore theoretical and methodological consequences dictated by the nature of the observational data that archaeologists deal with.

          "abstract": "The work focuses on the implementation of textile industry effluent management, the current pollution scenario in Bangladesh caused by these effluents, and the proposed solution of installing an effluent treatment plant. Despite the presence of ETP equipment in almost all textile industries in Bangladesh, many factories do not operate them regularly because of high maintenance and operational costs (Rahman &amp; Islam 2020). Rapid industrialization has intensified environmental pollution through the discharge of untreated toxic waste (Islam Rahman and Akter 2021). On the other hand, increasing industrialization is contributing to severe pollution of the environment by poisonous waste discharge. The liquid effluents from industries are causing major havoc to the environment, ecology, agriculture, aquaculture, and public health since the development of textile industries in the country. It had become a prerequisite to set up ETP in each industrial establishment, particularly at dyeing industries that were discharging immense amounts of liquid waste to the rivers every day. However, for the successful implementation of ETPs, industry owners will need to be socially responsible. At the same time, the government should provide factory owners with logistical support and a relaxed timeframe to set up ETPs.",

          "abstract": "Debates about how politicians handle evidence typically emphasize interpretation rather than selection. We shift attention to this earlier and often hidden stage and argue that partisan perspectives shape which evidence politicians attend to. We test this claim in a real-world field setting during the 2024 Austrian parliamentary election campaign. Three weeks before election day, we sent 1,822 candidates links to two high-quality research briefings on the same immigration reform and tracked which evidence they selected. Partisan-aligned selection is concentrated among extreme parties: far-right Freedom Party candidates disproportionately choose aligned evidence, while centrists show more balanced patterns. A contemporaneous survey of citizens shows that far-right supporters approve of elites’ selective attention to evidence, highlighting alignment between elite behavior and mass preferences. These results identify evidence selection as a key stage in policymaking and suggest that rising far-right strength may amplify reliance on supportive information, increasing the risk of ill-informed policy.",

          "abstract": "We examine the impact of 1990 and 2000 laws of citizenship in Germany, which liberalized the path to the acquisition of citizenship, on the national identity of immigrants. Leveraging the exogenous variation in waiting time for naturalization generated by those two reforms, we find that immigrants who benefited from less restrictive conditions to become citizens developed a stronger national identification with Germany, both after and during their waiting time for naturalization. The effect was particularly strong for women and for those immigrants that were older at the time of their arrival. A higher attachment to Germany seems to have been mainly driven by psychological and socioeconomic mechanisms: a more liberal regime reduced subjective concerns about discrimination, heightened immigrants’ social and political participation, and fostered their use of the German language.",

          "abstract": "The growing use of algorithm based systems to manage employees has transformed how work is organized and controlled in contemporary organizations. Commonly referred to as algorithmic management, this approach relies on automated decision making to allocate tasks, monitor performance, and evaluate employee outcomes. While such systems are often adopted to enhance efficiency, their implications for human work remain insufficiently understood. This study examined the relationship between algorithmic management and key employee outcomes, with a particular focus on employee autonomy, job satisfaction, and performance.\nUsing a quantitative research design, data were collected through an online survey from employees working in algorithmically managed environments. Established measurement scales were employed to assess the study variables, and statistical analyses were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicate that algorithmic management is negatively associated with employee autonomy and job satisfaction, while demonstrating a significant relationship with employee performance. These results suggest that algorithmic management may improve performance related outcomes but can also constrain employees’ sense of control and satisfaction at work.\nThe study contributes to the growing literature on digital and technology-mediated management by highlighting the dual effects of algorithmic management on human work. From a practical perspective, the findings underscore the importance of designing algorithmic systems that balance organizational efficiency with employee well-being. The study also offers directions for future research on the evolving role of algorithms in shaping the future of work.",

          "authors": "Evangeline Wandag; Michelle Victoria De Leon",
          "abstract": "This qualitative research investigates the constitutive role of communicative framing in the production and internalization of economic poverty among urban poor residents in Manila, Philippines. Anchored in the framing theory and situated within a communication-centric analytic paradigm, the study utilizes semi-structured interviews to examine how macro-level discursive formations emanating from state, media, and institutional actors are translated into micro-level interpretive schemas through which marginalized subjects perceive economic deprivation, agency, and futurity. The analysis demonstrates that participants’ narratives are permeated by hegemonic frames of dependency, passivity, and moralized deservingness, which operate as symbolic constraints that delimit perceived economic agency and normalize structural exclusion. The study contends that communication functions not merely as a descriptive or mediating apparatus but as an infrastructural dimension of economic inequality itself, actively configuring the conditions of possibility for economic action. To deepen the paper’s theoretical portability, we introduce the Communicative Architecture of Governed Exclusion (CAGE) as a mid-range framework specifying how poverty is reproduced through 1) classification (what counts as poverty and who counts as poor); 2) access control (administrative and informational gatekeeping), 3) governance through discourse (moralized narratives of deservingness and dependency), and 4) exclusion effects (internalized passivity, “waiting orientation,” and self-limiting economic agency). CAGE clarifies how framing effects become durable social infrastructure—an architecture that governs inclusion and exclusion through everyday communication.",

          "abstract": "What is the relationship between global and local identification, and how is it linked to political conflict? These questions are central to scholarship on contemporary electoral politics, which has linked the radical right’s rise to a new dimension of political conflict separating tolerant, globally minded voters from exclusionary, locally oriented ones. This cleavage, variously described as universalist–particularist, cosmopolitan–parochial, or globalist–nationalist, implies that collective identification is polarized along a global–local axis and helps drive political mobilization. Yet little is known about how different territorial identities compete with or reinforce each other, let alone how their configurations shape political preferences. Using latent class models and survey data from 35 countries, I find that most Europeans are pluralists, who identify across a range of territories and support mainstream parties. A subset of countries, however, exhibits a division between particularists, who emphasize proximal identities, and expansivists, who emphasize distal ones. Remarkably, both groups converge in their strong attachment to the nation. This division overlaps with educational and geographic divides and separates radical-right supporters from those of new left parties like the greens. The findings demonstrate how collective identities reinforce new electoral divisions while challenging influential accounts of the scope and structure of identity-based polarization.",

This is partly due\nto the crop’s undetectability—it contains no foreign genes—rendering it less radical than\nconventional GMOs. Next, the study advances a theory of dynamis and dynamist rites, viewing\nthe current transitional stage of adoption as a contradictory and suspended spatiotemporal journey.\nIt draws on liminality and liminoid formations to highlight this limbo-like phase, which\nnonetheless harbors an undercurrent of potent possibility. The research foregrounds pre-reflective,\nmagico-religious attunements (e.g. awe-like receptivity), arguing that they lie deeper than ethical\nstances or anticipatory care. Amid current preparations to export genome editing to Asian\ncountries, this study’s use of an ethnographic case from the region illuminates the potential and\nconcerns of genome editing adoption that are likely to emerge across Asia and the world in the\nnear future.\nKeywords: genome-edited, rites of passage, dynamis, multispecies, liminalit",

          "abstract": "Desde el descubrimiento de la penicilina por Alexander Fleming en 1928, el sector farmacéutico se ha expandido aceleradamente hasta convertirse en uno de los segmentos más poderosos de la economía global, con una facturación anual cercana a US$ 1,5 billones y corporaciones valoradas en cientos de miles de millones de dólares. Aunque los avances científico-tecnológicos y las transformaciones socioeconómicas han impulsado la investigación y el desarrollo de medicamentos, la literatura crítica ha señalado prácticas controvertidas de influencia corporativa — aquí sintetizadas como “Influencia, Desvíos y Excesos”— que favorecen la rentabilidad y la consolidación del poder, en ocasiones en tensión con el interés colectivo y la salud pública. En este contexto, el artículo adopta un diseño exploratorio-descriptivo y un enfoque mixto, basado en la triangulación de datos públicos, documentos institucionales y revisión crítica de la literatura internacional, con el objetivo de mapear los principales mecanismos de influencia corporativa en el sector farmacéutico a partir de ocho ejes: (i) lobby y financiación electoral; (ii) influencia en organismos de regulación y fiscalización; (iii) influencia en organizaciones de pacientes; (iv) participación en la elaboración de guías clínicas; (v) manipulación, promoción y ocultamiento de investigaciones y ensayos clínicos; (vi) escritura fantasma; (vii) estrategias de ampliación diagnóstica y promoción de enfermedades; y (viii) financiación y provisión de beneficios a prescriptores e instituciones, incluyendo dimensiones psicosociales y formativas. Los resultados muestran que la influencia corporativa opera de manera multiescalar y simultáneamente visible y difusa. En el plano político, el lobby y la financiación electoral se consolidan como instrumentos centrales para moldear el entorno normativo y regulatorio. En el ámbito regulatorio, la recurrencia de conflictos de interés y la circulación de profesionales entre agencias públicas y empresas privadas evidencian vulnerabilidades a la captura institucional. En el campo científico, el patrocinio industrial se asocia a sesgos que afectan el diseño de los ensayos, la publicación selectiva de resultados y la credibilidad de las evidencias, incluyendo prácticas como el ghostwriting. Asimismo, se identifica la actuación de la industria en la ampliación diagnóstica y la medicalización de la vida cotidiana, con efectos sobre la invisibilización de determinantes sociales y alternativas no farmacológicas. En la práctica clínica, los pagos y transferencias de valor a profesionales e instituciones se vinculan a cambios en los patrones de prescripción, incremento de costos y favorecimiento de medicamentos promovidos, incluso mediante beneficios de bajo valor mediados por sesgos cognitivos.",

          "abstract": "A longstanding debate in research on peer effects concerns whether exposure to high-achieving classmates enhances or depresses students’ academic performance. While normative models emphasize positive spillovers, social comparison theories highlight negative contrast effects, and empirical evidence remains mixed. Moreover, it is unclear whether peer effects operate similarly across institutional contexts. This study addresses these issues through a comparative analysis of Italy and Norway, two educational systems that differ markedly in competitiveness, tracking, evaluation practices, and gender norms. Using harmonized, population-wide administrative register data, we follow three full student cohorts from Grade 5 to Grade 8. This longitudinal design allows us to control for prior achievement—an advantage unavailable in international assessments such as PISA, TIMSS, or PIRLS. We estimate value-added school fixed-effects models that exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in peer composition. Across both countries, higher average peer achievement is associated with lower individual performance, consistent with social comparison mechanisms. Exposure to top-performing peers has negative effects, while exposure to low-performing peers has positive effects. These patterns are similar across countries and do not vary systematically by gender, suggesting that peer comparison processes are remarkably stable across institutional contexts.",

          "abstract": "Demand for tiger parts has contributed to a global decline in tiger populations. Tigers are extirpated entirely from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and are severely threatened in extant populations in Southeast Asia. Across the region, tiger farms have been established with the main intent of supplying tigers for consumer demand, e.g. tiger bone glue for medicine. Tiger farms are known to operate within Vietnam and within Nghe An province, the focal area of this study. We interviewed 16 former tiger farmers to understand how they obtained their tigers, how they farmed tigers, why they farmed tigers, why they stopped farming tigers, and their beliefs around environmental policy, tiger conservation, and tiger reintroduction. Tiger cubs were trafficked in from Laos and raised by the tiger farmers to adulthood, at which point the tigers were sold to other individuals who slaughtered the tigers for their parts. We found that most of our sample were aware that tigers are in decline globally, and extinct from Vietnam. Farming was perceived as “easy” and lucrative; however, our sample were no longer raising tigers due to fears of fines and jail time. Our sample were ambivalent about the current environmental policy around farming, but were supportive of reintroduction and stated their desire to see tigers in Vietnam again. While tiger farms do still operate in Nghe An, we find it heartening that proactive enforcement appears to be discouraging individuals to continue farming. Our study illustrates the importance of government commitment to policy in driving conservation impact.",

We report baseline material flows and circularity indicators for Europe (2010-2023), highlight differences between the EU27 and non-EU Europe (CH/NO/TR), and quantify a DPP scenario with confidence intervals. For the EU27 in 2023, current circularity is 15.5% and the DPP scenario implies 45.6% (95% CI: 29.2-62.0), corresponding to potential savings of 52.3 Mt and EUR 64.7 bn (95% CI: 23.8-80.8 Mt; EUR 29.5-100.0 bn).

This study investigates the adoption of preprinting over time, focusing on how it varies across scientific disciplines and geographical regions. We analyzed bibliometric data on 4M preprints and 105M peer-reviewed outputs in the period 1991-2023. Peer-reviewed outputs were linked to preprints using data from Dimensions, OpenAlex, and Crossref, resulting in 2.2M peer-reviewed outputs linked to a preprint. Our findings indicate a strong growth in preprinting, with a nearly threefold increase in the number of preprints published between 2017 and 2022. The adoption of preprinting is highest in the physical and mathematical sciences, particularly among researchers in the Americas and Europe. In recent years, preprinting has also increased notably in the information and computing sciences and the life and medical sciences, driven primarily by researchers in North America and Western and Northern Europe. Preprinting remains relatively uncommon in the humanities and the social and behavioral sciences. Asia demonstrates low preprint adoption, with Eastern Asia showing a modest increase in recent years. Preprint adoption in specific disciplines varies significantly across regions, showing that preprint adoption is shaped by the interplay between disciplines and regions.",

          "authors": "Viyaleta Korsunava; Boris Sokolov",
          "abstract": "Non-probability web surveys offer several advantages over face-to-face (F2F) interviews—they are cheaper, faster, more accessible, and reduce interviewer effects and desirability bias. As such, they are increasingly popular in both academic and commercial research. However, they often yield demographically biased samples, raising concerns about the accuracy of the resulting public opinion estimates. Most studies on web surveys focus on developed countries, with limited attention to non-WEIRD contexts. Addressing this gap, we compare data from the Values in Crisis (VIC) survey (2020–2021, opt-in online panels with quota sampling) and the 7th wave of the World Values Survey (WVS; 2017–2022, probability-based multi-stage stratified sampling) across nine countries: Brazil, Chile, China, Germany, Greece, Japan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United Kingdom. We assess differences in demographic coverage and national mean scores on 15 attitudinal items, including trust, national pride, religiosity, life satisfaction, postmaterialism, and support for gender equality and reproductive freedom. WVS samples more closely match national demographics, though VIC performs comparably in some cases. Substantively, web surveys show higher (up to 20–30 p.p.) acceptance of gender equality, abortion, and homosexuality and lower religiosity, national pride, and life satisfaction. These differences persist even after adjusting for demographic imbalances and restricting WVS samples to internet users.",

Despite this seeming agreement, we know little how normative principles are interpreted, operationalized, and assigned responsibilities within particular contexts. This study compares the values invoked within the European Union’s AI Act with policy documents of five major AI companies—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Meta AI, and Mistral AI. Through a combination of frequency analysis and inductive keyword-in-context analysis, we identify prioritized values and map how they are specified in public legislation and corporate policies. Both public and private actors largely invoke the same values (accuracy, authenticity, control, improvement, privacy, safety, and security) but sometimes differ in their specification. While values like privacy, security, and safety typically mean the same thing in policy discourses, we found stark differences in the understanding of improvement, tensions between technical and normative operationalizations of values, and shifts of responsibilities for upholding values from one stakeholder to another. Value specifications surface the politics of values in AI regulations, exposing how private actors employ polysemy to claim alignment with the public interest while avoiding substantial accountability. When it comes to value-driven governance, the devil is in the details.",

While this characterization is correct under standard assumptions—continuous, unimodal distributions on a meaningful metric scale—its application to ordinal grading data such as university marks is problematic. Using explicit counterexamples, we show that the HL estimator can exhibit severe jump discontinuities: minimal changes in the sample leads to large, discrete changes in the HL estimate. This behavior persists under sample size inflation by replication. This shows that the HL should not be used to represent a central location in ordinal grading data as frequently present at universities.",

          "abstract": "Individualism, the prioritization of personal distinctiveness over group conformity, is theorized to increase with economic development. This study tests this hypothesis over a century (1900–2022) across 95 French départements, using name uniqueness as a behavioral proxy. We first validate this proxy at the subnational level, showing that name uniqueness correlates with regional survey-based individualism indices (World Values Survey), even after controlling for immigration rates. Using complete civil registry data (N ≈ 79 million) and a bootstrapped name uniqueness score, we then analyze its relationship with economic development across space and time. Our analysis yields three key findings. First, longitudinal analysis reveals a strong positive association: as GDP per capita increased nationally over the 100-year period, name uniqueness rose significantly across all départements. Second, after removing shared temporal trends by standardizing variables within each year, effectively treating départements (n = `r nobs(norm_model_boy)`) as small, culturally and socially identical countries, GDP per capita continues to predict higher name uniqueness. Third, we uncover nuanced patterns: the relationship was moderated by gender, particularly during the World Wars, and rising economic inequality between regions was accompanied by growing divergence in naming practices, suggesting that development drives both cultural individualism and cultural stratification. Together, these results provide robust, fine-grained evidence that economic development fosters a cultural shift toward greater individualism.",

          "authors": "Catherine Ludwig; Noelia Delicado; Jean-David Sandoz; Catherine Busnel",
          "abstract": "Introduction. In a context of increasing social, mental, and physical vulnerability, there is wide agreement on the need to address health and social needs in an integrated manner. Yet, considering such “complexity” remains a pervasive challenge for professionals in social and health care, especially due to a lack of operational definitions. This scoping review aims to map existing definitions of complexity in social and health care and to identify shared assessment tools that support interprofessional and coordinated intervention. Methods and analysis. The review will follow the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al., 2018) and updated guidance (Peters et al., 2020). Literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), SocINDEX (EBSCO), Social Services Abstracts (ProQuest), and Cairn.info databases using appropriate keywords, index terms and search equations. All selected study bibliographies will undergo manual screening (\"snowballing\"). Studies will be selected based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, screened by title and abstracts. Data from full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be extracted independently by three authors. Evaluation discrepancies will be resolved through consensus. Results. Findings will be presented in descriptive tables and summarized narratively in relation to the review’s objectives and questions. Conclusion. This scoping review is expected to contribute to the development of an operational definition of complex situations in integrated social and health care and to identify tools that support professionals in assessing these situations in practice.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on three ethnographic studies of secondary schools in England, this article makes a case for “socio-technical audits” – a method combining technological walkthroughs with observations, workshops, and interviews – as part of ethnographic inquiry. A case example is presented to illustrate how the integration of socio-technical audits enables articulation of the underlying logics of technologies, while producing empirically grounded, contextually situated accounts of how technologies are interpreted, negotiated, and embedded within everyday educational practice.",

          "authors": "Sarah Grajdura; Matthew Palm; Collin Yarbrough; Qian He; Dana Rowangould; Chen Chen; Tara Goddard; Karl Kim; Stephen Wong",
          "abstract": "As climate-related hazards intensify, transportation systems play a central role in shaping who is exposed to risk, who can respond, and who recovers mobility and access after disruption. This scoping review synthesizes 88 studies to assess how transportation and hazards research has engaged equity and justice frameworks, what outcomes are used to evaluate inequity, where findings converge or diverge across hazards and disaster phases, and what conceptual gaps constrain progress. We find that the literature is effective at documenting disparities in exposure, evacuation, adaptation, and recovery, largely through population-based comparisons and novel mobility datasets. However, equity is most often treated implicitly, with unequal outcomes reported absent explicit normative or theoretical grounding. As a result, differences are frequently described without clarifying when and why they constitute inequities, limiting comparability across contexts and policy relevance. Evidence is strongest for inequities in transportation-mediated exposure, particularly for extreme heat and access loss driven by network failure, indicating a maturing understanding of transportation systems as active producers of vulnerability. Findings on evacuation disparities are less consistent, reflecting methodological limitations and contextual variation, while recovery outcomes show greater convergence, with marginalized communities experiencing slower or incomplete mobility restoration. Across domains, mismatches persist between commonly used mobility metrics and lived disaster needs, and mechanisms producing inequity—such as disinvestment, governance capacity, caregiving constraints, disability access, labor precarity, and information asymmetries—are often underexamined. We argue that greater engagement with explicit justice frameworks is necessary to move beyond documenting disparity toward explaining inequity and guiding equity-oriented transportation decisions under growing risk and uncertainty.",

          "authors": "Andrew J Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Despite the Third Reich's efforts to rewrite German history, post-WWII scholars and activists have worked valiantly to unearth the inspiring legacies of Magnus Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee (WhK) before Nazi takeover. But by lionizing Hirschfeld, these same scholars/activists have too often erased (1) WhK’s limitations, (2) other, less savory competitor groups like the masculinist Community of the Self-Possessed (GdE) and collaborationist Human Rights League (BfM), and (3) surprisingly generative critiques put forth by these latter groups. In a comparative-historical analysis of WhK, GdE, and BfM organizers, I suggest that fin-de-siècle German capitalism inculcated an illusory proximity to power that limited organizers' insights into bourgeois heteronormative German society and their precarious place within it. Despite criticizing some particulars, all of these activists nonetheless identified with and demonstrated adherence to classist models of normative Germanness by excluding other gender- and sexually-nonconforming people. WhK medicalists constructed themselves as upright, learned \"homosexual\" professionals against criminalized \"pseudohomosexual\" sex workers; GdE masculinists constructed their Hellenistic literary circle of enlightened \"homoerotic\" against crude, hypersexual, effeminate decadents. BfM homonormatives constructed themselves as respectable, everyday middle-class citizen-subjects against perverse, pathological, in-your-face activists. These attempts to gain inclusion at one another’s expense undermined their ability to work together and with other oppressed groups. Apart from a brief rapprochement, these competing groups constantly distinguished themselves from and denigrated one another. Hidden beneath this impulse is, to borrow from current discourse about Trump supporters, a sense of being “temporarily embarrassed elites\" that obscured friend from foe and obscured their extreme vulnerability to the coming storm of fascist reaction. I conclude by bringing the strengths and limitations of these three groups to bear on the current fascist, genocidal moment, suggesting that learning from their mistakes and capitalizing on their strengths is essential for bringing about a non-fascist movement, society, and world.",

          "authors": "Geoff Kushnick; Sam Passmore; Daniel M.T. Fessler; Karmila br. Karo; Fikarwin Zuska",
          "abstract": "The Karo of North Sumatra, Indonesia, have long expressed a preference for matrilateral cross-cousin (impal) marriage, yet the practice has declined sharply over the past century. To identify the demographic and sociocultural factors underlying this change, we applied an epidemiological approach to cultural evolution, using a case-control design coupled with structural equation modeling (SEM). Ethnographic data from 176 married individuals across 62 villages were analyzed to assess the effects of demographic, alliance, religious, cosocialisation, and modernisation variables on the likelihood of impal marriage. The model fit was strong (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.04), revealing significant direct and indirect effects. Marrying an impal was positively associated with the number of marriageable impal and with arranged or strategically motivated unions but negatively associated with reported religious conflict between spouses. Indicators of modernisation such as schooling and infrastructure were non-significant. These results indicate that the decline of impal marriage reflects demographic contraction and the weakening of alliance-based strategies rather than a rejection of the cultural norm itself. Framed within an epidemiological model of cultural transmission, the findings demonstrate how social practices may fade when the ecological and demographic conditions sustaining them erode, even as their normative value persists.",

          "authors": "Hari Srinivasan",
          "abstract": "This paper conceptualizes engineered exclusion—the predictable sidelining of disabled users that results from choices about data provenance, model objectives, and evaluation practices within AI systems. We frame this phenomenon through the lived experiences of minimally and nonspeaking autistics whose multimodal communication profiles challenge the speech-centered defaults of current AI pipelines. “Nonspeaking” is not a single condition or an absence of language but a spectrum encompassing users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), from text to gesture, rhythmic movement, and partial vocalizations. Communicative profiles vary across time with fatigue, anxiety, sensory load, and motor planning demands, yet design abstractions erase this variability. By tracing exclusionary mechanisms across speech recognition, text-to-speech, plain-language generation, and interface design, we identify how inequities are structurally produced and propose measurable designed dignity metrics for evaluation and governance. We argue that accessibility must be treated as a core dimension of AI ethics—on par with fairness, privacy, and safety. Re-engineering AI for designed dignity requires systems that recognize embodied, multimodal, and state-dependent forms of communication, expanding what counts as valid signal and responsible innovation.",
