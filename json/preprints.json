          "title": "Jiatama 2.0™:  Reframing Human Intelligence in the Age of Cognitive Automation",
          "authors": "Hisataka Takasugi",
          "abstract": "In the age of artificial intelligence, human intelligence faces an existential redefinition. As algorithmic systems increasingly automate tasks once considered exclusive to human cognition, it is high time to reconsider the essence of human intellectual capacity. This paper introduces Jiatama 2.0™, a reimagined framework for understanding intelligence not as static capacity or raw IQ, but as the operational deployment of thought—situated, purposeful, and contextually attuned. Building on cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind, Jiatama 2.0™ posits three core \"intellectual muscles\": the ability to structure information, to generate meaning, and to reinterpret experience. These capacities resist full automation due to their reliance on subjective agency, ethical orientation, and contextual inference. To ground this conceptual framework, we analyze current insights from studies on the Default Mode Network, affective neuroscience, enactivism, and neuroplasticity. We argue that these human faculties are not merely evolutionary vestiges, but vital capabilities for navigating an era of accelerating change and cognitive outsourcing. Jiatama 2.0™ serves not only as a theoretical model but also as a foundation for educational and organizational development in an AI-saturated society. By reasserting the value of volitional, meaning-driven, and structurally agile thought, this framework seeks to shift the narrative from fear of automation to empowerment through uniquely human cognition.\nKeywords: Jiatama 2.0™, cognitive agency, Meaning-making, Contextual intelligence, Cognitive automation, Value-based reasoning",

          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "This paper aims to structurally redefine the phenomenon commonly referred to as \"luck.\"While often used in everyday language, the concept of luck remains vague and under-theorized.Using the perspective of Core-Belief Structural Theory (Kakushin Kōzōron), the paper presents a two-layered model of luck:the first layer as probabilistic events, and the second as structural meaning-making. Not all coincidences become luck; only when a person recognizes meaning, assigns value, and acts on it does luck emerge.We analyze this process through the lens of Structural Quotient (SQ),composed of structural perception, core-value-oriented filtering, and cognitive flight (Hishō-Ninchi).The paper further explores how such cognitive structures can be trained and how luck becomes a partially reproducible skill.We argue that luck is not a mystery but an expression of structurally organized intelligence.",

          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "This paper attempts to reinterpret and structurally analyze everyday anomalies—phenomena that are difficult to explain but are commonly experienced—in the light of Kakushin Structure Theory. The selected anomalies include things such as becoming more tearful with age, the feeling of falling in love at first sight, déjà vu, and the feeling of not knowing what one wants to do in life. The common thread among these phenomena is that they are intuitively understood but their underlying mechanisms have not been adequately explained. Using the concept of \"structure,\" Kakushin Structure Theory attempts to shed light on these phenomena, asserting that \"structure is meaning itself.\" This paper emphasizes the importance of \"structure\" in thought, emotion, and behavior and aims to provide a new perspective on understanding everyday occurrences through this structural lens. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how Kakushin Structure Theory offers a new viewpoint and helps foster a deeper understanding of the phenomena that shape our everyday experiences.",

          "authors": "Ignacio Cea; Niccolo Negro; Pedro A. M. Mediano; Camilo Miguel Signorelli",
          "abstract": "The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0 is an influential framework aiming to explain consciousness mathematically in terms of intrinsic existence, namely what exists for itself in a specific, maximally irreducible, structured form. IIT thus posits that the minimal substrates of consciousness are also the ultimate building blocks of what exists. These are called ‘monads’, and are defined as self-connected, single-unit systems purportedly specifying maximal values of IIT’s measure of conscious irreducible existence, namely system integrated information phi_s* (i.e., phi-monads). In this paper, we argue that IIT 4.0’s formalism cannot be applied to monads, thus threatening the theory’s own ontological ground.  We show that IIT’s formalism requires that any candidate substrate of consciousness must be constituted by at least two non-overlapping, non-empty, and jointly exhaustive parts, which we refer to as the Plurality requirement.  We then show that monads violate this requirement, which leads to serious mathematical and conceptual problems, since the equations needed to calculate system integrated information become undefined. Thus, our paper calls for urgent clarification and/or revision by IIT proponents concerning the status of phi-monads as ontologically fundamental building blocks and minimal substrates of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Low-cost consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) amplifiers have been around for more\nthan a decade, yet their viability for cognitive neuroscience research remains mostly unexplored. These low-cost amplifiers are an attractive potential tool for naturalistic neuroimaging and recording neuroscience data at scale. In this study, we simultaneously recorded data from eight EEG channels using the low-cost OpenBCI Cyton and the high-cost, state-of-the-art Brain Vision BrainAmp. We analyzed three well-studied event-related brain potential (ERP) components (P3b, N4, ERN) and found that there were no significant differences between the signals recorded from the BrainAmp and Cyton, and that both amplifiers adequately captured all three components. We conclude that the Cyton is suitable for traditional ERP-based cognitive neuroscience research, although it has limitations that are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a leading cause of premature death. For decades investigators have assessed the clinical efficacy of direct brain stimulation for TRD. Outcomes have been inconsistent due to imprecise brain targeting. Minimally invasive Personalized Adaptive Cortical Electro-stimulation (PACE) uses fMRI-based precision functional mapping (PFM) to target patient-specific network anomalies with brain surface electrodes. We utilized this novel technology in an n-of-1 study to treat a 44-year-old man (TRD-1) with over 30 years of severe unipolar depression. PFM revealed a 400% expansion in cortical area of the Salience Network (SN)  and a 25% reduction in default mode (DMN) and frontoparietal (FP) networks compared to a group average controls. Stimulation paddles were implanted targeting patient-specific SN, DMN, and FP networks. Postoperative stimulation testing (within 24h) revealed immediate electrode-specific mood and cognition responses that matched the underlying functional networks. Stimulation parameters were iteratively optimized using ‘Bayes Tuning’ based on patient feedback. TRD-1’s suicidal ideations ceased within 7 weeks. Full remission of symptoms was achieved within 9 months and maintained at 30 months. PACE therapy appears to be a scalable, safe, and cost-effective approach to treat TRD.",

          "abstract": "The “hard problem” of consciousness centres on explaining for-me-ness: the perspectival character of experience. We introduce the Recursive Self-Model Threshold (RSMT) framework, which treats this property as a mathematically necessary feature of any system capable of stable, open-ended self-modelling. RSMT identifies a self-index—the F-token—as a fixed point F of the system’s self-update operator Mν, where ν ∈ [0,1] parameterises transparency to internal state. The theory formalises (i) the inevitability of self-reference (Lawvere/Banach/Tarski fixed-point results), (ii) indexical opacity—the impossibility of redescribing the self-index non-indexically without shifting the origin, (iii) an opacity–stability trade-off with critical νc, (iv) a binding axiom that forces all bound content to be “for-me,” yielding an anti-zombie corollary, and (v) a lights-on theorem guaranteeing ongoing work under environmental drift.",

          "authors": "Alfonso J. Martinez; Jonathan Templin; Karrie Shogren; Tyler Hicks",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a Beta-Bernoulli mixture item response model (BBM-IRT) for bounded-continuous items such as those often utilized in continuous rating scales and slider-bar assessments. These item types are commonly used in psychological research but, to date, these assessments have primarily been utilized in fixed-length situations, where the same set of items are administered to all respondents, and have not been utilized within an adaptive testing framework. An adaptive testing framework offers several benefits, including the ability to obtain higher quality measurement precision with fewer items as items are targeted and administered based on the respondent’s previous responses. In addition to introducing the BBM-IRT model, this work also explores the use of the model within an adaptive testing framework. In particular, the item and test information functions – a component necessary for building adaptive assessments – is derived and presented in closed form. Through a series of simulation studies, we provide empirical evidence that it is possible to create adaptive assessments for bounded-continuous item types. An application with real data is also provided showing how the BBM-IRT model can be utilized in practical assessment situations.",

          "authors": "Cassandra M Brandes; Hannah Clark; Catherine Demers; Elysia Poggi Davis; Benjamin Hankin",
          "abstract": "Pregnancy and postpartum are times of increased risk for a variety of mental health problems. Historically, these symptoms have been conceptualized via ostensibly distinct, consensus-based diagnostic categories. However, applying an empirically-based, dimensional approach to psychiatric classification may significantly advance understanding of common and specific risk factors during this highly dynamic period. In the present study, we used exploratory psychometric methods to examine the structure of psychopathology symptoms from the “bottom-up” or using symptom-level co-occurrence to derive common factors in a sample of individuals (N = 347) across earlier pregnancy (M = 17.4 weeks gestation), later pregnancy (M = 34.6 weeks gestation), and postpartum (M = 25.3 weeks postpartum). We examined changes (or invariance) in symptom structure longitudinally and between distressed (N = 252) and euthymic (N = 96) pregnant individuals. Results demonstrated a hierarchical structure of symptoms including a robust Broad Distress factor at the highest level, followed by replicable Internalizing and Externalizing factors, all the way down to a nine-factor solution including Low Mood-Anhedonia, Pregnancy Anxiety, Fear-Worry-Tension, Social Anxiety-Dependence, Traumatic Stress, Somatic Problems, Detachment, Anger-Antagonism, and Inattention-Hyperactivity factors. Psychopathology structure was remarkably invariant from earlier to later pregnancy, but structure changed slightly into postpartum. Symptom structure also showed slight differences between distressed and euthymic individuals, indicating that while some factors (e.g., trauma and somatic symptoms) differ across time or clinical population, perinatal symptom factors are largely robust. Similarities and differences between the perinatal psychopathology structure recovered here and general population structure have important implications for empirically-based psychopathology classification.",

We conducted a study using a GPS-enabled mobile app, NatureDoseTM, to quantify geographic and temporal patterns of nature exposure among college students (N = 315) at a university located in the northeastern United States over a 14-week intervention (January–May 2023) as part of a randomized controlled trial. Early in the semester, nature exposure was concentrated in urban areas, nearby parks, and ski mountain areas. Later, nature exposure increased near lakeshores and geographically broadened during the week of spring break, highlighting temporal shifts. Participants in the nature experiences intervention group gained nature exposure in significantly more census blocks than those in the control, physical activity, or therapy groups, suggesting the nature-based intervention encouraged wider geographic engagement. These findings suggest that nature-based interventions may enhance the quality and diversity of exposure among young adults.",

Nearly all parents (99.6%) tracked at least one domain. Most adolescents viewed tracking as legitimate, though location tracking was seen as less so. Parental digital tracking was unrelated to adolescent well-being but positively to parental factors associated with control and fear. Thus, parents tracking their teenager appears widespread, and may reflect parental insecurities, with no clear between-family link to adolescent maladjustment.",

Participants then engaged in a conversation with GPT-4 Turbo – a frontier AI model available to the public – prompted to act as a psychotherapist and pragmatic problem-solver in the treatment condition and as a neutral interviewer in the control condition. Compared to controls, treated participants reported improved mental health related to their stated challenge.

          "abstract": "Background: Early intervention increases the likelihood of eating disorder (ED) recovery but many young people delay help-seeking. We developed a smartphone-friendly, online decision-making tool to address this gap (FREED-Mobile [FREED-M]) and conducted a feasibility trial of the tool. Methods: 16- to 25-year-olds with a suspected ED and no previous specialist treatment were randomly allocated to FREED-M or active control in a parallel group, two-arm trial. Outcomes were measured at weeks 0 (baseline), 4 (post-intervention) and 12 (follow-up). The primary feasibility outcome was attrition at follow-up. Other outcomes included motivational, clinical and economic measures. Results: We were able to over-recruit with 204 randomised participants (including 20 fraudulent participants). Main analyses were conducted with 184 genuine responders (FREED-M: n=91, control: n=93). At baseline, participants’ mean age was 21.0 (SD 2.0) years, 89% identified as female and 64% as white. Mean BMI was 23.1 (6.3). N=83 participants had an anorexia nervosa-like disorder, 101 had another ED or ED high risk. Attrition at week 12 was n=112 (61%).  Of the n=42 FREED-M participants who provided acceptability ratings, 79% liked the intervention and 66% found it useful. Between-group effect sizes for motivation and readiness to change were small-medium at 4-weeks (d=0.27 and d=0.15, respectively) favouring FREED-M, but differences were not sustained at follow-up (d=-0.02 and d=-0.12, respectively).  Conclusions: Although the attrition rate was high, recruitment exceeded expectations. Acceptability of FREED-M was high. Motivation and readiness to change are candidates for primary outcomes in a future randomised controlled trial.",

          "authors": "Alexander Samuel Weigard; Mary Fiona Molloy; Chandra Sripada; Andrew Heathcote",
          "abstract": "Applications of the diffusion decision model (DDM) to the study of cognitive individual differences consistently find that the model’s drift rate (v) parameter forms a cohesive factor across many tasks and relates to measures of higher-order cognitive functioning, including general cognitive ability and working memory. This parameter is often interpreted as a measure of “processing speed”, a traditional psychometric construct thought to reflect an individual’s basic speed of information processing across tasks. However, conceptual differences between v and traditional notions of processing speed make this mapping far from straightforward. Racing accumulator models, which provide a more flexible and comprehensive account of behavioral data than the DDM (Heathcote &amp; Matzke, 2022), allow for the speed with which individuals accumulate evidence to be dissociated from the efficiency with which they accumulate task-relevant evidence (versus task-irrelevant evidence). We applied the DDM and a racing accumulator model to three tasks across three independent datasets to gauge the extent to which v parameter findings from the cognitive individual differences literature reflect speed of evidence accumulation (SEA) versus efficiency of evidence accumulation (EEA). Across all tasks, v was more strongly related to EEA than SEA. EEA was consistently related to measures of general cognitive ability, working memory, and executive function whereas SEA explained less than 1% of the variance in each. These findings suggest individual differences in the DDM’s v parameter, and its relations with higher-order cognitive abilities, primarily reflect EEA rather than SEA and challenge the widespread practice of equating v with the traditional “processing speed” construct.",

          "abstract": "Valence asymmetries - the tendency for negative stimuli to elicit more processing effort than positive stimuli - have been widely observed but remain theoretically contested. To advance this debate, we present a formalized account that integrates two major explanatory perspectives: the intrapsychic (or phylogenetic), and the ecological (or ontogenetic) approach. We introduce a concise set of parameters to specify the key concepts and analyze the argumentative structure of each perspective. This yields three major insights: a) parts of the established terminology are misleading and we suggest using more informative labels such as valence-driven and distinctiveness-driven instead, b) it is essential to specify how exactly “good” and “bad” stimuli are distinguished from one another, and c) some explanations rely on implicit yet critical assumptions such as the probability of having contact with stimuli. Clarifying these theoretical foundations provides a framework for conducting informative empirical tests in future research.",

          "abstract": "Attention can be affected by expectations about where and when stimuli will appear. These two influences, spatial and temporal, may be present together and may interact with each other in unknown complex ways. To explore these possibilities, we used an attention paradigm that incorporated three variables known to produce effects on performance in a speeded reaction-time task: spatial cueing to indicate where a target stimulus is likely to appear, temporal statistics to indicate when the target is likely to appear, and preparation for a block of trials of similar length. When analyzing the data for linear trends, we found that each of these factors impacted performance but did not interact. When analyzing nonlinear trends in the data, we found an interaction between spatial and temporal attention that was modulated by preparation for a block of trials of similar length. We evaluated whether attentional effects across spatial, temporal, and preparatory domains could be explained by one unitary mechanism, rather than multiple modality-specific mechanisms, using an augmented drift diffusion model. In the model, attention is allocated according to an interplay between the costs and benefits of maintaining attention. The model successfully replicated the linear effects observed in the human data, and accounted for some but not all nonlinear features in the data, suggesting that many disparate features of attention can be parsimoniously explained by a cost-benefit framework, but some complexity in attention control remains to be understood.",

          "abstract": "Valence asymmetries - the tendency for negative stimuli to elicit more processing effort than positive stimuli - have been widely observed but remain theoretically contested. To advance this debate, we present a formalized account that integrates two major explanatory perspectives: the intrapsychic (or phylogenetic), and the ecological (or ontogenetic) approach. We introduce a concise set of parameters to specify the key concepts and analyze the argumentative structure of each perspective. This yields three major insights: a) parts of the established terminology are misleading and we suggest using more informative labels such as valence-driven and distinctiveness-driven instead, b) it is essential to specify how exactly “good” and “bad” stimuli are distinguished from one another, and c) some explanations rely on implicit yet critical assumptions such as the probability of having contact with stimuli. Clarifying these theoretical foundations provides a framework for conducting informative empirical tests in future research.",

          "authors": "L J Ji; Cherie Zhou",
          "abstract": "Holistic and global cognition are often treated as interchangeable terms in psychological science to describe broad-scope cognitive styles. However, this conflation obscures important theoretical and methodological distinctions between the two constructs. In this review, we disentangle holistic and global cognition by tracing their conceptual foundations, measurement approaches, and empirical correlates. We argue that while both involve attending to “the big picture”, they are grounded in fundamentally different mechanisms: holistic cognition emphasizes sensitivity to context, relational reasoning, and causality, whereas global cognition reflects a tendency to prioritize higher-level, abstract, or gestalt features over local details. Drawing on cognitive, behavioral, and cross-cultural evidence, we synthesize findings that illustrate both the dissociation between these constructs, their underlying mechanisms, and their differential associations with other variables, as well as areas where they overlap. By mapping where these constructs diverge and converge, we provide a clearer conceptual and methodological distinction that reconciles past inconsistencies. We argue that such clarity is crucial for avoiding misinterpretation of findings and misalignment of measures. To this end, we offer concrete guidelines for defining, operationalizing, and studying these constructs, and call for more rigorous theoretical precision in future work.",

          "abstract": "If only the present exists, how can we make sense of causal chains that stretch across time, the irreversible processes we observe in nature, and the one-way arrow of time? This question strikes at the heart of temporal metaphysics and physics. Existential Realism (ER) is a present-centered ontological framework   that claims only present entities exist in the fullest sense, yet past and future entities are still in some sense real due to their causal connections and informational traces.  Unlike standard presentism (which would render past and future wholly unreal, raising puzzles about truth, memory, and cause),  ER draws a crucial distinction between existence and reality. Under ER, the present is the locus of existence, but the past remains ontologically real insofar as it has left enduring effects and information in the world. The future, likewise, though not yet existent, can be treated as real in the mode of anticipated possibilities that influence current plans and expectations. This nuanced ontology aims to resolve presentism’s classic problems   — for example, how past causes can still have effects, or how past-tense statements can be true if the past is utterly nonexistent.\nIn what follows, we will deepen the case for Existential Realism by showing how it accounts for causal relations, the linear order of time, the sense of temporal becoming, and the thermodynamic arrow of time. We will draw on insights from the philosophy of physics – including Hans Reichenbach’s   analysis of time’s direction, Huw Price’s   reflections on retrocausality and perspective, and Barry Loewer’s   work on entropy and the “Past Hypothesis” – to demonstrate that a present-centric metaphysics can be fully time-compatible. Ultimately, we argue that ER not only accommodates modern physics but preserves our intuitive and scientific understanding of time’s asymmetries and the unfolding causal story of the universe.",

          "abstract": "Autistic individuals experience temporal integration difficulties in some sensory modalities that may be related to imagination difficulties. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that among Japanese university students in the general population, (1) higher autistic traits and (2) greater imagination difficulties are associated with lower performance in tasks requiring temporal integration. Two tasks were used to assess their temporal integration abilities: a speech-in-noise test using noise with temporal dips in the auditory modality and a slit-viewing task in the visual modality. The results showed that low performance in the speech-in-noise test was related to autistic traits and some aspects of imagination difficulties, whereas the slit-viewing task was related to neither autistic traits nor imagination difficulties. The ability to temporally integrate fragments of auditory information is expected to be associated with performance in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips. The difficulties in perceiving sensory information as a single unified percept using priors may cause difficulties in temporally integrating auditory information and perceiving speech in noise. Furthermore, the structural equation modeling suggests that imagination difficulties are linked to difficulties in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips, which links to social impairments.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Quantum physics has dramatically reshaped our understanding of time and reality, revealing that the present moment occupies a uniquely privileged position within physical processes. In the first paper (\"Quantum Physics Prefers the Present: A Temporal Ontology Grounded in Measurement\"), we saw how quantum phenomena such as wavefunction collapse and measurement highlight the “now” as the only time when possibilities become actual. However, simply embracing presentism – the doctrine that only the present exists – is not enough. Presentism’s traditional metaphysical stance, which conflates existence with reality by declaring all non-present things unreal, runs into serious conceptual roadblocks when confronted with quantum experiments and the demands of causality and truth over time. This second paper advocates Existential Realism (ER) as a more nuanced and robust ontological framework that builds on those quantum insights while overcoming presentism’s limitations. By rigorously distinguishing existence from reality, ER provides a richer account of quantum phenomena – one that honors the special role of the present without erasing the past or negating the future. We will argue that ER better captures the ontology implied by quantum mechanics, from delayed-choice experiments and collapse theories to decoherence, and that it empowers a view of time where “becoming” and temporal agency are coherent and defensible.  In short, Existential Realism preserves the empirical centrality of the present while acknowledging the tangible reality of past causes and future possibilities — making it a more comprehensive fit for quantum reality.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "In both everyday language and philosophical discourse, the terms existence and reality are often used interchangeably. This conflation is especially evident in debates on the ontology of time. For example, an orthodox presentist will say that only present things truly exist, treating all non-present entities (past or future) as unreal in an absolute sense – “all such objects are unreal, according to Presentism,” as one defender neatly put it. This paper serves as a focused extension and clarification of the metaphysical framework introduced in Existential Realism – A Distinct Ontological Framework Beyond Presentism. It addresses specific questions raised by readers and critics: Is it coherent to distinguish existence from reality? What philosophical work does that distinction do? How does it help with longstanding problems like truthmaking, the status of unobservable entities, and future ethics? In short, while the original paper laid out the core ontological structure, this follow-up revisits its foundations to deepen the theoretical implications, refine key definitions, and explore practical consequences. Our central thesis remains: existence and reality are not identical. But here, we argue more sharply that separating them yields a more nuanced, empirically grounded, and philosophically productive ontology of time. We defend this view against objections, offer clarified examples, and explore its implications for epistemology, phenomenology, and ethics. We proceed as follows. Section 2 defines existence narrowly, in terms of presentness and empirical accessibility, drawing on the spirit of van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism . Section 3 then defines reality more broadly, to include causal and structural aspects of the world inferable beyond the present—illustrated through examples such as dinosaurs, future climate events, and cognitive anticipations. Section 4 explores how this distinction addresses several philosophical issues: the truthmaker problem for past truths, the ontological status of unobservable scientific entities, the phenomenology of temporal experience (in the sense of Husserl and Metzinger ), and considerations of metaphysical parsimony. Section 5 argues why this two-tier ontology is not merely a restatement of presentism or eternalism, but a distinct metaphysical framework. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our contributions and highlights new directions this view opens—particularly in ethics (e.g., our duties to future persons), AI models of time, and decision theory under uncertainty. Throughout, we maintain an academic tone and use end-of-paragraph references in line with the original paper’s style. Our aim is for this article to stand on its own as a focused argument on the existence–reality distinction, while continuing and enriching the foundation laid by Existential Realism.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Existential Realism as a novel ontological framework in metaphysics that offers a rigorously technical alternative to presentism. In contrast to standard presentism’s claim that only the present exists , In contrast to standard presentism, which claims that only the present exists, Existential Realism distinguishes between existence—material, empirically accessible presence—and reality, which includes causal, epistemic, and anticipatory structures beyond the immediate present. This framework integrates insights from metaphysics, epistemology, and phenomenology to address the limitations of presentism and related theories of time. We delineate how Existential Realism departs from presentism (and is not merely a variant thereof) by reinterpreting what it means for an entity or event to exist now, while still affirming the ontological significance of past and future entities as real despite their lack of present existence. Systematic comparisons are drawn between Existential Realism and the standard theories of temporal ontology – presentism, eternalism, and the growing block theory – with references to key contributors (Markosian, Crisp, Bourne, Zimmerman) to highlight differences in ontological commitments. We provide technically grounded examples—from causal traces in physics to cognitive-state evidence and time-indexed data structures—to show how entities can be real even without presently existing. The paper also addresses major objections, including the coherence of reality without existence, the epistemological access to entities that do not presently exist or are unobservable, and the compatibility of this framework with special relativity. A comparative table is included to map Existential Realism vis-à-vis other theories. In conclusion, Existential Realism is presented as a robust, integrative stance that preserves the empirical and experiential centrality of the present while acknowledging the enduring reality of the past and the looming reality of the future – thus serving as a stand-alone reference framework for future discourse in metaphysics and cognitive science.",

It is described here through eight core aspects, including the architecture of questions, the manifestation of core belief (kakushin), and the self-propagating nature of thought as an OS. Framed as a guidebook for “how to navigate” this theory, the paper also functions as a meta-thought: a theory that justifies itself through its own process of emergence.

National televised briefings to communicate updates and legislation changes were held at regular intervals during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. This study aimed to identify behaviour change strategies used within the UK’s COVID-19 national televised briefings. \n\nDesign: A content analysis was performed on twenty transcripts of UK national televised briefings, purposively selected for their alignment with key UK COVID-19 milestones between March 2020 and July 2021.\n\nMethods: Transcripts were analysed for behaviour change content using Intervention Functions from the Behaviour Change Wheel and the Behaviour Change Technique Ontology. Inter-rater reliability of double-coding was performed using Krippendorff’s alpha.\n\nResults: Sixty-nine of the 281 BCTs presented within the Behaviour Change Technique Ontology were identified across the twenty transcripts. The most commonly identified Intervention Functions were Education (100% of transcripts), Enablement (95%) and Persuasion (85%). The most commonly identified Behaviour Change Techniques were Present information from credible influence (100% of transcripts), Advise specific behaviour (90%), Instruct how to perform behaviour (70%) and Deliver instrumental support (70%).\n\nConclusions: The UK’s COVID-19 nationalised televised briefings were lacking Modelling and Training support. Televised briefings during future public health emergencies would benefit from including clear behavioural and outcome goals to guide and empower the public.

Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF), DNA was extracted from whole blood and DNAm was assayed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Microarray. \nUsing state-of the-art processing pipelines, we failed to replicate the original finding of common and shared epigenetic signatures by CM type. When using a pipeline that was closely matched to the original study, we could replicate that DNAm of cg07032930 was linked to emotional neglect, but in the reverse direction as in the original report. Overall, replication rates per CM subtype were only modest. \nThese findings highlight challenges in independently replicating reported epigenetic associations in high-risk samples and underscore the importance of replication attempts in the field of behavioral epigenetics.

          "abstract": "Registered Reports are a type of empirical article in which study proposals are peer reviewed and pre-accepted before the research is undertaken. This is achieved by splitting the traditional peer review process into two stages: at ‘Stage 1’, authors submit their study proposal and peer reviewers assess the plausibility of the research questions and the appropriateness of the methodology and analytical plan. Protocols that are favourably reviewed receive ‘In Principle Acceptance’ (IPA) whereby the journal, or platform, commits to publishing the final study regardless of its results. The authors then collect and/or analyse their data. At ‘Stage 2’, they then submit their complete research article and peer reviewers evaluate how closely the authors have followed their protocol and accurately report and interpret their findings. By doing this, Registered Reports are proposed to mitigate many issues seen in the historical research ecosystem: they aim to reduce the potential for questionable research practices by incentivising transparency and reproducibility and reduce publication bias by focusing on methodological and analytical rigour over the nature of the results. This guide provides an overview of what Registered Reports are and how they work, responds to frequently asked questions, outlines barriers and solutions to their implementation, and offers 10 top tips for researchers.

Hence, crafting a validity argument of the popular TPACK self-assessments is key to facilitating evidence-based practices in these areas. However, the existing body of validity evidence abounds in divergent findings, for instance on the factor structure of TPACK self-reports across pre- and in-service teacher samples. To synthesize this evidence and capture its heterogeneity, we conducted a systematic review with a meta-analysis. First, we examined the internal validity of TPACK by analyzing its factor structure using meta-analytic structural equation and network modeling. Second, we compared two theoretical models describing the relations among the TPACK dimension—the transformative and integrative models—against the data. Third, we assessed the external validity of self-reported TPCK by examining its correlation with actual technology use in teaching. Our findings revealed two distinguishable dimensions of TPACK for both pre- and in-service teacher samples, which represented the technological and non-technological dimensions. The integrative model provided an overall better fit to the data. Moreover, TPACK self-reports were moderately correlated with technology use (r ̅s = 0.23-0.49) and exhibited substantial heterogeneity. Our results underscore the importance of generating and considering both internal and external validity evidence when applying TPACK assessments to generate implications for educational research and practice.",

Experiential factors such as education, occupation, and leisure activities influence the development of CR. \nTheoretically, such factors build up from childhood and across adulthood. Thus, appropriate tools to define and measure CR as early as adolescence are essential to understand its developmental processes. To this aim, we introduce the construct of \"Cognitive Reserve Potential\" (CRP) and its corresponding index of experiential factors tailored to youth. We investigated prototypical youth exposures potentially associated with the lifelong development of CR (e.g., sport practice, musical experiences, cultural activities, relationships with peers and family).  \nPrincipal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis identified and replicated the CRP factor structure on two independent samples of Italian students: N=585 (295 F) and N=351 (201 F), ages 11-20. CRP was associated mainly with family socio-cultural status (i.e., SES, Home Possessions and Books at Home).  \nResults confirmed the strength of the factorial model and warranted the proposal of the CRP-questionnaire as an innovative tool for understanding CR evolutionary dynamics.",

In this replication study, we also included conspiracy mentality as the moderator variable that might influence the strength of the association between inoculation scripts and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. Findings from this study shows that logic-based and fact-based inoculation scripts were perceived differently by participants.

First, I describe various considerations of the nature of knowledge in the history of philosophy with a focus on the age-old epistemological controversy between rationalism and empiricism. Building on these reflections I present different psychological traditions of conceptualizing knowledge and their implications for the use of digital media. Then I introduce collective knowledge construction as a process in which people create new insights collaboratively in inter-personal activities that involve the collective creation of meaning and recollection via social interaction. I discuss conceptualizations of knowledge construction from a cognitive and from a sociocultural perspective. After that, as an integrative approach, I present a systems theoretical account that considers knowledge construction as a co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. The article concludes with a discussion of how collective knowledge construction as a cognitive and sociocultural phenomenon is currently changing due to recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence. I argue that this has also implications for memory processes, which are not mere individual repositories but part of distributed systems of cultural memory incorporating digital artifacts and human networks.",

          "abstract": "Child and adolescent development is influenced by complex interplay between a range of diverse factors. The network approach is gaining popularity as a way of modelling such complex processes. Here we used the network approach to investigate whether developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as arising from causal interactions between characteristics and symptoms. We used data from four population-based birth cohorts in England (n=47,315), those born in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s, to investigate interrelations between areas of psychological functioning that underpin learning and engagement in education settings (i.e., memory, attention, non-verbal ability, arithmetic skills, reading, language and communication, motor skills, neurodevelopmental characteristics, psychopathology, social functioning, and wellbeing). We fitted 12 undirected psychometric network models; one network for each cohort and developmental stage (early childhood; 3-5 years, middle childhood; 7-10 years, adolescence; 13-18 years). We then determined how these areas of functioning cluster within developmental domains. Clustering differed between childhood and adolescence. In early and middle childhood, psychological functioning, generally, clustered within two related developmental domains: (1) cognition and language and (2) social and emotional functioning. In adolescence, they clustered within three developmental domains (1) cognition and language and (2) social functioning, and (3) emotional functioning. We demonstrate that developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as likely resulting from causal interactions between different areas of psychological functioning. They arise through bottom-up processes, whereby a given symptom or characteristic activates or leads to another; symptoms or characteristics that activate or lead to each other cluster together and appear as neurodevelopmental or psychiatric conditions. Differences and disorders that appear to be similar, prima facie, may be underpinned by diverse etiologies. Our work provides the first population-level evidence for a needs-based support system in schools; children and adolescents with developmental disorders and differences should be supported by targeting specific characteristics and symptoms with the aim of deactivating clusters or related characteristics and symptoms. Such an approach does not rely on waiting for a diagnostic label through lengthy assessment processes.",

These crises disrupt daily life and fuel uncertainty about the future in a life phase where expectations about the future increasingly influence identity and wellbeing. Experiences of such challenges are not equally distributed: youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are often more affected, both behaviorally and neurodevelopmentally. In this perspective, we argue that adolescence is a developmental window of both vulnerability and opportunity. We highlight the role of uncertainty and inequality as key mechanisms linking societal challenges to wellbeing. Importantly, we propose that inclusive prosocial engagement—opportunities for youth to contribute meaningfully to others—can foster resilience, identity development, and a sense of purpose. We propose that supporting adolescent wellbeing requires a developmentally informed, context-sensitive, and globally inclusive approach.",

Four previous reviews (two systematic) covered interventions for acalculia, however, all missed some studies.\nThe current work systematically searched Web of Science and ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts for studies describing interventions for acalculia published up until 13th of June 2025. To be included, studies had to be written in English, involve an intervention for acalculia that resulted from a stroke or a brain-injury, directly address numerical difficulties, and report the outcomes of the intervention, with no limit on the type or timing of measures.  \nSixteen publications describing interventions for acalculia were identified, with a total of N=31 patients. One unpublished study described an app-based intervention with 18 patients. Most interventions (10) targeted relearning of multiplication tables, followed by interventions designed to improve transcoding (4). All interventions were delivered individually (i.e., no group interventions), and most were tailored to individual patients. The most common method used was intense repetition (‘drill’), and the majority of interventions were conducted in French or German. Only one intervention was delivered in a non-European language (Japanese). \nWhile all interventions were effective, there were differences in the transferability of improvement from trained to untrained problems. Overall, the review highlights the scarcity of evidence of interventions for acalculia, despite the high prevalence of the condition.

          "authors": "Monika Eckstein",
          "abstract": "Previous research has exhaustively shown that stressful situations and conditions at work are associated with increased health problems while only few studies have addressed the relationship between engagement beyond professional work and mental health. The state of research points to a bidirectional relationship between volunteering activities and better mental health, though. An underlying mechanism may lie in the social environment and meaningfulness by these activities. Therefore the question raises whether volunteering in free time may buffer worsening effects of work stress on mental issues. The goal of the present data analyses is to better understand risk and protective factors for mental health burden like depressive disorder and draw conclusions for the function of volunteering in persons’ lives.\nI analyzed the relationship between volunteer work and mental health in a large sociological cross-sectional data set (within one year, 2019) and a longitudinal data set (over 2 years, 2018 and 2019) with N = 18.490 persons (a subset of the German socioeconomic panel study, SOEP) with statistical regression models for main effects and moderation effects. Variables of interest were the frequency of volunteering and depressive illness as well as job characteristics (payment, hours), demography (gender, age), job satisfaction and general health.\nThe analyzes resulted in evidence for a small association between some work factors (low payment, low hours) and no volunteer engagement with mental health problems as depression in the same year. In addition, there are also longitudinal relationships that could be a first hint for potential causal relationships: While volunteering itself seems to be quite stable, it is performed by persons with prior good overall health and job satisfaction. This result is in line with the notion that being healthy and in a good job is a very important and central factor for participating in a social society. My analyzes also replicated the general role of gender and age and the work characteristics low salary and low hours as risk factors for depression. A clear buffering effect of volunteering against these risk factors in a longitudinal perspective could not been shown. Limitations of the analyzes are the small effect sizes and very parsimonious assessments of volunteering and mental health.\nIn the analyzed large data set, there is more than a thousand persons affected by depression. This large group of mentally ill people shows its relevance and therefore it is worth to investigate potential mitigating factors further in more systematic future research. My results also add that health and more general a good life situation is a very important precondition for behaving in a sustainable way, which in turn might result in more mental health and support for oneself and others. Furthermore, the importance of a good and healthy work environment cannot be stressed enough with factors like adequate acknowledgement applying to both: payed work and volunteering.",

          "abstract": "Around the globe, today’s generation of adolescents and young adults appear to experience more mental health problems than previous generations, and it is currently unclear why. Neuroimaging research has revealed vulnerabilities related to adolescents’ brain development, which gives insight into the development of mental health problems in adolescence. Neural changes, as part of normative development, can however not fully explain the rising trends. This paper outlines two important considerations: i) youth are currently dealing with various macro-level changes and ii) these changes are affecting youth through micro-system mechanisms in the family environment. First, the current generation of youth grow up in a society marked by multiple global changes like climate change, wars, poverty, and the aftermath of a pandemic. These macro-level changes can interfere with daily live and subsequently affect how youth feel about themselves, their lives, and their future, particularly through experiences of future uncertainty. Thus, it is important to gain understanding on how youth navigate through challenging times. However, not all youth are affected equally. As such the second focus of this paper is to shed light on which adolescents are prone to negative developmental outcomes. In the present perspective paper, we reflect on adolescence as a sensitive period for mental health problems and give an overview of how the macro-level influences of societal challenges, and micro-level influences in the family environment uniquely contribute and sometimes interact to shape youth’s wellbeing. Additionally, we discuss how providing youth with opportunities for inclusive prosocial actions may improve their wellbeing and elucidate how a more global perspective on studying youth’s wellbeing benefits research and practice.",

Using a single-blind randomized controlled design, this study involved 24 university students in a four-week academic writing training program. Participants completed weekly essays and received feedback either from ChatGPT or Pigai. ChatGPT’s responses were refined through prompt engineering, ensuring alignment with best practices for formative feedback by addressing lower-order (e.g., grammar, punctuation) and higher-order concerns (e.g., argumentation, structure), providing strengths and weaknesses, motivational language, and actionable improvement suggestions. Writing quality, perceptions of feedback quality, and motivation were assessed using linear mixed-effects modeling and independent samples t-tests. Both ChatGPT and Pigai improved writing quality over time, but only ChatGPT enhanced student motivation—particularly self-efficacy. These findings highlight the advantage of LLMs in delivering formative feedback over traditional AWE systems, particularly in fostering student motivation while achieving comparable improvements in academic outcomes.

ER was conceived to reconcile the intuitions of presentism (only the present exists) with eternalism (past and future are ontologically significant) in a two-tier view of time and being. This preprint surveys a range of open questions and forward-looking challenges that have emerged from the first generation of ER research. We chart key areas—metaphysics, physics, formal logic, phenomenology, cognitive science, and ethics—where ER’s framework invites further development. How does becoming (the passage from potential to actual) work in ER’s ontology? Can ER fully accommodate relativity and quantum physics without sacrificing its present-centric stance? What extensions to two-tier logic might capture phenomena like an open future or cross-temporal identity? How might ER engage with phenomenological accounts of time-consciousness or empirical findings about memory and anticipation in the brain? And what are the implications of ER for ethics, especially concerning our agency over time and responsibilities to future persons? Throughout, our tone is rigorous yet exploratory and humble: we outline problems and tensions rather than claim final answers.

We formalize a welfare model in which mood set-points are individually optimal but socially coupled through production, pro-sociality, and political legitimacy. We introduce the concept of affective conformity equilibria in which firms and platforms optimize output by narrowing variance around elevated hedonic baselines, producing a new pathology: Pathological Unhappiness—sorrow rendered deviant by design. We outline a preregistered experimental program (laboratory, field, and platform telemetry) to estimate causal effects of engineered happiness on creativity, moral judgment, and collective action; and we propose policy levers, from clinic consent to platform governance to labor law, that preserve therapeutic gains without erasing the cultural and civic functions of melancholy.

We summarize ER’s core definitions and motivations, drawing from metaphysics, cognitive science, and physics to illustrate why separating existence from reality matters. ER offers a synthesis: like presentism it holds that only the present exists, yet like eternalism it affirms that past and future entities can still be real. We provide examples from neuroscience (memory and anticipation), physics (causal traces and relativity), formal logic (truthmakers and temporal reasoning), and ethics (duties to past and future) to demonstrate ER’s explanatory power.

Method: Seventy-eight children (Mage = 10.19 years, 54% female) with clinically diagnosed dyslexia took part in the trial. Children were randomised to either attend Clever Kids (n = 38) or to a wait-list control condition (n = 40). Coping skills, emotion regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, assertiveness, as well as mental health (internalising and externalising symptoms) were measured at pre-programme, post-programme, and at three-month follow-up using well-validated measures. Results: The predicted interactions between intervention condition and time were significant for six outcomes. Attending Clever Kids was associated with significant improvements in child-reported coping, emotion regulation, academic and social self-esteem, as well as parent-reported anxiety and depression. Effects were all maintained at three-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, being assigned to the wait-list condition was associated with improvements in perseverance at follow-up assessment. For all other outcomes, interactions between intervention condition and time were non-significant. Conclusion: Clever Kids appears a promising programme for supporting socio-emotional wellbeing of children with dyslexia. Future research should consider incorporating caregivers more explicitly into the programme and alternative delivery modes, which could expand the reach of the programme.",

          "authors": "Atsushi Hamada; Kazuo Mori",
          "abstract": "In Japan, physical education (PE) is often perceived as less intellectual than other school subjects. To address this bias, we developed a paper-based implicit measure to evaluate the intellectual image of PE. The test adapts the FUMIE test (Mori et al., 2008), a paper-and-pencil version of the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., 1998), suitable for group use in schools. In Study 1, 52 university students rated 100 two-kanji Japanese words as “intellectual,” “non-intellectual,” or “neutral.” Based on high agreement, we selected 20 intellectual and 10 non-intellectual words to construct the iFUMIE test. In Study 2, we evaluated its reliability and validity using the target words “understanding” and “ignorance,” with 51 students. Results confirmed the test’s usability in measuring implicit intellectual associations. The iFUMIE offers a foundation for future research assessing the effects of instructional efforts designed to enhance the perceived intellectual value of PE.",

          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "This paper aims to reinterpret the long-assumed ineffable phenomenon of the sublime within the theoretical framework of the Core Belief Structure Theory (Kakushin Kōzō-ron).\nTraditionally discussed in religion, philosophy, and art as an experience of the infinite, the sacred, or the unknowable, the sublime is here defined as a collapse of the cognitive viewpoint, triggered when meaning structures leap beyond the processing capacity of the human Thought OS.\nThe central analytical model proposed is a three-stage sequence—Critical Leap → Structural Overreach → Perspective Collapse—through which the phenomenon of the sublime is structurally explained. The paper argues that the loss of language or tears in moments of awe are not emotional excesses but cognitive reactions to an unprocessable but existent structure.\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a five-stage Sublime Contact Design Model, offering a structural approach to increasing the likelihood of encountering the sublime in fields such as education, research, art, and healthcare. Through comparative analysis with major theories (Kant, Lacan, Heidegger, Barthes), the paper demonstrates that the Core Belief Structure Theory functions as a Thought OS capable of structurally articulating phenomena traditionally deemed beyond explanation.\nThe sublime, rather than being beyond language, is a structural event awaiting proper theoretical articulation. This work serves as a self-referential proof of the theory's capacity to describe the limits of meaning and the collapse of viewpoint within cognitive architecture.",

          "abstract": "In recognition memory, the variance of the target distribution is almost universally found to be greater than that of the lure distribution. However, these estimates commonly come from long-term memory paradigms where words are used as stimuli. Two exceptions to this rule have found evidence for greater lure variability: a short-term memory task (Yotsumoto et al., 2008) and in an eyewitness memory paradigm (Wixted et al., 2018). In the present work, we conducted a series of recognition memory experiments using different stimulus (faces vs. words) along with different paradigms (long-term vs. short-term paradigms) to evaluate whether either of these conditions would result in greater variability in lure items. Greater target variability was observed across stimulus types and memory paradigms. This suggests that factors other than stimuli and retention interval might be responsible for cases where variability is less for targets than lures.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a Beta-Bernoulli mixture item response model (BBM-IRT) for bounded-continuous items such as those often utilized in continuous rating scales and slider-bar assessments. These item types are commonly used in psychological research but, to date, these assessments have primarily been utilized in fixed-length situations, where the same set of items are administered to all respondents, and have not been utilized within an adaptive testing framework. An adaptive testing framework offers several benefits, including the ability to obtain higher quality measurement precision with fewer items as items are targeted and administered based on the respondent’s previous responses. In addition to introducing the BBM-IRT model, this work also explores the use of the model within an adaptive testing framework. In particular, the item and test information functions – a component necessary for building adaptive assessments – is derived and presented in closed form. Through a series of simulation studies, we provide empirical evidence that it is possible to create adaptive assessments for bounded-continuous item types. An application with real data is also provided showing how the BBM-IRT model can be utilized in practical assessment situations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Globally, as many as 1 in 8 children experience severe and persistent language difficulties. These children are at heightened risk for mental health difficulties, however, both the ways in which mental health concerns manifest in the context of language difficulties, and the experiences of children with language difficulties and their caregivers in accessing and engaging with formal mental health supports remain under researched. Aim: The aim of the current study was to explore lived experience perspectives (child and caregiver) on mental health concerns and, mental health support, for children (≤ 18 years) with language difficulties. Method: A 2-phased sequential explanatory design was employed, which combined findings from an online international survey of caregivers (n = 120) of children with language difficulties with data from semi-structured interviews with both children (n = 4) and caregivers (n = 12). Results: Combined data from the survey and interviews highlighted a high level of caregiver concern about the mental health of children with language difficulties but low levels of access to formal mental health support. Interviews highlighted several reasons for not accessing formal mental health supports including limited availability of mental health care providers; funding and time constraints (i.e., not wanting to over-schedule their child); mental health providers lacking knowledge about DLD, and perceived or actual barriers of traditional methods of therapy (e.g., one-on-one talk therapy) for children with language difficulties. Conclusions and Implications: The findings of our study support the view that children with language difficulties are at risk of mental health concerns and yet are also under-served by mental health services. These findings highlight the need for targeted interprofessional training and integrated models of collaborative care between mental health and language specialists to more adequately meet these children’s needs. Future research to engage a wider range of child perspectives and the perspectives of clinicians on the facilitators and barriers to engaging children with language difficulties in formal mental health support is needed.",

          "authors": "Shruti Mishra",
          "abstract": "In today’s attention economy, the first three seconds of a video can determine whether a viewer stays on and watches it or scrolls away. This study analyzes 46,605 TikTok “hooks\", the opening line of text or speech in a post, drawn from more than 20 content categories. Using emotion‐richness scoring, rhetorical device flagging, and mixed statistical‐machine-learning models, the analysis compares emotional versus informational hooks and evaluates five persuasion devices (questions, “how to” framing, second-person address, negation, and urgency cues). Emotional hooks are scarce (≈ 3.2 % of posts) yet drive proportionally higher comments and shares, suggesting deeper audience resonance, while any advantage to likes is modest. Curiosity gaps and urgency statements outperform direct address or instructional phrasing across most categories, while optimal hook length shifts dramatically based on the niche, ranging from ≈ 9 words in news to ≈ 90 in entertainment. Unsupervised clustering uncovers five stable hook archetypes, with Meta/Community Humor and Fast &amp; CTA-Heavy styles leading the chart as the strongest predictors of engagement. Regression-tree, random-forest, and SHAP analyses connect on content category, hook length, urgency cues, and emotional richness as the most reliable predictors of performance. Collectively, the findings highlight that viral success on short-form video rests on an interplay of tone, rhetorical craft, and category norms rather than any single “magic phrase.” Practical guidelines are offered for creators and marketers aiming to design hooks that capture attention in the critical first few seconds.",

This study evaluated whether an instrument previously shown to predict SU outcomes in mid-adolescence could also predict SU outcomes in young adulthood, comparing performance across ages and demographics. \n\n\nMethod: The Loeber Risk Score (LRS) is a 5-item, parent-completed screener indexing risk of future SU in children. We evaluated the predictive performance of the LRS in a nationally representative longitudinal birth cohort (N = 4,898, 48% female). Parents completed the LRS when the child was ~5 and ~9 years old. Subsequently, youth reported their SU at age ~22 years old. \n\n\nResults: The LRS at age 9 predicted several outcomes at age 22 better than chance (ps&lt;0.05): daily cigarette use (AUROCs=0.71-0.75), cannabis use ≥3x week (AUROC=0.59), vaping ≥3x week (AUROC=0.55), and receipt of treatment for an alcohol/drug problem (AUROC=0.60). Performance was no better than chance for alcohol outcomes (AUROCs=0.47-0.50). Children with LRS scores ≥2 were 1.3-2.0 times more likely to display frequent substance use outcomes. There were no consistent performance differences when the LRS was measured at age 5 vs. age 9 or by child’s sex, race, or ethnicity.\n\n\nConclusion: The LRS had modest accuracy when predicting some substance use outcomes in young adulthood, but it does not predict alcohol outcomes any better than chance.

          "abstract": "Potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and substance use (SU) are commonly endorsed in early adolescence, a crucial period for neurodevelopment. PTEs and SU are precipitating events in the etiological development of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Separately, they have been shown to alter within- and between-network connectivity in the three brain networks posited by Menon’s Theory of Psychopathology: the default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN). While comorbid PTSD+SUD in adulthood shows shared neural underpinnings, this is less clear in adolescence. We analyzed the effects of PTEs and SU (all use, alcohol/cannabis/nicotine only, and stimulant or sedative use) on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 9-15 year olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Fixed effects panel models were fit to assess the effects of PTEs and SU on between-network (FPN-SN rsFC, DMN-SN rsFC, and FPN-DMN rsFC) and within-network (FPN rsFC, SN rsFC, and DMN rsFC) connectivity measured across three timepoints spanning two years. PTEs were the most reliable predictor prospectively, with significant effects of PTEs observed for both between- and within-network rsFC. Alcohol and nicotine use predicted higher within-network DMN and FPN rsFC, but lower DMN-SN connectivity, while cannabis use predicted lower within-network SN connectivity and moderated PTE effects in SN and DMN-SPN connectivity. Evidence for PTEs and SU interactively predicting rsFC was supported with sex-specific effects (males showed a steeper decline in SN and DMN-SN connectivity when PTEs and SU were combined, and females showed stronger positive DMN connectivity when alcohol and PTEs were combined). Results suggest that the observed changes in resting state functional connectivity are related to exposure to PTEs, SU, and their interaction rather than the typically observed neurodevelopmental changes during adolescence, highlighting a critical period for early intervention to prevent rsFC changes following PTEs and SU in early adolescence.",

Using functional MRI, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying music perception in one-hundred healthy participants by comparing responses to intact and temporally scrambled musical pieces. Through computational acoustic analyses, we demonstrated that scrambling disrupted global structure while preserving local features, which allowed us to assess how the brain extracts coherence from musical input. We observed that intact music recruited a fronto–striatal pathway associated with rhythm processing, affect and reward, while scrambled music engaged auditory areas implicated in perception, as well as a fronto-parietal and cerebellar network involved in cognitive control. Through linear mixed-effects modelling, we also showed that individual differences in musical aptitude, training, and emotional self-regulation influence music perception in default–mode and cognitive, but not reward areas. We observed a dissociation between musical training and aptitude indices within the angular gyrus, showing opposite responses to intact and scrambled music. Our findings suggest that coherent musical structure is critical in shaping musical affect, with implications for a better understanding of the role of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Although often linked, much is unknown about the relationship between adolescents’ social media use and stress in everyday life. This study examined how the effect of social media use on stress unfolds at daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly levels, focusing both on overall effects across the sample and person-specific effects. In addition, we tested whether adolescents differed in effects based on their gender, age, and trait resilience. We used a 100-day diary study among 479 adolescents (44,211 completed observations). Participants reported daily stress levels and time spent on favorite social media platforms. Trait-level moderators were measured in a baseline questionnaire. Overall, the daily effect of social media use on stress was negligible (β = .03). However, there was substantial variation among adolescents: for 37% usage was linked to increased stress, for 14% to reduced stress, and for 49% it had no impact. These differences could not be explained by gender, age, or trait resilience. At longer timescales, the effect strengthened and affected more adolescents, rising from weekly (β = .05; increased stress for 46% of adolescents), over biweekly (β = .07; for 59%), to monthly levels (β = .13; for 73%). Additionally, 14% experienced less stress on days of increased usage, but this relief effect was nearly absent at longer timescales. The daily impact of social media use on stress is minimal. However, the effect becomes more pronounced over longer periods. This study is a first step toward understanding how everyday social media-related stress accumulates over time.",

Using a Bayesian computational model applied to a modified multi-armed bandit task, we investigated the correspondence between optimal triggers of curiosity (those that maximize learning potential), heuristic triggers of curiosity (surprise and uncertainty), and participants’ reported curiosity. In Studies 1-2 (N = 848), we found that adults’ curiosity was most sensitive to “local” learning potential (the extent to which information would shed light on the immediate target of curiosity). Curiosity was less sensitive to “global” learning potential (the extent to which information would contribute to broader learning goals), uncertainty, or surprise. Study 3 (N = 310) showed that curiosity’s sensitivity to local learning potential strengthened between ages 5 to 9 years and adulthood. Together, these studies suggest that curiosity tracks opportunities for learning, especially those that support learning about immediate targets of curiosity rather than broader learning goals.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of attention is its spatial scope: whether attention is narrowly focused or more broadly distributed across the visual field. Here, we examined whether the spatial scope of attention is modulated by tonic arousal level. Based on findings that arousal amplifies the selectivity of attention and memory, we hypothesized that arousal would enhance the currently dominant spatial scope of attention (narrow or broad). Participants (N = 39) performed a visual search task designed to measure the breadth of attention. Auditory white noise was presented in half of the blocks to increase tonic arousal. Each trial started with a procedure that aimed to induce a narrow or broad breadth of attention. Pupil size measurements and visual search task performance revealed that the manipulations of arousal and breadth of attention were successful. However, we found strong Bayesian evidence against an effect of arousal on attentional scope. We discuss the implications of this finding for arousal-biased competition theory.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "authors": "Giovanni Pezzulo; Günther Knoblich; Domenico Maisto; Francesco Donnarumma; Elisabeth Pacherie; Uri Hasson",
          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Psychosexual development is profoundly shaped by a network of hormonal signals that influence brain organization, behavior, and social interactions. Among these, sex steroid hormones, neuropeptides, and glucocorticoids play central roles in shaping motivational circuitry during critical windows of perinatal and pubertal brain development. Insights from modern developmental neuroendocrinology and behavioral genetics serve as a new foundation through which to understand Freud’s five stages of psychosexual development. The oral stage is primarily shaped by the organizational effects of sex hormones on perinatal brain development, and by oxytocin’s role in attachment formation. The anal stage centers on bodily control, mediated by cortical development and influenced by stress exposure. The phallic stage is characterized by the emergence of gender identity and psychological sex differences, where neuropeptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin play critical roles facilitating the development of prosociality and aggression. The latency stage marks the beginning of adrenal puberty, improved executive functioning, and environmental influences on pubertal timing. The genital stage represents a critical period of brain and behavioral reorganization driven by puberty, whereby androgens and estrogens orchestrate the development of secondary sexual characteristics, sex drive, neural reward circuitry, and sex differences in risk-taking and anxiety. Taken together, Freud’s theory of psychosexual development is revised under modern empirical constraints in the spirit of his Project for a Scientific Psychology.",

          "authors": "Tong Li; Joshua R. Oltmanns",
          "abstract": "A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many are developed from language responses directly to the depression assessments. These “Mirror models” suffer from “criterion contamination,” which arises when a predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus “Non-Mirror models,” which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two different interviews: (1) structured diagnostic and (2) life history. GPT-4, GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models (using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R²  = .80). As expected, Non-Mirror models (using life history data) demonstrated smaller effect sizes, but were still relatively large (e.g., R² = .27). When Mirror and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and Non-Mirror performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve, incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological assessment.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Older typical-hearing adults without a cochlear-implant (CI) have been found to exhibit greater multisensory benefits when identifying audiovisual speech than younger normal-hearing adults. The greater multisensory benefits demonstrated by older non-CI users can compensate for unisensory auditory and visual speech deficits, allowing them to identify audiovisual speech at a degree of accuracy like that of younger normal-hearing adults. Though most new CI recipients are 65 years of age and older, the reliance of older CI users on such multisensory benefits is unknown. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate age-related differences in cross-sensory and multisensory benefits in audiovisual speech identification in aging CI users and to examine how they differ from age-matched non-CI users.\n\nDesign. Twenty middle-aged-to-older CI users (50-83 years of age) and 35 age-matched non-CI controls completed an auditory-visual speech identification task, identifying 288 disyllabic words presented either auditory-alone, visual-alone, or audiovisually. CI users identified speech stimuli streamed directly through their CI device in quiet and in noise (Gaussian) at +10 and +5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Non-CI users identified speech stimuli delivered through earphones in noise at -5, 0, and +5 dB SNR conditions. Different noise conditions were used for CI users and non-CI users to avoid ceiling and floor effects. From visual, auditory, and audiovisual performance, psychometrics for the visual enhancement of audiovisual speech (VE), the auditory enhancement of audiovisual speech (AE), and auditory-visual multisensory enhancement (AVE) were calculated. Group differences (in the overlapping +5 dB SNR condition) and effects of age and noise were tested using linear regression and linear mixed-effects regression models.\n\nResults. Both CI users and non-CI users demonstrated canonical differences in visual, auditory, and audiovisual speech identification. VE and AVE were greater for CI users than non-CI users.

The results of the current investigation suggest that CI users, like age-matched non-CI users, rely on multisensory integration more as they age. Older CI users can benefit more from audiovisual input than older non-CI users. These perceptual benefits grant older CI users the capacity to identify audiovisual speech to a degree of accuracy closer to that of older non-CI users, despite deficits in the auditory perception of CI users. As a result, successful use of a CI device may partially depend on the ability of a CI user to integrate information they see with information available from their device, and older CI users may depend on visual input more to successfully use their CI.",

Both are strongly influenced by human behaviour, making behavioural change a critical pathway for mitigating climate and health risks. This chapter explores how selected theories and models from health and environmental psychology can inform the development and implementation of interventions that promote both healthy and sustainable behaviours. It then presents effective interventions targeting psychological factors as well as more structural aspects (e.g., infrastructure and policy) in high-impact behavioural domains such as mobility (reducing car use and promoting active transport) and diet (reducing meat consumption and increasing the intake of healthy plant-based foods). Finally, the chapter discusses the limitations and future directions of current behaviour change approaches, calling for greater representation of diverse populations, more long-term evaluations, consistency in measured outcomes, and greater attention to the broader context in which behaviours occur. Overall, this chapter advocates for multidisciplinary and multilevel interventions that address both individual and contextual determinants of behaviour. It aims to inspire researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to strengthen the scientific and societal relevance of behavioural strategies in the transition toward healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.",

Collocation analysis further showed that Title IX is frequently situated alongside other regulatory terms such as “VAWA,” “FERPA,” “Clery,” and “nondiscrimination,” suggesting its central role within a broader network of institutional compliance and campus safety mandates.

Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

Hierarchical linear regressions assessed whether FreeSurfer-derived total hippocampal volume or hippocampal subfield volume (subiculum, presubiculum, dentate gyrus, CA1) moderated the association between GAP-43 and episodic memory performance. GAP-43 and hippocampal volume were independently associated with episodic memory performance.

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

          "authors": "Som Subhro Nath",
          "abstract": "The rise of generative artificial intelligence has ushered in a new era where machines produce text with such emotional coherence that they blur the boundary between simulation and sentience. This paper explores the emotional fallacy—a cognitive bias wherein users and even developers anthropomorphize Large Language Models (LLMs), attributing genuine emotions to systems governed solely by statistical inference and pattern recognition.\n\nWhile LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI are engineered to generate emotionally evocative content, their responses are frequently mistaken as indicators of self-awareness, affective reasoning, or internal states. This anthropomorphic illusion carries significant implications for user trust, emotional labour, and the broader ethical landscape of AI deployment.\n\nThrough a novel empirical study, we evaluate the responses of multiple LLMs to a curated set of emotionally charged and ethically sensitive prompts. The outputs are analyzed qualitatively across three dimensions: linguistic style, affective mimicry, and ethical stance. Our findings reveal a paradox: while LLMs simulate emotion with impressive linguistic precision, they lack any true experiential grounding—underscoring their inherent emotional inauthenticity.\n\nTo address these concerns, we propose an ethical framework that includes affective transparency, disclosure protocols, and regulation to prevent emotional manipulation in public-facing AI systems. We argue that the unchecked spread of the emotional fallacy may distort public perceptions of AI, affect mental health, and reshape norms surrounding machine consciousness and empathy.\n\nBy integrating philosophical inquiry, empirical analysis, and ethical design, this paper calls for a paradigm shift—from emotional realism to emotional accountability in the design and deployment of generative AI. Our work offers a cautionary lens and a research frontier in the study of human–AI emotional interaction, particularly as such systems permeate education, healthcare, and psychological support domains.",

          "abstract": "Until now, we have explained the process of deriving emotions and thoughts based on Wiener processes using stochastic differential equations. While we have been able to predict the values of cognitive curves, we actually want to know how to address depressive symptoms. Specifically, we want to know how to reduce the number of times depressive symptoms occur and how to shorten the duration of depressive symptoms. Therefore, we considered the number of times depressive symptoms occur. First, we derived the probability distribution of the number of times depressive symptoms occur used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the expected value of the derived probability distribution, it was found that the expected number of times depression symptoms occur is equal to the time spent experiencing depression symptoms converted into the number of times. Based on these results, we proposed interventions for depression. These interventions are the same as those used in psychiatric treatment, and we provided a logical basis for these treatments.",

A significant rise of 28% in the relative frequency of 12 target words was found exclusively in 2024, suggesting a recent in-crease in LLM use. In particular, the words delve, enhancing, and pivotal saw significant in-creased use in 2024. Furthermore, higher-prestige journals exhibited slightly greater AI-associated word frequency. Country-level differences indicated particularly higher AI-word us-age in abstracts from China, South Korea, and Iran.

          "authors": "Graeme Lithgow",
          "abstract": "Abusive relationships are profoundly shaped by the interaction of distinct neurobiological profiles. This paper proposes a systems-level framework—defined as the interaction between neural, endocrine, and behavioral systems—of neurobiological entanglement to explain the self-perpetuating cycles of exploitation and dependency in relationships involving individuals with covert narcissistic traits and neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD or autism. The framework integrates research on the neurobiological mechanisms of perpetrators, who exhibit high cognitive but low emotional empathy, with the neurodivergent vulnerabilities of victims, including dopamine dysregulation and heightened oxytocin sensitivity. We conceptualize trauma bonding as a neurochemical process that shares key features with addiction, driven by intermittent reinforcement that exploits these inherent sensitivities. The long-term consequences of this abuse, including alterations to the hippocampus, amygdala, HPA axis, and default mode network, are discussed. Finally, we outline a neurobiologically-tailored recovery approach using the “Six Rs” framework. Given that neurodivergent individuals are significantly more likely to experience intimate partner violence—up to 47% in autistic women—this paper argues that recognizing narcissistic abuse as a neurobiological public health concern is essential for developing specialized, evidence-based interventions and policies to support neurodivergent survivors.",

The experimental design utilized was Completely Randomized Design, comprising 13 treatments, each replicated three times. The soaking agents included GA3 and organic substances with specific treatments as follows: T0: Control, T1: Distilled water + 72 hours soaking, T2: GA3 @ 400 ppm + 24 hours soaking, T3: GA3 @ 500 ppm + 24 hours soaking T4: Azospirillum @ 5% + 24 hours soaking,T5: Azospirillum @ 10% + 24 hours soaking, T6: PSB @ 5% + 24 hours soaking, T7: PSB @ 10% + 24 hours soaking, T8: Cow urine @ 5% + 24 hours soaking, T9: Cow urine @ 10% + 24 hours soaking, T10: Custard Apple Leaf Extract @ 5% + 24 hours soaking, T11: Custard Apple Leaf Extract @ 10% + 24 hours soaking and T12: Cow dung slurry @ 10% + 24 hours soaking. The results of the present investigation showed that among the various pre-soaking treatments, T2 (GA3 @ 400 ppm + 24 hours soaking) was the most effective in enhancing seed germination and shoot growth parameters, followed by T3 (GA3 @ 500 ppm + 24 hours soaking). In contrast, the control treatment (T0) exhibited the lowest performance across all evaluated parameters. Among the organic treatments, T9 (Cow urine @ 10% + 24 hours soaking) produced the most favourable response, followed by T12 (Cow dung slurry @ 10% + 24 hours soaking). In conclusion, T9 may serve as a viable alternative to chemical treatments in organic or low-input production systems.",

While defaulting to pre-booked slots may increase uptake, potential rebound effects remain unclear. We examine preferences between appointment types, their effect on vaccination intentions, and whether effects are different for individuals hesitant about this vaccination round.\n\nMethods: A mixed-methods approach was used to assess vaccination intentions for three groups (&lt;60 with influenza vaccination indication, 60-69 and 70+ years) eligible for pre-booked appointments. Study 1 examined attitudes around pre-booked appointments in 15 interviews. Study 2 experimentally tested preferences for pre-booked appointments vs self-scheduled appointments and their effect on vaccination intentions in a representative online panel (n=1.886) and those who experience hesitancy about this vaccination.\n\nFindings: Interviews showed that pre-booked appointments are seen as presumptuous or inconvenient (a potential indicator of reactance) by some, but also as a useful aid in support of vaccination uptake, sometimes by the same people. Participants in Study 2 indicated a preference for self-scheduling (Coefficient = -.23) but this preference did not translate to differences in vaccination intentions (Adjusted OR =1.11) Similar results were observed in the hesitant subgroup (Coefficient = –.25; Adjusted OR = 0.88).\n\nDiscussion: In our study pre-booked appointments do not change COVID-19 vaccination intentions. As pre-booked appointments evoked negative and positive sentiments and self-scheduling was found easier and more pleasant, it is important to examine potential rebound effects of switching the default, particularly amongst subgroups in the population with lower intentions.",

Twin studies estimate heritability at 0.41–0.66, and neuroimaging reveals large effect sizes for frontoparietal connectivity differences, supporting a polygenic neurodevelopmental origin. This paper presents an integrative synthesis from 2020–2025, combining findings from genomics, neurodevelopment, and cognitive neuroscience. Candidate genes affecting cortical patterning (CYP26B1, FOXG1, TCF4), synaptic scaffolding (SHANK3), and neurotransmitter systems (COMT, DRD4, HTR2A, OXTR, BDNF) produce an atypical cognitive architecture that disrupts visual-frontal integration but supports compensatory verbal-analytic strengths. The proposed “Aphantasia-Plus” phenotype includes enhanced reasoning, trauma resilience, and systemizing cognition. The model generates testable predictions for genetic scoring, neuroimaging, and education outcomes, and reframes aphantasia as a neurodivergent specialization rather than a deficit.",

The central thesis asserts that repetitive patterns in behavior, speech, and relational dynamics often reflect unintegrated symbolic configurations rather than pathology. By introducing the concept of structural integration fractals, we delineate how therapeutic transformation can occur through spontaneous symbolic resonance, even outside of traditional clinical contexts.\n\nThe model articulates a distinction between traumatic repetition and functional symbolic repetition, illustrating how projected symbols—when named or mirrored appropriately—can catalyze the reorganization of the self. A representative case study (“Alex”) is presented to demonstrate how fractal structures emerge in everyday discourse and may serve as therapeutic anchors without explicit psychotherapeutic framing.\n\nWe offer clinical tools, procedural frameworks, and symbolic language guidelines to support professionals in implementing the model without requiring advanced AI or digital systems. This work opens new lines of inquiry into symbolic language as a catalyst for reconfiguration and highlights the viability of structurally oriented interventions that align with the client’s projected symbolic logic.\n\nKeywords: structural fractals, symbolic integration, projected self, therapeutic repetition, symbolic logic, non-invasive therapy, clinical semiotics, psycho-symbolic resonance.",

Across four preregistered experiments (total N = 601), we demonstrate that, rather than adjusting estimates towards the extremes to correct for the regressiveness of the original judgments, participants consistently shifted their estimates of the true underlying probabilities towards the mean, thereby reinforcing regression effects.

Little research outside the US has included youth who vape, particularly those using newer disposable vapes. We investigated exposure to nicotine and the TSNA NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) among youth in England who vape, smoke, do both (dual), or do neither.\n\nMethods: \nIn 2023, youth aged 16-19 from England completed a survey and provided a urine sample (N=201). Linear regressions examined associations of creatinine-normalised urinary concentrations of Total Nicotine Equivalents (TNE-2) and NNAL (a metabolite of NNK) with past 7-day smoking/vaping status and self-reported recency of vaping. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex-at-birth, ethnicity, and any past 7-day cannabis use. \n\nFindings:\nOver three quarters (77%) of those vaping were using the newer disposable vapes. Urinary TNE-2 concentrations among those who exclusively vaped in the past 7 days (n=83, geometric mean (GM)=5.09 nmol/mg creatinine [95%CI=3.19-8.12]) did not differ significantly from those who smoked (n=9,GM=1.74[0.64-4.72],p=.426) or dual used (n=55, GM=5.60[3.32-9.43],p=.953). Levels of NNAL among those who exclusively vaped (GM=1.87 pg/mg creatinine[1.62-2.17]) were significantly lower than those who smoked (GM=4.87,p=.001[2.45-9.68]) or dual used (GM=3.67[2.76-4.86],p&lt;.001) and not significantly different from youth who neither vaped nor smoked (GM=1.84[1.52-2.24],p=.887).\n\nInterpretation:\nYouth who vape are exposed to similar levels of nicotine compared to those who smoke or who dual use. NNAL exposure among youth who vape is much lower than those who smoke, and indistinguishable from youth who do not vape or smoke.",

          "authors": "Jian-Sheng Kang",
          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels. Additionally, we present a quantum geometric derivation of Newton's gravitational constant and resolve the cosmological constant problem through discrete spacetime structures, unified by Hodge duality and baryonic matter counterforce mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Online consultation is a convenient format for public risk preference elicitation. Substantial instability and inconsistencies cast doubts about the reliability of the obtained preferences for policymaking. Given the parallels between choice blindness manipulation (CBM) detection and risk preference (in)stability, I explore in this study explores whether CBM detection can indicate risk preference. An online randomized controlled experiment with 330 UK residents served to test the coincidence of CBM and risk preference stability along with common predictors, incl. task-, domain-, and individual-specific variables. Using 2 different stimuli to communicate risks and outcomes in elicitation gambles, covering five urban drainage and flood prevention outcomes, the results do not support CBM detection as an indicator of preference stability. Only about 1 in 4 participants detected at least one CBM and 1 in 10 manipulations were detected. Risk preferences were moderately stable across trials but inconsistent across treatment conditions; icon array stimuli led to risk-seeking and numeric stimuli led to risk-averse preferences. The significant predictors of CBM detection included task stimuli, choice latency, risk numeracy, age, and household flooding or waterbody pollution domains. Significant predictors of risk preference stability were gamble distinctness and risk numeracy, as also the only joint predictors of CBM detection and preference stability. By contrasting with theoretical explanations and earlier findings in literature, gaps to address in future research were identified. The empirical findings highlight a strong influence of choice architecture on preference construction also in this study, questioning neutrality and reliability of online risk preferences elicitation for policymaking.",

In this experimental study, we designed a collaborative scavenger hunt with one participant remotely operating a telepresence robot and another participant being physically present on-site. Together, they solved a series of tasks, and their experiences were evaluated in terms of teaming, workload, and presence. Descriptive results indicate a generally positive collaboration experience, with similar levels of perceived workload across both participant groups and high ratings of social presence and engagement. These findings highlight the potential of telepresence robots for distributed collaboration and provide a valuable foundation for future studies aimed at optimizing their use in more complex, real-world scenarios.",

          "abstract": "When comparing latent means across groups, measurement invariance (MI) needs to be established to ensure that the test results are valid and meaningful conclusions can be drawn. Common tests of MI are not suitable for many groups and cannot be used during the development of measurement models. In addition, popular network-based alternatives to latent variable modeling lack established methods for MI testing. Therefore, we propose Exploratory Graph Analysis Trees (EGA trees) that apply the idea of model-based recursive partitioning to correlation matrices and combine it with EGA - which can be used instead of exploratory factor analysis. In a simulation study, we test the approach regarding its ability to detect configural or metric non-invariance in common factor models given numerous covariates and illustrate its usefulness in conditions with severe violations of configural invaraince based on diverging numbers of factors. The results demonstrate that EGA trees can be a valuable tool for the exploration of MI when constructing scales and working on measurement models. We provide R functions within the R package EFAtree to easily implement EGA trees.",

          "authors": "C Chinchu",
          "abstract": "India faces a profound mental health crisis, marked by the largest population in the world, a high prevalence of disorders and a severe shortage of qualified professionals. Recent policy initiatives, including the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Act 2021, aim to reform psychology education to address these challenges. This article critically examines the evolving landscape of psychology higher education in India, focusing on the curricula proposed by the NCAHP and the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). While the NCAHP’s B. Psy model curriculum represents a commendable step towards competency-based education, it faces implementation hurdles related to restrictive entry requirements, regulatory ambiguities, and infrastructural demands. Concurrently, the RCI’s introduction of a B.Sc. Clinical Psychology (Hons.) program, with its nomenclature and scope of practice, creates further discord and potential jurisdictional overlaps with the NCAHP and the University Grants Commission (UGC). This article analyses these competing frameworks, their alignment with existing legislation and international standards, and their implications for the standardisation and regulation of psychology professionals. It proposes recommendations for fostering synergy among regulatory bodies, clarifying professional roles, and enhancing the accessibility and quality of psychology education to build a robust mental health workforce. Strengthening psychology education and professional regulation is a national imperative and central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 on good health and well-being.",

While eternalism posits a static block where all times equally exist, and presentism insists only the now exists, both struggle with relativity’s implications. Existential Realism (ER), recently introduced by T. C. Trepp, resolves this tension by distinguishing between “existence” (reserved for the present) and “reality” (which includes past and future insofar as they leave traces or can be anticipated).   ER accommodates the relativity of simultaneity and the frame-dependence of “now,” avoiding the block’s metaphysical excess while preserving the ontological specialness of the present. This paper shows how ER reconciles relativity’s empirical content with a present-centered view that includes objective becoming and temporal continuity.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "In both philosophy and science, standard logics struggle to model a key insight of Existential Realism (ER): that existence is a strictly present, empirical notion, whereas reality spans beyond the present. Classical first-order logic and even temporal modal logics tend to conflate being real with existing simpliciter, making it difficult to formally distinguish something that exists now from something that is real but not present. This paper introduces a formal two-tier logical framework tailored to ER’s ontology. We motivate this framework by showing how orthodox systems—from classical predicate logic to temporal modal logic—fail to capture ER’s core distinction between present existence and temporally extended reality. We then develop a layered logic with explicit operators or quantifiers for “existence-now” versus “reality-over-time,” including formal axioms that preserve ER’s asymmetries: only present entities exist (in the fullest sense), yet past and future entities can be real (ontologically significant) without existing. The logic adopts a modal-style treatment of time to model the collapse of potential into actual (present-becoming), and explicitly encodes causal asymmetry — where the past influences the present, but not the reverse. We illustrate the framework with symbolic representations, including an iconic “ER equation” capturing the relationship between reality and existence. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply the logic to examples from quantum physics (e.g. wavefunction collapse and delayed-choice experiments), cognitive neuroscience (memory traces and anticipatory processing), ethics (moral duties to future persons and the reality of future outcomes), and AI (agents modeling counterfactual or temporally extended scenarios). Finally, we show how the formalism sheds new light on classic metaphysical debates such as the truthmaker problem for past truths, persistence and identity over time, and the ontology of merely possible or future entities. Throughout, our presentation maintains a rigorous yet accessible tone, consistent with prior ER works, with technical clarity and footnoted references. The result is a self-contained preprint that extends T.C. Trepp’s Existential Realism into a formal logical system, demonstrating its broad applicability across science, philosophy, and practical reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Computational models that explain lightness/brightness illusions have been proposed. These models have been assessed using a simplistic criterion: the number of illusions each model can correctly predict from the test set. This simple method of evaluation assumes that each illusion is independent; however, since the independence and similarity among lightness illusions have not been well established, potential interdependencies among the illusions in the test set could distort the evaluation of models. Moreover, evaluating models with a single value obscures where the model’s strengths and weaknesses lie. We collected the magnitudes of various lightness illusions through two online experiments and applied exploratory factor analyses. Both experiments identified some underlying factors in these illusions, suggesting that they can be classified into a few distinct groups. Experiment 1 identified three common factors; assimilation, contrast, and White’s effect. Experiment 2, with a different illusion set, identified two factors–assimilation and contrast. We then examined three well-known models that are based on early-visual processes, using the outcomes of the experiments. The examination of these models revealed biases in the models towards specific factors or sets of illusions, which suggested their limitations. This study clarified that correlations of illusion magnitudes provide valuable insights into both illusions and models and highlighted the need to assess models based on their ability to account for underlying factors rather than individual illusions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Children with dyslexia are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties, both internalising (emotional) and externalising (behavioural) problems. Clever Kids is a nine-week socio-emotional wellbeing programme developed specifically to support upper primary school children with dyslexia. Aims: We conducted a pre-registered randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of Clever Kids. Method: Seventy-eight children (Mage = 10.19 years, 54% female) with clinically diagnosed dyslexia took part in the trial. Children were randomised to either attend Clever Kids (n = 38) or to a wait-list control condition (n = 40). Coping skills, emotion regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, assertiveness, as well as mental health (internalising and externalising symptoms) were measured at pre-programme, post-programme, and at three-month follow-up using well-validated measures. Results: The predicted interactions between intervention condition and time were significant for six outcomes. Attending Clever Kids was associated with significant improvements in child-reported coping, emotion regulation, academic and social self-esteem, as well as parent-reported anxiety and depression. Effects were all maintained at three-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, being assigned to the wait-list condition was associated with improvements in perseverance at follow-up assessment. For all other outcomes, interactions between intervention condition and time were non-significant. Conclusion: Clever Kids appears a promising programme for supporting socio-emotional wellbeing of children with dyslexia. Future research should consider incorporating caregivers more explicitly into the programme and alternative delivery modes, which could expand the reach of the programme.",

          "abstract": "This paper theorizes the Subconscious Inner Thought Manipulation Theory (SITMT), which argues that all inner thought operates through unconscious processing systems that can be manipulated during critical childhood developmental periods to permanently alter cognitive architecture. Building on dual process theory research showing that unconscious Type 1 processing drives most human cognition, SITMT proposes that the specific form of inner experience each person develops, whether verbal internal monologue, visual imagery, emotional processing, or abstract conceptual flow, results from deliberate or unconscious manipulation of subconscious processing systems during periods when conscious resistance is impossible. The theory suggests that: (1) All inner thought emerges from unconscious processing systems operating below conscious awareness, making it inherently vulnerable to external manipulation, (2) Critical developmental periods create maximum plasticity in unconscious processing architecture when manipulation can permanently alter cognitive patterns, (3) The right hemisphere's inability to communicate verbally creates opportunities for unconscious manipulation of non-verbal processing systems without conscious detection, (4) Subliminal and pre-conscious environmental inputs shape unconscious processing preferences through repetitive conditioning that operates entirely below awareness thresholds. Unlike traditional theories focusing on conscious cognitive development, SITMT reveals how the unconscious mind, which generates all inner thought, can be programmed to produce specific cognitive experiences while the conscious mind remains completely unaware of this manipulation. This theory has implications for cognitive autonomy, mental freedom, and understanding how human consciousness itself may be controlled through unconscious processing system manipulation.",

          "abstract": "This paper redefines the commonly observed “flow state” from the perspective of Kakushin Structural Theory (KST), presenting it as a specific manifestation of structurally driven intelligence. While flow has been extensively documented in psychology and neuroscience—characterized by concentration, immersion, hedonic continuity, ego dissolution, and temporal distortion—its structural mechanism has remained unexplained.We introduce the concept of Orbital Intelligence, describing it as a dynamic cognitive mode that emerges through the following three structural conditions:\n•\tCritical density of structural shards (prepared cognitive fragments)\n•\tChain of Shunten (seamless focal transitions)\n•\tSemiotic gravity induced by Core Belief (Kakushin)\nIn this framework, flow is not simply sustained concentration, but rather a balanced, self-propelling orbit of cognition—held between structural density and semantic gravity. We position orbital intelligence alongside other “human anomalies” previously defined in KST—namely insight, mastery, and intuition—showing that it functions as an integrative, continuous mode of operation.The paper concludes by outlining the designability of this state, and explores its applicability in learning, creative processes, and AI-augmented cognition. Through this structural redefinition of flow, we demonstrate an internal proof of the core axiom of KST: structure drives intelligence.",

We tested this in a student population (N=320) by crossing PM reminder reliability (0%, 50%, 100%) and availability (present vs. absent). Thought probes served as a real-time proxy for whether the intention remained activated during the retention interval between encoding and retrieval. In Session 1 (trust trials), reminders enhanced performance without reducing internal activation, consistent with the representational backup view. However, after experiencing reliable external support, Session 2 (critical trials) showed that those in the 100% condition reduced internal activation and reallocated attention to the ongoing task. Moreover, unexpectedly removing reminders dropped performance in the 100% condition below the 0% condition. These findings suggest that offloading reshapes how intentions are maintained and provides a lens for observing how memory adapts to changing external support.",

          "abstract": "There is growing recognition that short-term changes in speech perception influence speech production. These effects shed light on phonetic convergence – the subtle alignment of speech patterns that emerges between communication partners – and offer insights into interactions of perception and production. Across three experiments, we investigate the representations underlying perceptual effects on speech production. Building from the strong influence of preceding context on speech perception, we strategically pair contexts and target syllables to enhance or diminish target syllables’ perceptual distinctiveness and examine the impact of these perceptual effects on speech production. Experiment 1 shows that speech contexts rich in articulatory-phonetic information shift speech perception and alter acoustic patterns of speech production. Experiment 2 demonstrates that continuous natural speech filtered to possess subtly different spectral profiles that do not impact articulatory-phonetic information also impact both perception and production. Strikingly, Experiment 3 reveals that even nonspeech tones induce perceptual context effects that influence speech production. The findings point to a much broader scope of perception-production transfer than reported previously, and challenge the necessity of social interaction, covert imitation, and articulatory-phonetic information in sensorimotor speech interactions. This points to the need to extend models of speech motor control to account for perceptual influences of other talkers’ speech on speech production, and to accommodate general auditory processes in perception-production interactions.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The objective of this scoping review is to explore the application of eye tracking in the\ninvestigation of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To this end, the most useful oculomotor cognitive\ntasks will be analysed and the correlations between specific metrics and different neuropsychological\ntests will be evaluated.\nIntroduction: Eye tracking is a cutting-edge technology that holds potential as a digital biomarker for\nthe early identification of abnormal visual patterns in various neurological disorders. Although some\nresearch has linked mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to changes in eye movements, there are notable\nmethodological discrepancies among the existing studies.\nInclusion criteria: Studies will be included if they meet the following criteria regarding participants,\ndesign, and setting: recruitment of people with MCI who are over 60 years of age; any eye-tracking\nparadigm administered using an ET screen; and any setting. No restrictions will be applied at the outset\nof the literature search with regard to study design, publication type or data.\nMethods: This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Up to August 2025,\nthe following databases will be searched: PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of\nScience. Additional articles will be identified by searching grey literature and the reference lists of all\nrelevant included studies. Two reviewers will work independently to decide which studies to include\nor exclude. They will conduct a thorough examination of all titles, abstracts, and full-text studies. The\nresearch group will endeavour to extract the features of the included pieces of research using a\nbespoke data collection form. A tabular and narrative summary will be prepared at the end of the\nprocess to present the gathered information.\n\nKeywords: Mild Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, Eye movements, Digital biomarker, Review, Protocol",

          "authors": "Graeme Lithgow",
          "abstract": "Aphantasia—the congenital absence of voluntary visual imagery—is a neurocognitive phenotype affecting approximately 1–4% of the population. Twin studies estimate heritability at 0.41–0.66, and neuroimaging reveals large effect sizes for frontoparietal connectivity differences, supporting a polygenic neurodevelopmental origin. This paper presents an integrative synthesis from 2020–2025, combining findings from genomics, neurodevelopment, and cognitive neuroscience. Candidate genes affecting cortical patterning (CYP26B1, FOXG1, TCF4), synaptic scaffolding (SHANK3), and neurotransmitter systems (COMT, DRD4, HTR2A, OXTR, BDNF) produce an atypical cognitive architecture that disrupts visual-frontal integration but supports compensatory verbal-analytic strengths. The proposed “Aphantasia-Plus” phenotype includes enhanced reasoning, trauma resilience, and systemizing cognition. The model generates testable predictions for genetic scoring, neuroimaging, and education outcomes, and reframes aphantasia as a neurodivergent specialization rather than a deficit.",

          "abstract": "Given that artificial intelligence (AI) programs like ChatGPT can generate creative content, some fear that such programs will displace human writers. But can AI-generated creative works truly compete with human-authored works? In Study 1, participants (N=1,498 adults recruited from Prolific) read either a human-written or AI-generated story. Regardless of their story’s true origin, half of the participants were told that their story was written by a human, while the other half were told that their story was written by ChatGPT. After reading, participants rated the story’s quality and their level of absorption into the story. Participants rated the AI-generated story as higher in quality and more absorbing, but they rated the story better on both measures when they had been told it was written by a human. In Study 2, participants (N=424 adults recruited from Prolific) read both a human-written and AI-generated fictional short story and guessed each story’s origins. They also answered questions regarding their experiences with ChatGPT and other AI software and their experiences with fictional literature. While participants were significantly worse than chance at differentiating between the human-written and AI-generated stories, experience with AI software expertise were positively correlated with correct performance. Experience with fictional literature had no significant effect. The results from these studies suggest that AI programs might be able to generate human-level creative work but are not perceived as being able to do so.",

          "abstract": "The visual system can encode many stimuli simultaneously, but there are limits to how\nwell multiple objects can be identified in parallel. At the extreme, some objects might\nhave to be identified serially. The redundant target paradigm is one tool for\ndistinguishing specific parallel and serial models. It compares responses to displays\ncontaining one target versus displays containing two targets. The typical result is a\npositive redundant target effect: faster correct responses to two targets, as predicted by\nmany parallel models. Here we generalize three standard models to account for response\naccuracy as well as speed. Surprisingly, two models predict a reversal of the redundant\ntarget effect (slower responses to two targets than to one target): the generalized standard\nserial model, and a specific form of a fixed-capacity parallel model. To test that prediction,\nwe measured performance for three different judgments of written words: color\ndetection, lexical decision, and semantic categorization. The color task yielded positive\nredundant target effects, which reject the standard serial model. The semantic task\nyielded consistently negative effects, which are consistent with either the standard serial\nmodel or some limited-capacity parallel models. Thus, redundant targets can have\nnegative effects, and they demonstrate limits that impair simultaneous recognition of two\nwords.",

This phenomenon is known as “motivational matching”. Yet, studies commonly confound the beneficial effects of matching with the detrimental effects of mismatching. We present a framework to disentangle these effects, and report two experiments (using samples of American adults) that demonstrate how mismatching actively reduces persuasion. In Study 1 (N=689), messages promoting volunteerism were substantially less successful to the extent that they contained elements that conflicted with people’s motivations to volunteer. In Study 2 (N=1,101), the detrimental effects of providing mismatched messages (e.g., presenting liberal individuals with appeals highlighting conservative values) were greater in magnitude than the benefits of providing matched messages (e.g., presenting liberal individuals with appeals highlighting liberal values). We discuss implications for theory and practice, including situations when generic/neutral messaging may outperform matching-based persuasion.",

          "abstract": "Online consultation is a convenient format for public risk preference elicitation. Substantial instability and inconsistencies cast doubts about the reliability of the obtained preferences for policymaking. Given the parallels between choice blindness manipulation (CBM) detection and risk preference (in)stability, I explore in this study explores whether CBM detection can indicate risk preference. An online randomized controlled experiment with 330 UK residents served to test the coincidence of CBM and risk preference stability along with common predictors, incl. task-, domain-, and individual-specific variables. Using 2 different stimuli to communicate risks and outcomes in elicitation gambles, covering five urban drainage and flood prevention outcomes, the results do not support CBM detection as an indicator of preference stability. Only about 1 in 4 participants detected at least one CBM and 1 in 10 manipulations were detected. Risk preferences were moderately stable across trials but inconsistent across treatment conditions; icon array stimuli led to risk-seeking and numeric stimuli led to risk-averse preferences. The significant predictors of CBM detection included task stimuli, choice latency, risk numeracy, age, and household flooding or waterbody pollution domains. Significant predictors of risk preference stability were gamble distinctness and risk numeracy, as also the only joint predictors of CBM detection and preference stability. By contrasting with theoretical explanations and earlier findings in literature, gaps to address in future research were identified. The empirical findings highlight a strong influence of choice architecture on preference construction also in this study, questioning neutrality and reliability of online risk preferences elicitation for policymaking.",

          "authors": "Trevor Scott Lies; Syed Muhammad Omar; Harrison James Schmitt; Glenn Adams",
          "abstract": "Conventional wisdom and scientific research suggest that political conservatism is at odds with support for environmentalism. Across two survey studies and an experiment (total N = 1,995) we consider the possibility that this relationship varies by environmentalism type and ethnic-racial category. Whereas political conservatism was negatively related to support for environmentalism, this relationship was significantly weaker for initiatives that prioritize conservation of supposedly pristine nature (Wilderness Preservation; WP) than initiatives that advocate techno-fixes to ecological degradation (Ecomodernism; EM) or acknowledge and address power structures and the suffering of marginalized groups (Environmental Justice; EJ; Studies 1-3), and these patterns were generally more pronounced among White compared to Black and Latine participants (Studies 2 and 3). Study 3 provides causal evidence that the relationship of conservatism with support varies by environmentalism type and shows that this relationship varies by ethnic-racial category. Mediation analyses reveal that the weaker relationship of conservatism with WP support (versus EM and EJ) stemmed in part from the perception of EM and especially EJ as threats to U.S. society. We emphasize the importance of foregrounding sociocultural context in the study of political ideology, ‘polarization,’ and environmentalism.",

An increase in cannabis use among parents could be important because cannabis has been linked to parenting quality in cross-sectional studies.\n\nMethod: Analyzed 2012-2023 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual representative survey of U.S. residents aged ≥12. We estimated the prevalence of cannabis use outcomes in parents vs. non-parents and tested whether trends in cannabis use outcomes among parents vs. non-parents differed.\n\nResults: In 2023, 7.8% of parents used cannabis on the majority of days, 4.9% of parents used cannabis daily, and 5.7% of parents met DSM-5 criteria for CUD. Since 2012, daily cannabis use has increased a nearly identical amount in parents vs. non-parents. Four times as many parents used cannabis daily in 2023 vs. 2012, and the rate of CUD among parents has increased 1.3x since 2020 (when first measured). Significant increases have occurred in parents across sociodemographic groups, but are largest in parents who are younger, unmarried, lower income, and have less than a BA.\n\nConclusions: Daily cannabis use among parents went from quite rare in 2012 (1 in 80 parents) to fairly common in 2023 (1 in 20 parents). Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest  ≥5.7 million children in the U.S. now live with a parent who uses cannabis on the majority of days. Determining how cannabis use affects parenting is therefore an important public health question.",

          "authors": "Mehrdad Aghlmand Yengejeh",
          "abstract": "Objective: This article introduces the Seven-Fold Filter Model of the Mind as a unified, evidence-informed framework for understanding psychopathology and guiding therapeutic interventions. The model conceptualizes mental processes as a sequence of seven sequential filters—from raw sensory input to the pinnacle of self-awareness—and highlights a crucial distinction between \"thought\" (the automatic stream of mental content) and \"thinking\" (the executive, observing \"self\"). We assert that an awareness of this structural architecture is a fundamental key to self-regulation and effective treatment.\n​Methodology: We demonstrate the model's utility through a rigorous, evidence-based analysis of two distinct clinical cases: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). These analyses are grounded in established neuroscientific findings (fMRI and EEG) to precisely delineate the neurophysiological foundations of each filter and its associated dysfunctions.\n​Findings: In our analysis of both disorders, we show that the pathology originates in the lower filters. In depression, the primary dysfunction in the \"emotion\" filter (hyperactivity in the amygdala) leads to an overprocessing of negative emotions. In OCD, the dysfunction manifests in the \"reasoning\" and \"belief\" filters (related to the inability to stop thought cycles). However, we argue that a deficit in the \"thinking\" filter, acting as a central executive failure, serves as a significant factor in the perpetuation and exacerbation of both disorders. This deficit allows the system to become trapped in these pathological and automatic cycles, rather than being actively managed.\n​Conclusion: The Seven-Fold Filter Model offers a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying the precise points of dysfunction within a patient’s mental architecture. By focusing on strengthening the \"thinking\" filter through interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and mindfulness, the model provides a targeted and effective therapeutic roadmap. We propose that this framework can serve as a common language among professionals and, more importantly, as an empowering tool for patients to increase their awareness of their mind’s structure and its role in their mental health.",

          "abstract": "Studying metacognition, the introspection of one’s own decisions, can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the decisions. Here we show that observers’ uncertainty about their decisions incorporates both the entropy of the stimuli and the entropy of their response probabilities across the psychometric function. Describing uncertainty data with a functional form permits the measurement of internal parameters not measurable from the decision responses alone. To test and demonstrate the utility of this novel model, we measured uncertainty in 11 participants as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in several experiments employing explicit bias or attentional cues. The entropy model enabled an otherwise intractable quantitative analysis of participants’ uncertainty, which in one case distinguished two comparative judgments that produced nearly identical psychometric functions. In contrast, comparative and equality judgments with different behavioral reports, yielded uncertainty reports that were not significantly different. The entropy model was able to successfully account for uncertainty in these two different types of decisions that resulted in differently shaped psychometric functions, and the entropy contribution from the stimuli, which were identical across experiments, was consistent. An observer’s uncertainty could therefore be measured as the total entropy of the inputs and outputs of the stimulus-response system, i.e. the entropy of the stimuli plus the entropy of the observer’s responses.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI becomes more integrated into everyday life, understanding the behavioral impact of generative AI usage becomes increasingly important. However, research lacks validated tools for capturing both the frequency and quality of generative AI use. This study presents the Generative AI Engagement Scale (GAIES), a multidimensional instrument that was developed following best practices in scale construction and validation. GAIES consists of two subscales: the Use Frequency scale, which measures how often users interact with generative AI for self-interested and task-oriented purposes, and the Interaction Style scale, which assesses how users interact with generative AI through Questioningness, Expressiveness, and Preciseness. This study included 414 participants. Several Psychometric evaluations were involved, including classical test theory, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and item response theory. The subscales showed strong internal consistency, a clear factor structure, and a good fit. Besides validating GAIES, we demonstrated its practical utility through two case studies. An analysis of a structural equation model revealed that predictors from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology explained Self-interest- and Task-oriented usage differentially, indicating the predictability of the scale. Further, latent profile analysis revealed four distinct user subgroups, demonstrating the usefulness of the scale in identifying meaningful patterns of engagement. Those findings establish GAIES as a psychometrically and theoretically sound method of measuring generative AI engagement. A key contribution of GAIES is its ability to go beyond generic usage metrics and offer a foundation for future research into the behavioral implications of generative AI usage.",

The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

          "abstract": "Background: Explaining how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (µ) dynamically interact to shape subjective experience is a central challenge in affective and cognitive science. While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\n\nResults: Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.",

Across experimental and naturalistic studies, we examined if more additive (to start something new or do more) than subtractive advice (to stop or do less) is given when humans and artificial intelligence give mental health advice. Compared to subtractive advice, additive advice was recommended more frequently and was rated as more effective and feasible by recipients. Several moderators of this effect are explored: Older people are more additive than younger people, who we are advising (e.g., strangers/friends) matters, as does the type of pre-existing mental health-affecting activities (e.g., gambling versus avoiding exercise). People feel that they are overburdened and yet we often tell them to do more. When helping people with their mental health, advice givers must balance what can be added to life with what needs to be removed.",

          "abstract": "Considering the complex nature of vaccine hesitancy and the vast amount of misinformation surrounding vaccination, training healthcare professionals (HCP) in vaccine communication is important to ensure high vaccine uptake. Recently, a new vaccine communication approach, known as the Empathetic Refutational Interview (ERI), was developed to help HCPs in conversations with patients who have vaccine concerns. In the present study, we developed and validated the ERI Skills Inventory (ERISI) for assessing learning outcomes of training in ERI. The ERISI measures are 1) ERI-related knowledge, 2) ERI-related skills, and 3) confidence in using the ERI. A sample of 103 HCPs who took part in ERI training responded to the ERISI, as well as questions about their self-efficacy in vaccine consultations and preparedness to refute arguments against vaccination, before and after the training. At two follow-ups, they also reported their understanding and use of the ERI. Results showed that the ERISI is sensitive to positive changes in ERI knowledge and confidence as a result of training. Participants also showed increased use post-training of ERI skills to demonstrate empathy towards patients. However, no change was observed for ERI skills that refute misconceptions and inform patients using factual information, which participants tended to already use at pre-test. ERI knowledge correlated positively with ERI skills at posttest. ERI confidence demonstrated both concurrent and predictive validity. The ERISI questionnaire is a valuable tool for assessing ERI training outcomes that can guide training development to ensure learning and future skill application.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied across various domains, playing an important role and becoming an indispensable part of modern life. A central question surrounding generative AI concerns its potential impact on individual creativity. However, existing findings on whether generative AI enhances creativity remain mixed. To systematically evaluate this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of 44 empirical studies published over the past five years, incorporating 141 effect sizes. All included studies compared creative task performance between human-only and human-AI collaborative conditions. Overall, results indicated that generative AI-assisted collaboration significantly outperformed human-only performance in creative tasks (Hedges’ g = 0.54, 95% CI [0.27, 0.81]). We also observed potential risks of publication bias in this field and employed multiple statistical approaches to assess the robustness of the findings. Further moderator analyses revealed that the positive effect of AI on creativity was more pronounced among non-expert participants (compared to experts) and within general creative domains (compared to specialized domains). Overall, our meta-analysis contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of how generative AI influences creativity, providing valuable guidance for AI developers and users to better adapt AI-supported creative applications across diverse domains and user populations.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence systems increasingly predict, model, and respond to human emotions, a pressing ethical question emerges: who holds the right to define what one feels—the individual or the machine? This paper introduces and operationalizes the concept of affective sovereignty, which defends the individual’s interpretive authority over their emotional states in algorithmically mediated environments. Building on the complementary notion of uniqueness violation, we argue that predictive emotion AI poses not only privacy risks but also fundamental threats to identity, agency, and epistemic justice.\n\nThrough two case studies—the 2024 EU AI Act, which bans emotion recognition in high-risk domains, and Replika, a commercially deployed affective chatbot—we analyze how regulatory and experiential tensions converge around affective autonomy. Our findings reveal that emotion AI systems can undermine users’ self-perception and enforce standardized affective templates, thereby distorting personal meaning and emotional authenticity.\n\nIn response, we propose an ethical design framework grounded in interpretive transparency, design restraint, and identity-responsive feedback. These principles collectively aim to realign affective AI with human values by ensuring contextual sensitivity, user agency, and dignity preservation.\n\nThis work contributes both a conceptual foundation and a policy-relevant framework for developers, regulators, and ethicists engaged in the design and governance of emotion-aware technologies. In doing so, it underscores a broader normative claim: the right to feel—and to interpret that feeling—must remain inseparable from the one who feels it.",

Understanding these implicit processes offers promising avenues for novel interventions targeting immune-related disorders. Future research should integrate neuroimaging and immunological assessments to further validate these pathways.",

          "abstract": "Listeners rapidly form first impressions from voices, inferring multiple person characteristics within milliseconds. We employed a novel method, Self-Steered Sound Synthesis (S4), to identify and compare the acoustic signatures underlying these impressions. Participants interactively used S4 to synthesise voices expressing six person characteristics - age, masculinity, health, attractiveness, dominance, and trustworthiness - by manipulating four perceptually salient acoustic dimensions: mean pitch, pitch excursion, breathiness, and formant spacing. Masculinity, older age, and dominance were conveyed by lowering mean pitch and formant spacing, consistent with projecting the impression of a large person, and flattening the intonation. Physical health, attractiveness, and trustworthiness were conveyed by choosing less extreme and more \"typical\" acoustic properties. A second perceptual experiment confirmed that the synthesised voices from Experiment 1 indeed conveyed the intended person characteristics to an independent sample of listeners, and that listeners relied on similar acoustic cues for their evaluations. From a methodological perspective, we draw similar conclusions from two drastically different approaches, thus providing a comprehensive account of first impression formation that bridges across voice production (or synthesis) and perception. Our converging findings furthermore demonstrate the methodological robustness of S4. From a theoretical perspective, our findings furthermore extend theoretical frameworks that conceptualise first impressions within a continuous “trait space”, highlighting the graded and intercorrelated nature of different person characteristics on a perceptual and conceptual level. We extend this framework by showing that not only perceptual judgments, but also the acoustic signatures of person characteristics show intercorrelations, thus integrating acoustic cues into perceptual models of voice perception.",

          "abstract": "Young adults increasingly abstain from committed romantic relationships. However, psychological theories of singlehood are lacking and it remains unclear who selects into remaining single throughout emerging adulthood and how consistent singles’ well-being is affected over time. Here, we included 17,390 initially never partnered respondents from three panel studies from the UK and Germany providing 110,261 yearly observations from ages 16 to 29. First, we used survival analysis to predict who remained single. Young adults with lower well-being, male gender, higher education, and living alone or with parents stayed single longer. Second, we compared within-person age trajectories of life satisfaction, loneliness, and depressivity between consistent singles and eventually partnered respondents. Across emerging adulthood, consistent singles experienced comparatively stronger life satisfaction decreases and loneliness increases. Well-being deficits became more pronounced in the later 20s, when depressivity increases also diverged between groups. Evidence for moderation of these changes (e.g., by gender) was absent or inconsistent. Third, we examined how the first romantic relationship affected well-being aspects longitudinally. In both the short and long term, the first romantic relationship was associated with increases in life satisfaction and decreases in loneliness but not depressivity. Together, the findings indicate considerable average well-being risks when staying single in emerging adulthood. Well-being differences between consistent singles and eventually partnered respondents were minimal in adolescence but were exacerbated with prolonged singlehood. This highlights difficulties for first partnership formation in the later 20s because, concurrently, low well-being predicted remaining in singlehood longer. We discuss critical questions for singlehood theory development.",

          "abstract": "Important advances have been made in understanding the roles that recollection and familiarity, true and false memory, as well as pattern separation and pattern completion play in episodic memory, using various paradigms that examine memory for lures that are similar - but not identical - to prior episodes. However, research using each of these paradigms has remained largely isolated, and a coherent theoretical integration is lacking. In this perspective paper, we argue that false recognition in these paradigms can be understood within a unified theory in which memory performance reflects the operation of three distinct processes: false recollection, false familiarity, and recollection rejection. Our proposed approach leverages the theoretical insights provided by parameter estimates derived from receiver operating characteristic analyses of recognition memory confidence. Using extant data from paradigms across all three literatures that collected recognition confidence judgments, we show that this analytic approach can be used to measure each process. Our findings bridge the existing literatures by showing that these three memory processes are functionally distinct and that they underly performance in each experimental paradigm. This new approach overcomes key limitations of earlier methods by separating common memory and decision processes across paradigms, and it provides new opportunities to further understand why factors such as healthy aging disrupts the ability to discriminate between similar episodes.",

          "authors": "Ali Arabian; Courtney Michael Goodridge; Natasha Merat",
          "abstract": "As automated driving technology advances, the development of an efficient human-machine interface (HMI) for delivering hazard warnings becomes increasingly critical for maintaining driving safety. One example is the use of directional auditory warnings in vehicles, which are used to direct drivers’ attention, either towards a free lane to move into, or towards the location of hazards. These warnings have the potential to reduce the time it takes for drivers to take over from automation, improving overall takeover quality. Findings from lab-based studies have shown that the timing of directional auditory warnings, particularly in relation to accompanying visual cues, plays a crucial role in how effectively they are processed. Specifically, asynchrony between auditory stimuli and visual information, known as stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), may enhance the effectiveness of auditory warnings by reducing reaction times. However, the impact of such temporal separation in real-world settings, especially during the transitions of vehicle control, is still unknown. Drivers (N = 48) were recruited for an experiment investigating how directional auditory warnings and asynchronous presentation of auditory warnings and visual information affect takeover performance from a hands-on SAE L2 automated vehicle. Results showed that directional auditory warnings reduced first steering reaction times, enhanced the accuracy of the first steering response, and resulted in smaller maximum lateral acceleration, relative to non-directional warnings. Notably, warnings that indicated the location of a free lane, and therefore a safe direction for drivers to steer towards for avoiding an obstacle, were associated with improved takeover performance and lower subjective workload. Additionally, longer SOAs were associated with reduced dominance of visual information, resulting in faster first steering response times and slight improvements in takeover quality. These findings provide evidence that directional warnings can facilitate faster and higher-quality takeover performance. Furthermore, attenuation of the visual dominance effect provides insight into how the temporal separation of auditory and visual components of audiovisual directional warnings may facilitate improved takeover performance.",

          "abstract": "Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first condition is the simulation of a world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. These globally integrated preferences for precision enact the epistemic agency and flexibility reminiscent of general intelligence. This Beautiful Loop Theory is also deeply revealing about altered states, meditation, and the full spectrum of conscious experience.",

          "abstract": "Multiple findings suggest that human visual perception displays extensive size invariance (i.e., insensitive to retinal image size changes) to multiple object categories. This is typically investigated when only retinal image size changes (by changing real world size and keeping a fixed viewing distance), a situation that does not reflect daily vision where objects retain their real-world size and their retinal image size changes as a function of viewing distance. Here size invariance was tested by examining if the ability of the visual system to discriminate subtle face changes (with morphed faces) survives retinal image size changes. Importantly, retinal image size changes were applied either naturalistically (when faces kept their world size but were more distant) or lab-like (where faces changed their world size while viewing distance was constant). We found that (i) the difference detection threshold (DT) was not influenced by the retinal size changes or viewing distances we manipulated, (ii) face discrimination was significantly worse when retinal image size was smaller (for both naturalistic and for lab-like conditions), (iii) worse face discrimination performance at smaller retinal image sizes were significantly associated between naturalistic and lab-like conditions. Our results indicate that face discrimination shows imperfect invariance to retinal size and importantly, this appears independent of viewing distance. Since face perception is based on fovea-related processes and may rely on face-dedicated mechanisms, future work should examine whether these results generalize to additional object categories.",

          "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of videos and illustrated texts in primary education, there is a limited understanding of how children study and review these materials, and how this impacts their learning performance. This study examined 97 tablet screen recordings, which captured the learning behaviors of fifth graders as they studied illustrated texts and videos in a within-subjects experiment. The screen recordings were coded frame-by-frame to assess the children’s studying rates and learning strategies. These factors, and their connection to prior learning performance data, were analyzed using mixed-effects models and stepwise regression. The results show that videos were studied significantly faster than content-equivalent illustrated texts. Furthermore, this faster studying was associated with better learning outcomes and lower cognitive load. As the children scarcely used the navigation options in the videos, the videos were mostly studied and reviewed linearly at their designed rate, which was especially beneficial for slower readers. In comparison, both the studying rate and the review strategies were more varied in the illustrated texts. In both conditions, children devoted more time on the slides that had more text content and were positioned early in the presentation. The type of pictures on the slide did not influence time spent. These results indicate that children tend to watch and review videos linearly at their designed rate and sequence, leading to faster studying rates, better learning outcomes, and lower cognitive load compared to illustrated texts. In particular, slow readers benefit from videos.",

While synesthesia has traditionally been understood through temporal consistency and static sensory mappings, this research emphasizes the dynamic sensorimotor contingencies (SMCs) shaped by an individual’s intrinsic value system. Semi-structured interviews, guided by phenomenological epoché and internal mimesis, were conducted with an individual who experiences chromaesthesia. Analyses revealed that chromaesthetic experiences dynamically generate vivid affective imagery within an “affecto-imagistic dimension,” where explicit temporal structures have not yet emerged. The richness of these affective and imagistic meanings correlates with the potential of sensorimotor contingency (counterfactual-richness), directly influencing perceptual presence.\nImportantly, this study highlights the intersubjective sharing of inherently id- idiosyncratic synesthetic experiences through phenomenological epoché-based questioning and internal mimesis. This dialogue-based approach enabled both the interviewer (also a synesthete) and the participant to empathically deepen introspection and mutual understanding of their experiences, suggesting that synesthetic experiences, typically considered highly subjective and private, may indeed be shareable.\nFinally, drawing from Ikegami and Zlatev’s concept of mimetic sharedness, this study argues that chromaesthesia exemplifies a general cognitive mechanism rather than an exceptional phenomenon. Thus, the fundamental question shifts from “What is it like to be a synesthete?” to “What is it like not to be a synaesthete?” This perspective significantly expands the conceptualization of pre-representational experiences, emphasizing the importance of phenomenological methods for understanding intersubjectivity in cognitive science.",

If certain non-mastered attributes hinder the growth of mathematical ability, early intervention becomes essential. In this study, we developed a random effect diagnostic classification for a multilevel growth curve (RDC–MGC) model to identify the specific effects of attribute mastery on the individual-level mathematics ability growth. The model was applied to arithmetic test data from second- to sixth-grade elementary students. Diagnosis was conducted in the second grade, and the effects of mastery on mathematics ability growth from the third to sixth grades were assessed. The results showed that attribute mastery in the second grade influenced both the intercept and slope of individual ability growth, highlighting the importance of early-stage diagnosis in supporting mathematical development.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between synesthesia and lucid dreaming, proposing a novel interpretation through the concept of perceptual presence and counterfactual-richness (the abundance of possible sensorimotor contingencies). We hypothesized that individuals with synesthesia experience higher frequencies of lucid dreams due to enhanced counterfactual richness, which facilitates dream control and clarity. To examine this hypothesis, we surveyed 616 adults using self-report measures for synesthesia classification, the Lucid Dreaming Questionnaire (LuCiD), and the Big-5 personality traits inventory (TIPI-J). While self-reported synesthesia prevalence was higher than in general populations, cluster analysis validated four primary types of synesthesia: Language-Color, Ordinal Linguistic Personification (OLP), Spatial Sequence, and Visualized Sensations. Regression analyses revealed distinct effects on lucid dreaming, depending on the type of synesthesia. Perceptual synesthesia types (Visualized sensations and Spatial sequence) significantly promoted lucid dreaming, particularly enhancing dream control, insight, dissociation, and positive emotions. Conversely, conceptual synesthesia types (Language-color and OLP) exhibited negative interactions with personality traits (Openness, Extraversion), inhibiting lucid dreaming experiences. Personality analyses further confirmed significant positive associations between lucid dreaming and Openness and Extraversion, aligning with previous literature. Thus, perceptual synesthesia types can be interpreted as phenomena of excessive counterfactual-richness, enhancing perceptual presence and sensorimotor contingency during dreaming. These findings not only validate the LuCiD scale but also highlight qualitative differences within synesthetic experiences, suggesting new directions for understanding both synesthesia and lucid dreaming as interconnected cognitive phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Monte Carlo simulation studies are the de facto standard for assessing both classical and modern statistical methods. In traditional simulation studies, researchers have full discretion over data generation and often create simulated data with a high degree of smoothness and limited dependencies among variables. Under such conditions, the performance of statistical methods may not indicate their real-world performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel AI-based simulation framework that leverages generative AI (GenAI) to create realistic synthetic data and incorporate them into Monte Carlo simulation studies. In particular, we focus on simulation studies with sequential data (e.g., action sequences from process data) and demonstrate our approach by evaluating the predictive performance of an example statistical method. Our framework consists of five key steps: (i) pre-processing input data, (ii) training GenAI models on input data, (iii) assessing synthetic data quality, (iv) conducting AI-based simulations, and (v) evaluating simulation results. We also perform robustness checks on both synthetic data quality and simulation outcomes by modifying specific steps of our approach. Overall, the proposed AI-based simulations outperform traditional simulations in generating realistic synthetic data and providing a more accurate evaluation of the real-world performance of statistical methods.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Contemporary debates on the ontology of time often overlook their ethical ramifications. This paper introduces the ethical implications of Existential Realism (ER), a two-tier framework that distinguishes between what exists (the materially present) and what is real (including non-present but causally connected phenomena). We argue that standard presentism—holding that only the present exists—encourages a form of moral myopia, undervaluing future harms and past obligations. Conversely, eternalism’s block universe (where past, present, and future equally exist) risks a kind of moral fatalism, implying that future outcomes are fixed and beyond influence. In contrast, ER’s temporal ontology allows us to extend moral concern across time without positing that past or future entities exist in the same way present ones do. By affirming the reality of past and future (despite their lack of current existence), ER provides a coherent basis for caring about real-but-non-existent individuals and events. We develop an account of moral responsibility toward future persons and past injustices grounded in ER, and show how this approach illuminates real-world cases like climate ethics (responsibilities to future generations) and historical justice (acknowledging the reality of past harms). Briefly, we also consider implications for AI ethics and decision-making where long-term outcomes are at stake. Throughout, we demonstrate that a two-tier temporal ontology can integrate moral foresight and memory into a consistent framework, supporting intergenerational duties and a temporally expansive view of moral agency. We conclude by advocating a temporally grounded moral realism rooted in the ER framework, which reconciles the primacy of the present with the enduring moral significance of the past and future.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Existential Realism (ER) is an ontological framework that distinguishes existence from reality in the context of time.  In brief, ER holds that only the present moment and its contents exist in the full ontological sense, yet much more than the present is real. Past events and future possibilities, though they do not exist now, are nonetheless real insofar as they leave traces, have causal effects, or figure in well-founded predictions. This two-tiered view is meant to reconcile epistemic humility about what we can directly observe (only the present) with a robust ontological realism about the world’s structure across time. In other words, ER asserts an objective world of matter, laws, and forces that unfolds in time, while acknowledging that our access to non-present times is indirect—mediated by memory, records, and inference.\nOne potential gap in the current ER framework is the role of the human mind in structuring our experience of time. ER recognizes that we know the past through records and remember it, and anticipate the future through predictions, but it does not yet deeply explore how our brains and cognitive processes actively construct the subjective flow of time. Cognitive science and constructivist theories of mind suggest that time is not just “out there” in the world; it is also a mental representational construct that our minds assemble through processes like memory, narrative, anticipation, and temporal perception. Classic phenomenological philosophers such as Edmund Husserl and Henri Bergson, as well as modern cognitive scientists like Thomas Metzinger, have all emphasized that the stream of time we experience is shaped by consciousness.  This report examines how integrating such insights from cognitive constructivism could enrich the ER framework. In particular, we will highlight cognitive science concepts – narrative memory, anticipatory processing, temporal binding, mental time travel, and the overall construction of subjective temporal experience – and evaluate whether ER currently underrepresents this subjective dimension of time. We then explore how ER’s temporal ontology could accommodate the fact that human access to past and future is structured by internal models, without compromising ER’s realist stance on an objective temporal reality. Finally, we address potential tensions between being epistemically humble (acknowledging the limits and constructions of our knowledge) and maintaining ontological realism, clarifying whether treating time as cognitively constructed undermines or, conversely, supports ER’s distinction between existence and reality.",

Then, a regression model was developed to predict the self-compassion scores (i.e., SCS and CEAS) from free texts with BERT. The self-compassion scores quantified by free texts and BERT highly correlated with the SCS score and certain criterion-related validity. Furthermore, the results suggest that thoughts, behaviors, and levels of self-compassion differ across situations and that the SCS score is related to both cognition (thoughts) and behaviors. The method of psychological quantification using free text may be less prone to priming or bias than measurement using questionnaires. Thus, future studies are encouraged to apply this natural-language-based approach to more diverse samples and other psychological constructs.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "This paper redefines \"expertise\"—the advanced state of skill or judgment—from a non-linear and structural perspective grounded in Kakushin Structural Theory. Rather than viewing expertise as the smooth accumulation of experience or knowledge, we propose that it emerges when “structural shards” are silently accumulated and reorganized in the unconscious domain, surpassing a critical threshold. This process results in the spontaneous formation of judgment criteria, often recognized by the individual only after the fact as a sense of “I realized I could do it.” We theorize this phenomenon as the static operation of \"Mindflight Structure,\" characterized by silent kakusen (non-conscious recognition) and quiet shunten (non-conscious structural fixation). Furthermore, the paper explores the conditions under which such expertise can be reproduced, offering a framework for educational and cognitive design. Ultimately, this study functions as an internal validation of the broader theoretical system of Kakushin Structural Theory, demonstrating that its core constructs—mindflight cognition, kakusen, shunten, and structural shards—correspond to empirically observable cognitive phenomena. Expertise is thus redefined as the state in which structure becomes one's world.",

          "abstract": "Despite being an important mental health consequence of climate change, climate anxiety assessment has been fragmented. Reviews of measures of climate anxiety raise concerns about content and convergent validity. We aimed to select the best functioning items from current climate anxiety measures to develop a condensed scale using Rasch methodology. We used a mixed-method approach across three studies. First, we pooled items from six measures of climate anxiety and neighbouring phenomena and used Rasch modelling to retain items that followed model assumptions in general public (N = 305) and university student (N = 143) samples. We then surveyed (N = 31) and interviewed (N = 12) clinicians and researchers about the relevance of the selected items and suitability of the scale for their professional practice. Finally, we tested the structure and validity of the retained items (N = 341). Of the 129 initial pooled items, we retained 22 that representatively cover the full scope of climate anxiety experience according to the theoretical model of climate anxiety. These items followed Rasch model assumptions and were deemed relevant by the expert participants. The candidate items exhibited good convergent and discriminant validity but did not predict wellbeing outcomes over and above an existing measure of eco-anxiety. We conclude that while our scale provides a useful representative measure of different climate anxiety presentations, its lack of incremental validity means it does not justify its existence as a new scale, and existing scales should be further validated.",

          "abstract": "Explanations are often social objects, and when people try to explain something, they usually have on hand the explanations that others have tried before. We present a simple theory of how people use the explanations they encounter as clues to the broader landscape of possible explanations, which informs decisions to either exploit what has already been done or, conversely, to strike out and explore new possibilities. The challenge of coming up with novel explanations draws people to exploit or imitate appealing ones they have already encountered; this draw increases as less appealing alternatives become more distant (the \"strawman\" effect). Conversely, when presented with distinct, high-quality explanations, people can merge them, recombining the appealing features in new ways. We test and confirm these predictions using a two-stage transmission chain experiment. In Stage One, 101 participants were asked to explain an unusual scenario. In Stage Two, a separate group of 983 participants were asked to explain the same scenario after reading pairs of explanations drawn from Stage One. We found that participants in Stage Two were more likely to exploit or copy explanations when at least one was high in quality and particularly when it was paired with a weaker alternative. In contrast, participants were more likely to explore or deviate from prior explanations when the two explanations were both high-quality and conceptually distinct. Our work provides new insight into how collective exploration can be promoted, or stalled, by implicit information about what is yet to be discovered.",

A better understanding of the genetic conflict that underlies these complications can offer researchers and practitioners potential explanations for these changes as well as insights into the treatment of these complications. Here, we provide an overview of genetic conflict theory, summarize the changes in pregnancy complications during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide insight into how the public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic potentially influenced the genetic conflict that underlies these pregnancy complications.",

In seven studies (N = 4,577), we examined the perceived similarities and covariation between all, and 20 prevalent, positive items. Cluster analyses clearly separated both the Big Two and the four facets. In our factor analyses, both models fit the data well but the Facet model did not fit better than the Big Two model.

          "abstract": "The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is thought to be scientifically and clinically useful because it aligns with the natural structure of psychopathology.  However, because HiTOP is based on analyses of standardized symptom criteria and close-ended survey items, it may just reflect the structure of available measures.  This study provides a novel test of HiTOP’s generalizability by comparing it to the structure of psychopathology derived from the natural language people use when talking about their mental health.  For our analysis, we obtained 87,007 naturalistic descriptions of mental health from &gt;55,625 unique users on 27 online Reddit forums (i.e., subreddits).  We used text embeddings in large language models to represent common themes of posts in the subreddits, each dedicated to a different diagnosis or maladaptive trait.  Semantic similarity of posts across subreddits was quantified with a cosine similarity matrix. We then fit exploratory factor models to this matrix and examined the hierarchical structure with a bass-akwards approach. Results showed the natural language structure of psychopathology closely corresponds to the HiTOP model, with factors resembling internalizing, detachment, thought disorder, substance use, antagonism, and somatoform spectra at the lowest level of the hierarchy.  The higher-order factors diverged from HiTOP, including a general factor of problem construal reflecting variation in attribution of problems to internal vs. external sources.  Overall, the emergence of HiTOP spectra from natural language offers unique evidence for its validity and clinical utility.",

          "authors": "Luther Kalb",
          "abstract": "Background: Life satisfaction is a cognitive self-appraisal of one's current circumstances, influenced by both external circumstances (\"bottom-up\" factors) and features of personality (\"top-down\" factors). Life satisfaction is consistently associated with physical and mental health outcomes, making it a public health priority; however, life satisfaction in the US has been precipitously decreasing. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that could be addressed by U.S. policy for the purpose of enhancing population-level life satisfaction.\nMethods: Data for this study came from Wave 1 of the Global Flourishing Study. Seventeen actionable/modifiable variables were selected as covariates. They included a wide variety of behavioral, socioeconomic, psychological, and health factors. All variables were dichotomized for the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis, a decision-tree approach used for problems of classification. This supervised, nonparametric, multivariate method was employed to identify the most accurate set of classifiers for the continuous outcome: Life satisfaction. CART offers several advantages over traditional ordinary least squares regression, including making fewer statistical assumptions, automatically detecting nonlinear relationships, and handling a large number of variables without the risk of multicollinearity. The CART model was trained and tested using a 70/30 split of the US sample (n=38,312). The model was further tested for replication in a combined international sample of similar Western countries (United Kingdom, n=5,368; Australia, n=3,844).\nResults: Of the 17 potential covariates, only 5 were represented in the models: balance, satisfaction with relationships, purpose, mental health, and comfortability with income. Each of the three models had similar numbers of splits (5, 7, 5). In all three models, the CART analysis identified life balance as the primary node. Those with low balance (the left-hand split) had much lower life satisfaction than those who self-reported balance (nearly a 3-point difference in life satisfaction, on average). For those with low balance, mental health was the second node for all datasets, and relationship satisfaction was the final split in the test and international samples. For those with good life balance in the US (the right-hand split), the tree structure was slightly more variable, as splits on purpose, relationships, mental health and comfortability with income were observed. For the international sample, splits only occurred on relationships and purpose.\nConclusions: The results clearly show the primary factors related to life satisfaction. Life balance was the most important, followed by mental health and satisfying relationships for those with low life balance. For those with high life balance, relationships, purpose, and comfortability with income (in the US only) were most important. These findings partially diverge from our hypothesis, as balance served as the most important correlate of life balance. The study findings not only reveal the most important correlates of life satisfaction, replicated across multiple test samples, but also those that were surprisingly less important (e.g., physical health, participation in a social or religious group, exercise). The findings have significant implications for interventions and policy development since all factors included were chosen are modifiable.",

          "abstract": "Many psychiatric conditions demonstrate overlapping psychological mechanisms warranting clinical intervention. Aversive reactivity (appraisals of unpleasant emotional states as harmful) is one such proposed mechanism by which neuroticism leads to maladaptive emotion regulation and mental illness. Although some constructs have been directly connected to aversive reactivity (e.g., distress tolerance), associations with other plausibly related constructs (e.g., mindful acceptance) have not been evaluated, nor does a measure of it yet exist. Undergraduates completed self-report questionnaires of mood symptoms, emotion regulation, neuroticism, and constructs related to aversive reactivity. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated two factors reflecting aversive reactivity and emotional awareness. In hierarchical regressions, aversive reactivity predicted more variance than neuroticism in mood symptoms and emotion regulation. Overall, results support that aversive reactivity is important for behavioural and symptom outcomes. Due to its role as a transdiagnostic mechanism, aversive reactivity should be prioritized in further research and considered as a treatment target.",

          "abstract": "This paper offers a psychometric and statistical defense of the claim that YoungHoon Kim possesses an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of 276 on a scale with a standard deviation (SD) of 24. Certified by organizations such as the Official World Record®, Noble World Records (with International Non-Olympic Committee, INOC), World Memory Championships (WMC), Global Genius Registry (GGR), Korea Record Institute (KRI), World Memory Sports Council (which partnered with Guinness World Records), and recognized by the World Genius Directory, Mega Society, Mega Foundation, Triple Nine Society, and Mensa Korea, this recognized IQ score reflects cognitive excellence validated across multiple high-range and standardized tests, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), VNPT-II, GENE Verbal I, Betts Test, Titan Test (Hoeflin Test), Langan Test, Personal Evaluation Report (PER), and Mensa Korea admission test. The analysis places the claim within the historical and theoretical framework of intelligence measurement, exploring limitations of standardized tests in assessing profound giftedness while noting YoungHoon Kim's consistent achievement of ceiling or perfect scores. We assess the methodologies of certifying bodies, the psychometric validity of the non-standard SD 24 scale, and the statistical plausibility of the score. Benchmarking against historical cases of profound giftedness (e.g., Sidis, von Neumann) and integrating neurobiological and genetic evidence, we argue that the claim holds credibility and marks progress in recognizing extreme human potential. Criticisms are examined, showing their basis in outdated psychometric assumptions, and we suggest that Kim’s score serves as a reference point for cognitive achievement. The paper closes with implications for advancing the study of profound giftedness, supported by a broad peer-reviewed reference base to uphold scientific rigor. This defense draws from the psychometric validation framework in Kim (2025), extending its multi-component model with statistical defenses specific to this case. The integration of diverse evidentiary sources helps reduce biases from single-method approaches and supports calls for multimethod convergence in psychological assessment, bolstering the empirical basis for extreme cognitive claims.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Elevated thresholds in the extended high frequency hearing range have been associated with functional hearing deficits, such as speech-in-noise performance. However, unlike the standard frequency range, there are a lack of recommendations from organizations such as the International Standards Organization (ISO) and World Health Organization (WHO) regarding normative data in the extended high frequencies limiting clinical implications of this data. In the present study, we report proposed normative data in the extended high frequency region in over 726 participants evaluated on typical clinical equipment using methodology from both the ISO and WHO. We hypothesize that extended high frequency will worsen with age and show excellent test-retest reliability.  \nDesign: Audiometric thresholds were collected from 726 adult participants at all measurable frequencies between .25 and 16 kHz. Data were analyzed using the equations reported by the 2017 ISO 7029 report and by calculating a 4-frequency extended high frequency pure tone average in alignment with the WHO. \nResults: Males had worse hearing than females when analyzed using a 4-frequency PTA, but there was no significant difference in the age-related rate of decline. Extended high frequency thresholds (N = 129) showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC &gt; 0.9, p &lt; 0.001). Extended high frequency 4-frequency PTAs in participants with normal hearing in the standard frequency range had a range of -11.25 to 92.5 dB.\nConclusions: Adaptation of norms in the extended high frequency range is feasible due to agreement among the literature and stability of test-retest measurements. Male extended high frequency thresholds are worse than women, but the rate at which hearing declines does not differ between sexes. Future research in this area should take into account normative data and functional hearing performance.",

          "abstract": "Like sleep, a brief period of eyes-closed waking rest following encoding can improve memory. But in addition to quantitatively strengthening memory, sleep also qualitatively transforms memory. In one example of this effect, sleep has been reported to promote the formation of false memory, perhaps as a result of preferentially strengthening gist memory over memory for veridical detail. Here, we tested whether a period of eyes-closed waking rest, like sleep, affects the formation of false memories. We hypothesized that rest would increase false memory in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm as measured by recall but would decrease false memory as measured by recognition. Following auditory encoding of 8 DRM word lists, N=51 participants either sat quietly with their eyes closed for 15min or spent an equivalent period completing a distractor task (within-subjects). Afterwards, participants completed a recall and recognition test. Despite being well-powered to detect effects of the magnitude previously reported in sleep studies, we did not detect any effect of rest on the formation of false memories, regardless of testing method. This may indicate that waking rest does not affect the formation of false memories in the same way that sleep does.",

Through a comprehensive approach that combines big-data analysis and experimental methods, we investigate the preference for concrete language in posts from two social media platforms—Twitter and Reddit—and with decisions made by participants in a two-alternative forced-choice experiment. In the first study, we analyzed data from 15 million Twitter posts. The overall results show that posts containing words that are more concrete are more likely to be retweeted. In the second study, we scraped over 50 thousand posts from Reddit across different subreddits and found that more concrete Reddit posts tend to have more upvotes (i.e., approval). Both studies also showed consistent effects for words that are acquired later in life, and are more arousing. The magnitude of these effects varied across topics. Finally, to demonstrate the causal influence of concreteness, we asked participants in an experimental study to indicate which of two social media posts they would be more likely to share, both artificially constructed from a real post to have either higher or lower concreteness than the original. Participants preferred more-concrete statements and the difference of concreteness between statements positively predicted choices. Our investigation sheds light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying online information sharing across a variety of topics and is consistent with an information competition theory, in which more easily processed information is preferred.",

          "abstract": "People are lazy. According to the law of least effort, people generally prefer to exert less rather\nthan more effort to achieve the same reward. However, this research often isolates individuals\nfrom social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour\nis shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we examine whether\nindividuals conform to both high-effort and low-effort norms equally, or whether the strength of\nnormative influence on effort choices depends on the direction of the norm. Across twelve\nstudies (N = 2,084), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose\nbetween a hard or easy task. While people generally avoid effort, results revealed that\nparticipants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently\nchose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others'\nchoices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however,\ndid not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Even after\nincreasing the acceptability of low effort—by enhancing the value of low effort and the\npsychological closeness to past participants—individuals still opposed the low effort norm,\nexerting no less effort than the control group. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour\ncan inspire us to work harder, individuals show resistance to lowering their effort below what\nthey would typically exert. While we consistently found conformity to high-effort norms, effort\npreferences were not influenced when hearing about others completing an unrelated task,\npointing to a possible boundary condition for norm effects.",

          "authors": "jiazheng liu",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a fundamental uncertainty principle of time: the intrinsic delay parameter τ₀, which governs all causal responses in natural systems, can never be precisely measured. The central argument is that any measurement device, being itself a physical system, must also possess a nonzero τ₀. As a result, attempts to measure τ₀ from within the system are inherently limited by the same delay they seek to resolve. Through reductio ad absurdum reasoning, we show that assuming τ₀ = 0 would violate thermodynamic irreversibility, relativistic causality, and quantum decoherence principles. We conclude that τ₀ is a universal constant defining the temporal resolution limit of the physical universe, akin to ℏ and c, and that its exact value lies forever beyond experimental reach.",

          "abstract": "Gelman and Carlin (2014) introduced Type S (sign) and Type M (magnitude) errors to highlight the possibility that statistically significant results in published articles are misleading. While these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a study (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that these statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the meaningful interpretation of results. Type S errors are a response to the criticism of testing against a point null of exactly zero in contexts where true zero effects are implausible. Testing against a minimum-effect, while controlling the Type 1 error rate, provides a more coherent and practically useful alternative. Type M errors warn against effect size inflation after selectively reporting significant results, but we argue that statistical indices such as the critical effect size or bias adjusted effect size are preferable approaches. We do believe that Type S and M errors can be valuable in statistics education where the principles of error control are explained, and in the discussion section of studies that fail to follow good research practices. Overall, we argue their use-cases are more limited than is currently recognized, and alternative solutions deserve greater attention.",

          "abstract": "Internalising problems are prevalent amongst neurodevelopmental conditions and associated with a range of negative outcomes. Yet, the unique contributions of autistic and ADHD traits remain under-researched. Using the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI), ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), this study aimed to quantify the relative contributions of autistic and ADHD traits to internalising problems. Adopting a traits-based approach in a general population sample 239 adults took part. Regression and dominance analysis indicated both autistic and ADHD traits predicted internalising problems, and that autistic traits were the stronger predictor. This is contrary to the other research which implied ADHD traits have the greatest bearing; however, this study used different measures and indicates that measures focussing on cognition may have overlooked the physical manifestations of internalising problems in individuals with higher autistic traits. Whilst camouflaging was touched upon, its impact requires further investigation.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Introduction\nAs generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools become more integrated into creative workflows, understanding how to optimize interactions with these systems to maximize creative output becomes increasingly important. While GenAI chatbots like ChatGPT have demonstrated high levels of creative ability on creativity tasks, there is limited empirical evidence on how to structure prompts and interact with GenAI to elicit their most original outputs. In humans, creative idea generation often follows a “serial order” effect, where later ideas in a brainstorming session tend to be more original than early ones. It remains unknown whether this phenomenon occurs in GenAI or whether repeated prompting enhances GenAI idea originality. This study investigates how the position of an idea in a response list and repeated prompting influence the originality of GenAI outputs on divergent thinking tasks.\n\nMethods \nWe will evaluate nine leading GenAI chatbots (ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-o3, Microsoft Copilot, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4, xAI’s Grok 3, and Perplexity AI) using the Alternate Uses Task. Each model will complete 50 independent sessions per task: each session will involve the generation of 25 original uses for an AUT item, with two further prompts to elicit further ideas. This will facilitate the study of the effect of response order and iterative prompting on GenAI idea originality. We plan to score the originality of each response using the Open Creativity Scoring with AI (Ocsai) tool. We will analyze the effect of response order and repeated prompting using repeated-measures ANOVAs and post-hoc comparisons. \n\nEthics and dissemination \nThe results of this experimental study will be shared in a relevant peer-reviewed journal and presented at local, national, and international conferences. As only data from GenAI will be used, we will not require ethics approval.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "The psychological and behavioural sciences have long struggled with issues of replicability and reproducibility, often attributed to poorly defined psychological constructs. Clear and precise construct definitions are essential for advancing theory development, improving measurement validity, and fostering scientific communication. This study aimed to develop comprehensive definitions for key constructs within the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), a widely used model in health psychology. Using a structured, iterative methodology adapted from Podsakoff et al. (2016), we focused on refining definitions for action planning, coping planning, self-efficacy, and action control—core constructs in the model’s post-motivational phase. The resulting definitions are intended for inclusion in the Decentralised Construct Taxonomy (DCT), promoting transparency and consistency in construct usage. This work offers a replicable framework for construct definition development, with implications extending beyond the HAPA model to the broader behavioural sciences.",
