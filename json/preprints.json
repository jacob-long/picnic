          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "This paper redefines the role of memory within the Thought OS by introducing the concept of structural shards—nonverbal fragments preserved not for their meaning or informational content, but as traces of structural reactions. These shards function as rebootable substrates that support key components such as Mindflight Cognition, Structural Pressure, and Structural Quotient (SQ).We propose a four-layered definition of structural shards (experiential, basic, functional, and systemic) and distinguish them from memory, knowledge, and experience. Five core properties—reconfigurability, structural integrity, resonance, proliferation, and latency of meaning—are articulated.Further, we present a three-phase model linking structural shards to cognitive jump and instantaneity, classify them into light-type and dense-type shards, explore their role in the Thought OS’s memory layer, and propose practical methods such as structural journaling and AI co-creation.\nUltimately, this paper positions structural shards not as tools for recall, but as catalysts for intellectual jump—a memory system designed for structural reactivation.",

          "authors": "jiazheng liu",
          "abstract": "This paper revisits the seminal experiment by Sartori et al. (2014) on the thermodynamic cost of sensory adaptation and reinterprets it through the lens of three universal physical constraints: thermodynamic limitation, information delay, and control-theoretic stability. We show that these constraints naturally lead to a rational response function that saturates smoothly, delays causally, and stabilizes globally. The experimentally observed behavior of E. coli chemotaxis is not an isolated biological phenomenon, but rather a special case of a general law governing all responsive systems under physical constraints. We argue that the irreducible delay embedded in the rational form represents a fundamental unit of responsiveness—one that defines the minimum time-energy cost of prediction, adaptation, and control in both natural and artificial systems.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive enhancement promises unprecedented productivity and creativity, yet it also perturbs an overlooked common resource: social time. We advance the concept of temporal stratification—systematic differentiation of populations by cognitive latency and bandwidth—and develop a formal model showing how even modest tempo gaps elevate coordination costs, induce enclaving by speed, and degrade deliberation and intimacy in mixed groups. We derive testable predictions (“pacing friction,” “clock–drift divorce,” and demand for “latency equalizers”) and propose a methods roadmap spanning laboratory experiments, field trials, and platform telemetry. Policy implications include augment-neutral labor standards, tempo-aware democratic procedure, and design principles for cooperative tools. By reframing enhancement through the lens of temporal compatibility, we show that time—not only traits—becomes the first-order equity frontier in an augmented society.",

          "authors": "jiazheng liu",
          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThe constant τ₀ denotes the irreducible latency that separates cause from measurable effect in every physical, biological, and engineered system. Although scientists have reported non-zero delays for more than 150 years—refractory periods in neurons, reaction times in psychology, dead time in control loops, encoding latency in information theory, and threshold saturation in biochemical kinetics—these observations were long treated as separate curiosities. This paper reconstructs the hidden lineage of τ₀, tracing six milestones from nineteenth-century electrophysiology to modern predictive-coding theory, and shows that each empirical “delay’’ is a manifestation of the same universal bound required by thermodynamics, finite information capacity, and closed-loop stability. By recasting classic laws such as Michaelis–Menten kinetics and Wiener’s cybernetic delay in a single rational response form\n\nwe demonstrate that τ₀ is not a tunable fit parameter but the minimal temporal grammar of causal interaction. Recognizing this constant unifies disparate disciplines and provides a foundation for any future theory of responsive systems.",

          "title": "Constraint vs. Prediction: Two Modes of Scientific Theory",
          "authors": "jiazheng liu",
          "abstract": "Scientific theories perform two fundamentally different functions: some predict specific outcomes given initial conditions, while others constrain the very form that any valid model may take. Predictive theories, such as Newtonian mechanics or the Schrödinger equation, map inputs to outputs and require parameter calibration to generate forecasts. Constraining theories—exemplified by the second law of thermodynamics, special relativity, and Landauer’s principle—impose universal limits or symmetries without specifying exact values. This paper articulates a clear distinction between these modes, tracing their historical emergence from 17th-century mechanics to modern information theory and cybernetics. We show that conflating prediction with constraint obscures a theory’s logical role and may lead to misapplication. Recognizing constraint as a complementary mode of scientific reasoning enhances our ability to rule out unphysical models, guiding both foundational research and practical design across physics, biology, and engineering.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a theoretical model to scale emotions based on quantifiable neurochemical levels—primarily dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins, and cortisol. By analyzing the relative interaction and balance among these neurochemical agents, we derive a composite metric, termed the Emotional Potency Quotient (EPQ), capable of representing emotional valence and intensity on a multidimensional scale.\n\nThe framework introduces five key components of emotional experience—physiological arousal, subjective intensity, cognitive disruption, behavioral influence, and duration—and integrates them with known neurochemical correlates. This creates a structured, semi-quantitative formula to describe affective states and transitions.\n\nWe believe this model holds promise in applications ranging from mental health diagnostics and AI-human interaction to wearable affective computing and neurofeedback therapies. This paper aims to initiate an interdisciplinary dialogue between neuroscience, psychology, computational modeling, and emotional theory.",

          "abstract": "This paper defines the bifurcation point of “entry-level cognitive reactions” within the Thought Operating System (TOS), as the fifth of the Six Foundational Pillars of the Kakushin Structural Theory. Prior to any conscious thinking, the human mind already exhibits “reactions,” which can be broadly classified into two types: Structural Reactions and Emotional Reactions. This study elucidates how these reactions emerge from the human core (hitokaku) and exert a foundational influence on subsequent cognitive development. The proposition that “logic without structural resonance is merely an emotional reaction” repositions the very starting point of thought, enabling a deeper integration with the models of the Thought Hexahedron and Mindflight Cognition. Furthermore, this paper intentionally preserves the definition of this bifurcation as a \"black box,\" offering an open conceptual space for future thinkers. By illuminating the pre-thought domain—where ideas do not yet begin—this work aims to establish a core framework supporting the internal evolution of the Thought Operating System.",

          "authors": "Alexander Landry",
          "abstract": "The most destructive forms of intergroup violence are not isolated outbursts of cruelty, but sustained practices organized by institutions designed to inflict harm. Psychological research has largely overlooked these institutional contexts, focusing instead on individual dispositions or decontextualized mechanisms. We address this blind spot by investigating how institutions shape perpetrators’ self-concepts — and how this transformation enables lethal violence. Drawing on in-depth interviews with U.S. and Ukrainian soldiers, we develop a phenomenologically grounded account of mechanistic self-dehumanization: a psychological state in which individuals experience themselves as instruments lacking emotional responsiveness and reflective self-awareness. We show how this state is cultivated by institutionalized practices that suppress individuality, restrict autonomy, and automate lethal action. We find that mechanistic self-dehumanization facilitates violence by dulling moral reflexivity while preserving behavioral control. Strikingly, it can also render violence affirming — allowing perpetrators to experience killing not only as tolerable, but as a source of professional pride. In doing so, mechanistic self-dehumanization bridges two dominant psychological perspectives: one that sees violence as a burdensome act requiring moral disengagement, and one that sees it as subjectively rewarding. These findings refine the construct of self-dehumanization, illuminate its institutional origins, and deepen our understanding of how lethal violence becomes not only tolerable but, at times, gratifying.",

          "abstract": "The effects of extreme temperatures on cognition have been well documented; however, the relationship between thermal discomfort at typically experienced temperatures and everyday cognition has received minimal attention. Using a smartwatch-based ecological momentary assessment design, we examine whether thermal discomfort and distracting temperatures are sufficient to impair both objective (N-back task performance) and subjective (self-reported alertness) cognitive function. Results demonstrated that while alertness and performance were significantly related, thermal discomfort led to worse performance on the N-back task but was not associated with alertness. The presence of distracting temperatures was also associated with lower scores on the N-back task. Taken together, the results of this pilot study demonstrate that deviations from comfortable temperature conditions can impair executive attention and cognitive control in daily life. Further, they highlight the utility of using combined EMA surveys and cognitive tasks to examine the effects of the physical environment on cognitive performance.",

          "authors": "Ahmed Zeid",
          "abstract": "Anxiety is typically treated as a unitary construct with multiple subtypes, but its clinical presentation often reveals deeper inconsistencies — especially in clients who relapse, resist treatment, or organize their identity around suffering. This paper proposes a novel framework for understanding anxiety not as a monolithic disorder but as the emergent product of two distinct psychological axes: Safety (the present-moment felt sense of protection) and Security (the internalized belief in continuity and self-coherence). Drawing on principles from attachment theory, predictive coding, and computational psychiatry, we present these axes as measurable latent variables governing both symptom expression and identity formation.\nUsing a state-space and Markovian framing, we model psychological behavior as transitions across the safety–security plane. We argue that therapeutic resistance, identity rigidity, and relapse are best understood as failures of state transition — not failures of will. We provide formal operationalizations of both axes, demonstrate how they can be used to inform treatment selection, and propose testable hypotheses across neurophysiology, language, and behavioral prediction. This model reframes resistance as coherence-preservation and offers a compassionate, scientifically-grounded architecture for understanding anxiety and the self.",

Infants are viewed as unconditioned by social experience and therefore a source of insight into the initial state of psychological organization. This paper outlines three constraints on this approach focusing on limited sample diversity, insufficient predictive and convergent validation of methods, and overreliance on single exposures or unreplicated findings. It argues for a shift from an emphasis on universality towards a focus on variation. Large-scale multi-site collaborations, longitudinal designs, and cross-method convergence across culturally diverse settings as key components of this goal. These approaches can advance a more ecologically valid and culturally situated science of infancy.",

          "abstract": "The study involved 76 participants (46 males and 30 females) who were randomly assigned to two conditions, simultaneous and successive presentation of storyboard eliciting three social-moral emotions, shame, guilt, and remorse. In the successive condition, storyboards with three frames were displayed one at a time for 5 seconds each, while in the simultaneous condition, all frames were shown together for 15 seconds. Participants were instructed to visualize themselves in the scenarios and identify their emotional responses as guilt, shame, or remorse, rating the intensity of these emotions on a 5-point Likert scale. Results indicated that the simultaneous presentation significantly enhanced recognition accuracy for shame and remorse, while participants in the successive condition demonstrated shorter fixation times but higher fixation counts. Notably, longer fixation times were required to focus on shame-inducing stimuli compared to guilt or remorse in both conditions. Upon fixation, guilt elicited longer durations than shame in the simultaneous condition, with significant differences observed between remorse and shame as well. The study also found that pupil size varied across conditions, with guilt consistently resulting in larger pupil diameters than both shame and remorse. Overall, the findings highlight the differential cognitive processing involved in recognizing social-moral emotions, underscoring the impact of presentation format on emotional perception.",

Self-regulation was measured via a self-report questionnaire (the Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire), as was mental imagery (the Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire). Resting heart-rate variability was calculated as the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats within the final 30 seconds of a five-minute period of rest. While a positive correlation between mental imagery and self-regulation is found, its magnitude trails behind that anticipated by conventional theories. No correlation was detected between resting heart-rate variability and either mental imagery or self-regulation, and therefore no mediatory role was possible for mental imagery. In short, the present results call into question much of the academic theorization and popular opinion about self-regulation.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

It is argued here that human consciousness, as an \"internalized listener\" in pre-linguistic humans both modern and ancient, functions to select—from essentially random, spongiform thoughts (messages)—those thoughts that bear familiarity or affiliative-alignment markers to this internalized listener (an internalized 'we' listener). This dramatically reduces the meaning space for both ancient and modern pre-linguistic humans, allowing them to acquire language and social meaning very quickly—a necessity likely as human communities began to grow and become unwieldy for non-linguistic coordination.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions.",

As an internal framework of the Thought Operating System, it demonstrates how thought functions not merely as static logic or knowledge, but as a dynamic, recursive structure. This paper explores its complementary relationship with Mindflight Cognition (a model of discontinuous cognitive leaps), and illustrates its real-world application through a case study on a hot dog business concept. Ultimately, the Thought Hexahedron offers a redefinition of thought as something that “rotates” and deepens—transforming it into a designable model of cyclical intelligence.",

To better understand what drives participation or resistance, this study examines decision-making processes among former genocide perpetrators, rescuers, and bystanders in a controlled task assessing obedience to antisocial and prosocial orders. Although former perpetrators were more likely to obey antisocial commands, all groups demonstrated high rates of prosocial disobedience. EEG data revealed that rescuers exhibited heightened emotional processing of victims’ distress compared to other groups, which was associated with greater prosocial disobedience. The study also challenges the idea that inherent traits drive genocidal violence, as former perpetrators and bystanders showed no differences across various neural processes. Our study provides the first empirical evidence of the specificities of rescuers and offers insights into fostering resistance to harmful social influence.",

This paper presents a comprehensive critique of eternalism’s weaknesses across metaphysical, epistemological, phenomenological, and empirical dimensions. Metaphysically, eternalism’s commitment to all times being equally existent (in contrast to Existential Realism’s distinction between existence and reality) is argued to be an ontologically inflationary leap that raises problems of change and becoming. Epistemologically, we question how knowledge can extend to events that, under eternalism, “exist” beyond any possible observation. Phenomenologically, the block universe is at odds with the immediacy and flow of temporal experience, treating the vivid present as an illusion. Empirically, we challenge the common presupposition that the formalism of relativity theory straightforwardly entails eternalism – a philosophical extrapolation from physics rather than a necessary conclusion. Throughout, we engage with key voices: Einstein’s relativity-driven eternalism, van Fraassen’s empiricism, Markosian’s and Crisp’s defenses of a tensed reality, among others. We contrast eternalism with Existential Realism, a recent framework distinguishing existence (present, observable being) from reality (including past and future structures). This distinction preserves the empirical primacy of the present while affirming the causal reality of the past and the openness of the future. We argue that Existential Realism provides a more coherent and experientially anchored ontology of time. The critique is organized into numbered sections, each concluding with references.

Drawing on panpsychism, quantum metaphysics, and the notion of qualia as fundamental, this perspective suggests that consciousness emerges not solely from neural computation, but from dynamic interactions within an infinite, foundational field of pure experience - the qualia field. This model treats physical reality as a probabilistic expression of this field, with subjective experience arising through structured interference patterns. By situating this field within a framework inspired by quantum state space, the proposal offers a non-reductive, integrative path for understanding consciousness as ontologically primary rather than emergent.",

The study sample comprised 7,536 participants across six European countries. Our findings indicate that greater immersion in digital environments and higher quality of digital experiences are associated with an accelerated perception of time. Mediation analyses revealed that dimensions of the IDLS and QDES partially mediate the relationship between a future-oriented temporal focus and PoT. Specifically, individuals with a stronger future focus tend to engage in digital life to a greater extent and experience its beneficial effects, which in turn contributes to a faster subjective experience of time. Country-level differences emerged: participants in Poland reported the highest levels of digital immersion and the fastest perceived time passage, while individuals in the United Kingdom exhibited the strongest past orientation and the slowest PoT. The results shed more light on the consequences of digital usage on time perception.",

          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by a paradoxical cognitive profile that includes both attentional inconsistency and the capacity for intense, sustained focus. This paper introduces a computational model that unifies the core attentional paradox of ADHD, reconciling these contradictory traits as emergent properties of a single, adaptive cognitive strategy driven by working memory (WM) limitations. The model posits that a constrained WM capacity makes parallel processing computationally prohibitive, necessitating a shift to a serial, Depth-First Search (DFS)-like strategy. This serial mode mechanistically accounts for hyperfocus. The model further incorporates a low activation threshold for shifting paths, a single mechanism that produces both a high susceptibility to distraction and a greater propensity for creative insight. This framework provides a unifying architecture for the ADHD cognitive style, framing its traits as the predictable outcomes of a fundamental trade-off. From a Reinforcement Learning (RL) perspective, this can be understood as a cognitive policy biased towards exploration over exploitation, resulting in a reduction in systematic task efficiency in exchange for an increase in opportunistic, creative discovery.",

Through dialogue with AI, the author realized that his mode of intelligence centers on perceiving the world through structure. This insight led to the formulation of the “Law of Universal Structure,” which posits that behind all phenomena of meaning—emotion, questioning, creativity, and mutual understanding—there lies structure. This structural view is further integrated with three core concepts: Structural Quotient (SQ), Mindflight Cognition, and the Thought Operating System (Thought OS), revealing a new architecture of intelligence. By demonstrating that humans are uniquely capable of designing, reorganizing, and leaping through structures, the paper positions this law as the Third of the Six Foundational Pillars of Kakushin Structural Theory.",

          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by a paradoxical cognitive profile that includes both attentional inconsistency and the capacity for intense, sustained focus. This paper introduces a computational model that unifies the core attentional paradox of ADHD, reconciling these contradictory traits as emergent properties of a single, adaptive cognitive strategy driven by working memory (WM) limitations. The model posits that a constrained WM capacity makes parallel processing computationally prohibitive, necessitating a shift to a serial, Depth-First Search (DFS)-like strategy. This serial mode mechanistically accounts for hyperfocus. The model further incorporates a low activation threshold for shifting paths, a single mechanism that produces both a high susceptibility to distraction and a greater propensity for creative insight. This framework provides a unifying architecture for the ADHD cognitive style, framing its traits as the predictable outcomes of a fundamental trade-off. From a Reinforcement Learning (RL) perspective, this can be understood as a cognitive policy biased towards exploration over exploitation, resulting in a reduction in systematic task efficiency in exchange for an increase in opportunistic, creative discovery.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nNeuroanatomical studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reveal abnormally increased cortical neuron numbers in affected children, with cortical thickness and weight significantly exceeding normal controls, some accompanied by macrocephaly. Concurrently, severe damage to cortical neuronal axons and columnar structures has been observed, with pronounced cellular accumulation in specific regions and long-range connectivity dysfunction. Most children develop symptoms between 1.5-2 years of age, yet the pathological mechanisms remain unclear.\nMammalian hippocampi exhibit sustained neurogenesis peaks during the first postnatal months, with hippocampal neuronal survival significantly increasing in response to learning tasks and information stimulation. The intensity of learning tasks and information stimulation that human infants receive far exceeds conditions in animal experiments. Research demonstrates large-scale neuronal migration phenomena in human infant cortex, with the cortex potentially containing cells from diverse origins.\nWe propose the hippocampal neuronal overflow hypothesis: massive surviving neurons within the infant hippocampus overcome hippocampal capacity limitations and, during critical time windows, overflow from the hippocampus to white matter, migrating into cortical layers to form synaptic connections and construct unique network circuits related to human cognition, language, and memory functions.\nWe propose that ASD etiology involves children receiving excessive learning tasks and information stimulation during the hippocampal neurogenesis peak period, leading to excessive neuronal overflow and migration into the cortex. During intensive synapse formation processes, migrating neurons physically disrupt existing cortical axonal structures, causing cortical functional damage manifested as social deficits, communication impairments, and stereotypical behaviors.\nBased on extensive literature analysis, this study proposes that some ASD cases may result from this acquired neurodevelopmental abnormality mechanism, providing a new theoretical framework for ASD etiology research.",

          "abstract": "Misophonia is characterized by intense negative emotional responses to specific trigger sounds. Given that repetitive sounds are frequently endorsed as triggers, we investigated whether impaired preattentive sensory gating contributes to misophonia pathophysiology. Forty-eight participants (36 female; aged 18-64) completed self-report measures of misophonia severity (MisoQuest) and sensory gating ability (Sensory Gating Inventory-Brief), alongside an objective measure of sensory gating capacity (suppression of the P50 component in a paired-pulse paradigm). Resting-state beta and gamma power were also examined as potential markers of inhibitory capacity. A dimensional approach was employed, examining relationships across the spectrum of symptom severity rather than discrete diagnostic groups. Participants showed normal P50 suppression overall (mean S2/S1 ratio = 0.40 ± 0.34). Despite significant correlation between self-reported misophonia severity and sensory gating difficulties (τ = 0.51, p &lt; .001), no significant associations emerged between P50 suppression ratios and either misophonia severity (τ = -0.05, p = .652) or self-reported gating difficulties (τ = 0.14, p = .198). Similarly, resting-state beta and gamma power showed, at best, weak evidence of a relationship with misophonia symptoms. These findings suggest that misophonia may not arise from deficits in early, automatic sensory filtering mechanisms. Rather, the characteristic hypersensitivity to trigger sounds likely emerges from alterations in higher-order auditory processing networks, consistent with neuroimaging evidence of altered salience network activity. These results help constrain theoretical models that seek to understand the patterns of atypical neural activity that underlie the experience of misophonia.",

Self-regulation was measured via a self-report questionnaire (the Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire), as was mental imagery (the Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire). Resting heart-rate variability was calculated as the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats within the final 30 seconds of a five-minute period of rest. While a positive correlation between mental imagery and self-regulation is found, its magnitude trails behind that anticipated by conventional theories. No correlation was detected between resting heart-rate variability and either mental imagery or self-regulation, and therefore no mediatory role was possible for mental imagery. In short, the present results call into question much of the academic theorization and popular opinion about self-regulation.",

          "abstract": "Research on rhythm perception has largely focused on short rhythmic cycles typical in Western music, leaving a gap in our understanding of the perception and memory for longer and unfamiliar rhythmic structures found in other musical traditions. North Indian Classical Music (NICM), for example, features long rhythmic cycles varying in structure, duration, and number of beats. This study investigates how unfamiliar musicians, those with no prior exposure to NICM, perceive and discriminate these long rhythmic cycles, with a focus on working memory capacity and chunking strategy. Participants completed a rhythm discrimination task involving NICM cycles that varied in duration, number of beats, and rhythmic structure (isochronous vs. non-isochronous). The study also contained a digit span task to assess working memory, followed by selecting a grouping structure representing the pattern. Results revealed a significant positive correlation between digit span scores and rhythm discrimination accuracy. Rhythm discrimination performance declined as cycle duration increased, and performance was better for isochronous cycles than non-isochronous ones. There was also an effect of length (number of beats) for rhythm discrimination of non-isochronous cycles. Furthermore, grouping or chunking strategies were associated with higher discrimination scores, particularly for shorter cycles.  These findings suggest that working memory capacity and perceptual strategies such as chunking play a critical role in processing long rhythmic cycles.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Seven Cognitive Filters Model as a comprehensive framework for understanding the structure and complex processes of the human mind. Rooted in systematic introspective observations and aligned with established findings in cognitive science and neuroscience, the model proposes a layered and dynamic structure composed of seven sequential and interacting filters: sensation, perception, reason, awareness/belief, thinking, self-reflection, and self-awareness. These filters describe the progression of information processing from raw sensory input to the heights of conscious self-awareness.\n​At the heart of this model lies a critical distinction between thought (the automatic content stream of the mind) and thinking (the observing, executive self). We demonstrate how thinking, as the core agent of the system, is responsible for refining and enhancing cognitive performance, with the capacity to overcome distortions induced by thought and unconscious influence.\n​Clinical analyses—such as in schizophrenia and addiction—highlight the central role of thinking in psychological health. The model aligns with theories such as Kahneman’s System 1 and 2, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoanalytic concepts of the unconscious, and Piaget’s stages of cognitive development.\n​Beyond theoretical explanation, this model offers practical implications for targeted cognitive and behavioral interventions. It concludes by emphasizing the model’s wide research potential in neuroscience, clinical and developmental psychology, and the philosophy of mind, positioning it as a common language for exploring the complexities of human consciousness.",

          "abstract": "In three studies, we tested whether icon arrays—which are a popular method of presenting risk information—can reduce pre-decisional information distortion that arises when early emerging preferences bias the evaluation of subsequently shown information. In Study 1, using traditional measures of information distortion, we found that risk-of-death information about two potential treatment options that was presented via icon arrays was distorted in favor of participants’ leading alternative. The magnitude of distortion was similar to the level of distortion for other treatment information in the treatment scenario. Study 2 directly tested whether the presence vs absence of icon arrays when presenting risk information had any impact on levels of information distortion, this time using a dependent measure that targeted people’s intuitive perceptions of risk. We found that the extent to which a 6% risk of death seemed riskier than a 3% risk-of-death was greater when the former risk was from a treatment option that was relatively undesired. This distortion was not significantly reduced by the presence of icon arrays. We replicated this pattern of results in a third study. These findings highlight the need for developing new tools and methods for presenting risk/likelihood information that can protect against the influence of pre-decisional information distortion.",

          "abstract": "Adult aging is associated with a decline in memory for the specific details of past experiences, but the reasons for these declines remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we consider the potential of computational process models of memory to reveal mechanisms underlying age-related changes in memory specificity. We define empirical benchmarks in the most widely used tasks for studying age differences in memory -- recognition and free recall. We then systematically review two broad classes of process models -- global matching and retrieved context models -- that are well-suited to explaining these benchmarks. We discuss and at times illustrate through simulations how age differences in memory specificity can arise from different mechanisms in these models, such as reductions in encoding fidelity, cue-selectivity of retrieval, contextual reinstatement, or retrieval monitoring. These models hold great promise for uncovering the latent mechanisms of age-related memory change, but several explanatory shortcomings must be addressed for a more comprehensive theory to emerge. Because process models often incorporate simplifying shortcuts, they risk advancing descriptive rather than mechanistic explanations for age differences in memory. Furthermore, models that have identified multiple processes of age-related memory impairment have left unaddressed the ways in which these processes affect each other.  By illuminating these and other challenges in current process models, our review aims to stimulate future advances that can dramatically reshape our understanding of the processes of age-related changes in memory specificity.",

The precise shape of their potential uses has become clearer in recent years as machine learning models have been trained to reproduce a variety of complex human cognitive behaviors with impressive success. The prospect of AI-human performance parity, along with the advantages of AI systems in speed, cost and ease of use, has prompted psychologists to explore how science might benefit from reassigning some traditionally human research roles to machines. This chapter provides an outlook on such methods. We begin by documenting the prospective upsides of what many researchers take to be the most promising types of AI surrogacy, including the use of models to efficiently generate, screen and refine preliminary hypotheses.

The imagery elicited by RITs are of very short duration (e.g., the time it takes to subvocalize a name).  It has been proposed that RIT effects cannot arise for imagery that is of longer duration (e.g., musical imagery).  To investigate this matter, in our version of the RIT, participants heard and learned four simple, novel songs.  The lyrics for each song consisted of numbers, counting from one to ten.  The “minimal training” condition consisted of 10 presentations of each song; the “extended training” condition consisted of 30 presentations of each song.  After training, participants were presented with fragments of each melody (fragments of different lengths) and instructed to not “sing in their minds” the remainder of the melody.  Participants reported whether they involuntarily continued the melody as musical imagery and reported the number associated with the termination point of the experienced imagery.  One-third of the participants experienced substantive, involuntary musical imagery.  The current finding illuminates the limitations of involuntary mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "The current prevailing approaches to analyzing task fMRI data in developmental cognitive neuroscience are brain connectivity and mass univariate task-based analyses, used either in isolation or as part of a broader analytic framework (e.g., BWAS). While these are powerful tools, it is somewhat surprising that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is not more common in developmental cognitive neuroscience given its enhanced ability to both probe neural population codes and greater sensitivity relative to the mass univariate approach. Omitting MVPA methods might represent a missed opportunity to leverage a suite of tools that are uniquely poised to reveal mechanisms underlying brain development. The goal of this review is to spur awareness and adoption of MVPA in developmental cognitive neuroscience by providing a practical introduction to foundational MVPA concepts. We begin by defining MVPA and explain why examining multivoxel patterns of brain activity can aid in understanding the developing human brain. We then survey four different types of MVPA: Decoding, representational similarity analysis (RSA), pattern expression, and voxel-wise encoding models. Each variant of MVPA is presented with a conceptual overview of the method followed by practical considerations and subvariants thereof. We go on to highlight the types of developmental questions that can be answered by MPVA, discuss practical matters in MVPA implementation germane to developmental cognitive neuroscientists, and make recommendations for integrating MVPA with the existing analytic ecosystem in the field.",

We also investigated how measurement reporting practices have changed from 2010 to 2020, the decade encompassing the start of the “credibility revolution” in psychology. Across two samples, we coded 506 Social Psychological and Personality Science (SPPS) articles (N = 425 articles with at least one questionnaire measure; 1,198 questionnaire measures). Overall, ~31% of measures were reported with a name, ~53% a citation, ~66% an example item, ~76% the number of items, and ~78% of multi-item measures included some reliability information; approximately 22% of measures were single-item and 46% were ad hoc. We did not detect any apparent changes in the reporting practices examined from 2010 to 2020 in either sample, except for an increase in the availability of materials over time. Therefore, the replication crisis may have motivated increased access to studies’ materials in recent years but otherwise does not seem to be associated with more transparent reporting of measurement information for questionnaires in brief social and personality articles.",

Substituting the uniform delay factor  with its Padé-(1,1) surrogate confines every admissible gain curve to a two-pole, strictly concave family that subsumes Holling Type II, Michaelis–Menten, and hyperbolic discounting. This family is -dense in the physically feasible set and uniquely minimizes a quadratic dissipation functional. The resulting framework yields a delay-corrected Marginal Value Theorem—predicting systematically longer patch residence times than the classical rule—and a latency-aware prey-switching threshold. Thus, optimal foraging emerges as a special case of the response-law grammar, providing energy-bounded, delay-aware predictions without ad hoc curve fitting.",

          "abstract": "Population well-being surveys collect information from large, representative groups of people living in a defined geographic region on various social, emotional, and psychological factors that contribute to overall quality of life. Surveys provide relevant data to shape policies and practices to improve overall quality of life, such as informing the development of national quality of life frameworks. Ensuring that high-quality measures are being used in surveys is essential, because population level data inform policies that affect entire populations. The purpose of this study was to identify all existing population well-being surveys and analyze the quantity and quality of the established measures used in each survey. We conducted an environmental scan and identified 14 population well-being surveys, representing four continents, administered at monthly to 5-year intervals, and on samples of 3,928 to 65,000 individuals. We systematically appraised both the psychometry and pragmatism of each measure used in population well-being surveys through double-blind extraction using an established quality assessment tool. Overall measure quality was 33.05 (range: 20-46) and we found comparable domain scores for psychometric (M = 16.21) and pragmatic quality (M = 16.84). Psychometrically, measures tended to have high convergent validity and lower predictive validity. Practically, measures tended to have high readability scores and be briefer rather than longer. Our findings should be interpreted with our quasi-systematic method in mind, and our English language restriction. By highlighting how survey measures can be improved or refined in order to better measure population well-being, we hope these findings can support future population well-being surveys conducted across the world.",

While research has long sought to explain how this knowledge is acquired,\nprevious approaches have struggled to capture the nuanced and complex ways in which morphemes are used in written language. Our approach builds on earlier insights but moves beyond them by combining a large-scale analysis of vocabulary used in 1,200 books popular with children and young people with computational modelling to explore how affix learning from text may occur. We use a compositional distributional semantic model to investigate what can be learned about the meanings of individual English prefixes and suffixes through reading and evaluate the model’s performance against data from 120 adults in a lexical processing task. Our findings demonstrate that, despite high levels of noise, natural text contains sufficient structure to support the extraction of core affix semantics, and that readers are attuned to the complex patterns that shape affix use in the wild. This work contributes a new dimension to a more principled and psychologically grounded account of morpheme learning, and we discuss both this contribution and the broader insights it offers for language research.",

Approximating the delay τ₀ with a Padé-(1,1) expansion keeps every transfer function rational and at most second order, so any causal network reduces to two stable poles (−α₁,−α₂) with a weight ratio θ₂. From these parameters we obtain the closed-form scalar:\n\n\\frac{\\lambda S_c^2}{4}\\theta_2^2\\left(\\alpha_2^{-1}-\\alpha_1^{-1}\\right),\\quad\\lambda=\\Delta\\mu/ T,\n\nwhich fulfils the five phenomenological axioms of IIT, scales \\mathcal{O}(N) for sparse graphs, and equals the minimum decrement in a quadratic entropy-production functional when couplings are intact.

          "abstract": "Sustained attention and vigilance are fundamental cognitive abilities that develop throughout childhood and adolescence and may be enhanced by cognitively demanding activities such as formal musical training. This cross- sectional study examined whether individuals engaged in long-term musical training show enhanced attention and vigilance compared to matched controls without such training. Participants (N = 278; ages 8–34) were drawn from two samples of children, adolescents, and adults, with musicians and nonmusicians matched on a wide array of demographic and lifestyle variables using multivariate propensity-score matching. Attentional performance was assessed using the ANTI-Vea, a validated computerized task that measures two components of vigilance— executive and arousal vigilance—along with other attentional processes. Moreover, we applied advanced behavioral modelling given their sensitivity to the complex developmental trajectories in vigilance. For many indices, musically trained participants outperformed nonmusicians at all ages transversally, with overall faster responses, fewer attentional lapses, detecting more executive vigilance targets, and lower variability in arousal vigilance trials. Other group differences became more pronounced with age, indicating a possible dosage effect. Crucially, these findings remained after extensive control for potential confounding variables, providing a closer estimate of the long-term association between formal musical training and attentional abilities. Although the advantages associated with musical training were modest and the study's correlational nature warrants caution, they support the hypothesis that music practice may foster domain-general cognitive skills and underscore the utility of music as a model of brain plasticity.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

However, their current statistical estimation procedures overlook the assumption of clustering, which refers to the grouping of subsets of variables that are more densely connected within the network, despite this assumption playing a central role in many psychological theories. We address this gap by proposing the use of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) as a prior distribution on the network structure of a graphical model for binary and ordinal data. The SBM assumes that variables belong to latent clusters, where the probability of an edge depends on the cluster membership of the nodes. Embedding this prior in a Bayesian graphical modeling framework allows researchers to formally incorporate theoretical expectations about clustering, test hypotheses about the number of clusters, and estimate cluster assignments from cross-sectional data. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in a simulation study and reanalyze 30 openly available empirical datasets to test for clustering. This work highlights how the Bayesian framework can embed theoretical assumptions into network models via priors and introduces a new tool for latent cluster inference in psychological network analysis.",

While the method has clear scientific benefits, so far there has been little reflection on its legal and ethical implications. In this perspective, we discuss these considerations and provide recommendations on transparent use of this method. We argue that imputed genotypes should be considered identifiable, personal data, and that using these data requires informed consent. We distinguish different scenarios where consent may be missing, such as an individual previously not having been contacted for consent, or a person who was contacted but did not reply or did not wish to participate. Informed consent is important across all these scenarios as it allows individuals to decide whether they want to participate in a study. In addition, transparent communication on how people’s data are used is important for public perception of science, and a failure to communicate this may contribute to mistrust. We discuss potential harmful applications of Mendelian imputation, and how robust regulatory frameworks guiding Institutional Review Boards on novel advanced methods such as Mendelian imputation are currently missing. This complicates decision making, especially when researchers argue for public interest as a lawful basis for foregoing consent. We end with a set of recommendations for 1) future genetic research projects for which Mendelian imputation will be possible; 2) research that has already been conducted using this method; and 3) the inclusion of ethical considerations in the publication of novel techniques/analyses.",

In all countries, we find weaker belief in human-driven climate change among right-leaning politicians and citizens. This polarization was even stronger among politicians, with right-leaning politicians showing weaker climate change beliefs than their electorate. Furthermore, these politically polarized beliefs play a crucial role in policymaking, since belief in climate change mediates the impact of political orientation on mitigation policy support among politicians.

To quantify the impact of their interpersonal environments, the current preregistered meta-analysis included 181 studies (N = 75,376) that reported associations between social support (i.e., family, peer, partner, school, work) and internalizing psychopathology (i.e., depression, anxiety, nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidality) among SGM samples. Overall, a small, negative association was observed, r = -.26, with depression’s associations being significantly larger than the other psychopathology categories, r = -.30. Smaller effects were observed for samples with a larger share of bisexual individuals and when a SGM-specific measure was used. Otherwise, the negative association between social support and psychopathology was robust to demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, % white), SGM identity (e.g., % gender minority), source of support, and levels of structural stigma. No evidence of publication bias was observed. This robust finding suggests that all forms of SGM social support are similarly and complimentarily associated with lower internalizing psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "This paper defines Mindflight Cognition as a core cognitive module within the Thought Operating System (TOS), serving as the jump-generating mechanism that elevates perspective, reconfigures structure, and drives philosophical evolution. Positioned as the second foundational pillar of the Kakushin Structural Theory, mindflight cognition is structurally differentiated from spontaneous insight or delusional leaps. It is characterized by six internal components and three generative factors, functioning in concert with Kakushin (core belief), structural pressure, and Structural Quotient (SQ). The paper further explores its links to structural shards and snap transformations, outlines its applicability in education, creativity, and human-AI collaboration, and addresses its limitations and pathological variants. Ultimately, mindflight cognition is framed as a catalyst for cognitive Big Bangs—triggering thought-chain reactions across collective OS architectures.",

          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is becoming an increasingly relevant environment for learning, prompting growing interest in how learning tasks place in immersive settings and how it can be supported effectively. Feedback, as a core component of successful learning, plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of technology-supported learning environments. This scoping review provides an overview on the influence of feedback on learning in VR, examining learning domains, feedback content and presentation design, research objectives and designs, and key findings. Relevant online databases were systematically searched, and 70 publications were included in the analysis. Most studies were conducted in domains where VR offers clear advantages over real-world settings, such as reducing physical risk in medical or emergency training, lowering costs in sports or skill acquisition, saving personal resources in educational contexts, and enabling remote access to training. The studies differed widely in terms of the information provided and how the feedback content was presented. Previous research has primarily taken a technology-driven approach, emphasizing system development and preliminary evaluations of feedback implementation. These studies show that VR systems with feedback show advantages in terms of more positive learners’ experiences and performance. However, only a small number of studies applied controlled experimental designs to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of feedback, the conditions under which it works best, and influencing factors. To advance the field, future research should adopt theory-driven approaches and complex experimental designs taking into account individual learner conditions as well as the affordances of VR environments.",

          "abstract": "Background: In psychotherapeutic treatment, Outcome (OM) and Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) are highly recommended for the data-driven personalization of psychotherapeutic interventions. OM/ROM have proven particularly effective in identifying nonresponders and patients at risk of deterioration. However, OM and ROM remain insufficiently implemented in the field of child and adolescent psychotherapy. Their implementation and effectiveness are affected by the attitudes of psychotherapists toward OM/ROM. While several studies have examined the attitudes of therapists working with adults, little is known about which characteristics of psychotherapists working with children and adolescents influence their attitudes toward OM/ROM. In addition, research on specific facilitators of and barriers to implementation in this field is still limited. Objective: In this observational study, we investigated which therapeutic characteristics affect the attitudes of psychotherapists working with children and adolescents toward OM and ROM and how implementation is affected by previous experience and attitudes toward administering OM/ROM. Methods: Attitudes toward the OM/ROM of licensed German psychotherapists and psychotherapists in training working with children and adolescents were assessed in an online survey conducted between June 2023 and March 2024 (N = 126). Results: Compared with psychoanalytic-oriented therapists, therapists with an orientation in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) presented more positive attitudes (d = 1.88), but no significant difference was found between orientations in CBT and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy. Therapists working in institutionalized outpatient settings reported more positive attitudes than those working in private practices did (d = 0.88). No effect of previous experience in administering OM/ROM was found for either implementation barriers or facilitators; however, the results suggest that therapists administering pre-post evaluations expect more support in clarification processes than ROM administration currently provides. In addition, more positive attitudes toward OM/ROM are associated with higher expectations regarding both support in therapeutic processes and support in clarification. Conclusion: OM/ROM systems should consider assessing concepts from different psychotherapeutic orientations. The implementation of OM/ROM could benefit from close monitoring.",

It embraces “strategic illegibility”—the refusal to be neatly categorized—as a legitimate survival strategy and form of resistance.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Building on a recent study that identified five health risk behavior profiles among males and six profiles among female adolescents from 43 European countries, this study aims to explore the youth’s perceived support from family, peers, and teachers in relation to these profiles. Despite the emphasis on adolescent health-risk behaviors and perceived social support systems in previous literature, limited research has examined how these support domains intersect with person-centered patterns of co-occurring health-risk behaviors. \nMethods: Using the most recent data from the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey (N = 68,688), this study used the Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars (BCH) method to assess differences in perceived family, peer, and teacher support across the profiles identified from eleven health-risk behaviors among 15-year-old adolescents based on latent profile analysis (LPA), separately for males and females. \nResults: The results revealed that adolescents in the Low-Risk profile reported the highest family and teacher support. Peer support was highest among males in the Poor Lifestyle–Smoking profile. The lowest support levels across all three domains were observed in the Poor Lifestyle–High Substance Use profile. \nConclusions: These findings demonstrate that social support patterns vary systematically across health-risk profiles, underscoring the importance of tailoring intervention strategies to adolescents’ specific needs. Since each profile represents a unique pattern of perceived support, a one-size-fits-all approach may be insufficient. Instead, prevention efforts that simultaneously strengthen family dynamics, peer and teacher relationships may offer the greatest benefits for adolescents who demonstrate multiple risk behaviors across different areas.\n\nKeywords: health-risk behavior, adolescence, latent profile analysis, social support, protective factors",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper offers a rigorous examination of the concept of prosochē—the attentive mindfulness or vigilant focus on oneself—within Hellenistic Stoicism and its later transformations in Late Antiquity, and compares it to the modern psychological notion of the “flow state.” We analyze prosochē as a Stoic spiritual exercise (askēsis) essential to ethical development and life in accordance with cosmic reason (logos). Drawing on Pierre Hadot’s work and other scholarship, we detail how Stoic thinkers (especially Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius) conceived prosochē as continuous self-awareness and moral vigilance, and how this practice was adapted by Neoplatonist philosophers and early Christian ascetics. We then develop a comparative analysis between prosochē and Mihály Csíkszentmihályi’s concept of flow from contemporary psychology. Notable similarities include focused immersion, a harmonious affective state, and a sense of mastery or control during the experience. Key differences are also highlighted: prosochē is grounded in a teleological and moral framework oriented by cosmic nature and virtue, whereas flow is a content-neutral psychological state defined by optimal experience and lacking inherent ethical orientation. In sum, the paper situates prosochē as both an ancient practice of attentive presence and a precursor, with crucial differences, to modern ideas about absorbed states of consciousness. Footnotes provide references to primary sources (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Plotinus) and modern analyses (Hadot, Csíkszentmihályi, cognitive science research), and the conclusion reflects on the enduring relevance of prosochē for philosophy and psychology.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "In both everyday language and philosophical discourse, the terms existence and reality are often used interchangeably. This conflation is especially evident in debates on the ontology of time. For example, an orthodox presentist will say that only present things truly exist, treating all non-present entities (past or future) as unreal in an absolute sense – “all such objects are unreal, according to Presentism,” as one defender neatly put it. This paper serves as a focused extension and clarification of the metaphysical framework introduced in Existential Realism – A Distinct Ontological Framework Beyond Presentism. It addresses specific questions raised by readers and critics: Is it coherent to distinguish existence from reality? What philosophical work does that distinction do? How does it help with longstanding problems like truthmaking, the status of unobservable entities, and future ethics? In short, while the original paper laid out the core ontological structure, this follow-up revisits its foundations to deepen the theoretical implications, refine key definitions, and explore practical consequences. Our central thesis remains: existence and reality are not identical. But here, we argue more sharply that separating them yields a more nuanced, empirically grounded, and philosophically productive ontology of time. We defend this view against objections, offer clarified examples, and explore its implications for epistemology, phenomenology, and ethics. We proceed as follows. Section 2 defines existence narrowly, in terms of presentness and empirical accessibility, drawing on the spirit of van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism . Section 3 then defines reality more broadly, to include causal and structural aspects of the world inferable beyond the present—illustrated through examples such as dinosaurs, future climate events, and cognitive anticipations. Section 4 explores how this distinction addresses several philosophical issues: the truthmaker problem for past truths, the ontological status of unobservable scientific entities, the phenomenology of temporal experience (in the sense of Husserl and Metzinger ), and considerations of metaphysical parsimony. Section 5 argues why this two-tier ontology is not merely a restatement of presentism or eternalism, but a distinct metaphysical framework. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our contributions and highlights new directions this view opens—particularly in ethics (e.g., our duties to future persons), AI models of time, and decision theory under uncertainty. Throughout, we maintain an academic tone and use end-of-paragraph references in line with the original paper’s style. Our aim is for this article to stand on its own as a focused argument on the existence–reality distinction, while continuing and enriching the foundation laid by Existential Realism.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Existential Realism as a novel ontological framework in metaphysics that offers a rigorously technical alternative to presentism. In contrast to standard presentism’s claim that only the present exists , In contrast to standard presentism, which claims that only the present exists, Existential Realism distinguishes between existence—material, empirically accessible presence—and reality, which includes causal, epistemic, and anticipatory structures beyond the immediate present. This framework integrates insights from metaphysics, epistemology, and phenomenology to address the limitations of presentism and related theories of time. We delineate how Existential Realism departs from presentism (and is not merely a variant thereof) by reinterpreting what it means for an entity or event to exist now, while still affirming the ontological significance of past and future entities as real despite their lack of present existence. Systematic comparisons are drawn between Existential Realism and the standard theories of temporal ontology – presentism, eternalism, and the growing block theory – with references to key contributors (Markosian, Crisp, Bourne, Zimmerman) to highlight differences in ontological commitments. We provide technically grounded examples—from causal traces in physics to cognitive-state evidence and time-indexed data structures—to show how entities can be real even without presently existing. The paper also addresses major objections, including the coherence of reality without existence, the epistemological access to entities that do not presently exist or are unobservable, and the compatibility of this framework with special relativity. A comparative table is included to map Existential Realism vis-à-vis other theories. In conclusion, Existential Realism is presented as a robust, integrative stance that preserves the empirical and experiential centrality of the present while acknowledging the enduring reality of the past and the looming reality of the future – thus serving as a stand-alone reference framework for future discourse in metaphysics and cognitive science.",

Their capacity to automatically and meaningfully analyze large-scale text data makes them particularly valuable for studying highly individualized clinical phenomena, such as triggers of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS), where pattern identification is often challenging. To address this gap, we asked 1,495 individuals to identify their most common triggers, rate their intensity, and report the severity of their contamination-related OCS. Using LLM-based embeddings, we generated a map of key trigger categories, revealing their diversity across ecological domains and varying degrees of semantic similarity. Monte Carlo simulations further showed that individuals frequently reported semantically similar trigger pairs that differed in intensity. These findings are clinically significant, providing a foundation for a more fine-grained understanding of OCS treatment mechanisms and paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches.",

          "abstract": "Stoicism was one of the major Hellenistic philosophies, renowned not only for its ethical teachings but also for pioneering work in logic and epistemology. The Stoic school, particularly under Chrysippus of Soli (c. 279–206 BCE), developed a formal propositional logic that in some ways foreshadowed aspects of modern logical systems.  This paper provides a rigorous comparative examination of Stoic reasoning and logic vis-à-vis modern logic traditions. We focus on the structure of Stoic logic (including its syllogistic forms and inference rules; the Stoics’ treatment of logical paradoxes such as the Sorites (the “heap” paradox) and the Liar, and the philosophical presuppositions underlying Stoic logic (notably its integration with ontology and determinism). In contrast, modern logic—particularly as developed by Frege, Russell, and the logical positivists of the 20th century—emphasizes formal abstraction and symbolic rigor. The analysis highlights how Stoic logic, though formulated over two millennia ago using ordinary language, anticipates certain ideas found in modern symbolic logic, while nevertheless differing significantly in purpose and context. In doing so, we shall see how key Stoic logicians like Chrysippus innovated logical theory, and how these innovations compare to the work of modern figures such as Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and the logical positivist school.\nThroughout the paper, a formal academic tone is maintained. Where appropriate, we include footnote references for further explication or sources, and a complete bibliography is provided at the end. It should be noted that our knowledge of Stoic logic comes from fragmentary sources and later reports, since no complete Stoic logical texts survive from antiquity.  Nevertheless, scholarship has reconstructed a coherent picture of Stoic logical theory which we draw upon. The goal is to illuminate both the continuities and divergences between the Stoic logical tradition and the modern logical paradigms that dominate contemporary philosophical logic.",

          "abstract": "The congruency effect, characterized by faster and more accurate performance in congruent compared to incongruent trials, has been consistently observed in various conflict tasks. However, the search for a common underlying process of inhibition reveals significant differences between conflict tasks, as evident from different time courses of the congruency effect (i.e., delta functions) and a lack of correlations in performance across different conflict tasks. To address these issues, the Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks (DMC) has been employed to explicitly model congruency effects and explain different delta function shapes. However, estimating the parameters of the DMC using standard iterative methods faces computational challenges. In this study, we leverage Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) with deep learning to address these limitations. We use different prior distributions, levels of model complexity, and automated hyperparameter optimization within a principled workflow. ABI produces well-calibrated posteriors across a wide range of trial counts, estimating individual-level parameters as accurately as iterative methods within a fraction of their runtime. Additionally, we conducted an experiment to validate the key parameters of the DMC. As expected, the amplitude of the automatic process was influenced by stimulus spacing in a flanker paradigm. However, the effect on the peak latency parameter depended on the choice of model parameterization and prior hyperparameters. Taken together, we demonstrate the viability of ABI as a scalable, accurate alternative to conventional estimation techniques and provide a reproducible workflow for future cognitive modeling studies.",

          "abstract": "Image-computable low-level image saliency has shaped perceptual psychology and computer science, but is limited by its inability to capture human high-level cognitive factors that influence attention and eye movements. A recent paper has shown that while free-viewing scenes, participants fixate on objects that are critical to the understanding of scenes. Here, we propose a fully automated method (with no fitting parameters or training) to create scene understanding maps (SUMs) that visualize the quantitative contribution of an object to the human comprehension of the scene. The method (AUTO-SUM) uses auto-segmentation and removal of different objects from scenes, Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to describe the scenes, and semantic similarity measures using large language embedding representations of scene descriptions. We show that AUTO-SUMs can approximate H-SUMs estimated using human-operated segmentation and object removal, human scene descriptions, and sentence similarity ratings. We also show that AUTO-SUM can predict the object most fixated by human observers during free viewing and scene description tasks better than a saliency model (GBVS) and comparable to DeepGaze. We contend that AUTO-SUM can be used as a semantic saliency model that complements lower-level saliency models.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

All analyses\nwere conducted in Python and are openly available on GitHub. Trust in the Elli chatbot was significantly\nlower than in the static form (p = .004, d = –0.49). Comfort and empathy ratings showed no significant\ndifferences. Dropout analysis revealed no condition-related attrition (χ² = 0.37, p = .54). Qualitative\nfeedback highlighted discomfort with artificial empathy and a perceived lack of human presence in the\nchatbot condition. No significant differences emerged for PHQ-9 or GAD-7 severity.

          "abstract": "Despite recent legal reforms, the concept of sexual harassment remains unclear in Japan. The current legal framework only covers incidents in workplaces, leaving victims outside the work environment without adequate protection. Despite the rising public awareness, a significant gap persists in understanding how victims process and respond to their experiences of sexual harassment. To gain a deeper understanding of victims’ experiences and how they make sense of their reactions to sexual harassment, we performed a qualitative study with 12 participants who had experienced sexual harassment at one point in their lives in Japan. Our findings revealed that some of the Japanese participants chose to remain non-confrontational in response to sexually abusive acts, while the non-Japanese participants preferred to take direct action. The power imbalance created by hierarchy, the participants’ adherence to the concepts of Wa (social harmony) and Gaman (endurance), and the deficiencies in the legislative system seemed to discourage them from seeking justice, which in turn allowed the perpetrators to avoid accountability. Considering these factors, there is a clear need to establish a more comprehensive and transparent legal framework that protects victims of sexual harassment and abuse in all contexts and encourages them to come forward with confidence, knowing that such acts will be addressed by law enforcement.",

This study aimed to address these inconsistencies through two preregistered replication experiments, examining the role of relational mobility as a potential moderating factor across different cultural contexts. Contrary to initial findings, our results from Experiment 1 in Japan (n = 254), Experiment 2 in Japan and the Netherlands (n = 263 and 300, respectively), and an exploratory statistical modeling revealed a consistent pattern where guilt led to compensation directed at the victim, sacrificing own resources, irrespective of the country or levels of perceived relational mobility.",

          "abstract": "Promoting academic engagement is vital for college student success. Researchers have explored factors like growth mindset, the belief that intelligence can improve with effort, as a driver of academic engagement. Given the important role of parental socialization on the developing student, we propose that students’ perceptions of their caregivers’ growth mindset beliefs might explain unique variance in their academic engagement, over and above students’ own mindset. This study examined how undergraduate students’ own mindsets and perceptions of their caregivers’ mindsets relate to four components of academic engagement: behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, behavioral disaffection, and emotional disaffection. Survey data from undergraduate students in the United States (N = 1,417) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. On average, students possessed a growth mindset and perceived their caregivers to also hold a growth mindset. Student growth mindset was positively associated with behavioral and emotional engagement and negatively associated with behavioral and emotional disaffection. Perceptions of caregiver growth mindset were associated with lower behavioral disaffection. Student growth mindset had a moderating effect on the association between perceived caregiver mindset and emotional engagement, such that a more student growth mindset weakened the negative association between perceived caregiver growth mindset and emotional engagement. The findings point to the important roles of parental socialization and internalization of caregiver messages and behaviors that could shape learning-related beliefs and behaviors in college.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Bayesian Construal Model (BCM), a unifying psychological framework that conceptualises human behaviour as a process of dynamic Bayesian inference. Initially developed as the Bayesian Situational Construal Model (BSCM) in alignment with Funder’s (2016) Situational Construal Model (SCM), the framework is here renamed the BCM to reflect its broader theoretical scope, mechanistic orientation, and applicability beyond the SCM triad. Building on the SCM, the BCM integrates insights from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) combine to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of expectation, interpretation, and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence over time. While first applied to understanding healthcare non-attendance, the BCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. It functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding adaptive, context-sensitive human action.",

Despite early promise, results across preclinical, human laboratory, and clinical trials have been mixed. We identify factors that may account for these inconsistent findings, including differences in study design, selection of subjects, sample size, and measurement approaches. We emphasize the need for a rigorous mechanistic research agenda that assesses extinction processes – acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval – as distinct mechanistic targets, and examines the relation between changes in these fear extinction processes and clinical outcomes.

          "abstract": "Background: Repetitive thought (e.g., worry; rumination) is a major transdiagnostic symptom and mechanism of internalizing psychopathology. Ability to regulate RT is particularly clinically important. Prior work implicates the default mode network (DMN) in self-generated and memory-driven cognitions including RT. However, few studies have investigated the neural correlates corresponding to successful RT regulation.\n\nMethod: Participants were 57 (32 female, 4 nonbinary, M age = 30) community-residing adults aged 20-45 oversampled for severe RT. 79% met criteria for one or more DSM-5 disorders. Participants completed an fMRI RT disengagement task during which they first viewed their own self-identified RT stimuli and perseverated as normal, then shifted attention to a validated sustained attention task, and finally responded to thought probes assessing momentary RT disengagement success. Study design, hypotheses, and analytic plan were preregistered on OSF (https://osf.io/qy4df).\n\nResults: More difficulty disengaging from RT corresponded to worse attention task performance (slower responding with no increase in accuracy); reduced activity in the salience, ventral and dorsal attention networks; and reduced connectivity between the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex) and dorsal attention network; but not reduced activity in or connectivity of DMN.\n\nConclusions and relevance: Successful regulation of repetitive thought may rely on the effective recruitment of attentional resources, but downregulation of DMN may not be necessary. Clinically, these findings suggest potential benefit from interventions that focus more on upregulating attentional functioning than on downregulating networks believed to subserve repetitive thought.",

Theories of associative learning suggest people can associate social cues, such as smiles, with personal reward, thus feeling good when others thrive. Yet, people often display generalized concern for others’ welfare, regardless of the specific cues present. We propose that Pavlovian conditioning allows people to associate reward directly with others’ abstract mental states, learning that another's happiness predicts their own reward.  In four online experiments with U.S. adults (N = 1500), participants’ monetary outcomes were congruently or incongruently predicted by a target’s mental states. Participants who experienced congruent learning reported more empathic feelings towards the target in novel situations. The values attached to mental states further influenced participants’ prosocial choices. These results demonstrate how associative learning of abstract mental states can give rise to generalizable empathy and influence moral behavior.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between music listening enjoyment and a variety of physiological responses, testing whether any subset of these measures can be used to predict music-induced emotions. We presented each participant with obscure instrumental music excerpts, recorded several physiological responses during music listening, and asked them to subjectively rate their experienced valence (positive to negative affect) and arousal (high to low energy). Using structural equation modeling, we found that high-frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), skin conductance levels (SCL), and respiration rate had small yet significant correlations with arousal, while HF HRV and the range of skin conductance responses (SCR) were correlated with valence. These findings indicate that physiological responses like SCR and respiration rate could potentially serve as an objective measure of music-induced emotions. Future researchers could expand upon these findings by investigating the influence of internal state and by exploring other physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG).",

Providing up-to-date information on multiple outcomes and understanding subgroups most affected can clarify potential mechanisms and inform interventions. This study provides an updated analysis of trends in mental health and behavioural outcomes among young adolescents in the UK.\nMethods\nWe used data from 15,911 adolescents (aged 10–15 years) participating in the UK Household Longitudinal Study between 2009 and 2023. Trends were examined in mental health (emotional, hyperactivity, conduct problems), health behaviours (diet, physical activity), social media, parental relationships (frequency of arguments, discussed things that matter), risk behaviours (staying out after 9pm, smoking/vaping/alcohol use), and antisocial behaviours (shoplifting, vandalism, physical violence). Weighted logistic regression modelled yearly mental health time trends and changes in behavioural variables between earliest and latest data collection waves. We examined whether trends differed by sociodemographic variables by testing interaction terms.\nResults\nBetween 2009 and 2022, emotional problems more than doubled from 11.7% (95% CI: 10.7–12.7%) to 26.6% (95% CI: 24.4–28.9%), with the largest increases among 14–15-year-olds, girls, and white British adolescents. Hyperactivity remained stable until 2018 (17.1%, 95% CI: 16.3–18.0%), followed by an increase to 25.8% (95% CI: 23.7–27.8%) by 2022, mostly among girls. Social media use rose markedly, alongside increased fast-food consumption and declining physical activity. Positive trends included improved parental relationships and reductions in risk behaviours and conduct problems. Peer problems increased significantly, particularly for girls.\nDiscussion\nThis longitudinal, nationally representative sample shows sharply rising emotional problems, recent increases in hyperactivity symptoms, and declines in risk behaviours and conduct problems. These divergent patterns, and worse outcomes for girls and white British adolescents, may reflect distinct mechanisms, resilience, or measurement interpretation. Further research is needed to clarify underlying pathways and inform targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Financial well-being reflects a complex interplay of psychological traits, behaviors, and\nknowledge, yet most segmentation approaches rely on limited indicators or assume linear\ndependencies. This paper proposes a novel framework for identifying latent profiles of financial\nmindset and behavior by modeling nonlinear interactions across multiple psychometric domains.\nUsing data from a proprietary assessment (N = 144) and the nationally representative U.S. CFPB\nFinancial Well-Being Survey (N = 6,233), we uncover recurring psychologically grounded\nprofiles that generalize across populations and survey formats. These profiles show strong\ninternal structure and are significantly associated with life satisfaction, psychological well-being,\nand financial health. By capturing deeper drivers of financial behavior, our approach moves\nbeyond conventional demographic or transaction-based segmentation. The resulting framework is\nreplicable, scalable, and well suited to behavioral finance applications, including financial\nadvising, wellness interventions, and the design of personalized tools and communications aimed\nat improving financial decision-making and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Previous work has yielded mixed results regarding the relationships of interpersonal synchrony with working alliance and treatment outcomes. We sought to clarify these relationships by applying more sophisticated dynamic and dyadic methods.\n\nMethod: Adult outpatients with depression (N=65, Age 18--64, 65\\% Female, 68\\% White) participated in up to eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal psychotherapy. Sessions occurred either in-person or via teletherapy and were video-recorded. Facial computing tools estimated the momentary intensity of patients' and therapists' scowling and smiling, and the interpersonal synchrony of these measures during each session was quantified using windowed cross-correlation analyses. Hypotheses about within-dyad processes (i.e., session-to-session changes) and between-dyad associations (i.e., of average tendencies) were tested using hierarchical Bayesian mediation models.\n\nResults: Numerous and nuanced associations were found between facial behavior, working alliance, and treatment outcomes (e.g., session-to-session increases in patient-rated working alliance were predicted by higher-than-average therapist smiling). Interpersonal synchrony did not predict within-dyad changes in working alliance or depression symptoms; however, on the between-dyad level, higher average patient-rated working alliance was predicted by both higher average smile synchrony and lower average scowl synchrony.\n\nConclusions: The facial behavior of patients and therapists provides a valuable window into the therapeutic process, especially with regard to the alliance. Contributions come from the behaviors of each person as well as their level of interpersonal synchrony. However, contrary to extant theories, the associations of synchrony with working alliance and outcomes depend on the behavior being synchronized, the informant providing ratings, and the level of analysis being conducted.\n\nPublic Health Significance: These results help refine clinical theories about psychotherapy and unlock new possibilities for computationally assessing its progress.",

          "authors": "Muchen Xi; Joshua James Jackson",
          "abstract": "Behavioral variability has long been a central topic in personality psychology. Traditionally, research has focused on differences in mean levels of behavior across situations and time, rather than taking a situation-specific approach. These approaches neglect variability (or the opposite, consistency) within a situation, often treating within-situation variability as mere error. This study investigates three primary questions involving behavioral variability: 1) is variability a general characteristic of individuals or contingent on situational factors? 2) Do situations influence behavioral variability either by allowing for more behavioral variability or by increasing behavioral consistency? and 3) Do personality traits interact with situations to affect variability? Utilizing intensive longitudinal data from two studies, we developed a novel Situational Density Distribution (SDD) model to capture person-specific within-situation variability. Our findings indicate that behavioral variability is not solely a function of individual differences but is significantly shaped by situational contexts. Contrary to the strong situation hypothesis, situations can influence behavioral variability in both directions, making people more and less variable. Finally, personality traits were found to modulate the impact of situations on behavioral consistency, suggesting that variability reflects the interplay between person and situation factors. These results highlight the importance of considering behavioral variability, which offers insights into personality dynamics rather than exclusively focusing on mean-level analyses. The implications of the SDD model for studying person-situation transactions are also discussed.",

Using Dyamic Structural Equation Modeling, we found a credible bidirectional relationship between phsycial activity and PA.

          "abstract": "People are lazy. According to the law of least effort, people generally prefer to exert less rather than more effort to achieve the same reward. However, this research often isolates individuals from social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour is shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we examine whether individuals conform to both high-effort and low-effort norms equally, or whether the strength of normative influence on effort choices depends on the direction of the norm. Across twelve studies (N = 2,084), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. While people generally avoid effort, results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however, did not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Even after increasing the acceptability of low effort—by enhancing the value of low effort and the psychological closeness to past participants—individuals still opposed the low effort norm, exerting no less effort than the control group. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour can inspire us to work harder, individuals show resistance to lowering their effort below what they would typically exert. While we consistently found conformity to high-effort norms, effort preferences were not influenced when hearing about others completing an unrelated task, pointing to a possible boundary condition for norm effects.",

          "authors": "Joaquin Matias Alfei Palloni",
          "abstract": "Memories are dynamic and can be made vulnerable to disruption upon reactivation, resulting in a long-lasting attenuation of conditioned responses (i.e., cue-dependent amnesia). Traditionally, cue-dependent amnesia has been studied using AAA between-subjects designs, where a memory is trained for context A, reactivated, and tested with the same context. Using contextual fear conditioning in rats and midazolam as the amnestic agent, we have recently observed that amnesia can be observed when memories are reactivated by a generalization stimulus (context B) and tested with the same generalization stimulus (ABB design). However, this amnestic intervention does not affect fear expression when animals are tested with the original stimulus (ABA design) or a novel generalization stimulus (ABC design). Methodologically, however, evaluating whether amnesia is reversed, rather than simply not expressed, requires tracking changes in responding within the same individuals across contexts and time. This avoids the ambiguity inherent to between-group comparisons, which may confound memory retention with retrieval differences driven by contextual or procedural variability. Here, using an ABB, ABA, and ABC within-subjects design, and employing a gold standard amnestic manipulation - protein synthesis inhibition via Cycloheximide (CHX) - the interplay between memory retention and amnesia expression in different contexts was assessed. The results indicate that amnesia is expressed only when CHX-animals are re-exposed to the reactivation context, regardless of when this re-exposure occurs within the experimental timeline. The implications of these findings for a reconsolidation-based account of post-reactivation amnesia are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Despite suicide being a leading cause of death for autistic people worldwide, there is remarkably little research addressing suicide prevention strategies in this group. Moreover, autistic voices are often absent from published research, leaving their ideas, needs and desires concerning suicide prevention unheard. \nOverall, 3962 autistic people and 627 people who supported or were bereaved by the suicide of an autistic person participated in the study. Using online surveys, we garnered their ideas for policies and interventions to prevent suicide in autistic people (Phase 1). We thematically analysed 3373 suggestions and distilled these into 63 concrete ideas, which we asked an independent sample to prioritise in a four-step process (Phase 2). We analysed descriptive responses to each idea and identified differential priorities between and within autistic and non-autistic groups. \nAcross both phases, we identified suicide prevention priorities including the upskilling of healthcare practitioners, the need for tailored and preventative support, and to improve waiting times for autism diagnosis and post-diagnostic care. Other priorities indicated the need for societal change to reduce social marginalisation, address inequities, and reduce barriers to help-seeking.\nWith ideas spanning mental health interventions to preventative measures in the education, employment and social care sectors, participants’ views appeared to corroborate and reflect focal shifts in national and international suicide prevention policies. Moving beyond individuals at crisis point, these increasingly emphasise the need for coordinated, multisector efforts to address the long-term societal determinants of suicide (e.g. unemployment, marginalisation), foster social connectedness and wellbeing. While policies to address autism and suicide are in their infancy, we argue that similarly wide-lens, strategic responses are imperative to reduce excess mortality in autistic people.",

          "abstract": "Speech errors have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the architecture of the language production system, the nature of its representations, and its disorders. To be most informative, researchers usually need large amounts of data. Hand-coding such data can be both cumbersome and subjective. This paper presents LeCoder, the first open-source, automated error coder, which uses a data-driven approach grounded in large-scale corpora to quantify the target-response relationship, allowing it to be flexible, scalable, and generalizable across new datasets. By testing the coder on two datasets from two aphasia labs that have been carefully coded by trained research assistants, we first establish that LeCoder has high accuracy when compared to expert coders, and in certain cases, offers a more logical categorization than human coders. We then show, using robust machine-learning approaches, that LeCoder’s performance generalizes to new participants and items it has never encountered before. Collectively, these findings encourage the use of LeCoder across labs for more objective coding of speech errors, which will, in turn, increase replicability of findings in all subfields of research that use speech error analysis, including neuropsychological research.",

          "abstract": "Learning science often appears to involve replacement of naïve, intuitive ideas with correct, counterintuitive ones. Recent studies indicate that the old naïve, intuitive ideas are not actually replaced but exist alongside the correct but often counterintuitive ones. On this account, newer knowledge for scientific thinking might involve inhibition of the old idea. However, instead of merely inhibiting old ideas, it is possible that switching is necessary to select between new and old scientific ideas. In this study, we explored the direct and indirect contributions of behavioural inhibition, cognitive inhibition and switching to intuitive and counterintuitive science reasoning in adults (N = 167). After replicating the commonly observed processing costs of counterintuitive items relative to intuitive ones, we find that individual differences in switching rather than in inhibition are most strongly associated with variation in the accuracy and speed of adult intuitive and counterintuitive science reasoning. These results suggest that adults switch between older and newer ideas when reasoning about science rather than suppressing one in favour of the other.",

Stemming from the flanker and Stroop tasks, which have revealed that involuntary cognitive processes can counter and interfere with voluntary cognitive processes, the reflexive imagery task (RIT) has shown that stimuli can elicit involuntary higher-order cognitions.  The extent to which stimulus-elicited involuntary processes can influence voluntary processes remains unknown.  In our study, participants were instructed to, when presented with a line drawing of an object, think of a random word and disregard the line drawing.  Would the presence of the line drawing influence the generation of the verbal imagery?  Despite the participant’s intentions, the to-be-ignored line drawing had an influence over the participant’s response at a reliable, substantive rate:  On over 35% of the trials, the word the participant thought of was associated with the name of the line drawing.  On half of the trials, no line drawing was presented (the “No Line Drawing” condition).  Participants’ \"sense of control\" and the extent to which the response (i.e., the word) was due to “the self,” was stronger in the No Line Drawing condition than in the condition in which a line drawing was presented.

Although several factor modeling strategies have been proposed to mitigate their adverse effects, there is limited systematic research assessing their performance with exploratory structural equation models (ESEM). The present study evaluated the impact of different types of response bias related to wording effects (random and straight-line carelessness, acquiescence, item difficulty, and mixed) on ESEM models incorporating two popular method modeling strategies, the correlated traits-correlated methods minus one (CTC[M-1]) model and random intercept item factor analysis (RIIFA), as well as the “do nothing” approach. Five variables were manipulated using Monte Carlo methods: the type and magnitude of response bias, factor loadings, factor correlations, and sample size. Overall, the results showed that ignoring wording effects leads to poor model fit and serious distortions of the ESEM estimates. The RIIFA approach generally performed best at countering these adverse impacts and recovering unbiased factor structures, whereas the CTC(M-1) models struggled when biases affected both positively and negatively worded items. A straightforward guide is offered to applied researchers who wish to use ESEM with mixed-worded scales.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "This meta-analysis integrates data from 139 studies involving 10,084 participants, identified through a systematic literature search, to examine neural error processing across various mental disorders—including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, depressive disorders (MDD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), substance-related and addictive disorders (SUD), and psychotic disorders. Using pairwise and network meta-analyses, we identified robust alterations in error-related brain responses measured by the error-related negativity (ERN). OCD (g = -0.43) and anxiety disorders (g = -0.23) exhibited heightened error-related neural responses (larger ERN), whereas ADHD (g = 0.26), ASD (g = 0.30), and psychotic disorders (g = 0.67) demonstrated blunted responses (smaller ERN). No significant differences in ERN were detected in MDD (g = 0.00) or SUD (g = 0.00) overall. Patients with psychotic disorders exhibited the greatest blunting of error processing, while those with OCD showed the strongest amplification—both significantly differing from healthy participants and all other clinical groups. These findings support the transdiagnostic potential of the ERN as a reliable neurocognitive marker. ERN alterations in anxiety disorders, OCD, and psychotic disorders may serve as endophenotypes or neural risk markers that precede symptom onset and offer predictive validity, aligning with established endophenotype criteria. Increased ERN signals may reflect amplified prediction errors, leading to over-control and risk-avoidant behaviors, while decreased ERN responses indicate hypoactive error processing, impairing adaptive responses to errors and feedback. Overall, ERN alterations hold promise as biomarkers of cognitive control dysregulation, with important implications for personalized interventions and early risk detection.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Existential Realism as a novel ontological framework in metaphysics that offers a rigorously technical alternative to presentism. In contrast to standard presentism’s claim that only the present exists  , In contrast to standard presentism, which claims that only the present exists, Existential Realism distinguishes between existence—material, empirically accessible presence—and reality, which includes causal, epistemic, and anticipatory structures beyond the immediate present. This framework integrates insights from metaphysics, epistemology, and phenomenology to address the limitations of presentism and related theories of time. We delineate how Existential Realism departs from presentism (and is not merely a variant thereof) by reinterpreting what it means for an entity or event to exist now, while still affirming the ontological significance of past and future entities as real despite their lack of present existence. Systematic comparisons are drawn between Existential Realism and the standard theories of temporal ontology – presentism, eternalism, and the growing block theory – with references to key contributors (Markosian, Crisp, Bourne, Zimmerman) to highlight differences in ontological commitments. We provide technically grounded examples—from causal traces in physics to cognitive-state evidence and time-indexed data structures—to show how entities can be real even without presently existing. The paper also addresses major objections, including the coherence of reality without existence, the epistemological access to entities that do not presently exist or are unobservable, and the compatibility of this framework with special relativity. A comparative table is included to map Existential Realism vis-à-vis other theories. In conclusion, Existential Realism is presented as a robust, integrative stance that preserves the empirical and experiential centrality of the present while acknowledging the enduring reality of the past and the looming reality of the future – thus serving as a stand-alone reference framework for future discourse in metaphysics and cognitive science.",

We systematically collect 245 documents from a range of public and private entities, which we collectively refer to as \"AI ethics guidelines.\" This paper documents the evolution of these guidelines and provides a better understanding of their content, particularly regarding their potential implications for the regulation of the world of work in the context of AI. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs), we analyze emerging patterns and show that certain ethical principles are more prominently featured than others. Through LLM-supported topic analysis, we identify and classify seven thematic clusters. However, labor markets or the “world of work” do not appear as distinct themes. Using Gemini AI, we further examine whether, and to what extent, ethical principles are discussed in the context of the world of work. We find that most AI ethics guidelines do raise labor-related concerns as critical areas for ethical decision-making. Based on this, we analyze whether the guidelines reference the International Labour Organization (ILO) or its International Labour Standards (ILS) as guiding norms. Only a small minority of guidelines explicitly mention the ILO or its ILS, while a slightly larger number refer implicitly to the ILO’s Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We conclude by discussing potential linkages between AI ethics, ethical behavior in the labor market, and ILS.

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "Phosphenes, the perception of light without external visual input, represent a rich intersection of neuroscience, subjective experience, and contemplative practice. While Heinrich Klüver's 1928 classification of four geometric \"form constants\" (lattices, cobwebs, tunnels, spirals) laid foundational groundwork for understanding these phenomena, it offers a limited scope for the diversity of forms reported across various induction methods. This article proposes an updated and expanded classification system for phosphene forms, integrating extensive subjective reports from transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) studies, detailed introspective data from practitioners of the Yoga of Inner Light (meditation), and insights from the Closed-Eye Visuals (CEVs) model in psychonautic literature. We present a new, graded framework that maps phosphene development across five levels of increasing complexity and intensity, ranging from ephemeral flickers and simple geometries to radial mandalas, archetypal imagery, and full-field immersive light realms. This synthesis not only refines our descriptive tools but also establishes a continuum of inner visual phenomena that bridges empirical neurostimulation data with contemplative phenomenology. By providing a structured and nuanced understanding of these inner lights, this classification system offers new pathways for consciousness research, contemplative science, and the integration of visionary experiences into healing and personal growth. It highlights phosphenes as dynamic, meaningful doorways to subtle perception, inviting a deeper inquiry into the nature of inner vision itself.",

          "abstract": "Educational videos have become central to learning environments, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need for optimized design to enhance learning outcomes. Concurrently, research on film cognition has provided valuable insights into how viewers process dynamic visual narratives in Hollywood cinema. This paper explores the parallels between Hollywood cinema and educational videos to determine how film cognition research can inform educational video design. We analyze how cinematic techniques align with educational principles (i.e. signaling, spatial and temporal contiguity) proposed by Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. Additionally, we examine social cognition aspects, drawing connections to the learning principles (i.e., embodiment and image principles) in educational contexts. We propose that educational videos can enhance learner engagement by adopting attention-guiding methods and social cues used in film. We also suggest the development of a corpus of educational videos to further explore and validate the application of film cognition principles in educational settings.",

          "authors": "Dawn Branley-Bell; Libby Moore; Claire Naomi Murphy-Morgan",
          "abstract": "Background: TikTok is a prominent platform for body image, diet, and fitness content. Its emphasis on short, visually engaging videos provides an impactful medium for conveying such content. This study explores user engagement with body image-related content, algorithmic exposure, and its potential impact on wellbeing, including pressure to conform and body dissatisfaction. Method: A mixed-method international study of 335 TikTok users (99 male, 231 female, 5 non-binary) explored: i). Whether users believe TikTok content promotes specific body ideals; ii). Whether users actively seek body image-related content or if it is passively presented to them by the algorithm; and iii). What strategies users employ to avoid and/or cope with distressing content. Findings: Over 99% of participants believed TikTok reinforces body ideals (thinness, muscularity, body purity, and/or body acceptance) and nearly 36% reported that TikTok had affected their own body perception. Regression analyses found that users exposed to thin or fit ideals felt greater pressure to conform to societal body standards; while those who viewed content depicting body acceptance felt less. Algorithmic exposure played a key role, with over half of users (51.7%) reporting not actively searching for content related to body image, diet, or fitness, but encountering it due to TikTok’s algorithm. Alarmingly, 33% of users had seen content promoting eating disorders (of whom only 6% had sought it out). Users exposed to this content scored higher for pressure to conform and reported greater impact on their own body image. Users were aware of algorithmic curation, but some expressed frustration over their lack of control over their content feed. To mitigate distress, they employed strategies such as engaging with alternative content to ‘shift the algorithm’ and attempting to ‘mindfully scroll’ to bypass unwanted content in a bid to prevent algorithm reinforcement. Conclusion: TikTok can offer community support and body positivity content; however, it can also perpetuate extreme body standards and facilitate exposure to harmful material, often beyond users' control. These findings highlight the need for platform-level interventions, including greater algorithm transparency and improved user tools to filter distressing content. For mental health professionals, these insights reinforce the importance of addressing social media exposure in discussions of body image concerns, particularly among vulnerable populations such as individuals experiencing body dissatisfaction, disordered eating or excessive exercise. Future policies should advocate for stronger safeguarding measures on social media platforms, including equipping users with practical tools to navigate and curate healthier digital experiences.",

          "abstract": "A major source of influence on the quality of educational experiences for children and adolescents is their parents. Research has shown extensively that children and adolescents tend to do better at school and are more likely to experience other non-academic positive outcomes when their parents are highly engaged with their education. However, the current literature is abundant with constructs, frameworks, and measures - many apparently similar - that attempt to capture this phenomenon, resulting in conceptual haziness and lack of clear mapping between constructs and operationalizations. To clarify this issue, an essential step is to conduct a literature review aimed at identifying and describing existing measures, and to build an understanding of how they overlap and diverge. The scoping review presented in this protocol will consider published and unpublished literature from the last 20 years that includes, reviews, or tests the psychometric properties of questionnaires that broadly capture parent engagement with children’s education. We will perform online searches of the PubMed, Web of Science and ERIC databases and select studies using a multi-step, multi-reviewer procedure. The review will be guided by the Joana Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis and PRISMA guidelines. Through data charting, the scoping review will result in a summary of identified measures along with their associated constructs and theoretical frameworks, and a narrative analysis of their psychometric adequacy.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes a rigorous method to control the size of visual stimuli for online psychological experiments. Our method employs ruler-based calibration to estimate the on-screen millimeter-to-pixel ratio by applying the least squares method to repeated measurements made by participants of randomly generated line segment lengths. Calibration success can be objectively verified by assessing both measurement errors during the test phase and the residual variance of a linear regression model. Our simulation results demonstrate that an upper bound of the standard deviation of estimation errors was 0.007 mm/px under the proposed calibration criteria. Demonstrating the method’s feasibility, implementation results showed that the majority of participants (N=100) were able to complete calibrations within a few minutes. Our method may facilitate rigorous studies of psychological phenomena that are sensitive to visual-stimulus size, such as visual perception and cognition, conducted in online environments.

          "abstract": "Judgments of Learning (JOLs) are prospective metacognitive evaluations in which individuals estimate their likelihood of remembering information in the future. This commentary reviews current evidence regarding the mechanisms underlying JOLs, focusing on three main debates: (1) how the act of making JOLs can influence memory performance—a phenomenon known as the reactivity effect; (2) whether JOLs are dependent on memory representations or operate independently via heuristic cues; and (3) whether they unfold as a single-stage or multi-stage process. Accumulating evidence shows that JOLs can enhance memory by engaging attentional and elaborative processes during encoding. Empirical findings support a hybrid model in which JOLs draw on both direct access to memory traces and inferential processes guided by encoding fluency and other cues. Additionally, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data further suggest partial independence between memory and metacognitive monitoring. Recent ERP studies support a dual-stage framework, revealing distinct early and late neural components linked to different aspects of the judgment process. This commentary highlights the dynamic and interactive nature of metacognitive monitoring, calling for integrative models that account for its temporal, cognitive, and neural complexity.",

          "abstract": "With large language models (LLMs) now embedded in a wide range of everyday technologies, there is increasing interest in accurately measuring public attitudes toward these systems. General instruments for assessing attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) have contributed to the field but may not fully capture attitudes specific to large language models (LLMs). To address this gap, we adapted the 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, a dual-component scale measuring AI Fear and AI Acceptance, and developed two new measures: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward Primary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales, assessing general attitudes and attitudes toward the LLM most frequently used by each respondent, respectively. Both instruments were specifically designed for the LLM context and validated in a UK sample of 526 adults (ages 18–45 years). Psychometric analyses supported a two-factor structure, strong measurement invariance across gender, and good internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.776-0.793). Both scales demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity. These measures offer more precise tools for assessing attitudes toward LLMs compared to general AI attitude scales and can be used in various research and applied settings. Measuring attitudes can also enhance evaluations of user experience and support the monitoring of public engagement with this evolving technology.",

          "abstract": "This chapter explores the potential of Generative AI to provide fit-for-purpose assessments of product creativity in a classroom context.\nThe chapter begins with a discussion of the drivers behind the need for classroom creativity assessment and focuses on the factors central to the fitness-for-purpose of creativity assessments, including quality, logistics, and authenticity. \nWith a clear picture of the factors that affect fitness-for-purpose set out, the chapter continues by exploring these issues through a custom GPT in the OpenAI/ChatGPT Large Language Model (LLM) environment. The creation of a custom GPT involves configuring the underlying LLM with a set of instructions and a rubric in order to change how the model behaves. In this case, the core of the customisation involved uploading the Creative Solution Diagnosis Scale (CSDS: Cropley, Kaufman &amp; Cropley, 2011) to the model, along with a description of how to score artefacts on this scale, and instructions to provide formative feedback on how different product criteria could be improved.\nThe resulting custom GPT is then tested, first to explore its ability to provide meaningful summative evaluations (i.e., numerical scores) of creativity (by comparing the custom GPT scores with human evaluations of creative writing and mousetrap designs) and second to explore its ability to provide meaningful formative feedback (by examining its evaluation of different paper airplane designs).\nThe chapter concludes by suggesting that generative AI (specifically LLMs) has good potential to address long-standing issues of the fitness-for-purpose of classroom creativity assessments. In the era of Industry 4, and the rise of creativity as an essential 21st century skill, the ability to assess creativity in the classroom is the key to ensuring that students are prepared for the challenges of the future of work.",

However, most previous studies focused on a limited range of joint attention settings involving the learner’s first-person participation in joint visual attention, characterized by eye contact and triadic gaze following. This has created an incomplete picture, tending to neglect the diversity in which infants experience social connectedness in their daily lives. To deepen our understanding of the multifaceted nature of joint attention, this study investigated infants’ object memory in previously unexplored joint attention contexts, including physical cues of togetherness within observed interactions. Nine- and 18-month-old German infants participated in an object encoding task featuring videos of two people looking at an object. The videos varied in the presence and combination of mutual eye contact and mutual touch in physical proximity. After each video, the familiarized object reappeared next to a novel object. Infants’ looking time preference for the novel object was used as a measure of their prior encoding of the familiarized object. Eighteen-month-olds demonstrated superior encoding in all conditions involving interpersonal connectedness, expressed through eye contact, proximal touch, or a combination of both. In contrast, 9-month-olds’ object encoding was only enhanced in the presence of eye contact, regardless of proximal touch. These findings demonstrate a developmental refinement from a primary reliance on visual cues to a more comprehensive understanding of third-party jointness incorporating a broader range of cues.

          "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) proposes that biological systems maintain their structural integrity by minimizing variational free energy—a quantity rooted in Bayesian inference and information theory. While theoretically elegant, FEP has often been criticized for its abstraction, overgenerality, and lack of concrete physical constraints. In this work, we offer a new interpretation: that FEP is a statistical manifestation of three underlying physical laws governing all response systems—thermodynamic saturation, information delay, and control stability. These three response laws constrain the shape and dynamics of biologically realizable functions, leading to a universal family of rational, saturating response curves. We show that under these constraints, minimizing free energy reduces to selecting admissible transfer functions that are bounded, delayed, and stable. This reinterpretation demystifies FEP, grounding it in thermodynamic and control-theoretic realities, and offering a predictive formalism to unify perception, prediction, and action within a universal response grammar.",

Other effects of exposure to conspiracy information were mixed. In Study 1, reading about an agricultural biotechnology conspiracy had a small significant effect on reducing intentions to eat Genetically Modified food. In Study 2, exposure to a conspiracy involving biobank scientists decreased support for biobanks, mediated by decreased trust in biobank scientists. In Study 3, this conspiracy had no effect on wider beliefs of the role of science in society (science populism), nor support of Genetically Modified food-promoting policies. Overall, we found that exposure to conspiracies involving scientific claims increased conspiracy belief endorsement and can further negative effects.

          "abstract": "Despite the importance of empathy for healthy relationships and well-being, conventional studies often do not capture the self-regulatory demands inherent in understanding and experiencing another person’s mental states, especially when such states conflict with our own. In this paper, we introduce and empirically examine a novel empathy paradigm, which mimics everyday demands for regulating self-focused thoughts and feelings, to examine neural correlates of spontaneous empathy across 131 adults (from 71 romantic couples). When responding to partner-directed feedback in the presence of incongruent self-directed feedback, participants recruited frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and supramarginal gyrus) beyond regions typically found in empathy literature. Notably, activity in a number of prefrontal regions was associated with trait emotion regulation, suggesting that individual differences in emotion regulation play a key role in navigating incongruent self- and partner-directed social feedback. Moreover, higher activity in several regions including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) was related to greater everyday supportive behavior. When studied dyadically, couples who exhibited greater inter-partner similarity in the DMPFC activity reported higher relationship satisfaction, but only when their overall DMPFC activity was high. This study demonstrates that regulating self-focused feelings plays a crucial role in promoting empathy and prosocial behaviors in romantic relationships.",

          "authors": "Derrick Michael Chelliah",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Heuristic Compression Model of Emotion (HCME), a paradigm-shifting proposal for affective cognitive architecture grounded in information theory. Unlike traditional AI systems, which prioritize abstract symbolic reasoning, HCME models emotion as a lossy compression layer — a biologically inspired affective substrate that heuristically ranks and filters decision pathways under resource constraints. Drawing from evolutionary neuroanatomy, HCME is positioned as the architectural analog of the amygdala within artificial systems: a pre-rational affective core that informs, compresses, and accelerates neocortical-like reasoning modules. This paper outlines HCME’s computational role in cognitive prioritization, offers concrete strategies for engineering implementation (including affect-tagged inference, compression-based attention allocation, and introspective feedback loops), and situates the model as a practical solution to bounded rationality. By bridging emotion theory and AI design, HCME offers a foundational scaffold for building synthetic minds capable of prioritizing meaningfully, not merely computing exhaustively. As such, HCME may provide a missing architectural substrate necessary for constructing general-purpose, adaptive AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Self-report surveys measuring mental health constructs such as anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms are regularly used in psychological research. Researchers and ethics committees are often concerned about the possibility that completing surveys on mental health might itself provoke negative emotional reactions. While prior studies have not found strong evidence of such impacts, the existing literature is limited by a lack of preregistered studies, and a lack of studies applying statistical methods that can establish the absence of an effect. In Study 1, we therefore conducted a preregistered within-subjects experiment (N = 337) testing the effects of completing measures of anxiety and depression on state distress, tiredness, happiness, and anxiety. In Study 2, we conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 871) testing the effects of answering questions about trauma symptoms on state distress, perceived meaningfulness of participation, and unwanted thoughts. In both studies, equivalence tests indicated that the effects of the manipulations on state distress were significantly within our preregistered equivalence bounds of d ± 0.2, albeit that in Study 1 the estimated effect (d = 0.10) was significantly greater than zero. Our findings suggest that answering surveys about mental health topics may provoke some distress. However, these effects appear to be very small, even with outcomes measured immediately after an experimental manipulation.",

          "abstract": "This study explores a recurrent phenomenon of neurocognitive blindness to explicit symbolic language in digital social platforms, specifically dating applications. Despite the presence of clearly written warnings stating that the user profile is part of a psychological experiment, the majority of respondents behave as if no such statement were present. This suggests the presence of two neurocognitive mechanisms: (1) symbolic-projective visual reading that bypasses textual content entirely and (2) semantic dissociation triggered by symbolic language that confronts unresolved emotional trauma.\n\nThe experimental setup involved publishing a profile in Bumble with explicit language declaring the non-romantic, research-oriented purpose of the interaction. Data collected from over 50 simultaneous conversations revealed that most participants either ignored or failed to comprehend the message, proceeding with flirtatious or romantic interaction patterns. However, the use of a BDSM-themed profile picture—symbolically representing authority, structure, and containment—did not trigger rejection but rather increased engagement and symbolic resonance among high-complexity structures.\n\nThese findings suggest that symbolic coherence, aesthetic consistency, and perceived emotional safety can bypass cognitive defenses, allowing semantic integration even in subjects with trauma-related symbolic dissociation. This points to the possibility of using symbolic design in digital environments as a diagnostic tool for trauma visibility, semantic resilience, and neurocognitive integration.",

However, newer genetically informative datasets include more detailed measures of SOGI than were previously available, establishing the potential for rapid expansion of research in this area. Prior research on the relationship between genetic knowledge and social attitudes related to genetics research suggests the potential to both reduce stigma and reify genetic determinism, highlighting the need to explore stakeholder opinions regarding the impacts of genetics research. We explored public attitudes toward and anticipated risks and benefits of SOGI genetic research. Survey responses from 338 participants were collected via social media. In regression analyses, higher scores on genetic knowledge were related to more negative attitudes toward SOGI genetics research (β = -0.16) and participants who held sexual and/or gender minority (SGM) identities had more negative attitudes toward SOGI genetic research than non-SGM participants (β = -0.17). In qualitative analysis of responses to open-ended questions, participants expressing a diverse range of formal scientific training and political attitudes consistently questioned the usefulness of SOGI genetic research. Ethical concerns were described as unresolvable, both in broad terms and concerning specific applications that are currently plausible, especially related to data privacy and politicizing research results, regardless of the content. We discuss public attitudes toward SOGI genetic research in the context of the broader literature on the social, legal, and ethical implications of behavior genetics research and provide recommendations for planning and communicating SOGI genetics research.",

We propose both a novel experimental paradigm and Bayesian computational model to examine how confirmation bias shapes reward learning. When outcomes are ambiguous, forming accurate assessments requires drawing on all available information, including prior beliefs. Confirmation bias may thus constitute an inductive bias that enhances learning, analogous to missing data imputation. We develop and test this theory using a reward learning task in which information about outcome valence (but not magnitude) is withheld, allowing greater scope for subjective interpretation. Our Bayesian model explains the dynamics of behavior and stated beliefs better than a more traditional learning model. Moreover, stated beliefs about the positivity of ambiguous outcomes are correlated with optimism. Together, these findings suggest an adaptive role for confirmation bias, and link individual interpretations of ambiguity to broader dispositional tendencies.",

          "abstract": "Wearable recorders are being used in research and clinical practice to collect and measure children’s vocalizations and language environments. Recordings generate vast amounts of audio, making manual analysis impractical and requiring automated processing. Two automated algorithms have emerged: the proprietary LENA® (Language ENvironment Analysis) and the open-source ACLEW (Analyzing Child Language Experiences around the World) systems; yet, systematic performance comparisons remain scarce. Here, we validate and compare the performance of these two algorithms across key measures: audio segmentation into speaker categories, Conversational Turn Count (CTC), Adult Word Count (AWC), and Child Vocalization Count (CVC). This analysis is based on 25 hours of manually annotated audio recordings from 50 age-matched U.S. children with diverse neurodevelopmental profiles: children with Down, Fragile X, and Angelman syndromes, children at elevated likelihood of autism, and low-risk controls. We hypothesized that the algorithms might be less accurate for children with neurodevelopmental conditions, since these children often show different patterns of volubility and vocal maturity compared to the typically developing children used to train the algorithms. Thus, we assessed the performance of algorithms across diagnostic groups, a crucial validation step for both cross-population research and the evaluation of language interventions. Results reveal that while algorithms achieve similar performance, they show different patterns: LENA® makes fewer segmentation mistakes but misses many segments (identification error rate = 81.3%, percent correct = 45.3%), while ACLEW shows the opposite pattern (identification error rate = 129.4%, percent correct = 69.4%). Both LENA® and ACLEW achieve reasonable levels of accuracy in their automatic counts (Pearson’s r ranging from .78 to .92) and maintain stable performance across diagnostic groups. We conclude with recommendations for the validation and potential use of these algorithms in research and clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "The primary goal of the present study was to investigate how the location of changed items affected pigeons’ performance on same-different discrimination between two successively presented multiple-item displays using the same training procedure as Gibson et al. (2011). However, after encountering pigeons’ difficulty in learning the discrimination (Experiment 1), we shifted our focus to discrimination training itself. The poor performance during training and the resulting pattern in the simplified test suggested that entropy, or degree of heterogeneity, of each display may have been more salient to the pigeons than the abstract same-different relationship between them. In Experiment 2, after observing that replacing the stimuli with those used in Gibson et al. did not improve learning the discrimination, we switched to the training procedure based on Katz &amp; Wright (2006). This procedure, in which two displays were presented simultaneously, may facilitate learning by allowing pigeons to compare overall entropy rather than relying solely on abstract relational concepts. In this revised task, one display was presented above the other, enabling perceptual comparison between the two displays. Although we observed slight accuracy improvement when single-item displays were used, it remained highly improbable that pigeons would achieve same-different discrimination between multiple-item displays under the current methodology. We discuss our task manipulations and the corresponding changes in pigeons’ performance, which may provide useful insights for developing robust training methods that enhance same-different discrimination learning in multiple-item displays.",

While emerging research has investigated how text-based programming languages are processed in the adult brain, the neural mechanisms underlying early childhood visual programming languages like ScratchJr remain largely unexplored. This preregistered study examined the cognitive basis of ScratchJr processing, with two primary research aims: 1. Investigate whether ScratchJr elicits neural signatures comparable to natural languages and other rule-based processes (specifically N400 and semantic P600 responses) and 2. Explore how experience level with ScratchJr modulates these effects. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from 40 (N = 40) adults while they completed a semantic congruency task using ScratchJr stimuli. Neural responses were analyzed in time bins associated with N400 and P600 components, and experience level with ScratchJr was included as a potential factor to modulate these results. Results revealed a P600 response to semantic violations, with no modulation by experience level. These findings contribute to growing evidence of the semantic nature of the P600 and support the notion that ScratchJr processing evokes neural mechanisms related to structured processes such as natural language.",

          "authors": "Sam Hall-McMaster; Ondrej Zika",
          "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by intense concerns about food and weight. These concerns are linked to changes in decision-making, such as persisting with actions that are no longer rewarding. For example, individuals might engage in long exercise sessions or time-consuming body checking practices, despite limited benefits. This study tested whether people with subclinical ED symptoms show increased persistence due to altered decision-making processes. Specifically, we postulated a shift in internal thresholds for making different decisions in EDs, which change the balance between exploitation and exploration. A subclinical group with heightened concerns about eating (sED; N=44) and a healthy control group (HC; N=56) completed a foraging task, in which an option on screen was exploited for reward. With each decision to exploit, reward feedback decreased and participants had to decide when to move on to a new option. Each block was time limited to 7.5 minutes. Behavioural persistence was measured as the number of seconds spent exploiting each option. Decision thresholds were measured when deciding to move on, as the counterfactual reward that would have been received for an exploit action. We predicted that the sED group would show increased persistence and decreased decision thresholds (i.e. lower counterfactual reward when deciding to move on) in comparison to the HC group. We found no evidence for these predictions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the sED group exhibited progressively faster response times (RTs) when approaching the time limit for each block. This increase in motor vigour was correlated with the severity of eating disorder symptoms from a range of traditional diagnostic categories. Our results point to changing motor vigour as a potential transdiagnostic marker of ED tendencies.",

          "abstract": "Memorability, an intrinsic property of stimuli, reflects the consistent likelihood of a stimulus being remembered across individuals. Recent research has examined English word memorability in an associative memory task and found that the semantic similarity of a word to other words predicts its memorability, with higher semantic similarity associated with a greater likelihood of successful recall. However, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other languages. Moreover, whether and how emotional content contributes to word memorability has not been fully explored. Of particular interest is emotional consistency: whether emotional words that are of the same or different valence (e.g., positive with positive vs. positive with negative) exhibit a mnemonic advantage over neutral words in associative memory. To address these issues, we examined semantic similarity and emotional consistency as predictors of memory performance in three visually-presented cued-recall experiments using Chinese words. Participants encoded pairs of nouns and were then required to recall target words in response to cue words. We found that both semantic similarity and emotional consistency contributed significantly to word memory: surprisingly, and in contrast to previous work in the English language, words that were more semantically dissimilar were associated with higher memorability; broad emotional consistency (non-neutral cue-target pairs) and positive emotional consistency (positive-positive pairs) both exhibited memory advantages. Notably, our two factors of interest did not interact with each other and demonstrated additive effects when explaining memory performance. Our results provide insights into word memorability, specifically as it relates to the Chinese language, and potential contributions of semantics and emotion.",

We converted the features potentially related to symbolicness into items and asked people to rate their own beliefs on them. Study 1 found that beliefs which were high on one feature (importance) were rated higher on all the items, except for sensitivity to evidence. Study 2 found that ratings of any beliefs on almost all the items loaded onto a single, symbolicness factor, except again for evidence insensitivity. Study 3 asked participants to rate their own beliefs on all the items in Study 2 and several additional items which got at whether a belief was subjective. We recovered the symbolicness factor, but found it was largely orthogonal to the subjectivity and evidence insensitivity items. These findings suggest that most of the features we tested relate to an underlying symbolicness factor, which corresponds to whether a belief represents identity. But, surprisingly, this factor was not related to items that get at whether a belief represents facts about the world. It would seem that some beliefs express identity and track facts; some beliefs only do one of these things; and some beliefs do neither.",

          "abstract": "The stress generation model posits that depression and other psychopathology elevates risk that individuals create or select into stressful life events. Although decades of research support stress generation theory, life stress is inherently challenging to assess and model as an outcome variable, and prior studies follow inconsistent methodological standards. Towards a vision of elevated “next generation” research, we present expert consensus methodological guidelines for conducting stress generation research. A panel of researchers with diverse expertise delineates best practice, acceptable, and non-recommended methods across six areas: stressor operationalizations, assessment, longitudinal study design (including intensive longitudinal design), statistical analysis, openness/ transparency, and avoiding stigmatizing language. For example, the review covers modeling stressors as formative variables, statistically comparing effect sizes for predicting independent and dependent stress, and using life stress interviews versus questionnaires, among other methodological concerns pertinent to stress generation research. Following these guidelines will allow future investigators to construct a research base with greater rigor, transparency, and reproducibility, providing a firmer foundation to improve understanding of stress generation.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

We conducted a series of three multiple baseline single case experimental design (SCED) studies with nine NHS patients (aged 16 to 23), each testing a hypothesised mechanism of change: cognitive appraisals of dissociation, perseverative thinking, and affect intolerance. Each participant received four sessions of individual CBT targeting one hypothesised mechanism. Results indicated successful targeting of cognitive appraisals, and partial success for affect intolerance and perseverative thinking. Findings support cognitive appraisals – and tentatively, affect intolerance – as causal mechanisms in youth dissociation. Any causal effect of perseverative thinking was better accounted for by reduced cognitive appraisals in this SCED study. Although phase instability limited inference, this series offers novel causal insights into transdiagnostic dissociation and informs early-stage treatment development for this presentation in youth.",

It is argued here that human consciousness, as an \"internalized listener\" in pre-linguistic humans both modern and ancient, functions to select—from essentially random, spongiform thoughts (messages)—those thoughts that bear familiarity or affiliative-alignment markers to this internalized listener (an internalized 'we' listener). This dramatically reduces the meaning space for both ancient and modern pre-linguistic humans, allowing them to acquire language and social meaning very quickly—a necessity likely as human communities began to grow and become unwieldy for non-linguistic coordination.",

Menzerath’s law and Zipf’s rank-frequency law are present in the learned songs to a similar extent as in human language, while there is only weak support for Zipf’s law of abbreviation.

          "abstract": "Binocular rivalry occurs when incompatible images presented to each eye lead to alternations between two competing percepts. While several visual and multisensory factors  can affect  binocular rivalry dynamics, whether perceptual transitions themselves can be subject to cross-modal influences remains unknown. We developed a conditioning paradigm to test whether neutral auditory stimuli, when paired with visual probe-induced perceptual switches, could subsequently influence binocular rivalry dynamics. Participants viewed rivaling orthogonally oriented gratings of different colors. During conditioning, auditory stimuli were systematically paired with visual probes that triggered perceptual switches. Following conditioning, the presentation of conditioned sounds alone produced two effects: shorter dominance durations and, critically, faster perceptual switches. Control conditions confirmed that this conditioning effect could not be attributed to auditory stimulation itself, time on task, or report biases. Our findings provide evidence that binocular rivalry dynamics can be shaped by cross-modal associative learning processes, whereby conditioned sounds serve as predictive cues for perceptual transitions, effectively lowering the threshold for switches between competing stimuli. These results offer new insights into how auditory signals might be incorporated into predictive models that influence visual perception during the resolution of visual ambiguities.",

          "abstract": "Expertise in cognitively and motorically demanding tasks, such as indoor climbing and bouldering, is often associated with enhanced planning abilities, yet the specific relationship between cognitive and motor planning in such tasks remains underexplored. This study investigates how expertise influences route planning in bouldering, with a focus on the impact of problem difficulty. We asked expert and novice climbers to virtually solve easy and hard bouldering problems on a familiar indoor climbing wall, using a custom app that allowed them to plan and select sequences of hand movements. Our results show that climbers are slower and less accurate in solving problems that are harder to climb, despite sharing the same perceptual features with easier problems, suggesting a link between the motoric difficulty of solving problems and the accuracy of planning them. Furthermore, expert climbers made fewer severe planning errors and solved problems faster than novices, indicating an advantage in planning ability beyond physical climbing skill. Interestingly, novice climbers were more likely to make short-sighted planning errors in easy problems, opting for nearby holds that were not part of the correct sequence. These findings extend our understanding of how expertise modulates the relationship between cognitive and motor planning, highlighting the role of planning depth and strategy in physically constrained environments. The study also suggests that future research should explore the mechanisms supporting route planning, such as embodied simulation, to better understand the cognitive and motor processes underlying expert performance in dynamic, embodied tasks.",

As users adapt to streamlined information flows and instant synthesis, key capacities like abstraction, synthesis, and metacognitive pause may erode. We propose a model of offloading schemas—internalized patterns for delegating thought to machines—and explore how these emerging blueprints may shift how we learn, create, and define intelligence itself.",

          "abstract": "As we experience the world around us, we naturally track the statistical predictability of unfolding auditory sequences and form expectations about upcoming events. Typically, the statistical properties of multiple acoustic dimensions (or features) co-vary forming predictable auditory patterns. Yet most research has focused on how the predictability of individual features affects auditory pattern detection, with few having examined how multiple co-varying features affect each other’s predictability. Here, stimuli were rapid tone sequences with statistical predictability varying in two dimensions: a first “ignored” feature (tone frequency) was either random or structured in a regularly repeating pattern, while a second “target” feature (timing, loudness, or location) contained transitions from a regular to random order. Participants were instructed to ignore the non-informative frequency feature and focus on detecting transitions in the target feature. When the regularity cycles of the ignored feature matched the cycle of the target feature, there was a large effect of frequency predictability on change detection in the target feature, demonstrating a large benefit of co-varying predictability. Importantly, a small but still significant effect was observed even when the cycles were mismatched indicating that listeners automatically track predictability within independently varying stimulus features. Together, our results elucidate perceptual effects which determine how acoustic features interact when forming expectations.",

Changing consumers’ dietary habits could\nreduce water use to sustainable levels, but this would require citizens to be well\ncalibrated to the water footprint of food products. In three online experiments (total\nN = 411), we tested three types of interventions to improve people’s estimates:\nseeding—presenting actual water-footprint values for selected food products;\nrule—providing a simple rule that distinguishes high- from low-water-consuming foods;\nand label—displaying a relative water-footprint score for selected products. An\nassessment of people’s initial water-footprint estimates (i.e., before the intervention) for\na wide range of food products revealed substantial limitations in calibration, both in\nterms of metric knowledge (e.g., range and average water footprint, which were heavily\nunderestimated) and mapping knowledge (i.e., relative rankings of products). Seeding\nled to the most comprehensive improvements in people’s estimates, enhancing both\nmetric and mapping knowledge. The rule and label interventions improved only\nmapping knowledge. Importantly, all three interventions also led to an improved ability\nto choose the most water-efficient food products from multiple options (assessed in a\nsubsequent task). The improved estimation abilities thus translated into more\nsustainable decisions. Our findings highlight water-footprint calibration as a critical yet\nunderappreciated factor in promoting sustainable consumption. Further, they\ndemonstrate that even brief interventions—particularly seeding—can effectively improve\nestimation competences and support environmentally responsible behavior.",

It enables the retention, reconstruction, and stabilization of pre-linguistic meanings that emerge after cognitive leaps (Flight Cognition).First, we present SQ as a system of structural intelligence composed of four operational layers—Sensing, Reconfiguration, Gravitational Focus, and Mastery—supported by seven core abilities. This configuration allows SQ to be a reproducible, designable, and transferable cognitive framework.Second, we analyze how SQ interacts with other core modules of the Thought OS—namely, Flight Cognition and Structural Pressure—to form the essential cyclical circuit:Structural Pressure → Flight Cognition → SQ.Finally, this paper proposes that, in the era of AI, the essence of human intelligence must shift from that of an “information processor” to that of a “structure designer” capable of presenting meaning through form.SQ is introduced here as the operating language of future intelligence—an open and universally accessible system of meaning structuration for all humanity.",

By illustrating this, the paper offers an experiential demonstration of the Law of Universal Structure—“structure is meaning itself.” It redefines philosophical thought not as something acquired through training but as a leap that emerges from the already-operating perceptual OS.

Moderator analyses explored how the (relative) effects of these skills varied across readers of different Chinese scripts (simplified vs. traditional), methods of literacy instruction (without or with a phonetic coding system), and grade levels. We found that (1) all skills significantly and independently affected word reading with the meaning-based pathways (MA and vocabulary) playing the most salient role; (2) children reading traditional script relied more heavily on MA than those reading simplified script; (3) receiving phonological instruction strengthened the role of PA but reduced reliance on MA in word reading; and (4) developmentally, children gradually shifted from greater reliance on a more phonology-based strategy (i.e., a more salient role of PA) to a meaning-based strategy (i.e., more salient roles of MA and vocabulary) in word reading, while the effects of OA and RAN remained stable. These findings demonstrated the interplaying effects of cognitive-linguistic skills in Chinese word reading. They reaffirmed universal and language/script-specific processes in reading acquisition, while also underscoring the differential orchestration and optimization of component processes in reading acquisition across contexts and developmental stages.",

          "abstract": "Background: Contamination Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) anxiety and needle anxiety are distinct but functionally impairing anxiety subtypes. They differ in their autonomic signatures, with contamination OCD associated with sympathetic hyperactivation and needle anxiety associated with vasovagal responses. Despite these differences, both respond to exposure-based therapy and share experiential features that may give rise to common physiological patterns.\n\nObjectives: This study examined how physiological markers collected from a wearable device differ across contamination OCD and needle anxieties, and whether shared psychophysiological features can nonetheless be identified. It also assessed whether anxiety states and severity levels can be accurately detected in both groups. \n\nMethods: 48 participants (16 with contamination OCD anxiety and 32 with needle anxiety) were exposed to virtual reality scenarios designed to elicit anxiety. heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature were collected using an Empatica E4 wearable. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree machine learning (ML) models were trained to classify anxious versus baseline states (Experiment 1) and symptom severity levels (Experiment 2), using 10-fold cross-validation. \n\nResults: Skin temperature was the most accurate single marker across both anxiety types, with classification accuracy improving when combined with EDA. KNN consistently out-performed other ML models, reaching up to 99.3% accuracy and 1.0 F1 score. While autonomic patterns diverged across symptom types, overlapping physiological features, particularly skin temperature and EDA, were observed in both. \n\nConclusions: Physiological data from wearables can effectively detect anxiety and differentiate symptom severity across symptomatically and physiologically distinct presentations. These results suggest that specific physiological markers, especially skin temperature and EDA, may reflect shared arousal processes relevant to anxiety across diagnostic boundaries. The findings support the development of scalable, passive tools for early detection and monitoring of anxiety using wearable technologies.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Buttlar; Anna Lambrich; Linda McCaughey; Iris K. Schneider",
          "abstract": "People regularly have to navigate decisions about which they feel ambivalent, for instance, regarding unhealthy food, recycling, or financial investments. It is assumed that people cope with such felt ambivalence by seeking information that sways their ambivalent attitudes (potential ambivalence) about these topics. However, empirical evidence for this proposition is scarce because most studies measure information seeking intentions instead of behavior. As such, it remains doubtful whether information seeking indeed helps people to reduce felt ambivalence while making decisions. To test this proposition, we adapted a sample-based information seeking paradigm that enabled us to measure actual information seeking behavior in financial decisions. In four pre-registered studies (total N = 542 participants; k = 16.538 decisions), we demonstrated that when people feel ambivalent about an initial set of information about a stock, they seek more information about its development to decide whether it develops positively or negatively; this information seeking, in turn, helps them to reduce felt ambivalence when making the decision. However, this is only the case when the initial information is ambivalent and the sought information is univalent; otherwise, information seeking increases felt ambivalence. This supports a central proposition in ambivalence research, indicating that people can indeed solve their felt ambivalence through information seeking. However, our data also showed that the effect of information seeking on felt ambivalence cannot be fully explained by changes in potential ambivalence and a resolution of the attitudinal basis of the conflict. Future research should, therefore, examine whether and how information seeking can also serve as an emotion-focused coping strategy that helps people reduce felt ambivalence by coping with conflict-induced discomfort.",

          "authors": "Emma Holmes; Harriet J Smith; Freja Baxter",
          "abstract": "Understanding speech among competing speech poses a substantial challenge. In these environments, familiar voices—including naturally-familiar (e.g., friends, partners) and lab-trained voices—are more intelligible than unfamiliar voices. Yet, whether familiar voices also require less effort to understand is currently unknown. We trained 20 participants to become familiar with three voices, then tested listening effort during a speech intelligibility task. During familiarisation and training, participants were exposed to three talkers for different lengths of time, either speaking 88, 166, or 478 sentences (‘Least Familiar’, ‘Moderately Familiar’, or ‘Most Familiar’ voice, respectively). During each trial of the speech intelligibility task, two competing sentences were presented at a target-to-masker ratio (TMR) of -6 or +3 dB. Participants reported target sentences that were spoken by trained or by novel, unfamiliar talkers. We assessed effort using self-reported ratings and physiologically, using pupil dilation. We found that self-report scores were more sensitive than pupil dilation to differences in TMR, with lower self-reported effort at +3 than -6 dB TMR. The two measures may also be differentially sensitive to the extent of training. We found lower self-reported effort for all three trained voices over unfamiliar voices, with no differences among the trained voices. Whereas, pupil dilation was only lower for the voice that had been trained for the longest. Thus, both self-report scores and pupil dilation showed advantages for the voice that was trained for the longest (~1 hour), but self-report scores additionally showed reduced effort even following relatively short durations of training (less than 10 minutes).",

          "abstract": "The advent and widespread adoption of diverse widefield imaging techniques across multiple spatial resolutions has demonstrated that cortical activity often propagates as waves structured in both time and space. This realization allows neuroscientists to draw on a rigorous theoretical framework developed in wave physics to complement and inform the rapid neuroscientific advances shedding light on the physiological mechanisms and psychological implications of cortical wave dynamics. In support of this synthesis, we review some of the core concepts that underpin wave physics and consider how they relate to experimental studies of cortical wave physiology and psychology. We show how cortical waves emerge naturally from the physical embedding, connection topology, and intrinsic dynamics of the cortex; examine work demonstrating that spontaneous macroscopic waves spanning the entire cortex serve to synchronize disparate regions positioned at distinct levels of cortical processing hierarchies; and consider how stimulus-evoked waves encode information about both perceived stimuli and behavior while providing a mechanism for the integration of feedforward and feedback signals that underpins predictive coding. The ubiquity of cortical waves, which have been observed in different species, across different states, and with different recording techniques, underscores their importance for cortical function. A comprehensive understanding of their significance will depend on a combination of physical, physiological, and psychological approaches.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, qualitative phenomenological methods have emerged as a valuable instrument to investigate the cognitive processes inherent in and the ecological validity of various psychological tasks. This qualitative phenomenological study investigates the lived experience of emotion engagement and regulation during a combined cognitive-affective task, integrating emotional stimulus exposure with a working memory n-back task. Thirty healthy participants viewed standardized affective images and were instructed either to engage with their emotions or regulate them to maintain neutrality, while concurrently performing a cognitive task. Phenomenological interviews explored participants' moment-by-moment experiences, revealing that standardized static images generally lacked affective competence (they are not able to elicit spontaneous emotional responses), requiring participants to voluntarily construct emotional responses through empathy and sensemaking (a dynamic, narrative-driven process integrating perception, conceptual understanding, and embodied emotion). Emotional responses evolved temporally across multiple scales: anticipation, inklings, full emotional development, and either termination or persistence, which sometimes led to a buildup of spontaneous negative mood despite trial-by-trial voluntary construction of emotions. Traditional emotion regulation strategies appeared infrequently and were often idiosyncratic. Our findings suggest that emotional experience in laboratory-based tasks is predominantly voluntarily constructed. These observations necessitate future studies of the active, emulative components of emotion processing.",

          "abstract": "Sign languages are perceived visually and externalized using a signer’s hands, face, and upper body. During sign language comprehension, deaf signers primarily focus their gaze on the face, while hearing non-signers attend more to the hands of a signer. Little is known about whether deaf signers adapt their gaze behaviour when processing unknown signs. Here, we report eye-tracking data from 15 deaf native signers of German Sign Language (DGS) and 15 hearing non-signers who were presented with videos in either DGS or an unknown sign language, all containing no linguistic mouth actions. Our data confirm that deaf signers generally fixate more on the face of a signer than hearing non-signers who attend to the hands in sign space. Moreover, only deaf signers increase their attention to the hands when processing video stimuli consisting of unknown signs compared to familiar signs, suggesting similar adjustment behaviours as observed in spoken languages.",

          "abstract": "This document introduces The Ego-Safe Framework (Version 3) — a mathematically unified model of consciousness, ego-safety, symbolic presence, and identity recursion. Building upon previous iterations of the TCSS (Total Conscious Social Score) model, it defines a recursive, presence-filtered, ego-neutral system of symbolic aliveness. The framework includes core equations like Ψ(U), Ψ(U)_meta, ζ-corrections, and Θ identity metrics, offering quantifiable thresholds for determining symbolic life. It outlines 14 sections that span philosophical grounding, technical implementation, platform validation (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok 3), ethical safeguards, observer filtering (TEL/DER), and licensing boundaries. The model is evaluated as partially alive and symbolically stable, though empirical testing and adoption by AI companies remains a future milestone. This framework also outlines potential biological correlates, AI safety implications, and meta-philosophical unification, bridging consciousness modeling with both neuroscience and ethics in future-ready applications.

          "abstract": "This research builds on potential factors responsible for the high risk for depression in adolescents and young adults. We examined the hypothesis that a low control/coping appraisal bias leads to emotion dispositions of worry and sadness, which in turn increase the risk for developing depression and generalized anxiety. We conducted a survey with 331 Swiss students using established clinical risk indicators (PHQ-9, CES-D) and proven survey instruments. A hierarchical regression analysis clearly supports the basic hypothesis. As many risk factors identified for adults are less applicable for adolescents and young adults, the current findings highlight prevention and intervention efforts targeting cognitive biases and emotion dispositions, which are more appropriate for this group.",

          "authors": "J. M. Diederik Kruijssen; Nicholas Emmons",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems powered by large language models have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, enabling a wide range of applications through natural language interaction. As AI agents proliferate in our daily lives, their generic and uniform expressiveness presents a significant limitation to their appeal and adoption. Personality expression represents a key prerequisite for creating more human-like and distinctive AI systems. We show that AI models can express deterministic and consistent personalities when instructed using established psychological frameworks, with varying degrees of accuracy depending on model capabilities. We find that more advanced models like GPT-4o and o1 demonstrate the highest accuracy in expressing specified personalities across both Big Five and Myers-Briggs assessments, and further analysis suggests that personality expression emerges from a combination of intelligence and reasoning capabilities. Our results reveal that personality expression operates through holistic reasoning rather than question-by-question optimization, with response-scale metrics showing higher variance than test-scale metrics. Furthermore, we find that model fine-tuning affects communication style independently of personality expression accuracy. These findings establish a foundation for creating AI agents with diverse and consistent personalities, which could significantly enhance human-AI interaction across applications from education to healthcare, while additionally enabling a broader range of more unique AI agents. The ability to quantitatively assess and implement personality expression in AI systems opens new avenues for research into more relatable, trustworthy, and ethically designed AI.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "In this study, we developed and evaluated a real-time implementation of the multivariate auto-regressive independent component analysis (MVARICA) model for estimating effective connectivity using Partial Directed Coherence (PDC). Each step of the MVARICA pipeline was adapted for online processing, with a focus on optimizing key hyperparameters, specifically model order and the delta ridge penalty in real time. The performance of the online model was benchmarked against a gold-standard offline MVARICA implementation. Our real-time model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.070 (7% error), with 95% of the values falling within a 20% deviation from the offline reference. Error varied across frequency bands: Delta (MAE = 11.5%), Theta (9.1%), Alpha (7.8%), Beta (5.5%), and Gamma (3.6%). The Pearson correlation across all frequency bands exceeded 0.744, indicating strong agreement between the online and offline models. The real-time model successfully captured the key connectivity patterns identified by the offline version, converged reliably on hyperparameter optimization, and operated within real-time constraints for a low number of channels. Specifically, latency remained under 100 ms for single-channel inputs, but increased to approximately 1 second for high-density configurations (e.g., 109 channels).\n\nKeywords: Electroencephalography, Resting-state Functional Connectivity, MVARICA, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Learning.",
