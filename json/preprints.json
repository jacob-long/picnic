          "abstract": "The rigorous treatment of uncertainties in global environmental assessments is essential to characterise the scientific state of the art and to inform policy. Recognizing this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has adopted a standardized assessment framework to promote transparency and consistency in reporting the level of confidence in its key findings — most prominently those featured in the Summary for Policymakers. However, applying this framework is challenging and often leads to confidence statements based on expert judgment rather than a transparent and replicable process. Here we recommend an updated framework for assessing uncertainties that is suitable for lines of quantitative ex-post policy evaluation evidence that inform Working Group II and III reports. The framework uses evidence synthesized from systematic reviews to support robust and transparent confidence statements and to provide a clear and traceable rationale for conclusions. Where such synthesized evidence is lacking, we offer practical guidance and outline intermediary steps for improving confidence assessments. Our approach provides a concrete and replicable pathway to enhance the level of transparency and the reliability of scientific assessments that inform climate policy.",

          "abstract": "Scientific knowledge is represented by approximately 3.3 million new journal articles each year and is expanding at an unprecedented pace, increasing in total size by 59% between 2012 and 2022 [1]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide a structured means of evidence synthesis, but they are slow and labor-intensive, often requiring more than a year to complete. This bottleneck constrains scientific progress and is especially consequential in contexts such as public health crises (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), where timely evidence is essential for guiding policy and practice [2, 3]. Here we show that artificial intelligence methods can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of systematic reviews. Using diverse datasets and examining over 30,000 data points, our AI-assisted approach matched or exceeded human performance while greatly reducing the risk of overlooking relevant evidence. In multiple tests of screening performance, the AI achieved 97.2% sensitivity and 96.84% specificity. With respect to extraction, the AI obtained 96.96% extraction accuracy, outperforming human efforts, and completed tasks up to 99% faster. These results demonstrate that AI augmentation can enable more timely and comprehensive evidence synthesis, facilitate living systematic reviews, and better support researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in responding to fast-moving scientific developments. Integrating AI into evidence synthesis represents a decisive advance in the accumulation of scientific knowledge.",

          "abstract": "In the classical theory of analogical reasoning, mappings between discrete symbols are a central mechanism in analogy evaluation and transfer. In this study several other analogy evaluation strat-egies are identified in expert think aloud protocols: bridging analogies, conserving transformations, dual simulations used to detect perceptual-motor similarity, and overlay simulations. These findings add to evidence for the hypothesis that analogical reasoning processes can be imagery based.",

          "title": "@Grok Is This True? LLM-Powered Fact-Checking on Social Media",
          "authors": "Thomas Renault; Mohsen Mosleh; David Gertler Rand",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded directly into social media platforms, enabling users to request real-time fact-checks of online content. Using an exhaustive dataset of 1,671,841 English-language fact-checking requests made to Grok and Perplexity on X between February and September 2025, we provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of how LLM-based fact-checking operates in the wild. Fact-checking requests comprise 7.6% of all interactions with the LLM bots, and focus primarily on politics, economics, and current events. We document clear partisan asymmetries in usage. Users requesting fact-checks from Grok are much more likely to be Republican than Democratic, while the opposite is true for fact-check requests from Perplexity -- indicating emerging polarization in attitudes toward specific AI models. At the same time, both Democrats and Republicans are more likely to request fact-checks on posts authored by Republicans, and - consistent with prior work using professional fact-checkers and crowd judgments - posts from Republican-leaning accounts are more likely to be rated as inaccurate by both LLMs. Across posts rated by both LLM bots, evaluations from Grok and Perplexity agree 52.6% of the time and strongly disagree (one party rates a claim as true and the other as false) 13.6% of the time. For a sample of 100 fact-checked posts, 54.5% of Grok bot ratings and 57.7% of Perplexity bot ratings agreed with ratings of human fact-checkers, which is significantly lower than the inter-fact-checker agreement rate of 64.0%; but API-access versions of Grok had higher agreement with fact-checkers than did not significantly differ from inter-fact-checker agreement. Finally, in a preregistered survey experiment with 1,592 U.S. participants, exposure to LLM fact-checks meaningfully shifts belief accuracy, with effect sizes comparable to those observed in studies of professional fact-checking. However, responses to Grok fact-checks are polarized by partisanship when model identity is disclosed, whereas responses to Perplexity are not. Together, these findings show that LLM-based fact-checking is rapidly scaling, is generally informative although far from perfect, while also becoming entangled with polarization and partisanship. Our work highlights both the promise and the risks of integrating AI fact-checking into online public discourse.",

          "authors": "Namkje Koudenburg; Hedy Greijdanus; Cristiana Angelini",
          "abstract": "Confrontation of sexism can entail individual costs and backlash. Across three experiments (N = 495), conducted in various countries and gender-equality contexts, we examined whether humorous confrontation (compared with serious and non-confrontation) can challenge sexism while preserving intragroup relationships and status. Using vignette studies, small-group videos, and actual text-based chat conversations, and including a baseline condition with no information on confrontation, we disentangled potential negative effects of serious confrontation from positive effects of humorous confrontation. Contrary to predictions, neither confrontation type reliably reduced perceptions of sexist norms (H1). However, across all three studies, humorous confrontation consistently repaired threats to women's standing (H2) while maintaining group cohesion (H3), and preserving the offender’s status. Together, these findings shift the focus from individual-level benefits and costs to group-level consequences of confrontation, broadening conceptions of effectiveness beyond norm change and personal backlash risks to include the preservation of group functioning.",

          "authors": "NA; Amanda Kay Montoya; Samantha F. Anderson",
          "abstract": "Moderated mediation models are commonly used in psychological research and other academic fields to model when and how effects occur. Researchers must choose which paths in the mediation model are moderated when specifying this type of model. While the ultimate goal is to specify the model correctly, researchers may struggle to determine whether to err on the side of including too many moderated paths (maximalist approach) or including too few moderated paths (minimalist approach). This registered report examines how the specification of moderation impacts statistical power, type I error rate, and parameter bias for the index of moderated mediation. In a systematic review of papers published using moderated mediation over the course of one year, we found that six model specifications account for 85\\% of published moderated mediation analyses and the median sample size was 285. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the impacts of model specification on power and type I error rate, and results were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression. In reference to the data-generating process, the data analysis model can either be correctly specified, over-specified, under-specified, or completely misspecified. Over-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power to detect a significant index of moderated mediation compared to correctly specified models and relatively low parameter bias. Under-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power than correctly specified models but unacceptably high parameter bias. Completely misspecified models were hypothesized to have inflated type I error rates and unacceptable parameter bias. Based on these results we recommend researchers lean more toward maximalist approaches to avoid parameter bias, but acknowledge that this comes with a cost in statistical power.",

          "authors": "Rajarshi Majumder; Ignazio Ziano; Robert Mai",
          "abstract": "During inflationary periods, consumers tend to focus on nominal price changes when making consumption decisions, often overlooking the changes in their real purchasing power, a phenomenon known as money illusion. What do consumers think when comparing how they and other consumers make decisions under inflation? Consumers might believe they make economically better decisions than others. However, consumers fail to realize that their choices are more distorted by money illusion than they expect others’ decisions to be. This research uncovers a consequential disconnect: the imprint of money illusion on consumers’ decisions persists despite consumers asserting to prioritize real over nominal value, more so than they believe others do. In nine studies (N = 3075), the self-other difference in the money illusion effect is examined across different decision contexts (buying, selling, salary evaluation). Results show that these self-other differences are more nuanced, varying based on (i) the type of economic decision (pronounced in buying decisions and attenuated in selling decisions) and (ii) the temporal reference point (evident when considering the inflation effect retrospectively and attenuated when considering it prospectively). This research extends the social comparison literature into the domain of inflation, with findings that inform price-setting decisions and perceptions of job appeal.",

          "authors": "María Villaplana García; Aida Pérez Fernández; Guillermo Soriano Tarín; Alejandro Ríos Oruña; Juan Carlos Onieva; David Gallardo-Pujol",
          "abstract": "The concept of work ability has generated much interest in the scientific literature. However, there are still certain aspects that remain unclear with regard to this concept's dimensions and how it interacts with other variables. The goal of this study was to systematically review studies that analyzed predictors of perceived mental work ability, based on the theoretical framework of the job demands-resources model (JD-R) and the European Framework for Psychosocial Risk Management PRIMA-EF. Moreover, we also analyzed whether the studies selected for evaluation addressed work ability as a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. Searches were performed in the Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycInfo and PsyArXiv databases with a ten-year limit. Of a total of 1811 potentially eligible studies, 77 were selected based on the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that the studies conceptualized this construct as perceived work ability and did not include the term mental in their definitions. Of the variables analyzed, those related to personal resources and workplace resources predicted greater perceived work ability. Conversely, age, job demands, psychosocial risks and the absence of both personal and workplace resources were negative predictors. However, with regards to age, positive relations were found when the mental dimension of perceived work ability was analyzed separately. It is noteworthy how limited the body of research is on some personal variables (personality traits and emotional states, aptitudes and physical/cognitive performance, and psychological capital) and attitudinal variables (satisfaction and commitment), as well as certain job and workplace characteristics (industry, job type, type of contract, and type of workday). Finally, an elevated percentage of studies analyzed perceived work ability as a unidimensional construct, resulting in a less precise evaluation of this concept. Practical implications and future lines of research were also addressed.",

          "abstract": "In the Final Position Judgement Task, participants imagine performing auditorily instructed movements and compare their imagined final position with a visual stimulus. Although participants are instructed to imagine the visual and kinesthetic sensations associated with the movements, they may verbally rehearse the instructions rather than generating an imagery, manipulating it according to the instructions, maintaining it, and subsequently inspecting it. To examine the involvement of action imagery and verbal rehearsal, participants completed the Final Position Judgement Task once in a baseline condition and once under articulatory suppression in a within-subjects design. The involvement of action imagery and verbal rehearsal was evaluated based on self-reported strategy use, associations with working memory components and behavioral measures of action imagery ability, as well as task performance. Accuracy in final position judgements was related to visuospatial sketchpad capacity but unrelated to phonological loop capacity. Most participants relied on visual rehearsal, whereas verbal rehearsal served a supporting role but did not benefit performance in final position judgements. Articulatory suppression appeared to impair action imagery rather than enhancing its use. Together, these findings support the use of the Final Position Judgement Task as an objective measure of action imagery ability, provided open-source alongside the manuscript.",

          "abstract": "The Cybernetic Theory of Character (CTC), proposed by Marian Mazur, offers a unique framework for understanding personality. Despite its significance, empirical research on CTC is limited, and no validated tool exists to assess its core assumptions. This study aimed to evaluate CTC's principles using the newly developed Character Dynamism Questionnaire (CDQ) and compare it with the Regulative Theory of Temperament. A total of 211 participants completed the CDQ, with 111 of them also completing the Formal Characteristics of Behaviour – Temperament Questionnaire, Revised Version. Analyses included statistical methods, artificial neural networks, and cluster analysis. Character profiles were consistent with CTC's theoretical assumptions. Most CDQ scales showed good reliability (α &gt; 0.7), except for endodynamism (α = 0.561). Analysis supported accurate prediction of dynamism levels based on character profiles. However, results related to age were inconsistent. Temperament correlated with dynamism only partially and with low to moderate strength. The findings support CTC's assumptions, distinguish it from temperament traits, and indicate that the CDQ is a generally reliable tool. Further refinement of the endodynamism scale and investigation into the link between dynamism and age are needed.",

          "abstract": "Cash transfers are a common poverty alleviation intervention, yet qualitative reports of recipients’ lived experiences are limited. To address this gap, we analyzed 77 in-depth interviews with cash transfer recipients and their household members in rural Malawi and Lesotho. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we created four themes: 1) cash transfers help address basic needs but are not enough for structural change, 2) grandmothers share cash transfers within intergenerational networks of care, 3) cash transfers bring psychological relief and restore dignity, but difficulty and uncertainty in obtaining them create stress, and 4) stigma and jealousy arise from community perceptions about the deservingness of ‘sky-falling’ and ‘satanic’ money. Recipients consistently noted improvement in food security, while effects on mental health and social relationships were more mixed. We argue that recipient-centered reports complement and strengthen quantitative evidence about the impacts and mechanisms of cash transfers. We discuss specific policy recommendations, such as larger and more predictable payments, better communication, and sensitive disbursement options, gender-sensitive support, and more active monitoring of psychosocial and community effects in order to mitigate potential negative impacts. Finally, we argue there is a need for a more ambitious focus on development as the key path to poverty eradication.",

          "authors": "Paul Hoffman",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Coherent speech remains focused on the topic at hand, avoiding irrelevant or tangential comments. Discourse coherence often declines with age and this has been linked to declines in cognitive control processes that regulate activation of knowledge and ideas. The present study tested whether external topic reminders could improve coherence by reducing reliance on internal control processes.\nMethods: 77 young and older adults produced spoken discourse in response to topic prompts. In the baseline condition, the topic prompt was removed when the participant began speaking. This was compared with conditions where a reminder was presented on screen, either throughout their response or only during the last 30 seconds.\nResults: Both age groups produced more coherent, topic-focused responses when they had access to a topic reminder. Late reminders had an additional proactive impact on participants’ speech, increasing its coherence even before the reminder appeared. This proactive effect was short-lived in the older group but more sustained in the young group.\nDiscussion: When speaking, people must maintain the current discourse goal (i.e., intended topic), in order to prioritise relevant information and inhibit irrelevant ideas. Topic reminders boost activation of the discourse goal, reducing the need to maintain this through internal control. Furthermore, people proactively strengthened goal activation when they anticipated a later reminder, but older people were less effective at maintaining this throughout their response. Together, these results suggest that internal maintenance of discourse goals is less effective in older people, though they do benefit from external cues that support topic maintenance.",

          "authors": "Ana Belen Carbajal Chavez; Eline Van Geert; Johan Wagemans; Yaniv Morgenstern",
          "abstract": "Shape processing is crucial for higher-level visual functions such as object recognition. Yet, isolating high-level vision from low-level shape influences remains challenging. Typically, studies rely on simple, symmetric stimuli and labor-intensive psychophysical measurements to control for perceptual shape similarity. However, natural objects are often asymmetric, and researchers currently lack efficient methods or validated stimulus sets for these complex shapes. Here, we present an image-based method that autonomously generates perceptually uniform shape sets composed of novel, asymmetric, animal-like shapes. We focus on circular shape spaces, where the angular distance between two shapes corresponds to their perceived similarity. Our method employs a search for circular arrangements of shapes that maximize perceptual uniformity according to ShapeComp, an image-computable shape similarity metric based on 100+ descriptors that is highly predictive of human shape similarity for naturalistic shapes. Through multi-arrangement experiments, we validated that our method produces circular shape sets that align with human similarity judgments. By comparison, uniform and circular shape sets according to alternative shape spaces (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks or Radial Frequency patterns), but not according to ShapeComp, were not necessarily perceived as uniform and circular. We provide five newly validated circular shape sets derived from intricate naturalistic shapes, along with MATLAB code facilitating the generation of an unlimited number of sets that can be tailored to experimental needs beyond circular configurations. By offering efficiency and adaptability, our method allows to systematically explore higher-level influences on object perception while minimizing the time and resources required to construct controlled, complex shape stimuli.",

          "authors": "Michał Misiak; Agata Dominik; Michalina Babiec; Hubert Ludwiczak; Marta Świątek-Prycik",
          "abstract": "People who view food-wasting behaviour as immoral tend to waste less. This observation raises the question of whether appealing to moral values can shift how individuals think about food waste and how willing they are to address it. The present preregistered experiment (N = 1006) tested this possibility by examining whether persuasive video messages grounded in the Morality-as-Cooperation framework influence psychological responses to food waste. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of seven value-based appeals: highlighting Family, Group, Reciprocity, Heroism, Deference, Fairness, or Property concerns; or one of two control conditions. Each moral message was presented in both positive and negative framing and delivered by one of two actors.\nOutcomes included judgments of the wrongness of food wasting, intentions to reduce waste, support for policy measures, and willingness to learn more or engage in related actions. Preregistered analyses showed no overall effects of the moral messages. However, mediation analyses showed a consistent pattern of opposing effects. Across outcomes, moral appeals were associated with lower perceived message relevance, which in turn predicted weaker moral concern, policy support, and behavioural intentions. At the same time, when controlling for perceived relevance, several moral messages—particularly those grounded in Family, Deference, Heroism, and Property concerns—exerted positive direct effects on outcomes.\nOverall, the findings show that moral appeals in food waste communication can be a double-edged sword. Moral messages have the potential to motivate stronger responses, but only when people find them personally relevant. When they do not, the same appeals may undermine their own effectiveness. This emphasizes perceived relevance as a key ingredient in successful moral communication about food waste.",

It is well established that those who are most vulnerable and most in need of mental health support are least likely to access services or take part in research. \n\nAims: Adopting an intersectional lens, this research aims to elicit the experience regarding mental health of young people who feel under represented \n\nMethod; People aged 16 – 24, living in England, who were currently experiencing or had experienced poor mental health in the preceding year were recruited from both NHS waiting lists (in Oxford, Sheffield, Cornwall and Liverpool) and nationally on social media and via charities. 248 people completed an online questionnaire, of which 117 took part in an initial screening call and 81 were interviewed. Unstructured interviews that adopted a narrative inquiry approach were conducted either in person or on online, and audio recorded then transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a combination of thematic and framework analysis. Young people with relevant lived experience consulted on the implementation of the research and recruitment, and peer researchers contributed data collection and data analysis. \n\nResults: Participants engaged with unstructured narrative inquiry interviews, often anchoring their experiences either in their schooling, or in a series of adverse childhood events. Three overarching themes were extracted from the data; the impact of connection, (in)validation, proactively coping and preventive opportunities. These themes highlighted the variation in health literacy and how mental health experiences are understood, as well as whether existing services were experienced as accessible and helpful. Participants were proactive with adopting coping mechanisms in the absence of support and identified times of transition as providing an opportunity for improved support. \n\nDiscussion: There are implications for policy and practice in how mental health is talked about and recognised amongst young people. It is important that young people are empowered to talk about their experiences, and that attempts to seek help or access care are not met with invalidation. Times of transition (particularly around schooling) are opportunities where support could be better offered in a preventative way. \n\nStrengths \n-\tLarge diverse set of lived experience data \n-\tYouth-led involvement strategy for implementing the research programme\n-\tInclusive and intersectional approach \n-\tOpen methodology that enabled participants to set agenda\n\nLimitations \n-\tAbility to represent large diverse data set within existing analytic frameworks\n-\tUnstructured narrative interview methods potentially challenging for some neurodivergent people and those with communication needs.",

          "authors": "Eren Gunseli",
          "abstract": "Adaptive cognition requires determining when previously stored information must be re-engaged to guide behavior. Prevailing accounts of working memory and cognitive control propose that contextual change cues the retrieval or reactivation of relevant information, reinstating stored representations into working memory when the task model changes. Here, I show that reactivation depends not on change per se, but on the stability of the change. In an EEG experiment, participants performed visual memory tasks using repeatedly presented items. The task rule was either repeating or consistently varying across trials. While contralateral delay activity (CDA) declined with memory repetition, reflecting reduced working memory engagement, this reduction was unaffected by whether the task rule consistently changed or repeated. Thus, when variability itself was consistent, it was learned as a stable context, no longer prompting reactivation. Reactivation, therefore, is not triggered by change itself but by the failure of contextual stability, revealing that consistent variability is learned as a stable context.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Young carers are an often overlooked group of carers, with little longitudinal research on their mental health, particularly regarding variations across demographics and support systems. This study examined whether young carers have poorer mental health than peers and explored inequalities by gender, ethnicity, special educational needs (SEN) status, income, parental composition, and support systems.\n\nMethods: We used the COVID Social Mobility and Opportunities cohort study, 2021-2023, a probability sample of &gt;13,000 young people aged 16-18 in England, we assessed self-reported young caring and mental health outcomes, including psychological distress, anxiety, depression and chronic mental illness. Modifiers were ethnicity, gender, household income, special educational needs (SEN) status, parental composition, perceived school support for mental health, peer support and social support. \n\nResults: Young carers reported 1.69 higher odds of chronic mental illness (95% CI: 1.35-2.12), and more depressive (B=0.20, 95% CI: 0.07-0.33) and anxiety symptoms (B=0.15, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.29). Associations did not vary by gender, ethnicity, SEN status, parental composition or income. Young carers with high peer support had more depressive symptoms than young carers with low peer support. Young carers with high social support had lower odds of a mental illness than young carers with lower social support. No differences were observed by school support.\n\nConclusions: Young carers had poorer mental health which did not vary across key axes of inequality. Addressing their mental health is crucial to prevent a cycle of care need. Increasing societal awareness, and fostering empathy and support may help improve young carers’ mental health.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a well-known algorithm used to assess the similarity between signals of varying lengths. Initially developed for automatic speech recognition, DTW has found applications in psycholinguistics, particularly in analyzing gesture form similarity. An open question in this domain is how effectively DTW captures gesture form similarity. Here, we validate DTW against human annotations of gesture form similarity across two multimodal interaction corpora and explore its utility as an automatic, continuous measure of gesture form similarity. Our findings reveal weak to moderate correlations between DTW distance and the number of gesture features---such as hand shape, movement, orientation, and position---suggesting that DTW serves as a useful proxy for gesture form similarity. Additionally, we highlight the importance of qualitative analysis of raw data and DTW predictions in enhancing DTW's predictive accuracy. Our study offers a rigorous validation of DTW as a measure of gesture form similarity and presents a detailed framework for preprocessing motion tracking data and calculating DTW distance. While none of the methods is perfect, the combination of automatic and manual measures provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and measuring gesture form similarity.",

          "authors": "Arkady Zgonnikov; Merijn van Niekerk; Yke Bauke Eisma; Joost de Winter",
          "abstract": "Merging onto a highway is a safety-critical task resulting in a large number of traffic accidents; fundamental research into merging behavior of human drivers can help reduce this toll. Two cognitive processes critical to merging, attention allocation and decision making, have been extensively studied in real-world and simulated driving scenarios. However, how these processes interact during highway merging remains poorly understood. While the relationship between attention and decision making has been widely examined in cognitive science, this work has largely relied on simple decision-making paradigms involving choices between static items on a computer screen, which limits the understanding of more dynamic and naturalistic decisions such as in driving. To address this gap, we investigated the relationship between attention and decision making in a simplified highway merging task. In a video-based experiment, participants (N=24) repeatedly made merging gap acceptance decisions based on the dynamic information about the distance and time-to-arrival to the end of the merging lane and the gap to the target-lane vehicle available in the front view and the side mirror, respectively. Participants' decisions, response times, and eye movements were recorded. We found that decisions to accept a gap were considerably faster than decisions to reject a gap. Decision outcomes and timing depended on the distance to and time-to-arrival of the target-lane vehicle, but also on the time pressure due to approaching the end of the merging lane. Most importantly, under high time pressure, a greater proportion of time spent looking at the side mirror was associated with a lower probability of accepting the gap. This finding indicates that differences in visual information sampling can be closely linked to decision outcomes when time budgets are constrained. \nOur results provide initial empirical insights relevant for future cognitive modeling of the interplay between decision making and attention during highway merging; this may help inform early-stage exploration of driver monitoring and support systems for partially automated driving.",

          "abstract": "This study examined trends in the future development of educational psychology using a mixed-methods approach. First, a scoping review identified articles containing explicit statements about the future of educational psychology, from which categories of anticipated developments were derived. Second, experts in educational psychology completed an online survey with open-ended questions on expectations, hopes, and best- and worst-case scenarios for the field’s future, and rated 84 statements—derived from the scoping review—on their perceived probability of occurring. ChatGPT completed the same survey. Articles from the scoping review and experts’ open-ended responses were analyzed using natural language processing techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, word clouds) alongside qualitative categorization.\nThe findings revealed a wide range of predictions, spanning from utopian to dystopian scenarios. Utopian visions emphasized interdisciplinary, multimethod, and evidence-based research with strong societal and political impact, leveraging advanced technologies to support personalized learning as well as mental health and social-emotional development. Dystopian scenarios expressed concern that educational psychology and quality education could become marginalized, politically constrained, inaccessible to many learners, or replaced by automated systems. Experts also identified concrete action points aimed at fostering desirable developments and preventing unfavorable futures.",

          "abstract": "Parental lying to children, for example, to influence children’s behavior and emotions, is common and linked to more child lying and maladjustment. Existing research mainly relies on retrospective parent- or child-reports of parental lying, does not differentiate between types of lies, and uses cross-sectional designs. This longitudinal population-based cohort study (N = 801) tested a novel systematic coding scheme to observe parental lying to children at age 3 during three structured behavioral control tasks in the laboratory. This study then examined prospective associations with observed child lying at age 4 (n = 537), and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 5 (n = 729), and callous-unemotional traits at age 9 (n = 563). We reliably observed four types of parental lies to influence children’s behavior (i.e., instrumental lies) and parental lies to foster imagination or fun. Most parents (94%) told at least one of these lies, whereas only few lied often. Prospective associations were examined for the four types of instrumental lies. None of the parental instrumental lies were associated with child lying or internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Parental instrumental lies involving false promises or exaggerated positive consequences were related to fewer callous-unemotional traits. This study shows the feasibility of using structured observations to measure different types of parental lying to children and demonstrates that the casual parental lies we observed were not associated with harmful child development and, in some cases, may even be associated with positive developmental outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Online surveys and browser-based behavior experiments rest on a simple inference: careful, coherent responding is taken as evidence of human participation. I argue that this inference is no longer safe. Autonomous AI agents—and participants who use generative AI as a writing or decision aid—can now produce responses that pass many (and sometimes nearly all) conventional quality checks, yielding data that look human-generated while embedding systematic, model-shaped distortions. Drawing on emerging evidence, I describe how even modest contamination can shift estimated public opinion, compress attitudinal extremes, and create self-reinforcing feedback loops in which AI-influenced “human” data become inputs to future models and future measurement. Because detection is an asymmetric arms race that researchers are structurally positioned to lose, I recommend a shift from bot-hunting to infrastructure redesign: contamination-aware inference and sensitivity analyses, clearer distinctions between exploratory convenience samples and high-assurance confirmatory sampling, and journal/platform incentives that treat data authentication as shared scientific infrastructure in an AI-saturated research ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "According to some views, reactive aggression declined during our recent evolution, this resulting in physical, cognitive, and behavioural changes in humans that promoted the sophistication of our culture. This so-called human self-domestication hypothesis (HSD) has been used to explain the parallel sophistication of language through a cultural mechanism, including the early emergence of rudimentary grammars capable of combining single words, with these compounds being perhaps extensively used for derogatory purposes in replacement of direct physical aggression. Complex language is a tool for achieving technological advancements, since it enables a more efficient transmission of know-hows to others. In this opinion paper, we hypothesize that this noticeable swearing behaviour might have contributed in direct and indirect ways to the improvement of human technology. Directly, because swearing has been shown to enhance dexterity and fine motor skills. Indirectly, because decreased stress levels and reduced anxiety, as typically resulting from swearing, enable one to engage in more efficient deep thinking, more efficient language use, and more productive work within a community.",

          "abstract": "Maladaptive social behavior can be considered both a cause and effect of pathological anxiety. These difficulties may arise from both the cognitive demands of social interaction, such as managing uncertainty, and the distinctively social demands of interactions, such as managing social friction. Previous work has linked generalized anxiety (GA) to reduced learning from aversive events, particularly under uncertainty, and social anxiety (SA) to fear of negative evaluation. However, these distinct hypothesized effects have not been previously dissociated within a single experimental framework. In the current study, we used a novel task, the Asymmetric Social Exchange (ASE) game, to study how people reason under uncertainty about the hidden intentions of others and weigh the real personal costs and benefits of accepting interpersonal inequality, a major source of social friction. In a large sample of online participants (N = 723), we tested the hypothesis of a double dissociation between anxiety subtypes in behavior. Behavioral and computational modeling supported this: GA, not SA, was specifically related to perturbed learning under uncertainty through aversive overgeneralization. By contrast, SA, not GA, was related to increased sensitivity to social friction, increasing acceptance of unfair, disadvantageous outcomes. Our study combined a novel social decision-making task with computational modeling to identify dissociable cognitive mechanisms underlying GA and SA phenotypes.",

          "authors": "John J. Clement",
          "abstract": "This chapter first consolidates a set of important heuristic strategies used for constructing\ninnovative scientific models from three books, including studies in the history of genetics and\nelectromagnetism, and an expert think-aloud study in mechanics. Twenty-four strategies are identified,\nmost of which are field-general. Patterns in their use suggest a partially organized hierarchy of\ninterconnected strategies and substrategies, contrary to the view that heuristics are simply tried in random\norder. Strategies at four different size and time scale levels are described, including larger Modeling Cycle\nPhases of model generation, evaluation, and modification, each of which can utilize many smaller Tactical\nHeuristics as substrategies, e.g., analogy, or testing predictions from the model. These in turn can utilize\nGrounded Imagistic Processes, such as imagistic mental simulation, an important alternative to deduction\nfor evaluating a model by running it. The framework links higher level, serially organized processes with\nlower level, imagery-based processes. Its intermediate degree of organization is neither anarchistic, nor\nfully algorithmic. Possible benefits of organization are narrowing the search space involved and balancing\nsources of model construction and criticism for productive creativity. Unorganized, spontaneous processes\nare also discussed, along with their possible benefits.",

          "abstract": "Theory of mind (ToM), or mentalization, is a core aspect of social cognition that enables individuals to infer the mental states of others. Brain activity underlying ToM has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with a primary focus on the Default Mode (DM). We investigated the interplay of multiple cognitive modes (i.e., cognitive processes eliciting distinct fMRI-derived spatiotemporal patterns) engaged during ToM, extending beyond but still including the DM. We analyzed a large-scale fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project Social (HCP) Cognition task, where participants (n=500) evaluated whether movements of animated shapes depicted social or random interactions. Six cognitive modes were retrieved using constrained principal component analysis (CPCA): (1) Multiple Demand (MD), (2) Default Mode B (DM-B), (3) Auditory Attention for Response (AAR), (4) Focus on Visual Features (FVF), (5) Language (LAN), and (6) Re-Evaluation (RE-EV). The functions of these cognitive modes have been characterized based on analyses of their task-induced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) changes over many tasks, but in the context of the HCP Social Cognition task, their BOLD changes were interpreted as: (1) mentally projecting into social narratives (DM-B), (2) allocating external attention to task-relevant components (MD), (3) processing non-verbal communication (LAN), (4) focusing on visual features of the social stimuli (FVF), (5) suppressing auditory attention due to increased visual attention (AAR), and (6) re-evaluating for possibly missed social patterns (RE-EV). Thus, our results confirmed the activation of DM during ToM, but also specified the contributions of five additional cognitive modes. An application of this work is that the six sets of mode-aligned functional patterns can serve as separate inputs for machine learning algorithms aimed at subtyping patients with psychiatric conditions to advance toward precision psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Scientific communication faces a dual crisis: exponential publication growth overwhelms human readers, and fragmented research practices block automated synthesis. AI-assisted writing exacerbates the volume problem, producing papers faster than they can be read. Behavioral and social sciences in particular suffer from incomparable stimulus databases, jingle–jangle measurement fallacies, and demographic blindness that conceals effect heterogeneity. Current AI tools aid comprehension and summarization yet cannot aggregate findings from incommensurable studies and risk amplifying biases when trained on unstructured, unverified text. We propose restructuring scientific papers for dual audiences: front-loaded narratives for time-pressed human readers, paired with machine-readable appendices containing executable code, standardized metadata, and ontologically mapped constructs. This design turns papers into queryable research environments where readers can interrogate data and rerun analyses, and where structured appendices enable automated verification of statistical methods and AI-assisted peer review grounded in executable rather than narrative claims. Such papers become nodes in continuously updated evidence networks: each publication automatically contributes effect sizes to real-time meta-analyses, with corrections and retractions propagating through dependent analyses. Widespread adoption will require institutional recognition of structured documentation as essential scholarly output and computational infrastructure that serves both human comprehension and machine analysis.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons connected to the rise of the Internet and our current political environment, societies around the world are facing an existential crisis–a lack of empathy. Today, people are increasingly struggling to be empathetic to others in their communities and in society more broadly. In the current research we (a team of academic researchers and practitioners) attempt to tackle this problem of decreasing empathy by testing and evaluating a school-based intervention program developed by Narrative 4 in American high school classrooms (N=380, 10th and 11th graders) using an experimental approach (i.e., comparing Narrative 4 programming to a control condition). This 10-session program focused on building empathy, perspective taking, and active listening skills (among other skills) through narrative storytelling exercises. Results indicated the program was successful in promoting students’ reported empathy, perspective taking, curiosity to diverse ideas, and active listening skills as compared to the control condition. Additionally, this greater empathy led participants to report more pro-sociality (e.g., greater willingness to be civically engaged, more respect for others in their classroom and community more broadly) and less affective polarization towards those who disagree with them on politics. At the end of the program, participants also reported positive experiences with the program. Taken together, this research highlights the merits of Narrative 4 programming for promoting empathy and pro-sociality among high school students, the merits of academic and practitioner partnerships, and a promising narrative-based intervention for promoting empathy in society.",

I also include recommendations for the APA and other psychological institutions, such as creating more formal professional practice guidelines for psychological work with undocumented immigrants and providing more explicit material support to practicing psychologists who engage in justified and ethical civil disobedience when ethics and law come into conflict. While this article is by no means a complete collection of considerations, and is in full transparency written by a first year doctoral student with limited clinical experience, I hope it can serve as an initial guide and jumping off point for researchers and practitioners to develop more fleshed out guidelines.

However, there remains a limited phenomenological account of how autistic adults experience their attention in their everyday lives. This is important for developing an understanding of autistic attention which is not based only on comparisons to neurotypical benchmarks. \n\nMethods: Thirteen autistic adults took part in semi-structured interviews, making use of photo elicitation to explore their experiences around attention. Participant responses were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis\n\nResults: Three Group Experiential Themes (GETs) were developed: Interruption is Devastating, Interest Engagement as a Sanctuary, and Attentional Normativity. Participants described their attention as a sequential, deeply engrossed process. They reported that interruptions, especially from other people, were profoundly challenging, often leading to a collapse of their focus and an exhausting state of vigilance (GET1). Time spent deeply focused on interests was described as a sanctuary, providing both joy and replenishment of cognitive resources depleting through navigating inaccessible environments (GET2). Participants described navigating entrenched normative expectations about how attention should function which particularly impacted their experiences in employment (GET3).\n\nConclusion:  This work provides rich, contextualised insights into the phenomenology of autistic attention. We highlight elements across themes which resonate with the monotropism theory of attention. We consider how creating inclusive environments, particularly in the workplace, requires challenging normative expectations around attention.",

Eligible studies employed an experimental design with a control group and outcome measures targeting prejudice (e.g., attitudes, stereotypes, intergroup bias) or intercultural competence (e.g., empathy, knowledge, culturally appropriate behaviour). Twenty-four studies met these criteria and were organized into four analytical groups: (1) collaborative gameplay, (2) player–character interaction and embodiment, (3) comparisons of different games with bias-related content, and (4) comparisons of game- versus text-based formats.\n\nResults and Conclusions: Across studies, video games showed potential to improve intercultural competence and prejudice-related outcomes. Effects were most consistent for collaborative and player–character interaction and embodiment game designs; by contrast, the impact of games with bias-related content depended on their moral framing, and comparisons of games with text suggested that interactive formats can have positive effects but demand careful experimental control.

However, quantifying the\ntemporal structure of spontaneous thought remains challenging due to limited behavioral paradigms and analytic tools that preserve its continuous, multidimensional nature. Here, we\nintroduced Density Map-Based Predictive Modeling (DMPM), a framework that characterizes spontaneous thought dynamics elicited by the Free Association Semantic Task (FAST) within\nvalence–self-relevance–time (VST) space. DMPM summarizes each individual’s thought stream using rating and vector density maps that capture both where thoughts concentrate and how they\ntransition over time. Across multiple independent datasets (total N = 392), DMPM yields robust, generalizable predictions of positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA). Feature analysis indicated that affectivity is reflected not only in the content of thoughts, but also in transition dynamics, with self-relevance as a key organizing dimension. Furthermore, higher DMPM-predicted positive affectivity was associated with lower salivary C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting a link between thought dynamics and inflammation. Together, these findings establish a scalable, interpretable approach for quantifying spontaneous thought dynamics and relating them to transdiagnostic affective traits and potential physiological correlates.",

          "abstract": "Geometry is often considered the paradigmatic model of abstract thought, and great thinkers since at least Plato have sought its origins. Particular, modular “languages of thought” have been invoked to explain humans’ unique cognitive achievements in certain domains, including geometry. Contrary to this hypothesis, I propose the Wanderers Hypothesis for Geometry, which states that: Human geometry is largely rooted in navigation-like mental processes that approximate Euclidean geometry and are shared by humans and nonhuman animals. Humans uniquely may access this geometry with natural language and use it flexibly in novel contexts, ultimately supporting our capacity for formal learning. In explaining geometry’s cognitive origins, we refine our understanding of the mind in general.",

          "abstract": "Background: Peer support for people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) holds promise to support recovery and reduce distress, but few BPD peer support programs have been developed or evaluated. We describe the design and implementation of a novel stakeholder-driven initiative to build a peer-led online support group for people with BPD. \n\nMethods: This manuscript does not present a traditional research study or follow an implementation science framework. Instead, it documents a radical, community-led model of care development—one that expands the possibilities for stakeholder-led innovation in mental health services. People with BPD and their families recognized an unmet need and co-created an intervention; researchers later joined to help assess program outcomes and capture impact. We describe support group design, peer facilitator training, and adaptation to online format during the COVID-19 pandemic using narrative format. We quantify changes in attendance over time (one-way ANOVAs) and participant demographics and satisfaction (n=598 survey respondents). \n\nResults: A two-year peer-driven process identified core principles and designed a peer-led support group. In the first 26 months, 138 peer-support sessions met (1383 total attendees) with significant increases in registered participants, program attendance, and waitlists. Participants were geographically diverse, likely to attend one session (72%), and reported high satisfaction. Many had never received BPD treatment (44%) or met someone else with BPD (48%).\n\nConclusions: This program demonstrates an example of stakeholder-led design of a sustainable program for people with BPD. The sustained demand we observed underscores the need for accessible empowering support for people with BPD.",

          "abstract": "Hypnosis is shown to be one of many ways a general capacity for phenomenological control shows itself. Phenomenological control is an evolved capacity to deceive ourselves so as to support socially useful beliefs. It allows one to strategically construct subjective experiences that misrepresent reality despite contradictory evidence in order to meet goals. It is so good at its evolved function that researchers of it have often found themselves being deceived: The participants in their studies feel energies, special states or parts of themselves that are taken to be constitutive of the mechanism of construction rather than what the mechanism constructs. \n\nKey points:\n\n•\tHypnosis is just one context in which phenomenological control is used; others include spirit possession, many spiritual experiences, esoteric martial arts, everyday experiences and psychology experiments\n\n•\tPhenomenological control is a metacognitive trick one plays on oneself: No other abilities are gained nor lost\n\n•\tFor example, hypnosis does not improve memory, strength, nor attentional capacity\n\n•\tIt can nevertheless be clinically useful in, for example, making pain go away by itself, precisely because it involves the motivated transformation of subjective experience\n\n•\tNo special state is needed to explain how or when phenomenological control is used\n\n•\tThere are enduring individual differences in the capacity for phenomenological control that have yet to be explained",

          "abstract": "Alternating treatments designs (ATDs) are single-case experimental designs (SCEDs) characterized by the rapid alternation of conditions, with the sequence of conditions typically determined at random. Outcomes in ATDs are often recorded as count data with repeated measurements nested within cases. Although generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) have been systematically examined for analyzing nonnormal outcomes in multiple-baseline designs, their application and statistical properties for ATDs remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a large-scale Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of GLMMs in terms of bias, mean square error, coverage rate and type I error rate for estimating immediate effects and trend changes in two prototypical ATDs. In addition, we present two empirical demonstrations using real ATD datasets with a focus on illustrating design-matrix coding, interpretation of parameter estimates, and reporting practices that jointly consider immediate effects and trend changes. Finally, we provide recommendations for analytic procedures for applied researchers based on findings from the simulation study and empirical demonstrations. We hope this article equips SCED researchers with essential guidance for appropriately analyzing count data from ATDs using GLMMs and outlines directions for future methodological work exploring the full potential of GLMMs and their extensions for the analysis and meta-analysis of ATD data.",

          "abstract": "On average single individuals commonly report worse mental health outcomes than partnered individuals. With the population of single adults quickly growing it is important the mechanism that relates singlehood to worse mental health outcomes is better understood. We conducted a scoping review to summarise the literature on the relationship between singlehood and mental health, and to evaluate the extent to which ultimate level perspectives are included in the current research. Of the 181 papers, from the PsycINFO databases, included in this review the consistent finding was that single individuals reported worse mental health oucomes. An inductive thematic analysis of these sources was used to identify patterns within the literature, with four clusters of commonly associated data items reflecting different singlehood identities (Widowed &amp; Lonely Women, Never-Partnered &amp; Childless Women, Male Involuntary Singles and Low-Socioeconomic Status Single Parents). Similar mental health outcomes were found for single men and women but the factors influencing this relationship were sexually differentiated in ways consistent with evolutionary theory. Childlessness and age were found to be more important in the outcomes of single women, compared to sexual access and voluntariness of singlehood in the outcomes of single men. With only a small number of exceptions, the literature broadly ignores ultimate levels of analysis and evolutionary explanations for the negative impacts of singlehood and accompanying sex differences. We provide a detailed discussion of how evolutionary theory could be used to shed light on the extant literature and call for future research to consider ultimate as well as proximate perspectives.",

This study introduces and evaluates the Health Equity Decisional Balance (HEDB) scale. Eighty-eight health professionals completed the scale of ten proposed items assessing perceived pros and cons of engaging with health and healthcare equity work, along with a measure of Anti-Racist Efficacy (ARE) (Eschmann et al., 2023). Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the latent structure of the scale and its predictive validity. A two-factor model retaining eights items with correlated pros and cons showed excellent fit (χ²(25)=32.98, RMSEA=.061, CFI=.982). Pros and cons were strongly and inversely related (r=−.90, p&lt;.001), consistent with decisional balance theory. When modeled as latent predictors, pros showed a strong positive association with anti-racist self-efficacy (ARE) (β=.82, p=.037), whereas cons was not significant. Together, the factors accounted for 20% of variance in efficacy. The HEDB scale provides a brief, psychometrically sound measure of health professionals’ readiness-related beliefs about health and healthcare equity work.",

          "authors": "Irene Pagliai",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a cross-linguistic idiom norming study based on 150 pairs of Italian and English idioms with similar meanings. Idiom pairs are categorized as lexical (LL), semi-lexical (SL), and post-lexical (PL) based on translatability (Beck, 2020), and annotated to indicate shared syntactic constituents. The variables explored include familiarity, meaningfulness, and objective knowledge (Experience-Based Variables, EBVs), alongside literal plausibility, decomposability, and transparency (Content-Based Variables, CBVs; Hubers, Cucchiarini, Strik, &amp; Dijkstra, 2019). The aims of the present work are multifaceted. First, a replicability check is intended, verifying if idioms show consistent correlational patterns across Italian and English. Second, it examines whether a correlational continuum exists for each CBV, with LL idioms expected to show stronger correlations than SL and PL ones. Finally, the study deepens the comparative perspective on CBVs through exploratory statistical modeling of cross-linguistic rating differences. Results show that correlational patterns are largely replicated between Italian and English, also for variables notoriously difficult to assess. The cross-linguistic correlational continuum is found for all CBVs, and model results show that the difference between Italian and English CBV ratings increases from LL to PL idiom pairs for each CBV, confirming the translatability continuum. Notably, syntax does not significantly impact the difference between Italian and English CBV ratings. Future research avenues are outlined to further explore the relationships between idiomatic variables and expand the comparative study of cross-linguistic idioms.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Kelly; Michael Dorneich; Stephen Gilbert",
          "abstract": "Cybersickness remains a persistent challenge limiting the usability of virtual reality (VR), yet commonly used subjective measures such as the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and the Fast Motion Sickness (FMS) scale are often difficult to interpret in terms of user outcomes. In particular, there is limited guidance on how specific values on these scales relate to user tolerance or the likelihood that users will discontinue a VR experience due to discomfort. This work addresses this gap by calibrating cybersickness severity interpretations against early termination of a VR experience. In Study 1 (N = 183), participants played an immersive VR game for up to 20 minutes and were free to terminate the experience at any time. Using a Behavioral Risk Banding (BRB) framework, logistic regression linked a modified 0-10 version of the FMS (FMS-10) and post-exposure SSQ scores to dropout probability, yielding behaviorally grounded risk severity bands (mild, moderate, severe, extreme). Survival analyses then showed how these bands mapped onto tolerance over time, revealing a transitional region marked by heightened individual variability. Study 2 (N = 304) evaluated the robustness of these categories across variation in VR content and mitigation context by applying the Study 1 thresholds without re-estimation. Although absolute dropout risk varied, the ordering and behavioral meaning of severity categories were preserved. Together, these results provide a practical, behaviorally grounded framework for interpreting cybersickness ratings in terms of user tolerance and usability across VR contexts.",

It delineates three core steps—awareness, evaluation, and regulation of emotions—together with the requisite competencies: emotion knowledge, norms and values, and a repertoire of regulation strategies. Early in development, caregivers assume primary responsibility for these processes through co-awareness, co-evaluation, and co-regulation. From a transactional perspective, the model delineates how specific caregiver practices shape children’s situated emotional experience and behavior and support the gradual transition from co-regulation to self-regulation of emotions. While the model receives initial empirical support, it also identifies key avenues for future research, including the need for culture-sensitive extensions of positive development.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the research in support of crisis management programs that target PK-12 students with disabilities who display challenging behavior in educational settings. We conducted database searches, ancestral searches, and website searches of organizations that produce crisis management programs to identify published and unpublished studies evaluating the programs. Our search process yielded just six studies evaluating five of 23 commercially available crisis management programs. Given the scarcity of supporting studies, none of the programs meet currently established thresholds for evidence-based practice in special education. Our review identifies a critical need for rigorous research on these programs to inform practice and policy, ensuring student safety and wellbeing.

Here, we conducted a scoping systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines, mapping the NF-MED field across both clinical and non-clinical contexts, with three aims: (1) assess the current state of NF-MED studies, (2) evaluate whether NF-MED facilitates meditative development, and in particular toward advanced meditation, and (3) provide methodological recommendations for future work. Our analysis shows that the field is dominated by proof-of-concept studies and marked by substantial heterogeneity in design, implementation, and outcome measures, which hampers the assessment of efficacy and applicability of NF-MED. While NF-MED has been shown to consistently modulate neural activity, evidence for corresponding improvements in behavior, phenomenology or transferable meditative skills remains limited. Additional research is thus essential for determining whether NF-MED can help practitioners overcome common meditative barriers, such as anxiety and self-doubt, and whether NF-MED can accelerate meditative development across the training spectrum from novice to advanced meditators.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive coding theory, perception arises from the interplay between top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory input. In the auditory domain, this interplay can lead to illusory experiences—for instance, when phonetic similarities between languages cause listeners to mishear foreign lyrics as familiar words in their native language. This study investigated how linguistic priors influence auditory perception during song listening. Participants read sentences in English or Italian before hearing English song excerpts, then rated how well the lyrics matched the text. Crucially, some of the Italian sentences were phonologically similar to the English lyrics, resulting in a cross-linguistic auditory illusion in which listeners reported the content of the lyrics matched that of the Italian text. EEG analysis showed that two neural markers of surprise—P200 amplitude and gamma-band activity—were heightened while listening to songs that were not perceived to match the preceding text, reflecting the violation of expectations. In contrast, these markers were attenuated in illusory trials, suggesting reduced prediction error despite the lack of semantic match. Time-frequency analysis revealed an early gamma response followed by beta-band dominance in the illusory condition, consistent with initial sensory mismatch followed by top-down assimilation. Together, these findings show that phonologically plausible but false linguistic priors can induce auditory illusions and modulate predictive processing during song perception.",

          "abstract": "People differ in their ability to distinguish visually similar items, a domain-general ability known as o (Richler et al., 2019). While o typically involves extracting invariant object properties, we investigated whether it also relates to long-term memory for episodic information extrinsic to object identity, specifically, object location. We further examined whether this relationship is influenced by stimulus meaningfulness, a factor known to enhance long-term memory, by using both high- and low-meaning stimuli. Participants completed a location memory test, a series of visual object-recognition tasks assessing o, and other cognitive covariate measures. Results showed a positive correlation between o and location memory, which was stronger for high-meaning than for low-meaning stimuli. This suggests that semantic content may enhance the link between object recognition and episodic location memory. Importantly, these effects remained after controlling for age, gender, low-level visual perception, working memory, and general intelligence. Our findings indicate that domain-general object recognition ability contributes to episodic memory by supporting the binding of meaningful objects to their spatial context. This challenges traditional cognitive boundaries by integrating current knowledge about individual differences in perception and memory, with semantic meaning acting as a significant moderator.",

Nevertheless, given that what is important and salient in individuals’ lived experience might be changing over time, this raises the question about the long-term usefulness of ‘off-the-shelf’ dictionaries developed decades ago. In the current study we used a bottom-up approach to create a large population-specific lexicon of personality terms. We subsequently examined the overlap and sensitivity to extract implicit personality of this dictionary compared to an established trait dictionary in the same language. Overall, we found that the two dictionaries only showed limited overlap with a pronounced divergence in emotionality (Neuroticism) and social aspects (Agreeableness) of personality. In addition to this, we found that while the implicit personality extracted from self-descriptions using the established dictionary showed alignment with participants self-rated personality, especially in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, the population-specific dictionary showed a significantly greater alignment between implicit and self-rated personality. In summary, our current study highlights the need to extend our thinking about the psycholexical hypothesis, moving away from assumptions of time invariant language encoding to more explicitly recognizing the temporal dynamics underpinning the expression and use of personality trait terms.",

Even when effective single-session interventions (SSIs) are available, Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) training remains a critical bottleneck. Recent advances in Artificial Humans and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable AI-powered clinical simulators that offer standardized, repeatable practice with immediate feedback. In this study, we developed and evaluated a novel AI-supported \"triadic\" training architecture for mental health professionals learning single-session Interpersonal Psychotherapy Intervention (IPT-SSI).\nMethod: In a single-group pre–post design, MHPs (N=72) completed a two-hour blended training comprising a didactic workshop (90 minutes) and an experiential, supervised text-based AI simulation (30 minutes). Participants completed baseline and immediate post-training questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, IPT-SSI knowledge, attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy, and willingness/apprehension to deliver IPT-SSI. Post-training user experience ratings and open-ended qualitative feedback were also collected. \nResults: MHPs showed significant pre–post gains in IPT-SSI knowledge (baseline M = 1.13, SD = 0.96; post M = 3.37, SD = 0.92; t(71) = 18.38, p &lt; .001) and self-efficacy (baseline M = 2.27, SD = 1.13; post M = 3.49, SD = 0.95; t(71) = 8.90, p &lt; .001). Attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy improved (baseline M = 3.15, SD = 1.27; post M = 3.67, SD = 0.83; t(71) = 4.16, p &lt; .001, d = 0.49). Willingness to accept clients for IPT-SSI increased (baseline M = 3.22, SD = 1.48; post M = 3.60, SD = 1.08; t(71) = 2.40, p = .019, d = 0.28), whereas changes in apprehension did not reach to significance. User experience ratings were high and qualitative feedback highlighted perceived advantages in psychological safety, accessibility, and real-time guidance, alongside concerns about over-scaffolding and the limits of text-based realism. \nConclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that AI-powered clinical simulators—especially those incorporating embedded supervision—may serve as scalable, practice-forward tools to support psychotherapy training. A brief AI-supported program was associated with substantial gains in MHPs' perceived knowledge and self-efficacy and with improved attitudes and willingness to deliver IPT-SSI - key barriers to SSI implementation.",

Therefore, it has been proposed that presumed ToM difficulties experienced by individuals with autism may be attributed to difficulties with deictic relating. However, rigorous studies testing whether altered deictic relating is associated with autism are lacking. To this end, we conducted two experiments (Nexp1 = 134, Nexp2 = 120) in which we tested the relationship between autism traits and performance on different types of relational responding, including deictic relating, in a general population sample. In Experiment 1, we investigated the relationship between autism traits and performance on eight types of relational responding via an improved version of the Relational Abilities Index (RAI). In Experiment 2, we adjusted the deictic relating scale to include stimulus functions more directly relevant to perspective-taking. Contrary to our predictions, deictic relating did not correlate significantly with autism traits. Moreover, none of the other RAI subscales correlated reliably with autism traits. These findings question the claims made by RFT about the relationship between autism and relational responding and warrant a reassessment of the accuracy of this position.",

          "authors": "Yonatan Vanunu; Kristin Donnelly",
          "abstract": "Consumers often encounter products featuring assorted components, such as bags of flavored popcorn or flower bouquets. How do they judge the quantity of each component to form overall preferences? Across twelve pre-registered studies, this article shows that spatial positioning significantly shapes judgements of relative quantity. The findings reveal a proximity-to-center bias: When evaluating products with assorted items, consumers tend to perceive a given type of item as more numerous when it appears closer to the center of the display, even when actual quantity is lower. This bias impacted both hypothetical and real choices. Consumers preferred products where the packaging positioned more of the type of item that they liked most, such as a specific popcorn flavor, closer to the center. Remarkably, this preference persisted even when the actual quantity of their favored type was lower. These results suggest that these biases are rooted in selective attention, specifically to the center of the product display. This research highlights the intricate relationship between spatial positioning, quantity judgments, and consumer decision-making, offering valuable insights for product design and display strategies.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to develop a phenomenology of the experience of self and its transformation through the interrelated experiences of form, substance, and essence. The objectives are two fold: (1) to articulate a structural vocabulary for describing how selfhood is lived, fragmented, and transformed, and (2) to demonstrate how this framework might illuminate and facilitate the resolution of identity conflict. The paper integrates relevant philosophical and psychological theory to articulate the experiential dynamics of self. This analysis yields a tripartite model composed of form (the physical and/or social dimension of identity), substance (the affective and psychological dimension), and essence (the integrative foundation of human meaning). In this model of selfhood, transformation occurs by integrating form and substance with essence. The analysis yields a phenomenological structure for understanding both intrasubjective and intersubjective reconciliation. An illustrative application of the model to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict demonstrates how collective identity fragmentation mirrors individual division and how transformation can emerge through renewed mutual recognition. The model emphasizes that transformation is not the elimination of conflict but its transfiguration through deeper relational awareness. By providing a conceptual vocabulary and analytic framework, this approach contributes to psychological theory on identity, selfhood, and the resolution of both internal and collective conflict.",

          "abstract": "Retrieval practice is a well-established strategy for enhancing memory retention. However, its effectiveness in authentic educational settings—particularly in mathematics and with respect to content transfer—remains understudied. We estimated the causal impact of retrieval practice on student performance in higher education, focusing on task-specific learning gains and content transfer (near vs. far). Participants were three cohorts of first-year business administration students in a gateway mathematics course (n1 = 636 in 2022/2023; n2 = 584 in 2023/2024; n3 = 571 in 2024/2025). Students completed weekly online retrieval practice exercises, with randomized assignments to different problem sets. Performance was assessed through three quizzes and a final exam. We estimated the local average treatment effect (LATE) using an instrumental variable approach combined with individual fixed effects. Retrieval practice improved quiz performance by 4–5 percentage points. Effects were strongest for isomorphic problems, then near-transfer problems, and only limited for far-transfer problems. On the final exam, retrieval practice yielded an 8-percentage-point LATE in one cohort, with smaller, nonsignificant gains in the others. The temporal distance between retrieval practice and quizzes did not systematically moderate outcomes. Our findings provide causal evidence that retrieval practice enhances mathematical learning in higher education by promoting a deeper conceptual understanding and facilitating near, and, in some cases, far content transfer.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) are increasingly used to study affect dynamics such as intraindividual variability and inertia. These parameters are often interpreted as substantive individual differences, yet they may be biased by stable response style tendencies, in particiular extreme response style (ERS). In the present study, we investigated whether ERS is systematically associated with affect dynamics estimated from multiple experience sampling method (ESM) datasets (total N = 1,254). Using a joint Bayesian IRTree–location–scale modeling approach, we estimated person-specific ERS alongside affective variability and inertia across multiple ESM datasets and synthesized study-level associations using a meta-analytic approach. We find that higher ERS is consistently associated with greater intraindividual variability. In contrast, we find no evidence that ERS was related to affective or emotional inertia. These results suggest that commonly used measures of intraindividual variability may partly reflect systematic response behavior rather than solely genuine affective fluctuations. Ignoring ERS may therefore bias variability estimates obtained from location–scale and related multilevel dynamic models. Overall, this study highlights the importance of accounting for response styles when modeling affect dynamics and interpreting person-specific variability parameters in ILD research.",

While national strategies address regulation, little is known about local authority-led vaping prevention initiatives. This study synthesised information on existing local approaches to identify their scope, strengths, and areas for improvement. \n\nMethods \nA survey developed by the University of Bristol, in collaboration with Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and Improving Performance in Practice (iPiP), was distributed to 130 local authorities in England. The survey collected data on initiative type, delivery, target age group, supporting evidence used, evaluation, and challenges. Respondents were encouraged to share supporting materials, which were then reviewed by experts to assess the initiative content, supporting evidence, and evidence of evaluation. Additionally, publicly available resources were found through online searches.  \n\nResults \nFifty-seven local authorities responded (44% response rate), with 52 reporting at least one vaping prevention initiative, and 41 reporting multiple initiatives, totalling 169 initiatives. The most common initiative types were school-based campaigns and online information resources, primarily targeting ages 11-16 years. Only 9 local authorities provided information about the effectiveness of their initiatives, and 4 had been adapted based on feedback or data collected. Common challenges included limited engagement from schools, inconsistent messaging about vaping, lack of resources, and absence of national guidance. Some materials contained outdated information or misinformation. \n\nConclusions \nLocal authorities are implementing a diverse range of vaping prevention initiatives, though few are evaluated. Clearer national guidance and regular review of resources are needed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and effectiveness in youth vaping prevention efforts.",

          "abstract": "In contemporary digital environments, visual storytelling has emerged as a central strategy through which brands communicate meaning and build relationships with audiences. Instagram, as a predominantly visual social media platform, offers a unique context in which imagery, narrative structure, and consumer psychology converge. This paper explores how narrative imagery on Instagram shapes brand perception by influencing emotional responses, perceived authenticity, trust, and consumer engagement. Drawing on psychological theories of narrative processing, visual persuasion, and affective response, the study examines how cohesive visual narratives, symbolic elements, and sequential imagery contribute to the construction of brand identity. The analysis suggests that strategically designed visual storytelling not only enhances attention and memorability but also fosters deeper cognitive and emotional associations with brands. These associations, in turn, play a significant role in shaping consumer attitudes, purchase intentions, and long-term brand loyalty. By situating Instagram-based visual narratives within established psychological frameworks, this study highlights the strategic value of narrative imagery as an effective branding tool in contemporary digital culture.",

This study examined physical activity professionals’ felt needs related to climate change, as expressed through lived professional challenges and dilemmas, and explored key competencies and educational strategies for training.\nMethods: A qualitative design was employed. Fifteen (7 females) physical activity professionals practicing in the province of Québec, Canada, participated online in (i) a 1h Climate Fresk game, a gamified collaborative workshop on climate change, followed by (ii) a ~45 min focus group. Thematic analysis was conducted following a structured six-phase analytical framework. \nResults: The physical activity professionals were French speaking; 80% of them had been practicing for ≥5 years in the public (n=5, 33%) or the private (n=10, 67%) sector. Eight key themes emerged, categorized into three overarching sections: (1) barriers and dilemmas in practice, (2) required competencies to adapt practice, and (3) educational design and delivery strategies. Physical activity professionals identified environmental and logistical constraints, ethical and safety concerns, and social pressures as key barriers affecting their ability to promote safe practice. They emphasized the need for climate-specific knowledge, adaptive and communication skills, and supportive, non-judgmental attitudes. Educational recommendations centred on the behaviour-oriented, and reflective learning approaches, encouraging both professional adaptability and environmental responsibility. \nConclusion: These findings offer a guide for integrating climate change–related competencies and pedagogical approaches into physical activity professionals’ education and training programs to support climate-resilient physical activity practice.",

          "abstract": "Bilingualism can be thought of as an intensive mental gym for language control. However, the moderators that underlie bilingual adaptations are a matter of ongoing investigation. Degree of similarity in mental, linguistic representations between the languages of a bilingual has been argued to differentially condition recruitment of control mechanisms and, as such, would embody a contributing factor to relevant neurocognitive adaptations. While ample evidence exists for this claim, its empirical coverage is limited because testing in cognitive science disproportionally represents communities that speak big, Indo-European languages, thus potentially providing a biased view of bilingual cognition. In this work, we assess the role of language distance as a key moderator of bilingual adaptations through a large-scale aggregation analysis of 510 experiments. To measure distance, we develop a multi-metric approach, using state-of-the-art databases, such as Grambank, and tapping into different levels of linguistic granularity. Aggregating data from 56,173 participants who speak 79 different languages, spanning 11 language families and a language isolate, we find sparse evidence for a distance effect at the population level. Certain language pairs stand out as promising hosts for bilingual adaptations, but their representation in the sample is not robust enough to enable strong conclusions, attesting to the need to employ more representative samples. Our results suggest that language distance is a complex variable that has the potential to address the perennial question of what makes bilinguals distinct.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation and disinformation are increasingly used to deceive individuals online. Identifying such deception can be particularly challenging for older adults. It is therefore crucial to understand how older users navigate online spaces. Despite the development of several interventions aimed at enhancing people’s ability to detect misinformation, their effectiveness among older adults remains underresearched. This systematic-narrative review identified interventions which target the psychological mechanisms contributing to online vulnerability and focused on their effectiveness among adults aged 50+. Searches were performed across PsycINFO, ERIC, Academic Search Ultimate, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google, and Policy Commons. Of the 1058 results retrieved, 16 articles were eligible for inclusion. Data regarding the implementation and outcome of interventions were extracted, enabling us to perform a narrative synthesis analysis. Aligning with previous research, three primary intervention types were identified: bunking, boosting, and nudging. Interventions provide mixed effectiveness among older adults but bunking programmes appear to be the most effective by facilitating discernment of both true and false content. Several interventions contributed to negative side-effects among older adults, such as an overconfidence in detection ability and decreased sharing of true information. Overall, psychological interventions provide a promising mechanism to support digital deception detection, but age-specific approaches are necessary to protect older users from the harms of false information online.",

          "abstract": "People who view food-wasting behaviour as immoral tend to waste less. This observation raises the question of whether appealing to moral values can shift how individuals think about food waste and how willing they are to address it. The present preregistered experiment (N = 1006) tested this possibility by examining whether persuasive video messages grounded in the Morality-as-Cooperation framework influence psychological responses to food waste. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of seven value-based appeals: highlighting Family, Group, Reciprocity, Heroism, Deference, Fairness, or Property concerns; or one of two control conditions. Each moral message was presented in both positive and negative framing and delivered by one of two actors.\nOutcomes included judgments of the wrongness of food wasting, intentions to reduce waste, support for policy measures, and willingness to learn more or engage in related actions. Preregistered analyses showed no overall effects of the moral messages. However, mediation analyses showed a consistent pattern of opposing effects. Across outcomes, moral appeals were associated with lower perceived message relevance, which in turn predicted weaker moral concern, policy support, and behavioural intentions. At the same time, when controlling for perceived relevance, several moral messages—particularly those grounded in Family, Deference, Heroism, and Property concerns—exerted positive direct effects on outcomes.\nOverall, the findings show that moral appeals in food waste communication can be a double-edged sword. Moral messages have the potential to motivate stronger responses, but only when people find them personally relevant. When they do not, the same appeals may undermine their own effectiveness. This emphasizes perceived relevance as a key ingredient in successful moral communication about food waste.",

          "authors": "Hao Qin; Rafael C. Gonçalves; Courtney Michael Goodridge; Natasha Merat",
          "abstract": "Partially automated driving (PAD) systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in consumer vehicles. While drivers are obliged to monitor the roadway and the system during PAD, they do not always comply with this requirement and may engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). Literature has emphasized the detrimental effects of visual–manual NDRTs on drivers’ capability to takeover control from PAD while reporting negligible effects of non-visual NDRTs (e.g., hands-free phone calls) and cognitive load. However, most studies focused on alerted scenarios, with takeover requests lowering drivers’ reliance on anticipation and cognitive load, masking the effects of cognitive load. Related work also examined PAD conditions alone, neglecting the combined effects of automation and cognitive load on drivers’ responses. To address the gaps, we conducted a driving simulator study examining the influence of cognitive load, induced by a 2-back task, on driver-initiated responses to urban traffic hazards (e.g., crossing pedestrians, oncoming vehicles) during both manual driving and PAD. The timing and quality of driver-initiated responses were analyzed separately for each hazard with detail. Results showed that (i) cognitive load effects manifested most when drivers encountered hazards with lower perceptual salience (e.g., a pedestrian gradually approaching the roadway); (ii) driver-initiated responses during PAD were less proactive and relied more on cognitive control; and (iii) this shift led to higher situational criticality and heightened susceptibility of responses to cognitive load during PAD. Together, these findings underscore an elevated safety risk associated with cognitive load during PAD, especially in scenarios requiring cognitively demanding, driver-initiated intervention.",

It is a prime instance of a class of tasks where eye movements are coordinated for the purpose of comprehension. Existing theories explain either eye movements or comprehension during reading, but the critical link between the two remains unclear. Here, we propose resource-rational optimization as a unifying principle governing adaptive reading behavior. Eye movements are selected to maximize expected comprehension while minimizing cognitive and temporal costs, organized hierarchically across nested time scales: fixation decisions support word recognition; sentence-level integration guides skipping and regression; and text-level comprehension goals shape memory construction and rereading. A computational implementation successfully replicates an unprecedented range of findings in human reading, from lexical effects to comprehension outcomes. Together, these results suggest that resource rationality provides a general mechanism for coordinating perception, memory, and action in knowledge-intensive human behaviors, offering a principled account of how complex cognitive skills adapt to limited resources.",

          "abstract": "Figurative and prior knowledge can each connect unfamiliar concepts to familiar experience to support learning, yet how they jointly shape real-time concept learning remains underspecified. The prior-knowledge scaffolding account predicts that learners primarily recruit domain-relevant semantic associates, whereas embodied-cognition accounts predict that figurative language promotes learning by eliciting sensorimotor simulations of a source domain and drawing attention to grounded information. We tested these competing hypotheses and their predictions in a visual-world eye-tracking study in which 104 Mandarin-speaking adults learned novel science concepts from spoken explanations that were either literal or figurative. Participants viewed three competitors per trial: a prior-knowledge associate, a sensorimotor-rich synonym linked to the figurative source, and an unrelated distractor. Learning outcomes were assessed with immediate and delayed judgments. Gaze time courses were analyzed across interest periods and linked to decision processes via hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling. Literal explanations elicited a sustained fixation advantage for the prior-knowledge competitor, consistent with the prior-knowledge scaffolding hypothesis. Figurative explanations produced a distinct temporal signature: attention shifted toward the sensorimotor synonym when the source domain was introduced, and later reflected concurrent engagement of sensorimotor and prior-knowledge information, reflecting an online interaction. Individual-differences analyses indicated that stronger figurative sensorimotor engagement at source-word onset predicted better learning outcomes and more efficient evidence accumulation, whereas sustained late reliance on figurative information predicted poorer performance. These findings show that abstract concept learning is supported by dynamically coordinated knowledge sources rather than a single mechanism. Instructionally, the results suggest that figurative language is most effective when it is used to initiate learning and is then paired with cues that promote integration with relevant prior knowledge.",

The quality of confirmatory testing depends critically on reliable fit index cutoffs that control type I and type II errors during hypothesis testing. However, conventional cutoffs developed by Hu and Bentler (1999; HB cutoffs) are inflexible and are vulnerable to sample and model characteristics, creating a demand for more flexible dynamic fit index (DFI) cutoffs that can be adapted to researchers’ specific designs. In this study, we attempted to develop a DFI algorithm for Gaussian graphical models, a widely implemented network model, and compared the performance of DFI cutoffs with HB cutoffs\nin terms of their specificity and sensitivity to misspecifications. In simulation studies based on both synthetic and empirical networks, DFI provided more flexible cutoffs with a transparent, fixed power/specificity to detect correctly specified models and was often more sensitive to misspecifications, especially in empirical networks. The DFI for network models provides a more reliable and flexible criterion for confirmatory network analysis, thereby marking an essential advancement in theory and hypothesis testing in network research. The algorithm has been implemented in an open-source, user-friendly R package, netDFI.",

          "abstract": "Network models in time-series and panel data have been powerful tools to investigate the dynamical relations among variables. A common goal of empirical research is to compare the networks of different groups, such as treatment and control, to understand how the dynamical relations are shaped by grouping variables. However, existing methods for comparing n = 1 idiographic networks are restricted to global tests, which lack the capacity to identify the precise location of edge heterogeneity. Furthermore, there is a lack of easily applicable methods to compare networks from panel data where just a few time-points are available per person. We therefore present the invariance partial pruning (IVPP) approach, which first evaluates heterogeneity globally with the network invariance test, and then determine the exact locus of heterogeneity at the edge level with partial pruning. Through simulation studies, we discovered that network invariance test based on Akaike Information Criterion performed well. Bayesian Information Criterion performed similarly well but also showed insufficient power to detect smaller true differences at small sample sizes, and the Likelihood Ratio Test was prone to false discovery. Comparison with the fully constrained model revealed superior performance than comparison with the fully unconstrained model. Partial pruning successfully uncovered specific edge difference with high sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that IVPP is an essential supplement to the existing network methodology by allowing the comparison of networks from both time-series and panel data, and also allowing the test of specific edge difference. We implement the algorithm in the R-package IVPP.",

          "authors": "David Brian Rompilla; Connor Bazar; Savannah Dod; Valerie Lu; Takashi Yamauchi",
          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is widely viewed as adaptive. Yet this control-based emotion regulation may carry hidden costs when individuals encounter personally meaningful reminders of past adversity. The present study examined these tradeoffs in a naturally occurring subsample of undergraduates with a history of parental divorce. Within a larger experiment, participants viewed sad film clips, including an unexpected divorce-relevant reminder, completed a movement-based Stroop task, and later reported the extent to which the reminder reactivated negative feelings from their own experience. As predicted, instructed reappraisal conferred short-term functional benefits on the Stroop task. However, at a longer timescale, individuals who reported habitually relying more heavily on reappraisal showed evidence of preserved reminder-evoked distress. In contrast, individuals higher in habitual acceptance showed a more normative pattern, such that those with divorces further in the past reported faint to no distress in response to the reminders. Together, these findings point to a central tradeoff in emotion regulation: reappraisal helps people maintain composure in the moment, yet repeated reliance on it keeps emotional echoes of past adversity alive. The divergent effects of these two emotion regulation strategies—reappraisal and acceptance—are discussed through cybernetic and comparator-based models of emotion regulation, where cognitive appraisal acts as a feedback process involving reference signals, error monitoring, and corrective adjustments while acceptance involves release of control.",

          "authors": "Kendra Wyant; Jiachen Yu; John Joseph Curtin",
          "abstract": "Background: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease. An automated recovery support system using personal sensing and machine learning may help identify when individuals are at elevated lapse risk. Cellular communication sensing may detect dynamic changes in lapse risk and can be contextualized with self-reported, risk-relevant information about contacts. \n\nObjective: We evaluated a machine learning model predicting next-day alcohol lapse among individuals in early recovery from AUD using contextualized cellular communication data and baseline demographic and AUD characteristics. \n\nMethods: A total of 144 participants (49% male; mean age=40; 87% non-Hispanic White) with a goal of abstinence provided cellular communication data and alcohol use reports via a 4x daily EMA for up to three months. Models were trained and evaluated using repeated k-fold cross-validation. \n\nResults: The best-performing model used an elastic net algorithm and retained 13 features (median posterior auROC=0.68, 95% Bayesian credible interval (CI; [0.64, 0.71]). A baseline comparison model including only baseline features retained five features and demonstrated nearly identical performance (median auROC=0.68, 95% CI [0.64, 0.71]). \n\nConclusions: Cellular communication data capture some risk-relevant signal for alcohol lapse but do not provide incremental predictive value beyond baseline measures. Several communication features were retained in the final model with moderately sized coefficients, suggesting that aspects of social communication may be important for understanding lapse risk. Although, limitations inherent to cellular communication as a sensing method may outweigh their added value.",

          "abstract": "Background: Peer support for people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) holds promise to support recovery and reduce distress, but few BPD peer support programs have been developed or evaluated. We describe the design and implementation of a novel stakeholder-driven initiative to build a peer-led online support group for people with BPD. \n\nMethods: This manuscript does not present a traditional research study or follow an implementation science framework. Instead, it documents a radical, community-led model of care development—one that expands the possibilities for stakeholder-led innovation in mental health services. People with BPD and their families recognized an unmet need and co-created an intervention; researchers later joined to help assess program outcomes and capture impact. We describe support group design, peer facilitator training, and adaptation to online format during the COVID-19 pandemic using narrative format. We quantify changes in attendance over time (one-way ANOVAs) and participant demographics and satisfaction (n=598 survey respondents). \n\nResults: A two-year peer-driven process identified core principles and designed a peer-led support group. In the first 26 months, 138 peer-support sessions met (1383 total attendees) with significant increases in registered participants, program attendance, and waitlists. Participants were geographically diverse, likely to attend one session (72%), and reported high satisfaction. Many had never received BPD treatment (44%) or met someone else with BPD (48%).\n\nConclusions: This program demonstrates an example of stakeholder-led design of a sustainable program for people with BPD. The sustained demand we observed underscores the need for accessible empowering support for people with BPD.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the Insight Development Process (IDP), a theoretical framework of propositional insight development to facilitate its scientific investigation. This framework formulates three empirically-testable propositions: transience, self-lessness, and incongruence, each defined as a perceptual mode that individuals report during advanced insight meditation. These propositions parallel classical Buddhist descriptions of the “three characteristics,” but are articulated here in a form suitable for empirical investigation and ontologically neutral analysis. The IDP differentiates two forms of insight in relation to these propositions: (1) momentary insights, defined as brief pre-reflexive shifts in perception in which experience appears consistent with one or more propositions, (2) integrated insights, defined as more durable shifts in perception, cognition, or behavior that reflect an intuitive and implicitly accessible sense of one or more propositions. Based on these formulations, we hypothesize that increasing access to these perceptual modes constitutes the primary mechanism enabling momentary insights to arise. Drawing on descriptions of Theravada Buddhist insight meditation stages in classical texts, modern practice manuals, and first-person accounts across contemplative and non-contemplative contexts, we delineate eight insight stages, each specified in terms of its characteristic patterns of momentary insights and associated experiential features. Criteria are proposed for evaluating degrees of integrated insight. We outline temporal dynamics describing how momentary insights unfold and change across the eight stages. The IDP provides operationalizable constructs suitable for empirical research, supporting hypothesis generation about the cognitive, affective, and neural mechanisms of propositional insight, and the ways in which advanced insight meditation shapes consciousness and well-being.\n\nKeywords: advanced meditation, meditative development, insight stages, meditative endpoints, Insight Development Process, propositional insight",

          "abstract": "The present research adopts a mixed-methods approach to examine the boundaries between two anger variants: an anger perceived as moral, appropriate, and justified; and an anger considered wrong and unjustified. In Study 1, we analyze participants’ narratives about their past experiences of justified and unjustified anger using qualitative thematic analysis, closed-vocabulary, and open-vocabulary text processing methods. In Study 2, we use a prototype approach to differentiate justified and unjustified anger experiences across ten theory-driven dimensions. The results reveal crucial differences in cognitive and emotional components, as well as interpersonal outcomes associated with these anger types. Participants often considered their anger to be justified when a target’s actions were perceived as immoral, unfair, harmful, or violating norms. They viewed the target’s behavior as reflecting poor moral character, expressed absolutist judgments in their writing, and experienced concurrent hostile emotions. In contrast, participants perceived their anger as unjustified when it stemmed from unrelated frustrations, misunderstandings, or overreactions to trivial offenses. Unjustified anger narratives were often reflective, and demonstrated retrospection and self-directed emotions (e.g., guilt and embarrassment). The two anger types varied considerably in their relational impact: Justified anger commonly led to strained or severed relationships, while unjustified anger prompted efforts to repair bonds. Additionally, justified anger had a stronger overlap with hate and contempt appraisals. We discuss the implications of these findings for constructing theories capable of explaining diverse anger experiences as well as developing interventions to address the maladaptive behaviors associated with anger.",

          "abstract": "Sacred moments are characterised by the five qualities of boundlessness, deep\ninterconnectedness, transcendence, ultimacy, and spiritual emotions, experienced at one moment\nin time (Pargament et al., 2014). These moments have been associated with improvements to\nwell-being in numerous ways. Benefits to well-being as a result of attending concerts have also\nbeen well documented, as concerts have become increasingly popular in recent years. The goal\nof the present study was to investigate how sacred moments manifest during rock concerts, and\nthe extent to which sacred moments contribute to the improvements in well-being experienced\nfrom concert attendances. Thus, the present study involved a questionnaire to examine the\nprevalence of experiencing sacred moment qualities at rock concerts (N = 87). Semi-structured\ninterviews were also used to explore the lived experience of these qualities, along with the\nelements that made the concert impactful (n = 3). The results of the questionnaire revealed that\nparticipants were likely to experience sacred moment qualities during at least one or few concerts\nthey have attended. Religious belief, age, gender, and frequency of rock concert attendance\ngenerally did not have an effect on the frequency of experiencing sacred moment qualities at\nconcerts, except for ultimacy, which had a slight negative correlation with age only.\nInterpretative phenomenological analysis on the in-depth interview data uncovered two group\nexperiential themes: “The Singular and Unique Experience of Live Music,” with Literally\nSingular, and Figuratively Singular; Unique and Extraordinary as subthemes, and “Live Music\nis a Sensory and Physical Experience,” with Physicality and Moshing, The Visual Experience,\nThe Auditory Experience, and Physical Realness as subthemes. Notably, every sacred moment\nquality experienced at concerts was described by the participants as exceedingly enjoyable and\nresulted in improved well-being, though the longevity of these effects had limited evidence. The\nhypothesis that sacred moment experiences could be a mechanism through which live music\nexperiences improve people’s well-being was supported by the findings. Limitations and\nimplications for future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Recent debates on violent video game (VVG) effects highlight the importance of analytical robustness and transparency in longitudinal research. Teng and Bushman (2026) reanalyzed our prior study (Lacko et al., 2024), identifying several methodological concerns and arguing that our conclusions were unwarranted. In this response, we critically evaluate their reanalysis and demonstrate that their conclusions rely on a narrow set of analytical decisions that do not adequately capture the complexity of the data. We show that many of their criticisms are either unsupported or reflect analytic preferences rather than validity threats. Through comprehensive robustness checks available on OSF, we address concerns regarding model specification, missing data, measurement decisions, and time constraints. We further examine the unexpected empathy–aggression association and alternative VVG operationalizations. While some inconsistencies emerge across different specifications, none consistently support General Aggression Model (GAM) interpretations, confirming our original conclusion that evidence for GAM processes in this dataset is weak. We identify transparency issues in Teng and Bushman's findings reporting, data processing and inconsistent interpretation of effect sizes. We also argue that the current debate reveals a fundamental theoretical problem: without precise specifications of mechanisms, developmental patterns, and falsifiable predictions, GAM risks unfalsifiability when contradictory findings can all be accommodated as supporting evidence. We advocate for formal modeling approaches to enhance theoretical rigor and predictive specificity in violent media research.",

To increase PBI accessibility, we developed The College Parent Guide (CPG), an AI-driven chatbot providing research-based guidance on student drinking, parent communication, and risk reduction. This study evaluated expert perceptions of CPG. Method: Seventeen PhD-level experts specializing in alcohol/substance use, parenting, and/or adolescent/emerging adult health, completed an online survey and input four preselected prompts to CPG. Responses were assessed on whether they would have provided a similar response, accuracy, clarity, appropriateness, and potential benefit or harm. Participants provided overall impressions of CPG’s performance and indicated whether modifications were needed. Results: Sixteen experts agreed CPG would provide reliable and safe information to parents of college students. Two participants believed one response could be harmful. One participant identified multiple concerning responses. Fourteen experts recommended CPG could be supplemental to PBIs with minor updates. Two suggested no updates, while one suggested major revisions. Conclusions: CPG appears to be a promising, scalable tool that may provide parents with reliable guidance on college student drinking. Before CPG is used in a PBI, further research is required to identify how parents engage with CPG, evaluate its effectiveness, and ensure its guidance supports safe and constructive parent–student communication.",

          "authors": "Hari Srinivasan",
          "abstract": "Growth mindset has reshaped how educational psychology explains persistence under challenge by showing that self-change beliefs influence how students interpret difficulty and respond to setbacks—particularly when learning conditions make improvement feasible. For disabled and neurodivergent learners, however, effort and strategy often cannot fully remove high-impact barriers, raising questions about how motivation operates under enduring constraint. This article introduces possibility mindset as a complementary construct for understanding motivation in such contexts. Possibility mindset is defined as a learner’s context-specific appraisal of “room to move,” grounded in three belief dimensions: self-change beliefs (can I develop in ways that matter here?), environment-change beliefs (will this setting adapt reliably in practice?), and pathway-flexibility beliefs (are there multiple legitimate routes to valued goals?).\nAlthough especially salient for disabled and neurodivergent learners, the framework applies more broadly to educational contexts where effort alone cannot reliably secure access. The central claim is one of translation: self-change beliefs sustain engagement most reliably when learners also expect environments to respond and pathways to remain viable. The article specifies predicted belief configurations, outlines a staged research agenda for measurement and incremental validity testing, and proposes “aligned” interventions that combine psychological messages with visible structural flexibility. Drawing on attributional traditions, the contribution is not to displace existing motivation theory, but to specify how attributions about systems—rather than solely about the self—shape motivational decisions under enduring constraint.",

While fluid intelligence and political ideology offered limited predictive power, IH consistently predicted accuracy, particularly in volatile domains. High-IH individuals engaged in a self-correcting cycle: they updated predictions more frequently and calibrated uncertainty intervals more effectively. Crucially, and challenging “wisdom of crowds” models, exposure to diverse peer predictions did not improve accuracy; diversity without metacognitive scaffolding provided no benefit. Automated topic modeling confirmed that accurate forecasters focused on base rates and uncertainty, whereas inaccurate ones defaulted to generalized pessimism. Thus, in complex domains, metacognitive discipline predicts foresight more than intellect or information access alone.",

          "abstract": "The semantic processing generating the N400 event-related potential (ERP) could be an inhibition preventing information from being placed into working memory (WM). This predicts that the amplitude of the late positive potential that follows, the LPP, should decrease. Conversely, when N400s are small, less inhibition would occur, LPPs should be larger and the WM content richer. This was observed in Sinha et al. (2023): when N400s to equivocal story endings were as small as those for univocal endings, LPPs to equivocals were larger and their ambiguity, detected. Here, to further test such LPP predictions, the half of their 101 participants who had similar or smaller N400s to equivocals than to univocals (the SN4s) were separated from the half having larger such N400s (the LN4s). As predicted, LPPs of SN4s were larger for equivocals than for univocals, while LN4s had smaller such additional LPPs. These LPP differences were distinct from N400 ones: equivocality interacted with time-window and the subtractions of the ERPs to univocals from those to equivocals revealed two peaks. Complementarily, in Sinha et al. (2025a), N400s were found a bit larger for equivocals than for univocals. There, LPPs were only a bit larger for the former than for the latter. Here, the same separation of 50 SN4s from 50 LN4s and the same subtractions led to similar results: two peaks having distinct scalp distributions. We thus report further support for the N400 inhibition hypothesis framework and a method for detecting the semantic processing strategy occurring in each participant.",

Across experiments, both age groups showed evidence of sensitivity to disadvantageous offers that provided them nothing while their partner received resources (e.g. 0 vs. 3). However, only 4-year-olds were willing to forgo offerings involving personal gain (e.g., 1 vs. 3) to protest unfair treatment, a hallmark of disadvantageous inequity aversion. These findings suggest that sensitivity to disadvantageous offers emerges as early as the second year of life, but this sensitivity develops into disadvantageous inequity aversion over subsequent years.",

          "abstract": "Matrix reasoning tasks are widely used measures of fluid reasoning. Despite variation in construction principles, four difficulty components recur across tests: the number of elements, the number of rules, rule type, and perceptual organization. Among these, rule type is particularly central and can be formally classified into unary, binary, and ternary operations. Accordingly, we introduce BOLT (Boolean Operations and Logical Thinking), a matrix test grounded in Boolean algebra as the formal framework for item generation. Across two online pilot studies (Study 1: N = 473, 45 items; Study 2: N = 430, 42 items) and one operational administration (Study 3: N = 7,150, 39 items), we estimated Rasch item difficulties and examined feature-based explanations of these estimates. Study 1 confirmed that the number\nof binary rules was the primary driver of difficulty, whereas unary and ternary rules showed no consistent effects. For Studies 2–3, we combined cross-validated LASSO feature selection with linear logistic test models (LLTMs) to quantify contributions of structural features (number of elements, number of rules, rule types) and perceptual-organizational indices that were extracted from stimulus files. Item difficulty could be predicted with sufficient accuracy (LLTM R² = .75 in Study 2; R² = .57 in Study 3). Overall, binary operations and perceptual organization emerged as converging determinants of item difficulty in BOLT items. Future work should replicate and extend the finding that image-derived computer-vision indices make an incremental contribution beyond rule-based predictors and integrate these indices into models of matrix-item difficulty.",

          "abstract": "Music is a cultural universal, yet the conceptual boundary between “music” and “non‑music” remains theoretically unsettled. This study used behavioral measures to examine the perceptual judgments of listeners from Brazil, China, and the United States as they classified short sound excerpts and rated their perceived musicality. Participants (N = 103) completed an online survey featuring 24 two‑second stimuli drawn from 11 sound categories, including traditional music from 130 societies and non‑musical sounds from established auditory taxonomies. Descriptively, the mean proportion of “music” classifications was 0.51, with substantial category‑level variation: traditional vocal and non‑vocal music received the highest endorsement rates, whereas speech and environmental sounds received the lowest. Musicality ratings showed a parallel pattern. Inter‑participant agreement, quantified using Krippendorff’s α, was moderate at the aggregate level (α = .73) but generally low within categories.\n\nTo complement these descriptive patterns, mixed‑effects models were used to assess whether sound category or country predicted responses while accounting for participant‑ and stimulus‑level variability. Both models revealed large, reliable effects of sound category: the two traditional music categories were far more likely to be judged as music and received substantially higher musicality ratings than all other categories. No other category differed significantly from the reference, and country effects were small or nonsignificant. Together, the descriptive and inferential results indicate that listeners share strong intuitions about prototypical musical sounds, but judgments become highly heterogeneous for ambiguous cases, suggesting that the concept of music may be graded and context‑dependent rather than sharply bounded.",

          "abstract": "Background: Resilience-promoting interventions are positioned as potential solutions to support young people’s mental health and coping under macroeconomic uncertainties and adverse life events.\nAims: This scoping review explored key directions in promoting resilience among children, adolescents and young adults.\nMethods: A scoping review was conducted according to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Eight databases were searched for peer-reviewed studies reporting interventions targeting youth resilience or coping with adversity. The inclusion criteria focused on resilience-building interventions for youth exposed to adverse life events. Data were narratively synthesised. \nResults: Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria. Promising intervention features included CBT-informed intervention ingredients delivered in a group format, tiered school models, and peer-support. Improvements were observed in emotion regulation, self-esteem, prosocial behaviour, and psychological flexibility. Effects on core mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety were inconsistent. Co-design, facilitator training, and cultural grounding were inconsistently addressed across studies. \nConclusions: Significant heterogeneity characterised how different intervention programmes defined and operationalised resilience, leading to variability in outcome variables and measures. Greater consistency in defining and measuring resilience, alongside attention to implementation quality and cultural context is essential to strengthen the evidence base and inform future interventions and building cumulative evidence base in the field.",

          "abstract": "Background. Music performance anxiety is a common and debilitating problem among musicians. Biofeedback interventions have been increasingly investigated as non-pharmacological approaches to reduce anxiety and enhance musical performance; however, evidence regarding their effectiveness, training characteristics, and outcome specificity remains fragmented. Aim. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence on the effects of biofeedback techniques on musician's mental health and performance. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted across Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Studies investigating biofeedback interventions targeting anxiety, performance, or physiological outcomes in musicians were included. Study selection followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Results. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included electroencephalography (EEG) - based neurofeedback, autonomic biofeedback, and multimodal biofeedback approaches, with durations ranging from single-session protocols to multi-week and multi-month training programs. Anxiety-related outcomes were most consistently improved by autonomic and multimodal biofeedback, whereas EEG neurofeedback more frequently yielded improvements in expert-rated musical performance. Physiological modulation, including changes in EEG activity, reductions in muscle tension, and improvements in heart rate variability, was observed across intervention types. Conclusions. Biofeedback interventions represent a promising non-pharmacological approach for reducing performance anxiety in musicians. Future studies should standardize outcome measures, define optimal intervention dosage, and directly compare different biofeedback modalities to inform evidence-based implementation in musical performance contexts.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, spending on political campaigns has surged dramatically. This paper introduces and examines “party-defiance ads,” a novel type of political advertisement in which candidates explicitly criticize their own party and take a position typically associated with the opposing party. Given the importance of party loyalty, defiance ads appear counterintuitive and risky. Why would candidates air ads in which they criticize their party? Across eight main studies and nine supplemental studies (N = 12,626)—including an analysis linking real-world ad content to voting outcomes in recent elections—we investigate how consumers react to the use of defiance ads. Past research on political polarization predicts that defiance ads will have negative consequences for candidates. In contrast, we argue and present evidence that defiance ads can result in positive consequences for candidates (a “defiance premium”). We examine the defiance premium in the context of both general elections and primaries and specify when and why it emerges. Our findings examine a previously undocumented advertising strategy, introduce electability as an important construct for research at the intersection of political marketing and consumer psychology, and provide practical insights for managers interested in deploying defiance ads without triggering backlash for doing so.",

Yet there are no existing self-report scales for measuring the process of decision-making in individual dilemmas (as opposed to general moral attitudes or beliefs about moral decision-making). We address this gap by devising new self-report measures of several of the processes by which people make moral decisions and validate them using realistic moral dilemmas, including six new vignettes that we developed. The resulting 12-item Decision Process Scale (DPS) can be used to measure how much people rely on rules versus cost-benefit reasoning and how much they rely on intuition versus deliberation in the specific moral dilemmas they face in a laboratory experiment or in the real world.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Aphasia rehabilitation increasingly emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms and ingredients underlying behavioral interventions. Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) is a commonly-used intervention for anomia in aphasia but there is little evidence directly examining its active ingredients. Using within-trial responses during SFA, we sought to explore how generating semantic features might facilitate naming improvements. \n\nMethod: A retrospective analysis evaluated data collected from a clinical trial focused on intensive SFA treatment for individuals with chronic aphasia. The study included 44 adults with chronic aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke. A pre-trained semantic model was used to estimate the semantic relatedness between  features and targets.\n\nResults: Participants were 2.6 (95% CI: [2.16, 3.12]) times more likely to correctly name target words after engaging in feature generation. Each additional feature generated was associated with a three percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.2, 0.4]) in the probability of a correct response at the end of the trial; a one standard deviation increase in semantic similarity (i.e., feature quality) was associated with a six percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.4, 0.10]). Model comparison favored semantic similarity over feature generation count in predicting final response accuracy.\n\nConclusions: Findings provide converging evidence that semantic feature generation is an active ingredient in SFA treatment, emphasizing the importance of feature quantity and semantic quality, consistent with a spreading activation account of SFA’s benefits. Further research is warranted to validate relatedness values from semantic model embeddings, and to explore the relationship between within-trial feature generation and generalization to semantically related but untreated words.",

          "abstract": "People are lazy. According to the law of least effort, people generally prefer to exert less rather than more effort to achieve the same reward. However, this research often isolates individuals from social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour is shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we examine whether individuals conform to both high-effort and low-effort norms equally, or whether the strength of normative influence on effort choices depends on the direction of the norm. Across twelve studies (N = 2,084), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. While people generally avoid effort, results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however, did not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Even after increasing the acceptability of low effort—by enhancing the value of low effort and the psychological closeness to past participants—individuals still opposed the low effort norm, exerting no less effort than the control group. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour can inspire us to work harder, individuals show resistance to lowering their effort below what they would typically exert. While we consistently found conformity to high-effort norms, effort preferences were not influenced when hearing about others completing an unrelated task, pointing to a possible boundary condition for norm effects.",

It starts with drawing cluster random samples using countries as clusters, drawn proportional to their populations. Then, through Big team Science, reaching out and building connections at those sites for participation. Finally, correcting treatment effects for nonresponse bias at the cluster (country) level through country-level indicators. This framework starts to bring us closer to random sampling of the globe while correcting for nonresponse bias at the cluster level. Future work can refine this procedure and make further steps towards generalizable human sciences.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive theories on trauma memory postulate that trauma-related intrusions are associated with more data-driven and less contextual processing. However, contextualisation can be enhanced via verbalization, suggesting that verbalizing traumatic material should reduce the number of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms and processes. Methods: In this experimental study, participants watched different trauma films and were instructed to verbalize the contents of each film clip, to visually imagine them, or to let their mind wander freely. Intrusions were measured via a diary and an intrusion provocation task applied three days after film presentation, and general trauma-relevant symptoms were assessed with the Posttraumatic Symptom Checklist (PCL-5). Thought suppression was measured twice, i.e., before and after the experimental manipulation. During a memory processing task, participants were asked to recall the film clips, and their performance was evaluated based on the number of details they accurately remembered as well as the time it took them to do so. Results: No group differences emerged regarding the number of intrusions, PCL-5 scores, memory processing task outcomes, levels of thought suppression or data driven processing. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed that intrusion frequency (i.e., diary intrusions, provoked intrusions, PCL-5) was positively correlated with thought suppression pre- and post-manipulation. Conclusion: The verbalization task did not result in a reduction of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms. However, results further underline the relationship between thought suppression and intrusions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Short-form video platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) have experienced unprecedented growth globally, with particularly rapid adoption in South Asian developing economies like Nepal. However, concerns regarding algorithmic exposure to inappropriate content and mental health impacts remain understudied in these contexts, where digital literacy and regulatory frameworks are still evolving.\n\nObjective: This study provides the first comprehensive multi-platform comparison of public discourse surrounding explicit content exposure, age-related concerns, and mental health implications of short-form video platforms. We address the content-specific research gap identified by Nguyen et al. (2025) through large-scale secondary data analysis, with particular attention to the unique challenges facing developing digital economies like Nepal where English serves as the primary digital lingua franca.\n\nMethods: We collected 221,764 user-generated records from five sources: Google Play Store reviews (160,000), Apple App Store reviews (12,086), Reddit posts (48,606), Trustpilot reviews (800), and YouTube comments (18,539). After relevance filtering and deduplication, 8,435 records mentioning content concerns, age-related issues, or mental health were analyzed using VADER sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling.\n\nResults: Analysis revealed highly polarized sentiment (45.0% negative, 42.3% positive, 12.7% neutral) with platform-specific variations. Instagram exhibited the most negative sentiment (M = −0.096), while TikTok showed slightly positive sentiment (M = 0.025) despite receiving the most discussion (49.6% of relevant content). Five dominant themes emerged: (1) child safety and parental concerns, (2) algorithmic content recommendation issues, (3) personal usage experiences, (4) account moderation and banning, and (5) mental health and attention span concerns.\n\nConclusions: Our multi-platform comparison reveals significant platform-specific variations in user sentiment, with Instagram exhibiting the most negative discourse (M = −0.096) despite TikTok dominating discussion volume. These findings align with and extend Nguyen et al.'s (2025) meta-analytic findings on short-form video's cognitive and mental health correlates. The results highlight the need for platform-specific content moderation strategies, transparent algorithmic practices, and age-appropriate safeguards—particularly critical in developing economies like Nepal where digital adoption is outpacing regulatory and educational infrastructure.",

Here, we examined whether strong or weak social memories are more prone to updating when violated. Participants viewed well-known characters’ emotional reactions to food items either repeatedly or only once. They then studied new events where some characters exhibited unexpected emotions to the same food items, violating initial memories. We found that when violated, strong existing memories, compared to weak memories, led to worse learning of new information, suggesting the resistance of strong memories to updating. Further, using a novel behavioral metric, we assessed the mechanistic role of memory reactivation in the updating of strong and weak memories. We showed that when encountering conflicting information, instead of reflecting their relative encoding strength, reactivation of weak memories reached a level similar to that of strong memories. Meanwhile, strong memories that were more reactivated showed higher likelihood to incorporate new information.",

          "abstract": "Assessing similarity between objects is a fundamental cognitive process, and similarity judgments can assess many different attributes, including objective properties (color, shape) or subjective appraisals (preference, scariness). Here, we investigated how psychological similarity across eight different properties relates to neural representational geometries and artificial models. We first collected large-scale pairwise similarity ratings for 280 objects. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and multidimensional scaling, we identified three mental representational spaces: one defined by multiple object features and general similarity, a second by affective evaluations, and a third by color. Combining fMRI and RSA in 80 participants, we found that object feature ratings significantly correlated with representational structures in visual and prefrontal cortices. Unexpectedly, affective ratings also correlated with patterns in visual cortices. Crucially, regional variability strongly shaped these correspondences: visual cortices exhibited high noise ceilings and consistent alignment with behavior, whereas associative regions showed greater across-subjects variability and weaker correlations. Finally, algorithms and neural networks with high classification performance on specific properties strongly correlated with behavioral and fMRI RSA matrices. Together, these results demonstrate that similarity is a multidimensional construct that comprises multiple representational spaces whose neural correspondence is shaped by representational content, regional variability, and modeling methodology.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive models provide profound insights into the psychological processes underlying behavior. However, a significant limitation has constrained their application: the reliance on extensive, repeated-trial data from each participant. The data-hungry nature of cognitive models has largely precluded their application to infrequent but consequential one-shot decisions common in economic, social, and clinical contexts, and has excluded populations unable to complete lengthy experiments. Here, we address this methodological constraint by proposing a conceptual shift: instead of requiring many trials from a few individuals, we leverage few trials from many individuals. By treating between-subject variability as a source of information, we demonstrate that cognitive models can be successfully fit to one-shot data. Through a series of simulations, we first establish that we can recover known parameter values from single-trial data. We then validate the approach empirically by showing that with only a single trial per participant it can replicate canonical findings; namely, the speed-accuracy trade-off, the influence of food quality and expectations on choice, and the task-specificity of linear vs. non-linear numeric representations. This work overcomes a major limitation to the widespread application of cognitive models, opening new frontiers for understanding the cognitive mechanisms of real-world choices.",

In a series of experiments, we gave participants choices between predictive models, allowing them to see the underlying data used to fit the models. Participants systematically neglected model complexity relative to the statistically optimal benchmark, often preferring models that overfit the data. While they partially compensated for complexity neglect by changing their decision thresholds, this strategy failed to appropriately account for the fact that simpler, misspecified models frequently outperform more complex models under noise and limited data. These findings challenge the view that simplicity is a general cognitive preference. When it comes to prediction, people appear to prefer a good fit.",

          "abstract": "The influence of cyclothymic temperament on the creativity of professional artists has long been debated. Popular narratives often suggest that emotional instability fuels creative achievement, giving rise to the enduring cultural figure of the \"mad genius\". However, empirical literature presents a more complex and often contradictory picture. This study investigates whether subjective well-being (SWB) mediates the association between cyclothymic temperament and creative self-beliefs. A sample of 201 artists with proven professional status completed the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego, and a validated nine-item creative self-beliefs scale. Confirmatory factorial analyses supported the measurement models, and structural equation modelling with bootstrapping was conducted. Results indicated that cyclothymic\ntemperament negatively predicted SWB, while SWB positively predicted creative selfbeliefs. These findings suggest that contrary to the “mad genius” myth, heightened cyclothymic temperament may undermine creativity when it reduces well-being, highlighting the importance of addressing factors modulating the SBW of professional artists.",

Tasks involving open ended verbal responses such as the Triangles Task offer valid indicators of ToM, but their manual scoring is time-consuming and demands substantial training. In this study, we test the validity and reliability of TrAIngles, an automatic scoring software for the Triangles Task developed through fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). TrAIngles was trained on a dataset of N ~ 11,000 responses collected from 581 Italian-speaking participants aged between 8 and 81 years. LLM-based ToM scores showed high accuracy and reliability metrics (Cohen’s kappa, ICC, Krippendorff’s alpha, Spearman’s rho) comparable to human ratings and consistently exceeding commonly accepted thresholds for inter-rater agreement (i.e., &gt; .80). Performance remained robust across age groups (children, adolescents, young adults, adults, and older adults). Our findings demonstrate that reliable and valid ToM indexes can be obtained from the Triangles Task using this new automated scoring system based on LLMs. TrAIngles thus provides an innovative tool for lifespan ToM assessments relying on open-ended responses, highlighting the potential of training automated scoring systems on archival, human-rated datasets.

          "abstract": "Recently, there have been growing efforts in developing fair algorithms for treatment effect estimation and optimal treatment recommendations to mitigate discriminatory biases against disadvantaged groups. While most of this work has focused on addressing discrimination due to individual-level sensitive variables (e.g., race/ethnicity), it overlooks the broader impact of societal structures and cultural norms (e.g., structural racism) beyond the individual level. In this paper, we formalize the concept of multilevel fairness for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects to improve fairness in optimal policies. Specifically, we propose a general framework for the estimation of conditional average treatment effects under multilevel fairness constraints that incorporate sensitive variables from multiple structural levels. Using this framework, we analyze the trade-off between fairness and the maximum achievable utility by the optimal policy. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework through a simulation study and a real data study on advanced math courses using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009.",

We argue that profit-driven forces are taking advantage of overworked mental health professionals via technologies that do not address cracks in the foundations of our healthcare systems and, instead, cause more harm than good. Throughout this manuscript, we aim to accomplish a tripartite goal: a) highlight the market forces promoting AI adoption, b) challenge the illusion of control in AI usage, and c) elaborate on the oxymoronic nature of ‘human-centered’ AI within the mental health fields. Supporting our argument through a comparative investigation are connections between the current GAI industry and another profit-driven industry that made use of clinician collusion to sell the public on a product: Big Tobacco.",

          "abstract": "Introduction-Objective: We outline and test three key assumptions of identity-based motivation theory. First, in everyday life, people draw both difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility inferences when tasks or goals feel hard to think about (ecological validity). Second, how much people endorse each inference is both an individual difference and context sensitive (trait-like and state-like). Third, strong (unambiguous) contexts shift momentary endorsement (context matters). Methods: Five studies (N=2,746, undergraduates except Study 2) apply autobiographical recall, secondary data analyses, daily diaries, and experimental methods and validated difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scales. Results: Ecological validity: people recall making both inferences a few times monthly (Study 1, N=986). Trait-state: difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scores differ between and fluctuate within persons about equally (Study 2 N=733 elementary-to-high-school-aged students; Study 4 N=260, n=2,789 two-week daily diaries). Trait difficulty-as-impossibility predicts preference for easier tasks (Study 3 N=216); trait difficulty-as-importance predicts daily meaningful engagement with school (Study 4). Daily difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility are associated with daily self-esteem, self-compassion, and self-efficacy (Study 4). Context: Strong contexts shape momentary difficulty-as-importance and difficulty-as-impossibility scores (Study 5 N=551). Conclusion: Results support three key predictions and suggest that difficulty mindsets can be meaningfully considered as consequential traits and as fluctuating states affected by strong (unambiguous) contexts.",

This influence has been theorized to differ by cultural tightness—the extent to which people adhere to shared cultural norms. Understanding whether and how cultural context moderates the influence of behavioral interventions is essential for the design of culturally-attuned and adaptable interventions to address collective action problems like climate change. Yet, past research has primarily relied on correlational approaches to test this theory, without experimentally manipulating norm information across different settings, limiting insights into how cultural context shapes conformity to norm information. Our study tests the effects of three social norm interventions on the climate-related attitudes and behaviors of 16,070 participants in 42 countries. We find limited evidence that cultural tightness moderates the strength of conformity to social norm information in our study, suggesting a more nuanced relationship between the two.",

We investigated whether collaborative future imagination influences individual optimism and its computational underpinnings. Participants engaged in either individual or collaborative prospection, interspersed with likelihood estimations of future events related or unrelated to the imagined scenarios. Collaborative imagination selectively increased optimism bias for related future events. This effect was driven by a social prediction error mechanism, whereby individuals updated their beliefs based on discrepancies between their own optimism and peers’ inferred beliefs. This cognitive update was content-specific and distinct from parallel emotional contagion effects. These findings demonstrate that optimism bias is a malleable, socially transmissible state shaped dynamically by interaction, highlighting a computational mechanism by which social contexts influence prospective cognition.",

The review focused on women and girls (15+) across high income settings in North America, Europe and Australasia during and after the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO (April 2025), followed by a theory informed synthesis using behavioural science frameworks. Findings were translated into practice oriented strategies using established intervention design and acceptability criteria.\n\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. Engagement with digital IPV support was shaped primarily by three behavioural domains: Environmental Context and Resources, Emotion, and Beliefs about Consequences. Engagement was constrained when technological access was fragile or surveilled (Theme 1), home environments were unsafe or shared (Theme 2), emotional distress restricted digital interaction (Theme 3), survivors anticipated surveillance, escalation of harm or inadequate care (Theme 4), or doubted the usefulness of digital platforms (Theme 5). Disengagement therefore often reflected active safety management rather than lack of motivation to seek help. These determinants were translated into theory informed recommendations prioritising practical support, safety by design, and flexible service features that make engagement possible even when access is constrained, unsafe, or frequently interrupted.\n\nConclusions: Engagement with digital IPV support is shaped by behavioural, emotional and contextual determinants, such that withdrawal or partial engagement often represents safety driven decision making. Behaviourally informed, trauma responsive digital services embedded within hybrid care ecosystems are therefore critical to supporting safe and sustained engagement.",

However, prior research predominantly relies on expert- or researcher-based judgements of how similar two scenarios are, rather than learner-based similarity metrics. Two studies (N total = 483) with undergraduate students in the United States examined how learner-based similarity judgments relate to transfer. These studies also show how using learner-based metrics can help researchers explore how features of lessons (i.e., the richness of diagrams) influence transfer. Participants sorted the stimuli in the posttest based on their similarity either at the beginning (Study 1) or the end of the study (Study 2). Participants learned about metamorphosis using either perceptually rich or bland life cycle diagrams. After the lesson, they completed a posttest after the lesson and after a month. Both studies showed that participants’ similarity judgments predict transfer. Using this metric also showed that participants were more likely to extend their knowledge to animals similar to the ladybug when they learned with the rich diagram, but to dissimilar animals when they learned with the bland diagram. This was consistent after the one-month delay.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory and schema knowledge are known to interact when we recall everyday events – such as the location of an object in a scene. Recent Bayesian models of memory have assumed that this interaction is a function of the trade-off between the strength of episodic memory and schema knowledge. Ramey et at. (2022) empirically quantified this relationship using the recollection-familiarity paradigm as a proxy for memory strength. They also manipulated the congruency/incongruence of object locations in natural scenes as a proxy for schema strength. Here we replicate their findings and then model the effects using a Hierarchical Bayesian model of memory. We model familiarity/recollection as memory strength, and the congruence versus incongruence as having different priors - with the congruent prior linked to accuracy for congruent new scenes in the experimental data, and the incongruent prior linked to accuracy for incongruent new scenes. The model successfully captures 1) the greater accuracy for schema-congruent versus incongruent object locations 2) the decreasing difference in accuracy between congruent and incongruent scenes across familiarity confidence, and 3) the elimination of the accuracy difference for recollected scenes. We also evaluated the dual-process signal detection theory claim that recollection responses reflect a distinct recollection process. We found that the best fitting parameters for memory precision had a curvelinear relationship where memory precision gradually improved with increasing familiarity and then substantially changed for recollected responses.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cigarette brand and variant names are one of the last remaining marketing tools in countries with plain packaging and advertising bans. Variant names foster product choice and product bonding by signaling quality, taste, and even perceived harm. This study tests two policy measures aimed at reducing the influence of variant names: (1) a one-variant-per-brand policy and (2) replacing variant names with numerical labels.\n\nMethods: Three randomised controlled experiments were conducted with 1,381 participants (354 daily smokers aged 18–25; 293 non-daily smokers aged 18–25; 383 non-smokers aged 18–25; and 351 adult daily smokers aged 26+). Experiment 1 used a virtual shop scenario to test purchase intentions. Experiment 2 assessed support for policies and smoking-related intentions. Experiment 3 evaluated perceptions of attractiveness, taste, and harm based on cigarette packaging effects. Both quantitative (closed-ended) and qualitative (open-ended) data were collected.\n\nResults: One in three smoking and two in three non-smoking participants supported the policies. Replacing variant names with numbers slightly increased purchase intention. The most reported reason is curiosity. One-variant-per-brand did not change purchase intention. Smoking young adults showed increased intentions to quit or reduce smoking under both policies. The effect was strongest for one-variant-per-brand. Most common reasons to quit or smoke less were that they already had the intentions to quit and the policy offered a nudge. Smoking adults showed no change. Perceptions of harm, attractiveness, and taste were unaffected by the policies, instead policies likely create temporary friction in the smoking experience by breaking brand and variant loyalty, offering people who have an intention to quit or reduce smoking momentum for doing so. No evidence was found that policies would increase uptake among non-smokers or increase smoking; however, indications for substitution toward e-cigarettes and other tobacco products were reported.\n\nConclusions: Both policies may support existing desire for smoking reduction and cessation among young adult smokers, especially non-daily smokers, without unintended smoking increases. Linking such policies to cessation campaigns, monitoring curiosity effects and substitution behaviours is recommended.",

Bayesian mixed-effects models were used to estimate the additive and interactive effects of trait impulsivity and momentary affect on four gambling behaviors: (a) whether participants gambled since the previous signal, (b) time spent gambling, (c) money planned to gamble, and (d) money actually spent.\n\nResults: Most estimated effects did not meet the preregistered threshold for significance (99% credible intervals excluding zero). The only robust and statistically significant effect was a positive association between Lack of Premeditation and time spent gambling. Momentary affect variables showed heterogeneous associations with gambling outcomes, and zero cross-level interactions between traits, momentary affect, and gambling pathology severity were supported. \n\nConclusions: The robust association between Lack of Premeditation and gambling duration highlights the value of modeling impulsivity as a multidimensional construct that has varying relations with different forms of gambling behaviors in daily life. Although most effects were small and uncertain, the Bayesian framework allowed us to quantify uncertainty and provide estimates that may facilitate the use of more informed prior probability distributions in future work.",

          "abstract": "Few things are as instantly frustrating as realizing one made a mistake. Yet, it may be precisely this uncomfortable feeling what pushes us to pay attention, adjust, and do better next time. Affective theories of control argue that the negative or arousing quality of errors serves as feedback signal to respond with more caution. To directly test this idea, we combined a temporal flanker task—a paradigm well established for eliciting response conflict and error-related adjustments—with emotional words that systematically varied in affective context. We found that both arousal (emotional versus neutral) and valence (negative versus positive) of the emotional words modulate behavior following errors, consistent across a pre-registered experiment (N = 60) and a mega-analysis pooling this dataset with data from five other experiments employing a similar design (N = 352). Specifically, results showed increased post-error slowing following negative relative to positive words, supporting the idea that negative affect amplifies the aversive signal of errors. Results also indicated greater post-error slowing following high compared to low arousing words. However, this effect declined with time on task, suggesting that the stimulus-evoked arousal initially amplified an error-related orienting response, but habituated over time. Overall, the findings provide evidence for a functional integration of emotions and control, and we discuss potential mechanisms that may account for this relationship.",

Traditional approaches often suffer from two key limitations: the\ncriterion biases in reporting perceptual (un)awareness, and the criterion content fallacy, where\nawareness measures do not capture the specific information required to perform the perceptual\ntask. These problems are compounded by the widespread use of single-object paradigms, which\ntypically involve presenting isolated stimuli near threshold and suppressing them with masking\ntechniques. These constraints result in a low signal-to-noise ratio that severely limits sensitivity to\ndetect effects, and offer low ecological validity. Here we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nensemble perception that overcomes these long-standing limitations. Experiment 1 used a bias-free\ntwo-interval forced-choice task in which observers had to discriminate the predominant category in\nensembles comprising animate and inanimate items and also detect which interval contained the\ntask-relevant features Experiment 2 extended these findings with a single-interval design, addressing\nconcerns about potential detection inefficiencies. Multiple control analyses across experiments\ndemonstrate robust unconscious ensemble perception: observers reliably discriminated\nensemble-level properties even when detection of the task-relevant features was at chance.\nAdditionally, Bayesian ideal observer modeling anchors these findings within a computational\naccount of unconscious perception. Together, our findings demonstrate that perceptual processing\nof complex visual summaries can occur without conscious awareness - a phenomenon we term\nensemble blindsight. The work offers a new framework for studying visual consciousness beyond\nthe limits of traditional single-target paradigms.",

Yet modularity is not static: it reconfigures over seconds during cognition, adapts cumulatively over learning and training, and is reshaped over years across development and ageing. Across these domains, empirical findings can appear inconsistent, in part because similar values of global modularity may arise from qualitatively different underlying network reorganizations, including changes in within-module cohesion, between-module coupling, and community composition across scales. Here we synthesize evidence across cognition, learning, and lifespan research to show that modularity change is best understood as a repertoire of timescale-dependent reconfiguration modes rather than as a single scalar property. By organizing reported findings into key modes—such as transient integration, selective decoupling and stabilization, and slow long-term rebalancing—and relating them to biological mechanisms and constraints already implicated in the literature, we provide a unifying conceptual framework for interpreting flexible modularity as a core principle of adaptive brain organization.",

          "abstract": "Not all pro-environmental behaviors are created equal—some are vastly more effective at mitigating climate change than others. Do people judge more effective behaviors as proportionally morally superior? This matters because moral cognition and motivation are powerful drivers of prosocial behavior. Four studies (N = 5,336; three pre-registered) reveal a robust morality-effectiveness disconnect: Behaviors that rank better on objective climate mitigation potential rank worse on individual moral judgments. Exploratory analyses reveal that this disconnect is mediated by stronger personal support for less effective behaviors, and is weaker among individuals more interested in learning about environmental impacts. Study 3, a five-country experiment, reveals that explicitly labeling behaviors' impact reduces the disconnect by 75%, but does not eliminate it. Finally, Study 4 finds that providing detailed information reverses the disconnect, leading people to judge more effective behaviors as proportionally more moral and increase their policy support. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: To synthesise evidence on perceived barriers and facilitators of engagement with digital intimate partner violence (IPV) support. The review focused on women and girls (15+) across high income settings in North America, Europe and Australasia during and after the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO (April 2025), followed by a theory informed synthesis using behavioural science frameworks. Findings were translated into practice oriented strategies using established intervention design and acceptability criteria.\n\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. Engagement with digital IPV support was shaped primarily by three behavioural domains: Environmental Context and Resources, Emotion, and Beliefs about Consequences. Engagement was constrained when technological access was fragile or surveilled (Theme 1), home environments were unsafe or shared (Theme 2), emotional distress restricted digital interaction (Theme 3), survivors anticipated surveillance, escalation of harm or inadequate care (Theme 4), or doubted the usefulness of digital platforms (Theme 5). Disengagement therefore often reflected active safety management rather than lack of motivation to seek help. These determinants were translated into theory informed recommendations prioritising practical support, safety by design, and flexible service features that make engagement possible even when access is constrained, unsafe, or frequently interrupted.\n\nConclusions: Engagement with digital IPV support is shaped by behavioural, emotional and contextual determinants, such that withdrawal or partial engagement often represents safety driven decision making. Behaviourally informed, trauma responsive digital services embedded within hybrid care ecosystems are therefore critical to supporting safe and sustained engagement.",

          "abstract": "Our experience of time is deeply shaped by emotional and bodily states. Anxiety is known to distort our temporal perception, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we tested whether interoception links anxiety to variability in timing. Thirty participants underwent fMRI while performing a temporal reproduction task within a modified Threat of Scream paradigm. Safe and Threat blocks alternated, with aversive screams unpredictably delivered during Threat blocks. Screams reliably increased subjective anxiety and engaged salience and limbic regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula. Despite these affective and neural responses, Threat did not produce systematic changes in temporal accuracy. Instead, the interaction between subjective anxiety and interoceptive accuracy predicted reduced temporal accuracy, implicating an interoceptive contribution to anxiety-related time distortions. At the neural level, reproduction compared with the encoding phase increased activity in sensorimotor and parietal regions, with insula, cingulate, and striato-thalamic engagement in the Safe context. Under Threat, the encoding–reproduction differences were modest, and screams robustly recruited a salience–limbic–temporal network relative to both non-emotional tones. Together, these findings provide behavioral and neural evidence that anxiety influences time perception through its coupling with bodily awareness, highlighting interoception as a key pathway for recalibrating time perception.",

          "authors": "Maugan Russell Lloyd; Scott Moffat",
          "abstract": "Navigation difficulties in older adults are well-documented and declining wayfinding abilities serve as an early indicator of cognitive impairment. Such deficits can reduce mobility, restrict life space, and predict both nursing home admission and mortality. A major factor underlying this performance decline is the tendency for some older adults to rely on egocentric (self-referential) navigation strategies rather than allocentric (external) spatial representations. However, it is unclear whether this reflects reduced ability to engage in allocentric processing or an avoidance of allocentric strategies for other reasons. Metacognitive monitoring plays a central role in strategy selection, yet its influence on navigation remains chronically underexplored. While older adults can effectively assess their memory performance in associative memory tasks, evidence is less clear for their ability to monitor visuospatial memory. Low confidence in memory abilities has been shown to lead older adults to use less cognitively demanding strategies, which may parallel their preference for egocentric navigation. Navigation research has uncovered strategy clusters: some individuals integrate spatial information into a cognitive survey representation, others tend to default to egocentric navigation, and some struggle with all strategies. Older adults may cautiously adhere to the safer, known route following costly mistakes: that this may be the less cognitively demanding strategy does not show lesser cognitive abilities. This review examines metacognition in navigation in older adults, drawing from non-navigation findings, addresses the role of metacognitive monitoring in navigation strategy selection, and explores the implications for interventions to improve spatial cognition in aging.",

Across three studies, we developed and validated a psychologically grounded, user-derived taxonomy of content dimensions, and examined their associations with negative emotional and cognitive outcomes. The pilot study, which quantified people’s perceptions about harmful content, revealed that social networks were perceived as more emotionally harmful, particularly in relation to political vitriol and social comparison. Study 1 experimentally exposed participants to real-world Twitter content and found that content features derived from language model analysis predicted increases in hostility, distress, and nervousness. Study 2 employed a controlled laboratory design with participants’ own Instagram feeds, showing that exposure to polarized content was associated with increases in distress, fear, and shorter viewing duration, while content related to social comparison caused a reduction in enthusiasm and alertness. Methodologically, the project uses large language models within a psychologically interpretable framework, moving beyond black-box classification approaches. The findings offer initial insights for content moderation, platform design, and interventions aimed at mitigating the psychological costs of digital environments, and highlight the value of users' subjective beliefs as meaningful signals for identifying harmful content.",

          "abstract": "Understanding speech among competing speech poses a substantial challenge. In these environments, familiar voices—including naturally-familiar (e.g., friends, partners) and lab-trained voices—are more intelligible than unfamiliar voices. Yet, whether familiar voices also require less effort to understand is currently unknown. We trained 20 participants to become familiar with three voices, then tested listening effort during a speech intelligibility task. During familiarisation and training, participants were exposed to three talkers for different lengths of time, either speaking 88, 166, or 478 sentences (‘Least Familiar’, ‘Moderately Familiar’, or ‘Most Familiar’ voice, respectively). During each trial of the speech intelligibility task, two competing sentences were presented at a target-to-masker ratio (TMR) of -6 or +3 dB. Participants reported target sentences that were spoken by trained or by novel, unfamiliar talkers. We assessed effort using self-reported ratings and physiologically, using pupil dilation. We found that self-report scores were more sensitive than pupil dilation to differences in TMR, with lower self-reported effort at +3 than -6 dB TMR. The two measures may also be differentially sensitive to the extent of training. We found lower self-reported effort for all three trained voices over unfamiliar voices, with no differences among the trained voices. Whereas, pupil dilation was only lower for the voice that had been trained for the longest. Thus, both self-report scores and pupil dilation showed advantages for the voice that was trained for the longest (~1 hour), but self-report scores additionally showed reduced effort even following relatively short durations of training (less than 10 minutes).",

          "authors": "Jianghao Liu",
          "abstract": "Mental imagery refers to one’s quasi-perceptual experience in the absence of direct external input. Yet around 4% of individuals with “aphantasia” report an inability to voluntarily generate such experiences. This phenomenon provides a natural experiment that challenges current theories of imagery, which typically assume that reactivation of the visual cortex in imagery generation is sufficient for experience. In fact, neuroimaging evidence shows that aphantasic individuals can reactivate visual cortex normally during imagery tasks, indicating that additional, as-yet-unspecified, processes are required for subjective experience to emerge. In this theory paper, I propose an attention-based model of conscious imagery (“the attention model”), in which generation provides initial sensory reactivations, integration binds visual features into coherent perceptual-like content, and amplification enhances them for conscious access. This hierarchical processing of conscious imagery appears to be supported by a fronto-parietal-fusiform network shaped by two interacting attention systems. Aphantasia primarily reflects deficits in top-down modulation, with preserved generation but impaired integration and amplification of internal representations, linked to altered interactions between frontoparietal attention networks and the fusiform gyrus. Overall, this model reframes imagery as an active, constructive process shaped by the dynamic interplay of attention, sensory, and memory networks, rather than a passive reactivation of sensory representation. It offers a testable neuromechanistic account bridging research on imagery and consciousness, motivating future research on unconscious and conscious processing of internal representations.",

          "abstract": "Summative assessments (SAs) and formative assessments (FAs) fulfil complementary functions in the educational endeavour. SAs measure knowledge at the end of a unit in a standardised, high-stakes setting, while FAs evaluate student performance during daily classroom activities to tailor feedback and instruction. Computer-based FA (CBFA) systems enable collecting unprecedented amounts of data objectively and with minimal disruption for students, under conditions that more closely resemble real-life behaviour. Given concerns about student stress and ecological validity associated with SAs, potential biases in teacher judgements, and the high burden entailed by traditional classroom assessments, we investigated whether and how well FA outcomes can predict SA outcomes. Specifically, we estimated student abilities in a large sample of children evaluated at different time points during compulsory schooling and performed a systematic comparison of regression models trained to predict SA abilities on different subsets of features derived from FA abilities and auxiliary variables. A model that included mean abilities in different competence domains performed best, accounting for a considerable proportion of variance (30 - 48 %), although this was still below that explained by past SA measures. Most predictive FA features generally corresponded to abilities from the same or a similar competence domain as the predicted SA ability. We report systematic model biases that would warrant consideration when using the models for decision-making. Our findings provide valuable insights into how learning progress connects to future achievement, which can help teachers adapt instruction earlier and inform policies to reduce reliance on high-stakes testing.",

To address this question, 80 Spanish speakers completed a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) task measuring perceptual gradiency and consistency along a Spanish /ba/–/pa/ continuum manipulated in 7–8 ms steps of voice onset time (VOT). The same participants also performed an explicit imitation task using the same stimuli. Results revealed only weak relationships between perceptual gradiency and imitation accuracy, as well as between perceptual consistency and imitation consistency, even after accounting for other factors related to speech perception and imitation. These findings suggest that models proposing strong perception–production coupling may not extend to the subphonemic level.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The present study examined whether perceptual rhythmic ability predicts cognitive load during second language (L2) speech perception, and whether this effect depends on rhythmic interference from listeners’ first language (L1) or on rhythmic alignment with the L2 target language.\n\nMethod: Eighty-two L1 Spanish–L2 English bilinguals completed a pupillometry experiment in which they listened to English sentences spoken with accents differing in rhythmic properties (American-accented English: higher variability or more stress-timed; Spanish- and Mandarin-accented English: lower variability or more syllable-timed). Cognitive load was indexed using pupil dilation during listening. Participants also completed a perceptual rhythm discrimination task, along with additional control tasks relevant to L2 speech processing.\n\nResults: Overall, listeners with stronger perceptual rhythmic ability exhibited greater pupil dilation during L2 English listening compared to listeners with weaker rhythmic ability. However, this difference was reduced for American-accented English relative to Spanish-accented English, suggesting that rhythmic alignment between the accent and the target language facilitates processing.\nConclusions: The findings indicate that perceptual rhythmic ability is associated with greater cognitive load during L2 English speech perception across accents in L1 Spanish speakers, likely reflecting differences in rhythmic properties between languages. Moreover, alignment between listeners’ rhythmic sensitivity and the rhythmic properties of the target language plays a critical role in shaping cognitive load during L2 speech processing. Future research should examine how rhythmic sensitivity interacts with other factors across diverse L2 listening contexts and populations.",

They reported their momentary positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), vitality, and alertness up to six times per day. We analyzed associations of light exposure in the previous 5, 60, and 180 minutes with these different aspects of well-being.\nResults: Multilevel models showed that both brighter overall levels of melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (mEDI) and longer time spent above 250 lx mEDI were associated with higher high arousal PA, vitality, and alertness but not with lower NA. Additional analyses indicated that for PA and vitality this association may mainly exist for natural daylight whereas the light source did not matter for alertness. Exploratory analyses of higher thresholds (500-750 lx mEDI) partly yielded stronger effects.\nConclusion: This pattern of results may suggest energizing and activating effects of light exposure and future research should determine whether light exposure behavior could be a target for interventions to increase health and well-being in daily life.",

A community sample of Dutch-speaking adults (N=832; mean age: 55(SD:13)) completed self-report measures on psychological flexibility and mental health. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor second-order model representing psychological flexibility and inflexibility, providing a good fit for both the full and short versions. Regarding the MPFI-24 the 12-factor model had an even better fit. Internal consistency across all subscales of both instruments was good. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that psychological flexibility and psychological inflexibility were prospectively associated with well-being and mental health complaints, respectively. However, when both constructs were included in the regression models, only psychological inflexibility emerged as a significant predictor of mental health complaints, including depression, anxiety and stress. The findings support the use of the Dutch MPFI as a valuable tool for assessing psychological flexibility and psychological inflexibility, with the shorter MPFI-24 offering a more practical and efficient alternative in both clinical practice and research.",

It is particularly important to include languages that are highly dissimilar to widely studied languages like English. Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic) is one such language – a polysynthetic language of the Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language family spoken by approximately 60,000 people in Greenland and Denmark. A previous study of five Kalaallisut speakers with aphasia (Nedergaard et al., 2020) indicated that non-fluent aphasia in Kalaallisut exhibited different features from those found in English and similar Indo-European languages. However, the previous study was limited by its low number of participants, its focus only on semispontaneous speech narratives, and the fact that a more complete description of aphasia in Kalaallisut was not available. An essential prerequisite for incorporating data from an underresearched language in aphasiology is having sufficient information to reliably identify speakers with aphasia in that language. Gaining such information was the main aim of the present study where we tested a total of 42 speakers of Kalaallisut on repetition tests, language production tests, language comprehension tests, and working memory tests. We used a combination of qualitative judgments by a speech and language pathologist and hierarchical cluster analysis to analyze the results and were able to distinguish between presence or absence of aphasia, between levels of severity of aphasia, between apraxia of speech/dysarthria and aphasia, and to some extent between different aphasia subtypes.",

Remarkably, we found the opposite—accuracy was lower for standard bar or line plots depicting averages than for raw-data plots. This discovery stemmed from two observed phenomena: (1) average-blindness—the mislocation of explicitly marked averages, often placed within bars or along lines rather than at the intended markers; and (2) ensemble-acuity—the accurate estimation of averages from raw data (or ensembles), with variability comparable to confidence intervals and few outright errors.

          "abstract": "The hippocampus is a cognitive hub whose functions are disrupted in most major neurodegenerative dementias. Despite substantial knowledge of its anatomy, physiology, and circuitry, a unifying account that links hippocampal computations, functions and clinical manifestations is lacking. Drawing on recent advances in generative artificial intelligence and systems neuroscience, we conceptualize the hippocampus as a latent diffusion engine that compresses sensory, internal, and cognitive inputs into low-dimensional representations and then regenerates percepts, episodic memories, and imagined scenes for cortical integration. Travelling waves of cortico-hippocampal oscillations, aligned with large-scale functional gradients, schedule and structure this generative process, organizing distributed neural activity into coherent, semantically grounded constructs. Specifically, we propose a stochastic latent oscillatory diffusion (SLOD) framework that maps specific hippocampal–cortical computations onto biological substrates and dynamical processes. The computational architecture mirrors the dominant text-to-image generative AI algorithms (specifically latent diffusion models), adapted and translated into the biological embedding of the cortex and hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrate how major neurodegenerative dementias - including the Alzheimer’s disease spectrum, dementia with Lewy bodies, and the frontotemporal dementia spectrum - can be interpreted as selective breakdowns of the anatomical and computational components of this proposed architecture.",

          "abstract": "The transition from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) presents a shift that necessitates moving beyond purely algorithmic solutions toward a sociotechnical perspective. Our article argues that determining the moral compass of AGI is fundamentally a problem of cognitive compatibility and design constraints. We integrate established Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) principles, specifically Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), Joint Cognitive Systems, and Distributed Situation Awareness, to address the process gulf arising from the opacity of AGI goal pursuit. We critically examine seminal AI safety thought experiments through the lens of automation surprises and mode error. Furthermore, we adapt Rasmussen’s Risk Management Framework to model AGI alignment as a hierarchical control problem, introducing the concept of Ecological Alignment Interfaces to visualise the safety envelope. Finally, we argue that AGI safety requires Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment and the rigorous, non-iterative safety protocols found in High Reliability Organisations (HROs). We conclude that the HFE discipline offers the essential toolkit for defining the design constraints necessary for safe AGI.\n\nPractitioner Summary:\nThis article argues that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a sociotechnical challenge requiring Human Factors expertise. This article demonstrates how practitioners can apply Cognitive Work Analysis and Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes to define the moral compass of AGI as a set of rigorous design constraints. We provide a framework for using Rasmussen’s Risk Management model to design governance structures that maintain human control over opaque, autonomous systems.",

          "abstract": "Sleep problems rise in prevalence during adolescence and young adulthood and pose risk for a myriad of negative mental and physical health outcomes. Existing behavioral sleep interventions assumes existing moderate to severe sleep problems and that these problems are caused by behavioral habits, not structural/environmental factors. This study tested the proximal impacts of Project Sleep, a digital single-session intervention (SSI) for young people with mild sleep problems OR an interest in learning about sleep habits, with the aim of reducing and preventing sleep problems. This study specifically investigates whether there are differential effects of the intervention for those with structural sleep barriers, to lay the groundwork for future randomized controlled trial and long-term follow up studies assessing the effects of this intervention for this group. Participants were aged 13-25 with self-reported sleep problems (N=759, Mage=18.7; 48% white, 81% girls, 38% LGBTQ+). Structural sleep barriers were reported by 45%: uncomfortable temperature (20%), exceess noise (17%), shared rooms (13%), excess light (10%), nighttime workers in the home (7%), unstable living conditions (2%). Participants rated perceived importance of sleep and making a change to sleep, readiness for change, and perceived control over sleep pre- and post-SSI. Moderation models assessed whether structural factors influenced outcomes. T-tests and correlations tested whether participants’ feedback differed by structural barriers. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, those experiencing structural barriers improved similarly to peers on all pre/post-SSI change metrics (corrected ps &gt; .05). There were also no differences in participants’ feedback about their experience of the SSI by structural barrier (ps &gt; .05). This study thus provides preliminary evidence that Project Sleep may be an effective sleep health promotion tool among young people, including those with structural sleep barriers. However, given this study measured only proximal impacts, future research should continue to test these questions using a randomized controlled trial and long-term follow-up design.",

          "abstract": "Social rejection and acceptance are typically investigated from the perspective of individuals receiving, or observing, such information independent of others. However, experiences of rejection and acceptance often unfold in dyadic contexts, and can have implications for how partners interact, relate, and support each other, especially when partners experience incongruent social feedback (e.g., when others express caring for you but disapprove of your partner). How do people respond to a partner’s outcomes when faced with this type of challenging (i.e., incongruent) information? Employing a novel dyadic task, we examined affective responses to simultaneous social feedback information among cohabiting couples (Nparticipants = 168). Consistent with preregistered hypotheses, participants reporting higher positive relational interdependence were more likely to experience their partner’s social feedback as a personal reward or loss. This pattern emerged even when participants received incongruent social feedback (e.g., receiving negative feedback while a partner received positive feedback). Moreover, positive affect for a partner’s social feedback was associated with being responsive to the partner’s outcomes (i.e., higher perceived partner support, and perceived capitalization attempts). Together, findings suggest that positive relational interdependence allows people to respond sensitively to their partner’s rewarding and aversive events despite interference that may come from self-directed challenging (i.e., incongruent) information.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the impact of attention training, through mindfulness meditation, on driving performance.\n\nDesign: Prospective, active-controlled, longitudinal study.\n\nSetting: A training and research institute in Paris.\n\nParticipants: 186 healthy volunteers aged 20–35 years, with no previous attention or meditation training.\n\nInterventions: Two types of training were evaluated: the Mindfulness-Based Short Intervention (MBSI) and the Mindfulness-Based Mobile Intervention (MBMI). The MBSI cohort (n=57) participated in a 6-week online program consisting of six 1.5-hour sessions delivered by a trained instructor, combined with daily 20-minute audio-guided meditations in pairs. The MBMI cohort (n=61) engaged in autonomous pre-recorded audio-guided meditation practice using the Petit Bambou application, with an average frequency mimicking the general public’s use of 3–4 meditations per week, each lasting approximately 11 minutes. The control group (n=68) received no attention training.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was evaluation of reaction time on a driving simulator in six different contexts (Exercises 1–6) before and after attention training. Comparison of MBSI and MBMI was a secondary outcome.\n\nResults: Compared with baseline, the MBSI cohort demonstrated statically significant improvements in mean reaction time and attentional performance in three driving exercises by up to 108 ms, 53 ms and 48 ms (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001 and p=.005), and the MBMI cohort in two\ndriving exercises by up to 90ms and 40 (p=.002 and p&lt;.001). Our study did not show any significant interaction between group and time and no significant difference between-cohort, but post hoc analysis showed a significant improvement in Ex5 of 48 ms in reaction time for\nMBSI only, p = 0.005 and no significance for MBMI, p = 0.75 or control, p = 0.09. In Ex1, 2 post hoc analysis showed significant improvement in reaction time for all groups for the MBSI, 108 ms, p &lt; 0.001, as well as MBMI, 90 ms, p = 0.002 but with a result so close to the significance limit of p&lt;0.05 for the control group, p = 0.046 that it could be considered not significant.\n\nConclusions: Attention training through mindfulness meditation enhanced reaction time and potentially improved other measures of driving performance (i.e., attentional agility; peripheral vision; selective, sustained and executive attention; attentional fatigue), suggesting that meditation practice could be recommended as a preventive measure to improve driver safety",

According to one account, it decreases worries about other issues (e.g., the finite pool of worry hypothesis). In the second account, it increases worry (e.g., generalized affect hypothesis, availability heuristics). We conducted a web-based experiment on representative samples of adults in the Czech Republic and Poland (total N = 7,051). We manipulated worry about one of three societal issues and measured the effect of this manipulation on the degree of worry about 12 unrelated issues. We also examined the underlying mechanism by looking at whether the effect was mediated by affect (a mechanism related to generalized affect) and moderated by issue similarity (a mechanism related to availability heuristics). The study provides strong evidence for a small-sized positive cross-effect of worry. Further, there are strong indications that an effect is mediated by generalized affect, specifically its valence. Our result contributes to a better understanding of how increased worry affects worries about other issues.",

Rewards benefit memory across development, but how reward-associated memories are represented in the brain has not been well characterized. Here we conducted pattern similarity analyses of fMRI data in participants aged 8-25 to elucidate how neural representations in key memory-related brain areas are influenced by reward, and how these relationships change across childhood and adolescence. We found that reward information was reflected in pattern similarity during encoding in ventral temporal cortex and in changes in similarity from encoding to retrieval in anterior hippocampus (aHC). Strikingly, aHC reward-sensitive representations also varied with age such that adults’ memory benefitted from stability of hippocampal representations, whereas younger participants’ memory improvements were associated with greater drift in representations over time. Moreover, across all participants, reward-related univariate activation in the ventral tegmental area was associated with a greater tendency toward representational drift in aHC. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that reward modulates neural memory representations, and that the representational patterns supporting reward-motivated memory shift with age.",

          "abstract": "Stimulating and supporting behavior change is key for health promotion, social care, environmental conservation, and stigma reduction, among other areas. Many behavior change interventions primarily focus on increasing knowledge to improve health promoting behaviors. The underlying assumption is that unhealthy behavior (or failure to engage in health-promoting behaviors) results from ignorance or limitations in understanding the behavior or its consequences and that improving people’s knowledge (broadly defined) will lead to behavior change. In this paper, we argue that while knowledge (narrowly defined) about the recommended behavior is important and necessary, it is often not sufficient. Altering behavior requires addressing various other determinants, such as attitude, self-efficacy, perceived norms, and risk perception. Another consideration is that behavior change methods often used to target “knowledge” are actually methods designed to facilitate learning by enhancing the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information, ultimately supporting long-term memory retention. To target other key determinants of behavior beyond knowledge  a wealth of more effective behavior change methods is available, provided they match the targeted determinants and are correctly applied.. Because knowledge-focused interventions rarely lead to actual behavior change, we recommend health promotion planners to go beyond improving knowledge and differentiate between knowledge and other determinants when choosing behavior change methods. To enhance intervention effectiveness, we emphasize the importance of intentionally targeting additional behavioral determinants that have stronger theoretical and empirical support as drivers of behavior change.",

          "abstract": "Learned helplessness theory suggests that exposure to uncontrollable stress impairs motivation and cognitive flexibility, but how these effects evolve over time remains unclear. This study used a voluntary task-switching paradigm to examine the dynamic impact of controllability on cognitive flexibility under changing reward conditions. A total of 115 undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of three groups: controllable noise, uncontrollable noise, or no-noise control. All completed a baseline and a reward-based phase of the voluntary task-switching task. The reward phase featured four within-subject reward components: increasing, stable-high, decreasing, and stable-low. At baseline, both the uncontrollable and controllable noise groups showed elevated switch rates relative to the control group. However, hidden Markov modeling revealed divergent switching dynamics: participants in the controllable group more frequently transitioned into a high-switching, fast-response state, whereas those in the uncontrollable group predominantly remained in a low-switching state. During the reward phase, only the controllable and control groups modulated their switching in response to reward changes, whereas the uncontrollable group’s behavior remained flat and reward insensitive. Spectral clustering further showed that participants under uncontrollable stress increasingly adopted reward-insensitive behavioral profiles as trials progressed.  \nAlthough both stress groups initially increased switching, only the controllable group sustained adaptive flexibility. In contrast, uncontrollable stress reduced reward sensitivity and fostered rigid behavior—hallmarks of learned helplessness. These effects emerged gradually, underscoring the importance of perceived control and the value of trial-level modeling in capturing the development of helplessness over time.",

          "authors": "Bufan Gao; Xuechunzi Bai",
          "abstract": "Humans learn not only from personal experience but also by observing others. Integrating social information often allows groups to make decisions more efficiently and accurately than individuals, yet it can also generate persistent bias. These opposing outcomes are typically attributed to different mechanisms, with optimal outcomes linked to how people rationally update their beliefs, share information, and make decisions, whereas biased outcomes are attributed to frictions in these processes. Here, we show that the same underlying process -- rational social learning -- can produce both effects. Whether social learning improves or degrades group performance depends on the structure of the environment, particularly how clearly options differ. Using hiring decisions as a relevant context, we study networks of Bayesian-rational learners, generative AI agents, human online participants, and hiring professionals making decisions independently or collectively. Our design strips away common biases in social learning by embedding agents in fully connected networks and sharing information in their original form, while causally varying the decision environment and network structure. Across all four cases, integrating social information improves efficiency when one option is objectively optimal. However, when multiple options are equally optimal, the same learning process amplifies early random signals and prematurely reduces exploration, leading to bias. In these cases, biased outcomes do not reflect a failure of rationality, but rather a predictable consequence of rational inference. These results identify a unifying psychological mechanism underlying both collective intelligence and collective bias, with implications for designing fair decision-making systems in human and AI collectives.",

          "abstract": "Long rhythmic cycles (‘tal’) are a defining feature of North Indian Classical Music (NICM),\nyet their perceptual processing remains largely unexplored in empirical research. These cycles\ncommonly extend up to 16 beats and last more than 3 seconds, placing substantial demands on\nmemory capacity. Identifying the first beat is critical for understanding any NICM rhythm\ncycle, as it serves as the structural anchor for rhythmic organisation. How listeners perceive\nand locate this first beat remains an open question in rhythm cognition, particularly in cross-\ncultural contexts where rhythmic structures and enculturated listening strategies differ. This\nstudy introduces a novel rhythm cycle alignment task to examine how cultural familiarity and\nmusical training shape the ability to identify the first beat of long NICM rhythmic cycles.\n\nParticipants were required to align a tone track (beeps) with a continuously looping rhythmic\ncycle in real time, adjusting its position to indicate where they perceived the cycle to begin.\nFour NICM rhythm cycles were tested (7-beat Rupaktal, 8-beat Kehervatal, 10-beat Jhaptal,\nand 16-beat Teental). The study included four participant groups (N = 121): Culturally Familiar\nNICM Musicians, Culturally Familiar (Indian) Non-musicians, Culturally Unfamiliar Western\nMusicians, and Culturally Unfamiliar Western Non-musicians. Results showed that NICM\nmusicians accurately aligned the first beat across all rhythm cycles, demonstrating robust top-\ndown processing. Western musicians performed above chance only for isochronous cycles,\nsuggesting reliance on temporal regularities common in Western music. Neither Indian nor\nWestern non-musicians aligned the first beat above chance. To examine bottom-up strategies,\nalignment responses were compared with acoustic templates derived from the rhythmic stimuli.\nFor all groups except NICM musicians, responses were best predicted by weak-to-strong\ntimbral transitions, indicating a reliance on local acoustic salience rather than cycle-level\nstructure.\n\nOverall, the study presents a replicable method for measuring rhythm-cycle perception and\ndemonstrates that the accurate identification of the first beat in long NICM cycles is culture-\nspecific and dependent on musical training.",

Longstanding models of empathy, however, center the empathizer’s embodied emotional experience, which AI fundamentally lacks. This tension between human experience and traditional researcher-imposed empathy definitions raises important scientific questions as to what it truly means for AI to “empathize.” In the present paper, we propose an alternative definition and approach to studying empathy which eases this tension, emphasizing the multiple dissociable functions that empathy serves within various relational schemas. Taking a functional-relational approach redefines the study of empathy by centering practical meta-scientific concerns (e.g., surrounding the exploration of empathy within study contexts, foregrounding lived experience). In doing so, we seek to future-proof empathy as a construct, ensuring that our science remains relevant, generalizable across time, and responsive to lived human experience as technology advances and new forms of relationships emerge.",

Study 1 experimentally exposed participants to real-world Twitter content and found that content features derived from language model analysis predicted increases in hostility, distress, and nervousness. Study 2 employed a controlled laboratory design with participants’ own Instagram feeds, showing that exposure to polarized content was associated with increases in distress, fear, and shorter viewing duration, while content related to social comparison caused a reduction in enthusiasm and alertness. Methodologically, the project uses large language models within a psychologically interpretable framework, moving beyond black-box classification approaches. The findings offer initial insights for content moderation, platform design, and interventions aimed at mitigating the psychological costs of digital environments, and highlight the value of users' subjective beliefs as meaningful signals for identifying harmful content.",

          "abstract": "Of all the conceptual distinctions that humans can detect in their environment, only a limited set are encoded in grammars, with striking cross-linguistic consistency. Attributes such as numerosity,\nanimacy, and its subdivisions (e.g., sex) recur across languages, structuring grammatical systems in similar ways. This raises the question of whether human cognition is intrinsically biased toward\nlearning these contrasts and using them to organize grammar, or whether their presence can be explained by usage and cue frequency in experience. We address this question using categorization and artificial lexicon learning experiments that contrast animacy with color, a perceptually distinct attribute that is never grammaticalized. In a non-linguistic task (Exp 0), both attributes were spontaneously selected as categorization cues. Novel grammatical systems mapping exclusively onto animacy (Exp 1) or color (Exp 2) were learned equally well. In Exp 3, where cues to the two attributes were equally frequent and ambiguously related to learned words, participants selected either contrast with comparable frequency. Crucially, the two semantic oppositions interacted, with a tendency of color distinction to be encoded more robustly within the animate category. This pattern mirrors cross-linguistic tendencies, where higher-order animacy categories host richer grammatical specifications.\nThese observations reveal an implicit bias in emergent grammatical systems, in which animacy functions as a privileged organizing dimension. We suggest that this bias arises from the salience and\nreal-life frequency of animacy, which provide a reliable foundation for communicative and processing efficiency in grammar and in the broader architecture of language.",

          "abstract": "Emotions influence how we control our thoughts and actions, but theories propose different mechanisms and make opposing predictions how valence and/or arousal modulate control exertion. This meta-analysis of 34 studies (72 experiments, N = 3,748) examined whether and how task-irrelevant emotional stimuli influence the congruency sequence effect (CSE), a widely used measure of control in conflict tasks like Stroop. Overall, results showed increased CSEs following negative compared to positive stimuli across a variety of different experimental procedures (g = .12). This negativity-boost for control was stronger in studies that used tonic (sustained) affect inductions, presented non-threatening stimuli, controlled for feature-binding confounds, and employed the flanker task. In contrast, arousal showed opposing effects depending on the overlap between emotional and task stimuli, as well as the format of the emotional stimuli—for example, high-arousing words or stimuli embedded within the task appeared to facilitate control. The valence findings support affective control accounts suggesting that negative affect enhances control adjustment. The arousal findings are compatible with theories assuming that emotional stimuli interact with attentional resources. Based on these results, we offer a tentative integrative framework that combines elements from several existing models to explain how emotional stimuli can interact with control operations.",

          "abstract": "Real-time sentence comprehension relies on memory resources to establish long-distance syntactic dependencies. There is convincing evidence that formation of many dependencies is mediated by hierarchical constraints. However, it remains an open question how richly hierarchical information is represented and employed in memory processes. Here we ask whether hierarchical relations between noun phrases in a sentence as in x c-commands y (Reinhart, 1976) constrain antecedent retrieval for a local anaphor. We measure the real-time reactivation of c-commanding target antecedents and distractors in processing the Turkish reciprocal birbirleri via three visual world studies. Unlike existing studies that confounded multiple cues, we disentangled c-command from other structural information (clause-mateness, case, subjecthood) and linear order/recency. Experiment 1 compared the availability of c-commanding subjects and non-c-commanding, clause-mate, similarly case-marked distractors; and showed that c-commanding subjects were rapidly distinguished from distractors within the reciprocal window, irrespective of their linear order. Experiment 2 revealed that immediate availability of c-commanding subjects extends to c-commanding indirect objects. Experiment 3 was a pre-registered, high-power replication that yielded similar results. We found limited evidence for interference from distractors, which was not replicated. Overall, we find that hierarchical, item-to-item relations between noun phrases rapidly determine antecedent availability in retrieval beyond other cues. We suggest that hierarchical information may guide access to c-commanding items during retrieval if item representations include hierarchically informed features targeted by retrieval cues; alternatively, hierarchical information may shape the organization of items in memory, with c-commanding items represented in a privileged store allowing direct access during retrieval.",

However, the relative predictive effects of these different constructs on science learning are understudied in children despite the relevance of elementary school to science understanding and engagement. This study examined whether U.S. third-graders’ fixed mindset, science identity, and conceptions of science predicted learning of evolutionary mechanisms from a curriculum on evolution. It also explored whether these variables showed changes after the life science curriculum. Fixed mindset decreased, and science conceptions shifted from stereotypical views toward core understandings of science as evidence-based and explanatory. The most consistent predictor of learning was children’s conception of science as explanatory. These results provide preliminary support for the idea that children’s abstract understanding of science is relevant to their science learning. \n\nKeywords: Conceptions of Science, Nature of Science, Mindset, Science Identity, Cognitive Development, Elementary Science Education.",

          "authors": "Robert Dennis Henry",
          "abstract": "Replicating observational‐coding studies is notoriously difficult: coder variance attenuates effect sizes, protocols can be opaque, and raw text/video/audio cannot always be shared. This tutorial presents a three-step, open science workflow that links design decisions to reproducibility outcomes, assuming interchangeable observers and simple mean rating scores. Step 1 shows how (under the appropriate assumptions) the Spearman-Brown Prophecy and attenuated correlation formulas translate coder reliability into sample size targets; in an illustrative example, we illustrate that with two coders and N ≈ 158 participants, researchers retain 80% power to detect a correlation of r = .30. Step 2 provides a six step loop from training coders to calculating inter-rater reliability. This protocol emphasizes the importance of creating agreement matrices and running periodic inter-rater reliability checks; using simulated data, we demonstrate how off diagonal errors pinpoint coder drift. Step 3 addresses coder positionality and ethical data sharing, offering a decision tree that maps media sensitivity and participant consent onto data repository options. Annotated code, simulated data, and a brief consent template are hosted on the OSF repository for this tutorial. Adopting this pipeline enables researchers to plan, monitor, and disseminate observational work in a way that is both transparent and statistically robust.",

          "abstract": "Eco-anxiety, defined as the psychological distress related to awareness of climate change, has gained increasing attention but remains conceptually and empirically fragmented. Existing tools such as the Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS) and the Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS) capture only partial aspects of the phenomenon. This study aimed to test the continuum hypothesis of eco-anxiety by jointly calibrating these two instruments within an item response theory (IRT) framework. A French sample of 534 participants completed a combined version of the CCAS and HEAS, analyzed using the Graded Response Model. Results showed a satisfactory unidimensional fit, with all items displaying acceptable discrimination. The HEAS predominantly assessed moderate manifestations, while the CCAS reflected more severe functional impairments. However, nearly a quarter of respondents with the lowest levels of eco-anxiety were not captured by either scale, indicating insufficient coverage of the mildest forms. External validity was supported through strong correlations with negative emotions and emotion-focused coping, but weaker associations with action-oriented strategies. These findings support the eco-anxiety continuum and highlight the need for refined tools capable of covering its entire spectrum, from adaptive concern to clinical manifestations.",

To address this question, we combined multidimensional experience sampling (MDES) with an altruism task administered online or in person (total N = 320). Participants made monetary sharing decisions across social contexts that varied in partner cues (distressed, neutral, unidentifiable), while intermittently reporting their ongoing thoughts using MDES. Dimensionality reduction of MDES responses using principal component analysis revealed a small set of common, interpretable, and robust thought patterns characterizing moment-to-moment cognition during social choice. Critically, the expression of these thought patterns tracked variation in social context, generosity, and model-based parameters indexing fairness preferences. Moreover, these patterns generalized to a separate non-social task that did not require social behavior, indicating that they reflect common patterns of cognition rather than task-specific artifacts. Together, these findings provide initial evidence that ongoing thoughts offer a reliable window into social preferences, introducing a novel framework for studying the link between ongoing cognition and social behavior in the laboratory and everyday life.",

Children in cold-weather regions (Wisconsin, Montreal) produced significantly more winter-related words compared to peers in milder climates (Texas, Florida), while seasonal analyses showed that within populations, winter word acquisition and knowledge peaked in the coldest months and declined during the warmest months. This pattern was most pronounced in older children, and in bilinguals with greater language exposure.

          "abstract": "Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic stressors during childhood and are a strong predictor of alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adolescence and into adulthood. Given that Mexican-origin adults exhibit some of the highest rates of heavy drinking, identifying factors that buffer the effects of ACEs among Mexican-origin adolescents is critical.  \n \nMethod: Data were collected between April 2021 and October 2024 in a 3-Wave longitudinal study from a community sample of Mexican-origin youth. Bilingual, bicultural research assistants facilitated data collection. Logistic regression models were employed to examine prospective associations between family-level (e.g., maltreatment) and community-level (neighborhood violence) ACEs and alcohol outcomes. Familism and family cohesion were evaluated as potential protective factors of these associations. \n \nResults: The sample included 344 Mexican-origin adolescents (Mage = 15.2 at Wave 3) from northern Indiana, USA. Family-level ACEs at Wave 1 were associated with increased odds of alcohol use at Wave 2 and risky drinking and AUD at Wave 3. Community-level ACEs at Wave 1 were associated with increased odds of risky drinking at Wave 2 only. While familism and family cohesion were negatively associated with alcohol use outcomes, familism at Wave 1 exacerbated the association between family-level ACEs at Wave 1 and alcohol use at Wave 2. \n \nConclusions: Our findings underscore the detrimental effects of ACEs on alcohol related outcomes during adolescence for Mexican-origin youth. While familism and family cohesion may serve as a general protective factor against alcohol use, familism may increase the risk for alcohol use in the context of family-level ACEs (e.g., maltreatment, household dysfunction). Equipping families with tools to strengthen relationships and prevent ACE exposure is crucial for fostering resilience and promoting long-term well-being.",

          "authors": "Tobias M. Peters; Kai Biermeier; Ingrid Scharlau",
          "abstract": "When humans interact with artificial intelligence (AI), one desideratum is appropriate trust. Typically, appropriate trust encompasses that humans trust AI except when they either explicitly notice AI errors or when they are suspicious that errors could be present. So far, appropriate trust or related notions have been mainly investigated by assessing trust and reliance. In this contribution, we argue that these assessments are not sufficient to measure the complex aim of appropriate trust and the related notion of healthy distrust. We introduce and test the perspective of visual attention as an additional indicator for appropriate trust and draw conceptual connections to the notion of healthy distrust.\n\nTo test the validity of our conceptualization, we formalize visual attention using TVA and measure its properties potentially relevant to appropriate trust and healthy distrust in an image classification task. Thereby, we investigate participants’ attentional capacity and attentional weight towards correct and incorrect classifications. \nWe observe that misclassifications reduce attentional capacity compared to correct classifications. However, our results do not indicate that this reduction is beneficial for a subsequent judgment of the classifications. The attentional weighting is not affected by the classifications’ correctness but by the difficulty of categorizing the stimuli themselves. These results, their implications, and the limited potential for using visual attention as an indicator of appropriate trust and healthy distrust are discussed.",

          "abstract": "White matter microstructure is a candidate neurobiological substrate underlying individual differences in fluid intelligence, potentially through differences in neural information transfer. Investigating the association between white matter microstructure and fluid intelligence requires precise modeling of these microstructural properties across the brain. Yet, it remains unclear whether MRI-derived markers of white matter microstructure generalize across tracts to support latent modeling approaches. Therefore, our primary objective was to derive measurement models for markers of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA), neurite density (intra-neurite volume fraction, INVF), and myelin content (magnetization transfer ratio, MTR) across 52 tracts (HCP-1065 atlas) grouped into ten functional clusters. We investigated data of N = 365 individuals (age range: 18−74) drawn from two independent samples (Dortmund Vital Study: 𝑁 = 150, Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05155397; Mainz Network Study: 𝑁 = 215). Confirmatory factor analyses consistently favored hierarchical bifactor models, capturing both a general factor per marker and orthogonal hemisphere-specific factors, independent of participants’ age. The general factors FA and MTR of the favored measurement models were significantly associated with fluid intelligence, assessed with matrix reasoning tests, FA: 𝛽 = 0.26, 𝑝 &lt; .001 and MTR: 𝛽 = 0.25, 𝑝 = .017. When controlling for age, the association of fluid intelligence with FA remained significant, 𝛽 = 0.14, 𝑝 &lt; .043, while the association with MTR was no longer significant, 𝛽 = 0.11, 𝑝 = .328. These findings establish anatomically informed measurement models for white matter microstructure and provide a scalable framework for investigating the biological underpinnings of cognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "Interest in the psychology of misinformation has exploded in recent years. Despite ample research, to date there is no validated framework to measure misinformation susceptibility. Therefore, we introduce Verification done, a nuanced interpretation schema and assessment tool that simultaneously considers Veracity discernment, and its distinct, measurable abilities (real/fake news detection), and biases (distrust/naïvité—negative/positive judgment bias). We then conduct three studies with seven independent samples (Ntotal = 8,504) to show how to develop, validate, and apply a Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST). In Study 1 (N = 409) we use a neural network language model to generate items, and use three psychometric methods—factor analysis, item response theory, and exploratory graph analysis—to create the MIST-20 (20 items; completion time &lt;2 minutes), the MIST-16 (16 items; &lt;2 minutes), and the MIST-8 (8 items; &lt;1 minute). In Study 2 (N = 7,674) we confirm the internal and predictive validity of the MIST in five national quota samples (US, UK), across 2 years, from three different sampling platforms—Respondi, CloudResearch, and Prolific. We also explore the MIST’s nomological net and generate age-, region-, and country-specific norm tables. In Study 3 (N = 421) we demonstrate how the MIST—in conjunction with Verification done—can provide novel insights on existing psychological interventions, thereby advancing theory development. Finally, we outline the versatile implementations of the MIST as a screening tool, covariate, and intervention evaluation framework. As all methods are transparently reported and detailed, this work will allow other researchers to create similar scales or adapt them for any population of interest.",

          "abstract": "The short-term and long-term memory systems are thought to interact via chunks – long-term memory representations that support maintenance of information for a short term. The creation and use of chunks is examined in the Hebb repetition paradigm, where participants repeatedly study and retrieve the same list of serially presented memoranda (a so-called Hebb list), which ultimately become chunked. Studies conducted to date underscore the inflexible nature of thus created chunks, which always encompass the exact series of memoranda. However, the long-term memory system is thought to often rely on schemas – flexibly adjusted representations that allow for generalization and transfer of learning. Here we examined whether the Hebb repetition paradigm can be used to induce the acquisition of schemas and their use to support short-term memory performance. We adapted the Hebb repetition paradigm so that participants learned and retrieved lists of category exemplars. Crucially, what was repeated here in the Hebb list was the order of categories from which those exemplars were taken, while the memoranda themselves changed from one list presentation to another. We demonstrated that in this task participants were able to derive the schema describing category order in the Hebb list and use it to support short-term memory performance for a novel set of schema-consistent memoranda. We conclude that chunks and schemas can be seen as similar types of representations that jointly provide an interface between short-term and long-term memory.",

Using a reinforcement learning framework, we show that participants successfully detected source biases and used this knowledge to correct biased feedback. However, these corrections were incomplete, allowing residual biases to continue shaping beliefs and decisions. Moreover, following exposure to biased sources, participants systematically misperceived unbiased sources as biased.  We demonstrate how these effects can arise from a “dual-learning” process in which both beliefs about source-biases and value-estimates of choice options are updated to minimize discrepancies between outcome feedback and expectations. Our findings highlight the challenge of forming accurate beliefs and offer mechanistic insights regarding how biased environments bias our beliefs.",

Many children experience developmental difficulties in acquiring handwriting skills, a specific learning disorder known as developmental dysgraphia. However, there is a lack of systematic review on the neurocognitive processes underlying different types of developmental dysgraphia in Chinese. To fill in this gap, we first propose a cognitive model of Chinese character handwriting based on adult research. Unlike stage-based theory that assumes distinct mechanisms for adults and children, our review supports the continual development theory, suggesting that similar cognitive stages operate across both child and adult handwriters. Based on the cognitive model of handwriting, we identify five categories of developmental dysgraphia, including surface dysgraphia, phonological dysgraphia, deep dysgraphia, graphemic buffer dysgraphia, motor-spatial dysgraphia, and then review on the relationship between dyslexia and dysgraphia. We systematically review their behavioural syndromes and associated brain regions in both alphabetic languages and Chinese, revealing neurocognitive mechanisms for each type. Finally, we examine current assessment tools for diagnosing dysgraphia, highlight their limitations, and call for development of more comprehensive assessments for developmental dysgraphia.",

Integrating non-MHC risk variants with immunological data especially implicates adaptive immune cells in psychiatric pathogenesis. Epigenetic studies show that resting immune cells carry a ‘poised’ landscape encoding past exposures and predicting future responses, illuminating how genetic variability shapes illness risk from environmental insults such as stress and infection.

          "abstract": "A REVISED AND PEER-REVIEWED VERSION OF THIS PREPRINT IS NOW PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/bdm.70063\n\nSequential collaboration describes an aggregation process intensively researched for numerical judgments which is characterized by a first contributor creating a judgment that is subsequently adjusted or maintained by following contributors. In previous research, participants performing sequential collaboration were only provided with information about the judgment of the person immediately preceding them in a sequential chain. However, in real-world collaborative projects (e.g., Wikipedia, Google Docs projects), more information about the past development of a sequential chain is often accessible or even directly displayed. As a concise piece of such information, we used judgment invariance, that is, the number of times a current judgment remained unchanged in the immediately preceding steps of a sequential chain. We hypothesized that increasing judgment invariance decreases both the probability and the magnitude of participants' judgment changes. Additionally, we hypothesized that the influence would be weakened with increasing expertise of participants. In three preregistered experiments, (G)LMM analyses suggested that increasing judgment invariance decreased the probability and magnitude of judgment changes confirming our hypothesized main effects. Concerning the interaction hypothesis of judgment invariance and expertise, a more ambiguous picture emerged. Experiment 1 was completely consistent with the interaction hypothesis. Experiment 2 supported it concerning the probability but not the magnitude of participants' judgment changes. In Experiment 3, a directionally reversed interaction effect was observed, possibly due to unconscientious participation. We conclude that the insight into the past development of a sequential chain, specifically information on judgment invariance, influences the judgment behavior of contributors in sequential collaborations. In summary, judgment invariance could be established as a substantial influence in sequential collaboration, which comes with practical implications for real-world collaborative projects.",

          "authors": "Philine Thomasius; Christoph Stahl",
          "abstract": "A longstanding issue in psychology is whether learning can occur in the absence of awareness. A recent study reported a robust conditioning effect for pattern-masked nonwords, and a regression of participants’ conditioning effect on their ability to perceptually discriminate between these stimuli found a positive intercept and a nonsignificant slope (Greenwald &amp; De Houwer, 2017). These results were interpreted as evidence for an unconscious learning process operating independently from—and in the absence of—awareness. The present study extended the set of awareness measures and addressed procedural limitations as well as analytical assumptions to scrutinize whether the finding indeed presents evidence for unconscious learning. We also tested the contributions of evaluative, perceptual, and motor processes to the conditioning effect. Results contradicted simple evaluative, perceptual, or motor accounts. While consistent with conditioning in the absence of awareness, results yielded evidence against their independence. We discuss alternative accounts of the effect as well as the assumptions underlying the unconscious-learning claim. Materials (data, analysis code, reproducible manuscript) are available at https://osf.io/3jud6. \nPublic Significance Statement: The issue of unconscious learning is relevant for theories of basic cognitive processes. We investigated a finding suggesting that simple forms of learning can occur in the absence of awareness. We replicated the finding, but our data do not unequivocally support the conclusion that it is based on unconscious learning. Nevertheless, the finding exemplifies how our cognitive systems can spontaneously use barely perceptible regularities in the environment to help adapt our behavior.",

          "authors": "Massimo Köster; Yannick Boddez; Bianca Boicu; Agnes Moors",
          "abstract": "According to goal-directed models of behavior causation, the degree to which an agent expects a response to lead to a valued outcome determines the value they attribute to it and their engagement in this response. Conversely, a response that is not expected to lead to a valued outcome should not be valued or enacted. However, it is conceivable that a response that used to lead to a positive outcome retains some degree of residual value from its past co-occurrences with the outcome. This idea stems from findings that an evaluative conditioning effect - a change in the valence of a conditional stimulus (CS) after having been paired with an unconditional stimulus (US) - can subsist even if the CS no longer signals the occurrence of the US. We tested whether the same principles apply to response values, that is, whether pairing a response with an outcome changes the value of the response in line with the value of the outcome and whether this value remains when the response is no longer paired with the outcome. The research design further allowed us to assess whether potential residual value stems from (a) an intact referential relation between the response and its past outcome or (b) a change in the intrinsic value of the response, and (c) whether such a residual value would be sufficient to elicit the response itself. The study used a novel task in which a learned contingency between a response and a valued outcome was removed and liking of and engagement in the response were compared to those of a response for which the same contingency was absent from the start. In line with goal-directed models, we did not observe residual liking nor responding for the response that previously led to the positive outcome relative to the response that never did.",

          "abstract": "With online data collection becoming increasingly common in developmental research, it is crucial to validate the comparability of virtual online and offline in-person methods in assessing children’s cognitive processes and behavior. We examined differences in 3- and 4-year-olds’ choice behavior and strategy use in a probability learning task when tested either online via video chat (n = 60) or offline in person (n = 39). Consistent with previous research, children’s performance across the two testing modalities was similar when averaged across trials. However, we found an interaction between testing modality and trial block: Children tested online were less likely to choose the more frequently rewarded option toward the end of the task than were children tested offline. Computational modeling analyses revealed differences in value-based learning across testing modalities: Children who were tested offline chose the higher-valued option more deterministically toward the end of the task than children tested online. In sum, our findings highlight the importance of considering task length and the characteristics of the online testing environment to ensure valid comparisons between online and offline studies in developmental research and add to a growing body of literature highlighting the context-dependency of reinforcement learning parameters.",

          "authors": "Ryan Panela; Alexander Barnett; Yulia Lamekina; Morgan Barense; Bjorn Herrmann",
          "abstract": "Everyday speech comprehension involves interpreting overarching themes as they unfold continuously overtime and structuring experiences for effective encoding and future recall. Characterizing downstream cognition, particularly how the brain perceptually organizes and encodes information, can help elucidate some of the mechanisms underlying listening effort. Recent advances in memory research highlight event segmentation, the process of identifying distinct events within dynamic environments, as a core mechanism to how we perceive, encode, and recall experiences. In the current study, we examine how background noise affects event segmentation during speech listening and its downstream effects on memory. Participants listened to and segmented narratives presented at varying signal-to-noise ratios (clear, +2 dB SNR, –4 dB SNR) and subsequently completed a free recall task. Increasing background noise reduced segmentation consistency and recall accuracy, indicating that challenging acoustics disrupt perceptual organization and encoding; however, listeners continued to identify meaningful event boundaries even when intelligibility declined by approximately 30%. Our analyses further suggest that segmentation was predominantly anticipatory, with listeners marking event boundaries towards the end of an event, suggesting a proactive updating of event models rather than a reaction to a prediction error. Additionally, segmentation-recall coupling was strongest under moderate noise, implying that moderate listening difficulty may enhance engagement. Ultimately, these findings demonstrate that while the adverse conditions impair detailed encoding, the cognitive mechanisms that structure experience remain robust, offering insight into how listening effort shapes perception and memory in complex, real-world speech.",

          "abstract": "Rule-governed behavior in humans is characterized by relative insensitivity to changes in contingencies, a phenomenon extensively documented in behavior-analytic research. The present study examined whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit analogous patterns of contingency insensitivity. We employed a rock–paper–scissors task in which models repeatedly made choices between two opponents (Sam or Alex). In the first block of 40 trials, selecting the optimal opponent (e.g., Sam) produced a 70% probability of winning, a 15% probability of a tie, and a 15% probability of losing. In the second block of 40 trials, these probabilities were reversed (i.e., Alex was the optimal opponent). Four frontier LLMs in January 2026 (GPT 5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Grok 4.1 Fast, and Gemini 3 Flash) were evaluated under a 2 × 2 experimental design manipulating (a) the presence or absence of a rule describing the opponent's skill level and (b) the extended LLM's reasoning (present vs. absent). In rule conditions, prompts specified the purported skill of the initial optimal opponent (e.g., \"Sam is not very good at this game\"). Results indicated that all models exhibited rule-based insensitivity to contingencies, qualitatively resembling human rule-governed behavior. However, the degree of insensitivity varied across models: GPT 5.2 and Grok 4.1 Fast showed the greatest contingency insensitivity, whereas Gemini 3 Flash and Claude Opus 4.5 were comparatively more sensitive to contingency shift. The effect of extended reasoning varied across LLMs. This study is the first to demonstrate contingency insensitivity in LLMs. These results have important implications for applied LLM contexts, where LLMs' contingency insensitivity might be detrimental.",

          "abstract": "Visual cues play a crucial role in supporting speech comprehension and managing turn-taking during conversation. However, how the use of these cues in everyday interactions changes when auditory information is degraded by background noise or hearing impairment - and how such changes are reflected in gaze behaviour - remains poorly understood.  \nWe investigated gaze and orientation strategies during natural triadic conversations between familiar interlocutors in a canteen setting. Twelve groups, each comprising one hearing-impaired and two normal-hearing participants, engaged in sixteen four-minute conversations under two background-noise conditions (during and outside lunch hours) and two seating configurations, with interlocutors seated either across from or next to the wearer of mobile eye-tracking glasses. Speech was recorded, and eye movements were tracked for either the hearing-impaired participant or one normal-hearing participant per conversation. Higher noise levels during lunch hours increased visual attention towards interlocutors, particularly among hearing-impaired participants. Seating configuration strongly shaped gaze behaviour: side-seated talkers received less direct gaze, and their presence elicited increased visual scanning. At turn offsets, talker gaze reliably predicted the next speaker, whereas listener gaze was less informative when the upcoming talker was not seated directly in front of them. Despite challenging acoustic conditions, gaze remained a robust marker of turn-taking, highlighting its potential relevance for hearing rehabilitation strategies and the development of gaze-informed technologies, such as beamforming hearing aids.",

          "abstract": "Household investment behavior shapes financial wealth inequality, yet the roles of return heterogeneity and risky asset participation remain insufficiently understood. This study examines their distributional effects using individual asset data from the DNB Household Survey and cross-country portfolio information from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Applying the Global Capital Asset Pricing Model, I find that returns do not systematically correlate with financial wealth in the Netherlands. Counterfactual simulations indicate that inequality remains stable under the Dutch status quo. However, rising returns or increased return heterogeneity amplify inequality, particularly if participation gaps persist. Broadening financial market participation mitigates these effects and reduces long-term uncertainty in wealth inequality trends. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "abstract": "We introduce a new source for the study of the kinship networks and careers of local officials in China in the late Qing, that is the late 19th and early 20th century. These officials constituted a local bureaucratic and educational elite, but compared with elite officials, relatively little is known about their characteristics, including their family backgrounds and kin networks. To study them, we have constructed a new dataset from Tongguanlu rosters of officials that include their resumes, degree or other qualifications and rosters of their kin and are available for officials in a variety of locations in China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Information for officials includes not only the names and degrees held by patrilineal father, grandfather, and great-grandfather commonly recorded for elite examination degree holders that have been studied previously, but detailed information about uncles, great-uncles, male cousins, sons, and nephews, and basic information about female kin including mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers, daughters. In contrast with other sources that only include holders of elite exam degrees, Tongguanlu include holders of purchased Jiansheng and Tribute (Gongsheng) degrees, low-level prefectural degrees Shengyuan, and other qualifications. We provide background on the Tongguanlu as a source, describe how we constructed the dataset, summarize its contents, and then present results on the posts, qualifications, and kin networks of local officials. We show that holders of purchased degrees and low-level Shengyuan examination degrees were less likely than holders of higher degrees to come from families with a history of holding degrees, and that officials with regular appointments were more likely to have kin with degrees than officials with acting appointments, or who were expectant officials.",

          "authors": "Daniel Sandvej Eriksen",
          "abstract": "Agenda setting is pivotal to democratic politics and remains in constant flux. With the rise of social media, many argue that political communication has increasingly migrated to these platforms, overshadowing traditional venues like parliament. However, the interplay between social media and the parliamentary venue remains poorly underswtood, even though understanding this relationship is crucial for grasping behavior in both contexts. In this paper, I argue that agendas initiated on social media can find their way into parliamentary discussions. However, while discussion in parliament is among opposition actors’ prime means of confronting the government with its ideas, such discussions carry higher stakes for government actors, making parliamentary talk less cheap for them. This dynamic creates an unexpected opportunity: Government parties can leverage social media to initiate new agendas that opposition parties subsequently introduce into parliamentary debates. In contrast, opposition parties cannot similarly employ social media to force government responses in parliament. Utilizing an original dataset of over 5.5 million tweets by parties and politicians, 400,000 parliamentary questions, and 750,000 news articles from the United Kingdom and Denmark (2015–2022), I employ state-of-the-art automated content analysis techniques. The findings support the proposed ideas. Together, these insights underscore the dynamic interplay between digital platforms and the legislative venue, calling for a renewed understanding of agenda setting in a hybrid communication environment where the boundaries between social media and parliament are increasingly blurred.",

          "authors": "Raffael Heiss; Isabelle Freiling",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms play a central role in shaping today’s information ecosystem, yet access to both their internal data and even publicly visible content remains tightly restricted for academic researchers. This stands in sharp contrast to other industries such as food and pharmaceuticals where researchers can independently study product ingredients and effects. As a result, academic research on social media faces an unprecedented dependency on industry-controlled data, increasing the risk of bias and potentially distorting the evidence needed for effective regulation and policymaking. Drawing on research from other disciplines, we examine how industry influence operates and how researchers’ reliance on platforms for data may amplify industry influence. We identify four challenges in collaborations between researchers and social media platforms: restricted data access, selective funding, hard-to-detect influence, and institutional entanglements. These challenges risk undermining the independence and transparency of research in a field of growing societal relevance. Addressing these challenges requires policymakers to regulate data access, as illustrated by the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which mandates data access for vetted researchers while safeguarding user privacy. In addition, new independent funding mechanisms could help ensure that research agendas remain free from platform interests. In parallel, the social science community must adopt stronger ethical standards and invest in “research on research” to detect and mitigate potential biases in policy-relevant research. With a dual approach – policy reforms and critical academic debates – we can ensure that research on social media platforms serves the public interest rather than platform priorities.",

However, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) may cause technological risks to materialize more rapidly than many climate impacts. This raises fundamental questions for the climate community. How should climate professionals address the potential for AI systems to automate cognitive tasks? How might dramatic technological transformation over shorter timescales affect the relative value of near-term versus long-term research priorities? Drawing on recent developments in AI capabilities, expert forecasting, and risk assessment, I suggest three broad scenarios to guide our thinking about AI development and its implications for climate research. Rather than advocating for any single response, I explore how climate professionals might thoughtfully prepare for multiple possible futures while maintaining commitment to addressing the climate crisis. The analysis considers potential adjustments to research communication, graduate education, and collaborative engagement with the AI safety community, while acknowledging the significant uncertainties inherent in technological forecasting. These questions have no easy answers, but they warrant serious consideration as the climate research community navigates unprecedented technological change alongside ongoing environmental challenges.",

          "abstract": "This article examines critical mineral supply chains through a geo-economic and governance-oriented lens, drawing on Global Value Chain (GVC) theory and insights from asymmetric interdependence. It argues that supply vulnerabilities extend beyond geological endowment and extraction, increasingly reflecting coordination failures across transnational value chains, particularly at midstream and downstream stages involving refining, processing, logistics, certification, and regulatory alignment. While existing scholarship has largely treated hydrocarbon corridors and critical mineral supply risks as separate domains, limited attention has been paid to corridor-based governance arrangements capable of coordinating extraction, transit, processing, and market access across Eurasia.\nThe study adopts a qualitative, policy-oriented methodology combining conceptual analysis, review of institutional and policy frameworks, and an embedded case study of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC serves as an institutional reference to examine how geographically connected actors, including Central Asian producers, Azerbaijan, Türkiye, and European markets, have managed asymmetric interdependence through long-term cooperation, intergovernmental frameworks, and coordinated state and commercial participation.\nBuilding on these insights, the article develops a corridor-based governance perspective for Eurasian critical mineral supply chains. It conceptualizes the Eurasian Critical Minerals Corridor not as an existing institutional structure, but as an analytical framework for examining how variable-geometry cooperation can structure interdependence, reduce exposure to value-chain vulnerabilities, and support more resilient supply arrangements. In doing so, the article advances a governance-centered interpretation of critical mineral supply chains and demonstrates how institutional lessons from energy corridors can inform policy debates on critical mineral security and the political economy of the energy transition.",

          "abstract": "Personal networks influence health and mortality at the individual level, but less is known about how population-scale social network structure relates to mortality. This study examines how US county-level social network structure relates to mortality disparities. Using measures from 21 billion Facebook friendships, we investigate how two structural features of population social networks – cohesiveness and diversity – are associated with age-standardized and age-specific mortality rates. Bivariate results show that measures of social network structure rival smoking rates, median income, and educational attainment in their association with mortality rates. Social network structure remains predictive of mortality even after controlling for traditional measures like socioeconomic status and rural/urban classification. Network diversity is\nassociated with lower mortality in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Network clustering is associated with higher mortality bivariately, but this association reverses after controlling for county-level demographic and socioeconomic factors, revealing a protective effect masked by confounding. Age-stratified analyses further complicate this picture, showing that clustering predicts lower mortality among adults aged 15-64 but higher mortality among those 70 and older. These findings highlight social network structure as an important dimension of place-based health disparities, one not fully captured by conventional measures of socioeconomic composition or spatial segregation.",

Empirische Forschung, insbesondere zu sogenannten „Nachrichtenwüsten“, zeigt, dass der Rückgang von (lokalem) Journalismus mit geringerer Wahlbeteiligung, steigender politischer Polarisierung, sinkendem politischen Wissen sowie schwächerer politischer und wirtschaftlicher Kontrolle einhergeht. Dieser gesellschaftliche Nutzen entsteht in wesentlichen Teilen durch positive Externalitäten und führt zu einer Unterversorgung mit Journalismus. Die Digitalisierung hat dieses Problem verschärft, da sie traditionelle Erlösmodelle (insbesondere durch Werbung und Anzeigen) untergräbt und die wirtschaftliche Verwertbarkeit journalistischer Inhalte erschwert.

A companion paper, however, documented an additional \nasymmetric component: a post-2012 widening of the male-female gap in sexlessness among the \nsexually experienced. This study investigates the distributional mechanism underlying that \nasymmetric gap using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The analysis focuses on \nnever-married, sexually experienced adults aged 25-34—old enough to have accumulated \nmeaningful partner histories, young enough to reflect contemporary market dynamics, and \nrestricted to those actively in the dating market; similar male-specific redistribution appears in \nbroader sexually experienced samples, indicating the pattern is not driven solely by marital \nselection. Among this population, I find a male-specific collapse of the “moderate middle”: the \nshare of men with 3-5 lifetime partners fell from 30.3% to 21.5% (-8.8 percentage points) \nbetween 2006-2010 and 2015-2017. This loss bifurcated: +4.4 pp shifted to the 1-2 category \n(exclusion) and +4.4 pp shifted to 6+ (concentration). Women’s distribution remained stable. \nThe upper tail (10+ partners) actually declined slightly for both genders, suggesting \nconcentration operates specifically in the 6-9 range—not through extreme accumulation. \nBecause this redistribution occurs within the middle of the distribution rather than the extreme \nupper tail, it is poorly captured by standard inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficients) and to \nanalyses focused on top-end accumulation. This distributional pattern—middle collapse rather \nthan upper-tail growth—has gone unrecognized in prior work. The asymmetric gap decomposes \nevenly into exclusion and concentration.",

          "authors": "Raffael Heiss; Isabelle Freiling",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms play a central role in shaping today’s information ecosystem, yet access to both their internal data and even publicly visible content remains tightly restricted for academic researchers. This stands in sharp contrast to other industries such as food and pharmaceuticals where researchers can independently study product ingredients and effects. As a result, academic research on social media faces an unprecedented dependency on industry-controlled data, increasing the risk of bias and potentially distorting the evidence needed for effective regulation and policymaking. Drawing on research from other disciplines, we examine how industry influence operates and how researchers’ reliance on platforms for data may amplify industry influence. We identify four challenges in collaborations between researchers and social media platforms: restricted data access, selective funding, hard-to-detect influence, and institutional entanglements. These challenges risk undermining the independence and transparency of research in a field of growing societal relevance. Addressing these challenges requires policymakers to regulate data access, as illustrated by the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which mandates data access for vetted researchers while safeguarding user privacy. In addition, new independent funding mechanisms could help ensure that research agendas remain free from platform interests. In parallel, the social science community must adopt stronger ethical standards and invest in “research on research” to detect and mitigate potential biases in policy-relevant research. With a dual approach – policy reforms and critical academic debates – we can ensure that research on social media platforms serves the public interest rather than platform priorities.",

          "authors": "Max Reichert; Alzbeta Bartova; Tom Emery",
          "abstract": "This study examines when parents across Europe begin using formal childcare and how the timing of entry is socially stratified by socioeconomic resources, employment, and informal care availability.  Childcare services are central to work–family reconciliation and gender equality. Existing research focuses primarily on whether families use childcare, largely overlooking when they do so. But timing matters because institutional entitlements only translate into real opportunities when households can convert them into use at specific points after childbirth. Using harmonized EU-SILC data from 22 European countries (2003–2020), this study estimates age-specific probabilities of formal childcare use during the first four years after birth. An analysis with matched longitudinal data complements thus study to assess the stability of childcare use once initiated. Formal childcare use rises steeply with child age but displays pronounced social stratification. Higher maternal education, stronger labor-market attachment, and higher household income are associated with substantially earlier entry into formal care. Informal childcare acts as a key substitute, delaying formal entry. Cross-national differences in usage levels and timing are large. Longitudinal results show that once families enter formal childcare, exit is rare. Inequality in childcare use is fundamentally temporal. Advantaged parents convert institutional entitlements into earlier and longer use, while less resourceful households enter later, reinforcing cumulative inequalities in employment trajectories and early childhood environments.",

Concepts, methods, and theories have been borrowed and adapted from biology to cultural evolutionary studies and subsequently applied to the study of the archaeological record. While these developments have loosely defined what constitutes the modern subfield of evolutionary archaeology, we argue that many of its premises fail to sufficiently engage with insights from fields such as ethnoarchaeology or explore theoretical and methodological consequences dictated by the nature of the observational data that archaeologists deal with. Here, we critically review the field of evolutionary archaeology, highlighting the relevance of under-discussed behavioural processes and inferential challenges and question what its critical self-consciousness can lead to.",

Despite the presence of ETP equipment in almost all textile industries in Bangladesh, many factories do not operate them regularly because of high maintenance and operational costs (Rahman &amp; Islam 2020). Rapid industrialization has intensified environmental pollution through the discharge of untreated toxic waste (Islam Rahman and Akter 2021). On the other hand, increasing industrialization is contributing to severe pollution of the environment by poisonous waste discharge. The liquid effluents from industries are causing major havoc to the environment, ecology, agriculture, aquaculture, and public health since the development of textile industries in the country. It had become a prerequisite to set up ETP in each industrial establishment, particularly at dyeing industries that were discharging immense amounts of liquid waste to the rivers every day. However, for the successful implementation of ETPs, industry owners will need to be socially responsible. At the same time, the government should provide factory owners with logistical support and a relaxed timeframe to set up ETPs.",

Three weeks before election day, we sent 1,822 candidates links to two high-quality research briefings on the same immigration reform and tracked which evidence they selected. Partisan-aligned selection is concentrated among extreme parties: far-right Freedom Party candidates disproportionately choose aligned evidence, while centrists show more balanced patterns. A contemporaneous survey of citizens shows that far-right supporters approve of elites’ selective attention to evidence, highlighting alignment between elite behavior and mass preferences. These results identify evidence selection as a key stage in policymaking and suggest that rising far-right strength may amplify reliance on supportive information, increasing the risk of ill-informed policy.",

Leveraging the exogenous variation in waiting time for naturalization generated by those two reforms, we find that immigrants who benefited from less restrictive conditions to become citizens developed a stronger national identification with Germany, both after and during their waiting time for naturalization. The effect was particularly strong for women and for those immigrants that were older at the time of their arrival. A higher attachment to Germany seems to have been mainly driven by psychological and socioeconomic mechanisms: a more liberal regime reduced subjective concerns about discrimination, heightened immigrants’ social and political participation, and fostered their use of the German language.",

          "abstract": "The growing use of algorithm based systems to manage employees has transformed how work is organized and controlled in contemporary organizations. Commonly referred to as algorithmic management, this approach relies on automated decision making to allocate tasks, monitor performance, and evaluate employee outcomes. While such systems are often adopted to enhance efficiency, their implications for human work remain insufficiently understood. This study examined the relationship between algorithmic management and key employee outcomes, with a particular focus on employee autonomy, job satisfaction, and performance.\nUsing a quantitative research design, data were collected through an online survey from employees working in algorithmically managed environments. Established measurement scales were employed to assess the study variables, and statistical analyses were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicate that algorithmic management is negatively associated with employee autonomy and job satisfaction, while demonstrating a significant relationship with employee performance. These results suggest that algorithmic management may improve performance related outcomes but can also constrain employees’ sense of control and satisfaction at work.\nThe study contributes to the growing literature on digital and technology-mediated management by highlighting the dual effects of algorithmic management on human work. From a practical perspective, the findings underscore the importance of designing algorithmic systems that balance organizational efficiency with employee well-being. The study also offers directions for future research on the evolving role of algorithms in shaping the future of work.",

          "abstract": "This qualitative research investigates the constitutive role of communicative framing in the production and internalization of economic poverty among urban poor residents in Manila, Philippines. Anchored in the framing theory and situated within a communication-centric analytic paradigm, the study utilizes semi-structured interviews to examine how macro-level discursive formations emanating from state, media, and institutional actors are translated into micro-level interpretive schemas through which marginalized subjects perceive economic deprivation, agency, and futurity. The analysis demonstrates that participants’ narratives are permeated by hegemonic frames of dependency, passivity, and moralized deservingness, which operate as symbolic constraints that delimit perceived economic agency and normalize structural exclusion. The study contends that communication functions not merely as a descriptive or mediating apparatus but as an infrastructural dimension of economic inequality itself, actively configuring the conditions of possibility for economic action. To deepen the paper’s theoretical portability, we introduce the Communicative Architecture of Governed Exclusion (CAGE) as a mid-range framework specifying how poverty is reproduced through 1) classification (what counts as poverty and who counts as poor); 2) access control (administrative and informational gatekeeping), 3) governance through discourse (moralized narratives of deservingness and dependency), and 4) exclusion effects (internalized passivity, “waiting orientation,” and self-limiting economic agency). CAGE clarifies how framing effects become durable social infrastructure—an architecture that governs inclusion and exclusion through everyday communication.",

          "abstract": "What is the relationship between global and local identification, and how is it linked to political conflict? These questions are central to scholarship on contemporary electoral politics, which has linked the radical right’s rise to a new dimension of political conflict separating tolerant, globally minded voters from exclusionary, locally oriented ones. This cleavage, variously described as universalist–particularist, cosmopolitan–parochial, or globalist–nationalist, implies that collective identification is polarized along a global–local axis and helps drive political mobilization. Yet little is known about how different territorial identities compete with or reinforce each other, let alone how their configurations shape political preferences. Using latent class models and survey data from 35 countries, I find that most Europeans are pluralists, who identify across a range of territories and support mainstream parties. A subset of countries, however, exhibits a division between particularists, who emphasize proximal identities, and expansivists, who emphasize distal ones. Remarkably, both groups converge in their strong attachment to the nation. This division overlaps with educational and geographic divides and separates radical-right supporters from those of new left parties like the greens. The findings demonstrate how collective identities reinforce new electoral divisions while challenging influential accounts of the scope and structure of identity-based polarization.",

Next, the study advances a theory of dynamis and dynamist rites, viewing\nthe current transitional stage of adoption as a contradictory and suspended spatiotemporal journey.\nIt draws on liminality and liminoid formations to highlight this limbo-like phase, which\nnonetheless harbors an undercurrent of potent possibility.

          "abstract": "Desde el descubrimiento de la penicilina por Alexander Fleming en 1928, el sector farmacéutico se ha expandido aceleradamente hasta convertirse en uno de los segmentos más poderosos de la economía global, con una facturación anual cercana a US$ 1,5 billones y corporaciones valoradas en cientos de miles de millones de dólares. Aunque los avances científico-tecnológicos y las transformaciones socioeconómicas han impulsado la investigación y el desarrollo de medicamentos, la literatura crítica ha señalado prácticas controvertidas de influencia corporativa — aquí sintetizadas como “Influencia, Desvíos y Excesos”— que favorecen la rentabilidad y la consolidación del poder, en ocasiones en tensión con el interés colectivo y la salud pública. En este contexto, el artículo adopta un diseño exploratorio-descriptivo y un enfoque mixto, basado en la triangulación de datos públicos, documentos institucionales y revisión crítica de la literatura internacional, con el objetivo de mapear los principales mecanismos de influencia corporativa en el sector farmacéutico a partir de ocho ejes: (i) lobby y financiación electoral; (ii) influencia en organismos de regulación y fiscalización; (iii) influencia en organizaciones de pacientes; (iv) participación en la elaboración de guías clínicas; (v) manipulación, promoción y ocultamiento de investigaciones y ensayos clínicos; (vi) escritura fantasma; (vii) estrategias de ampliación diagnóstica y promoción de enfermedades; y (viii) financiación y provisión de beneficios a prescriptores e instituciones, incluyendo dimensiones psicosociales y formativas. Los resultados muestran que la influencia corporativa opera de manera multiescalar y simultáneamente visible y difusa. En el plano político, el lobby y la financiación electoral se consolidan como instrumentos centrales para moldear el entorno normativo y regulatorio. En el ámbito regulatorio, la recurrencia de conflictos de interés y la circulación de profesionales entre agencias públicas y empresas privadas evidencian vulnerabilidades a la captura institucional. En el campo científico, el patrocinio industrial se asocia a sesgos que afectan el diseño de los ensayos, la publicación selectiva de resultados y la credibilidad de las evidencias, incluyendo prácticas como el ghostwriting. Asimismo, se identifica la actuación de la industria en la ampliación diagnóstica y la medicalización de la vida cotidiana, con efectos sobre la invisibilización de determinantes sociales y alternativas no farmacológicas. En la práctica clínica, los pagos y transferencias de valor a profesionales e instituciones se vinculan a cambios en los patrones de prescripción, incremento de costos y favorecimiento de medicamentos promovidos, incluso mediante beneficios de bajo valor mediados por sesgos cognitivos.",

          "abstract": "A longstanding debate in research on peer effects concerns whether exposure to high-achieving classmates enhances or depresses students’ academic performance. While normative models emphasize positive spillovers, social comparison theories highlight negative contrast effects, and empirical evidence remains mixed. Moreover, it is unclear whether peer effects operate similarly across institutional contexts. This study addresses these issues through a comparative analysis of Italy and Norway, two educational systems that differ markedly in competitiveness, tracking, evaluation practices, and gender norms. Using harmonized, population-wide administrative register data, we follow three full student cohorts from Grade 5 to Grade 8. This longitudinal design allows us to control for prior achievement—an advantage unavailable in international assessments such as PISA, TIMSS, or PIRLS. We estimate value-added school fixed-effects models that exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in peer composition. Across both countries, higher average peer achievement is associated with lower individual performance, consistent with social comparison mechanisms. Exposure to top-performing peers has negative effects, while exposure to low-performing peers has positive effects. These patterns are similar across countries and do not vary systematically by gender, suggesting that peer comparison processes are remarkably stable across institutional contexts.",

For the EU27 in 2023, current circularity is 15.5% and the DPP scenario implies 45.6% (95% CI: 29.2-62.0), corresponding to potential savings of 52.3 Mt and EUR 64.7 bn (95% CI: 23.8-80.8 Mt; EUR 29.5-100.0 bn). We also provide a proxy estimate of refurbishment-related employment exposure based on Eurostat production value per employee in NACE J.

This study investigates the adoption of preprinting over time, focusing on how it varies across scientific disciplines and geographical regions. We analyzed bibliometric data on 4M preprints and 105M peer-reviewed outputs in the period 1991-2023. Peer-reviewed outputs were linked to preprints using data from Dimensions, OpenAlex, and Crossref, resulting in 2.2M peer-reviewed outputs linked to a preprint. Our findings indicate a strong growth in preprinting, with a nearly threefold increase in the number of preprints published between 2017 and 2022. The adoption of preprinting is highest in the physical and mathematical sciences, particularly among researchers in the Americas and Europe. In recent years, preprinting has also increased notably in the information and computing sciences and the life and medical sciences, driven primarily by researchers in North America and Western and Northern Europe. Preprinting remains relatively uncommon in the humanities and the social and behavioral sciences. Asia demonstrates low preprint adoption, with Eastern Asia showing a modest increase in recent years. Preprint adoption in specific disciplines varies significantly across regions, showing that preprint adoption is shaped by the interplay between disciplines and regions.",

          "authors": "Viyaleta Korsunava; Boris Sokolov",
          "abstract": "Non-probability web surveys offer several advantages over face-to-face (F2F) interviews—they are cheaper, faster, more accessible, and reduce interviewer effects and desirability bias. As such, they are increasingly popular in both academic and commercial research. However, they often yield demographically biased samples, raising concerns about the accuracy of the resulting public opinion estimates. Most studies on web surveys focus on developed countries, with limited attention to non-WEIRD contexts. Addressing this gap, we compare data from the Values in Crisis (VIC) survey (2020–2021, opt-in online panels with quota sampling) and the 7th wave of the World Values Survey (WVS; 2017–2022, probability-based multi-stage stratified sampling) across nine countries: Brazil, Chile, China, Germany, Greece, Japan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United Kingdom. We assess differences in demographic coverage and national mean scores on 15 attitudinal items, including trust, national pride, religiosity, life satisfaction, postmaterialism, and support for gender equality and reproductive freedom. WVS samples more closely match national demographics, though VIC performs comparably in some cases. Substantively, web surveys show higher (up to 20–30 p.p.) acceptance of gender equality, abortion, and homosexuality and lower religiosity, national pride, and life satisfaction. These differences persist even after adjusting for demographic imbalances and restricting WVS samples to internet users.",

          "abstract": "Value-driven governance is a prominent topic in AI regulation, with both state actors and tech companies professing a commitment to values like fairness and safety. Despite this seeming agreement, we know little how normative principles are interpreted, operationalized, and assigned responsibilities within particular contexts. This study compares the values invoked within the European Union’s AI Act with policy documents of five major AI companies—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Meta AI, and Mistral AI. Through a combination of frequency analysis and inductive keyword-in-context analysis, we identify prioritized values and map how they are specified in public legislation and corporate policies. Both public and private actors largely invoke the same values (accuracy, authenticity, control, improvement, privacy, safety, and security) but sometimes differ in their specification. While values like privacy, security, and safety typically mean the same thing in policy discourses, we found stark differences in the understanding of improvement, tensions between technical and normative operationalizations of values, and shifts of responsibilities for upholding values from one stakeholder to another. Value specifications surface the politics of values in AI regulations, exposing how private actors employ polysemy to claim alignment with the public interest while avoiding substantial accountability. When it comes to value-driven governance, the devil is in the details.",

Results show a high mean similarity between both tools (cosine: 0.7766, Pearson: 0.5478, Euclidean: 16.59) indicating that the proposed methodology is able to search and combine different online resource types efficiently and with enough quality.  In addition, the application of filters has reduced the average similarity between both tools by up to 15.33%. We publicly release topSEARCH's code to support future research. We also release the database generated with topSEARCH, which contains a total of 27,002 resources for the selected 10 search queries.",

          "abstract": "The Hodges–Lehmann estimator (HL) is widely described (in statistical terms) as a nonparametric, robust, consistent and efficient estimator of central location. While this characterization is correct under standard assumptions—continuous, unimodal distributions on a meaningful metric scale—its application to ordinal grading data such as university marks is problematic. Using explicit counterexamples, we show that the HL estimator can exhibit severe jump discontinuities: minimal changes in the sample leads to large, discrete changes in the HL estimate. This behavior persists under sample size inflation by replication. This shows that the HL should not be used to represent a central location in ordinal grading data as frequently present at universities.",

          "abstract": "Individualism, the prioritization of personal distinctiveness over group conformity, is theorized to increase with economic development. This study tests this hypothesis over a century (1900–2022) across 95 French départements, using name uniqueness as a behavioral proxy. We first validate this proxy at the subnational level, showing that name uniqueness correlates with regional survey-based individualism indices (World Values Survey), even after controlling for immigration rates. Using complete civil registry data (N ≈ 79 million) and a bootstrapped name uniqueness score, we then analyze its relationship with economic development across space and time. Our analysis yields three key findings. First, longitudinal analysis reveals a strong positive association: as GDP per capita increased nationally over the 100-year period, name uniqueness rose significantly across all départements. Second, after removing shared temporal trends by standardizing variables within each year, effectively treating départements (n = `r nobs(norm_model_boy)`) as small, culturally and socially identical countries, GDP per capita continues to predict higher name uniqueness. Third, we uncover nuanced patterns: the relationship was moderated by gender, particularly during the World Wars, and rising economic inequality between regions was accompanied by growing divergence in naming practices, suggesting that development drives both cultural individualism and cultural stratification. Together, these results provide robust, fine-grained evidence that economic development fosters a cultural shift toward greater individualism.",

In a context of increasing social, mental, and physical vulnerability, there is wide agreement on the need to address health and social needs in an integrated manner. Yet, considering such “complexity” remains a pervasive challenge for professionals in social and health care, especially due to a lack of operational definitions. This scoping review aims to map existing definitions of complexity in social and health care and to identify shared assessment tools that support interprofessional and coordinated intervention. Methods and analysis. The review will follow the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al., 2018) and updated guidance (Peters et al., 2020). Literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), SocINDEX (EBSCO), Social Services Abstracts (ProQuest), and Cairn.info databases using appropriate keywords, index terms and search equations. All selected study bibliographies will undergo manual screening (\"snowballing\"). Studies will be selected based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, screened by title and abstracts. Data from full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be extracted independently by three authors. Evaluation discrepancies will be resolved through consensus. Results. Findings will be presented in descriptive tables and summarized narratively in relation to the review’s objectives and questions. Conclusion. This scoping review is expected to contribute to the development of an operational definition of complex situations in integrated social and health care and to identify tools that support professionals in assessing these situations in practice.",

          "abstract": "As climate-related hazards intensify, transportation systems play a central role in shaping who is exposed to risk, who can respond, and who recovers mobility and access after disruption. This scoping review synthesizes 88 studies to assess how transportation and hazards research has engaged equity and justice frameworks, what outcomes are used to evaluate inequity, where findings converge or diverge across hazards and disaster phases, and what conceptual gaps constrain progress. We find that the literature is effective at documenting disparities in exposure, evacuation, adaptation, and recovery, largely through population-based comparisons and novel mobility datasets. However, equity is most often treated implicitly, with unequal outcomes reported absent explicit normative or theoretical grounding. As a result, differences are frequently described without clarifying when and why they constitute inequities, limiting comparability across contexts and policy relevance. Evidence is strongest for inequities in transportation-mediated exposure, particularly for extreme heat and access loss driven by network failure, indicating a maturing understanding of transportation systems as active producers of vulnerability. Findings on evacuation disparities are less consistent, reflecting methodological limitations and contextual variation, while recovery outcomes show greater convergence, with marginalized communities experiencing slower or incomplete mobility restoration. Across domains, mismatches persist between commonly used mobility metrics and lived disaster needs, and mechanisms producing inequity—such as disinvestment, governance capacity, caregiving constraints, disability access, labor precarity, and information asymmetries—are often underexamined. We argue that greater engagement with explicit justice frameworks is necessary to move beyond documenting disparity toward explaining inequity and guiding equity-oriented transportation decisions under growing risk and uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "The Karo of North Sumatra, Indonesia, have long expressed a preference for matrilateral cross-cousin (impal) marriage, yet the practice has declined sharply over the past century. To identify the demographic and sociocultural factors underlying this change, we applied an epidemiological approach to cultural evolution, using a case-control design coupled with structural equation modeling (SEM). Ethnographic data from 176 married individuals across 62 villages were analyzed to assess the effects of demographic, alliance, religious, cosocialisation, and modernisation variables on the likelihood of impal marriage. The model fit was strong (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.04), revealing significant direct and indirect effects. Marrying an impal was positively associated with the number of marriageable impal and with arranged or strategically motivated unions but negatively associated with reported religious conflict between spouses. Indicators of modernisation such as schooling and infrastructure were non-significant. These results indicate that the decline of impal marriage reflects demographic contraction and the weakening of alliance-based strategies rather than a rejection of the cultural norm itself. Framed within an epidemiological model of cultural transmission, the findings demonstrate how social practices may fade when the ecological and demographic conditions sustaining them erode, even as their normative value persists.",

          "abstract": "This paper conceptualizes engineered exclusion—the predictable sidelining of disabled users that results from choices about data provenance, model objectives, and evaluation practices within AI systems. We frame this phenomenon through the lived experiences of minimally and nonspeaking autistics whose multimodal communication profiles challenge the speech-centered defaults of current AI pipelines. “Nonspeaking” is not a single condition or an absence of language but a spectrum encompassing users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), from text to gesture, rhythmic movement, and partial vocalizations. Communicative profiles vary across time with fatigue, anxiety, sensory load, and motor planning demands, yet design abstractions erase this variability. By tracing exclusionary mechanisms across speech recognition, text-to-speech, plain-language generation, and interface design, we identify how inequities are structurally produced and propose measurable designed dignity metrics for evaluation and governance. We argue that accessibility must be treated as a core dimension of AI ethics—on par with fairness, privacy, and safety. Re-engineering AI for designed dignity requires systems that recognize embodied, multimodal, and state-dependent forms of communication, expanding what counts as valid signal and responsible innovation.",

          "abstract": "Accurately delineating urban and suburban space has become increasingly difficult. Identifying each setting has long relied on capturing where population density and commuting flows differ, with research and policy often operating with binary measures to separate city from suburb. But as urban and suburban spaces expand, age, and reshape, places emerge that do not definitively fit this binary imagination. The uncertainty this generates creates complexities in claims made about urban and suburban space, but it is rarely addressed within empirical classifications. \n\nThis research focuses on the uncertainty that dichotomous categorizations of place hide. Through a comparison of seven extant definitions of urban and suburban, I identify places that sit reliably in one category or another; but I also highlight the areas of uncertainty and instability. Results demonstrate that there are ‘stable’ urban and suburban areas, but a spatially uncertain transitional space exists where the nature of the landscape is unclear. By delineating these transitional spaces as a third category, I support research and policy that aims to speak clearly about changes in urban and suburban places, while also opening a conversation about how places might move between these two canonical definitions.",

          "abstract": "Most, if not all, multiplayer games have a huge imbalance of teamwork and individualism that contribute very highly to the player experience. This aims to aid in understanding the cooperation and player behavior within a cooperative multiplayer game known as “Gambit’s Gauntlet,” which was designed with this study in mind. Our primary focus is to examine how players in cooperative games can be affected by player behavior and Level Design that affects the balance of Power Dependency (Emerson, 1962) between players when working in a team and whether they can be affected by categorized cooperative sections between levels, team dynamics based on personality types and player skills. The game pushes and tests players on their tolerance for working as a team, and we aim to study this through our qualitative and quantitative tests that would involve analyzing gameplay recordings, surveys, and personality assessments. Our goal is to learn and observe patterns that can affect cooperation, frustration, conflict, and player motivation, which can be an insightful start to creating the perfect game environment by testing all these factors. We also learn about the elements required in cooperative gameplay and how cooperative gameplay can be hindered. We decided to look at Power Dependency, specifically Power Dependency Imbalances (Emerson, 1962) in a dyadic relationship or Cooperation. Our Methodology consists of pre and post-surveys to a playtest testing Power Imbalances and Power Dependency (Emerson, 1962) between unfamiliar participants via our Capstone Cooperative Game “Gambit’s Gauntlet.” The levels used for our playtest were designed to create a power imbalance between players to help us understand how unfamiliar players respond to each other and how they would react when switching the power dependency between them. These behaviors were measured via annotating play sessions by tracking Behavioral Markers (Farah et al. 2022) that we find during gameplay. This playtest had a total of 16 male participants, with ages ranging from 18-30, who were all based around the Boston area, with a mix of university students and young professionals from multiple cultural backgrounds. Thanks to our research and our playtest, we were able to find that power dependency Imbalance done via Level Design encourages communication and cooperative behaviors between players since they will take on the imbalance and accommodate each other for the sake of completing the common goal, which is beating a cooperative game that demands both their involvement and cooperation.",

          "abstract": "This paper analyzes Türkiye's natural gas market reform through the lens of institutional path dependence, demonstrating the failure of textbook liberalization strategies in a system marked by embedded support structures and geopolitical constraints. The delayed restructuring of BOTAŞ and the absence of a clear segmentation framework prevented the emergence of a well-functioning domestic market, constraining price formation and liquidity, and ultimately hindering Türkiye's hub potential.\nTo address this structural gap, this study proposes a unique hybrid institutional pathway operationalized through a novel Dual-Ring Model. This model segments gas supply between a regulated Guardian Ring (for vulnerable consumers) and a market-based Competitive Ring, fostering traded liquidity and authentic benchmark pricing. Drawing on the \"second-best\" institutional approach and the principle of \"embedded autonomy\", the framework argues against full liberalization. The AggregateTR procurement mechanism coordinates strategic state bargaining power, notably leveraging the critical 2026–2030 contract rollover period, with transparent competitive allocation. Two original Structural Market Indicators (SSDI and TVR) monitor support targeting and traded liquidity.\nScenario-based analysis demonstrates how disciplined segmentation and phased support recalibration, including the strategic release of Sakarya Domestic Gas Production into the Competitive Ring, progressively balance supply security, affordability, and benchmark credibility. This framework provides a resilient hybrid gas market architecture grounded in Türkiye's structural context, offering actionable insights for the critical 2026–2030 contract rollover window and the subsequent post-2030 market design. The approach offers replicable lessons for other gas import-dependent emerging economies, reconciling liberalization with strategic state coordination.",

          "abstract": "The growing use of algorithm based systems to manage employees has transformed how work is organized and controlled in contemporary organizations. Commonly referred to as algorithmic management, this approach relies on automated decision making to allocate tasks, monitor performance, and evaluate employee outcomes. While such systems are often adopted to enhance efficiency, their implications for human work remain insufficiently understood. This study examined the relationship between algorithmic management and key employee outcomes, with a particular focus on employee autonomy, job satisfaction, and performance.\nUsing a quantitative research design, data were collected through an online survey from employees working in algorithmically managed environments. Established measurement scales were employed to assess the study variables, and statistical analyses were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicate that algorithmic management is negatively associated with employee autonomy and job satisfaction, while demonstrating a significant relationship with employee performance. These results suggest that algorithmic management may improve performance related outcomes but can also constrain employees’ sense of control and satisfaction at work.\nThe study contributes to the growing literature on digital and technology-mediated management by highlighting the dual effects of algorithmic management on human work. From a practical perspective, the findings underscore the importance of designing algorithmic systems that balance organizational efficiency with employee well-being. The study also offers directions for future research on the evolving role of algorithms in shaping the future of work.",

Through processes of visualization, narrativization, and platformization, CHE Capital becomes legible within contemporary regimes of visibility and evaluation, generating recognition, identity, and hierarchical effects. This paper situates CHE Capital in dialogue with Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital, care ethics, and affect theory, highlighting both its continuities with and distinctions from these frameworks.

Social network structure remains predictive of mortality even after controlling for traditional measures like socioeconomic status and rural/urban classification. Network diversity is\nassociated with lower mortality in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Network clustering is associated with higher mortality bivariately, but this association reverses after controlling for county-level demographic and socioeconomic factors, revealing a protective effect masked by confounding. Age-stratified analyses further complicate this picture, showing that clustering predicts lower mortality among adults aged 15-64 but higher mortality among those 70 and older. These findings highlight social network structure as an important dimension of place-based health disparities, one not fully captured by conventional measures of socioeconomic composition or spatial segregation.",

          "title": "Reconciling the Sex Recession Debate: Evidence of Male Exclusion from Two National Surveys",
          "authors": "Joshua Konstantinos",
          "abstract": "Prior studies of young adult sexlessness have reached conflicting conclusions: GSS-based analyses found rising male sexlessness, while NSFG-based studies found no male-specific trend. This study reconciles these findings and documents a post-2012 increase in male exclusion from partnership formation. The key innovation is distinguishing virginity (delayed sexual debut affecting both genders symmetrically) from dry spells (market dysfunction among the sexually experienced, which diverged by gender). Using difference-in-differences designs applied to two national data sources measuring sexual partnering directly—the General Social Survey (GSS) and the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)—both yield convergent evidence of a statistically significant widening of the male-female gap in the post-2012 period. The design identifies differential changes in male versus female outcomes but cannot isolate app-specific causality from other post-2012 changes. The GSS shows a 10.6 percentage point increase in the male-female sexlessness gap for 18-24 year-olds (p = .024). The NSFG, using a novel measurement approach that distinguishes virginity (delayed sexual debut) from dry spells (market dysfunction among the sexually experienced), reveals a 6.2 percentage point widening in the gender gap for dry spells (p = .014). Age-stratified falsification tests across both surveys show effects concentrated exclusively in the youngest cohorts most exposed to app-mediated dating. This study provides convergent evidence of a post-2012 increase in male exclusion from partnership formation, consistent with increased concentration among a subset of men, though alternative mechanisms (e.g., shorter relationships, reporting changes) cannot be ruled out with available data—an empirical pattern that prior work was unable to detect or disentangle. App-mediated matching architectures are a plausible contributing mechanism because they uniquely align with the timing, cohort specificity, and gender asymmetry of the observed shift.",

          "authors": "Huabo LIU",
          "abstract": "Interdisciplinary research is frequently conceptualized as an integrative endeavor that synthesizes disciplinary perspectives to yield more holistic explanations of complex phenomena. Although this integrative paradigm has yielded valuable outcomes, it often frames disciplinary differences principally as barriers to be surmounted. Drawing on insights from science and technology studies (STS), this article advances an alternative epistemological framework by reconceptualizing disciplines not as repositories of accumulated knowledge but as historically stabilized methodological apparatuses that actively constitute explanatory objects and practices. Building upon this reconceptualization, the article develops an interventionist epistemology that positions disciplinary differences as generative epistemic resources rather than impediments. The proposed framework delineates a three-stage mechanism—interpretive juxtaposition, cognitive friction, and methodological reflexivity—whereby the deliberate and sustained co-presence of incommensurable explanatory logics disrupts the naturalized authority of any single disciplinary method, thereby fostering reflexive scrutiny of underlying epistemic commitments and normative implications. Through illustrative cases from climate policy modeling, management research, and evidence-based medicine, the analysis demonstrates how interpretive juxtaposition manifests across diverse institutional contexts, generating cognitive friction that prompts methodological reflexivity without necessitating premature synthesis or resolution of differences. These examples illustrate that prolonged exposure to plural explanatory regimes can productively intervene in epistemic assumptions, thereby reshaping the conditions of legitimate judgment and knowledge production. The article concludes by elaborating the implications of reframing interdisciplinarity as epistemic intervention rather than integration, and by identifying promising directions for future empirical inquiry within STS, including investigations into the institutional conditions that enable or constrain such reflexive dynamics.",

          "authors": "Apil K C",
          "abstract": "Kathmandu valley’s spatial characters are constantly changing, and as such, its urban morphology can be\nobserved as a frequently altered palimpsest. Developing on the trade route of Tibet and India, settlements\nof Kathmandu valley can be traced back to more than three thousand years. The foundation of the earliest\nsettlements were laid out by Kirats in 300 BC or before that. The settlements expanded first under the\nsucceeding Lichchhavi ruling house who applied Vedic town planning principles and later the Mallas\nexpanded the settlements further with Astamatrika and Dashmahavidya concepts affiliated to Shakti-\ncult. After the unification of Nepal in 1769, Kathmandu Valley became the capital of politics, economy\nand administration, however the political centralization can be vividly observed only after the 1950's. After\nthe dethroning of the autocratic Rana Regime in 1951, the monarchical government had the authoritative\ngrip in government and development. The political turmoil did not stop until the 1990s, which brought two\nbig changes in Nepal, when the re-establishment of Democracy and wave of globalization brought\nunprecedented change in the urban form of Kathmandu Valley. However, the democratization of Nepal did\nnot go well; the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) declared a civil war that lasted for a decade till 2006\njeopardizing the baby local government (Decentralization) and causing massive migration to urban core\nfrom rural regions, especially to Kathmandu Valley. The mass movement of April 2006 changed the\ngoverning landscape, turning a democratic monarchical nation into a federal republic, with an expectation\nto loosen valley’s centripetal grip of economy and administration, if not politics. The era of federal republic\nof Nepal has witnessed the political chaos of more than a decade, in terms of urban policy and development\nstrategy. The paper reviews the spatial changes of Kathmandu Valley from the perspective of the political\neconomy of Nepal till date. It is observed that the political system and social structure have defined the\nchanges in the urban landscape of Kathmandu valley. The paper takes into account the regime changes over\nthe period and the planning strategies carried out in the period along with the political economics behind it.\nThe spatial changes of Kathmandu valley inferential to its political economy is also significant to\nunderstand the growth pattern of other growing cities in Nepal, which are largely influenced by political\ndecisions in Nepal.",

          "abstract": "La reunión programada entre el presidente colombiano Gustavo Petro y el presidente estadounidense Donald Trump (primera semana de febrero 2026) representa un encuentro diplomático de alto riesgo cuyo desenlace dependerá críticamente de la comprensión de las dinámicas psicológicas subyacentes. Mediante análisis comparativo de dos encuentros recientes con Trump – el caso fallido con el presidente ucraniano Volodímir Zelenski (febrero 2025) y el caso exitoso con el alcalde de Nueva York Zohran Mamdani (enero 2026) – este estudio identifica patrones psicológicos que determinan resultados en negociaciones con líderes narcisistas en contextos de asimetría de poder. Empleando metodología cualitativa de análisis de caso comparativo basada en el modelo de narcisismo patológico de Kernberg y Kohut, y marcos teóricos sobre toma de decisiones en contextos asimétricos, se analizan transcripciones de encuentros públicos, declaraciones oficiales, y reportes periodísticos detallados. Los hallazgos sugieren que el narcisismo patológico de Trump crea vulnerabilidades específicas que pueden ser navegadas exitosamente mediante estrategias que eviten activar rabia narcisista mientras permiten al líder narcisista \"salvar face\" y declararse ganador.  Se argumenta que la estructura de personalidad de Petro – caracterizada por narcisismo ideológico más que patológico – puede constituir ventaja táctica si es adecuadamente movilizada mediante recontextualización del pragmatismo como coherente con identidad revolucionaria. Se identifican siete principios psicológicos generales para negociaciones asimétricas con narcisistas patológicos: (1) priorizar evitar activación de rabia narcisista, (2) permitir \"salvar face\" como necesidad estructural, (3) reconocer que la narrativa de \"ganar\" puede superar el contenido sustantivo, (4) validar selectivamente sin adulación, (5) reconocer diferencias sin insistir en ellas, (6) crear oportunidades para magnanimidad, y (7) reconocer asimetría de poder implícita pero no explícitamente. Se formulan recomendaciones estratégicas específicas organizadas en tres fases: preparación pre-encuentro (reencuadre mental, identificación de triggers, preparación de propuestas ganar-ganar), tácticas durante la reunión (apertura constructiva, manejo de provocaciones, uso estratégico de validación), y comunicación post-encuentro (narrativas para audiencias múltiples). El estudio tiene implicaciones para diplomacia en contextos de personalidades incompatibles, gestión de crisis con líderes autoritarios, y comprensión de cómo factores psicológicos individuales interactúan con asimetrías estructurales de poder en relaciones internacionales.",

          "abstract": "A popular view holds that declining housing affordability stems from regulations that restrict new supply, and that deregulation will spur sufficient market-rate construction to meaningfully improve affordability. We argue that this ‘deregulationist’ view rests upon flawed assumptions. Through empirical simulation, we show that even a dramatic, deregulation-driven supply expansion would take decades to generate widespread affordability in high-cost U.S. markets. We advance an alternative explanation of declining affordability grounded in demand structure and geography: uneven demand growth – driven by rising interpersonal and interregional inequality – is the primary driver of declining affordability in recent decades. For cost-burdened households, trickle-down benefits from deregulation will be insufficient and too slow.",

In India, the other-gender community encompasses individuals with a variety of gender identities forming a culturally unique gender group. Although they have always remained an integral part of the society from\nthe very ancient time, unfortunately their existence is grappling with abject poverty, illiteracy, hatred and mockery. Such stigmatisation and segregation from society have left them to compromise with the employment opportunities available. This paper used the data on ‘other-gender’ released by Census of India for the first time. The 2011 Indian Census reported approximately 4,87,803 individuals belonging to the other-gender category in the country. This data demonstrate that the other-gender community exhibits lower level of literacy and labour force participation when compared with the general population. In this paper, we endeavour to conceptualize these findings and engage in a discussion of the inherent limitations of the data.\nKeywords: Census, other-gender, third-gender sexual rights, education, employment.",

          "abstract": "This finalized Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) manual introduces an innovative framework for institutional research ethics review guidelines that integrates the Ubuntu philosophy with international research ethics standards. The SOPs cover research ethics in a variety of fields, including veterinary medicine, public health, social sciences, natural sciences, agriculture, environmental sciences, business and economics, education and humanities, engineering and informatics. Despite being created for Wollo University, the SOP frameworks are widely applicable to African academic and research institutions. A unique and strong strength of the manual is the combination of the Ubuntu philosophy with a multidisciplinary approach, which advances beyond a simple compliance checklist to create a genuine ethical framework deeply integrated with the local context.\nKey features of the SOPs manual include: \n•\tAn ethical framework grounded in Ubuntu philosophy, which emphasizes community interconnectedness and collective benefit as foundational principles guiding ethical review processes.  \n•\tCustomized, discipline-specific evaluation checklists that address the unique methodological and ethical considerations inherent to various research fields.  \n•\tComprehensive protocols that extend beyond human subjects research to encompass studies involving animals, plants, environmental systems, and communities, applicable across all academic units, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of contemporary research ethics.  \n•\tThe introduction of innovative procedures and tools for community impact assessment that respect indigenous knowledge systems and actively involve stakeholders.  \n•\tFull alignment with international standards, including the Declaration of Helsinki and World Health Organization guidelines, while ensuring compliance with Ethiopian national regulations as stipulated in Proclamation No. 1130/2019.  \n•\tRecognition of interconnectedness through the incorporation of concepts such as environmental stewardship, community impact assessment, and benefit-sharing, which are essential for fostering sustainable and ethical research practices.  \n•\tDetailed implementation guidelines and training protocols designed to facilitate effective adoption and operationalization of the SOPs.\nInnovation  \nThis manual constitutes the first comprehensive effort to integrate Ubuntu philosophy into institutional research ethics review procedures, offering a culturally grounded approach that upholds international standards while honoring African philosophical traditions. The framework serves as a practical model for the decolonization of research ethics within African universities and research institutions.",

          "abstract": "Existing research has focused on women´s primary role in housework as an explanation for attitudinal gender gaps but stands at a crossroads as women´s labour force participation rates are catching up to men´s and the gender gaps remain. This article seeks to expand the idea of gender roles to the gendered nature of work experience as a result of gender-based occupational segregation. In doing so it synthesises an attempt to redraw the class map into a two-dimensional space divided by task structure and authority logic as a predictor of political attitudes with the literature on gender gaps. Is there a direct link between the attitudinal gender gaps and the gendered experience of work? Drawing on panel data and fixed effects estimation the causal nature of work experience is scrutinised. While previously noted differences in attitudes between different positions in the two-dimensional class scheme are (partly) observable, these differences largely cannot be attributed to a causal effect of work experience across different political attitudes. Rather, evidence points to the existence of personality-based selection into certain class positions and the stability of political attitudes irrespective of work experience. Although individuals in different occupations differ this is not because of their work. These findings contradict social role theory as an explanation for gender gaps by discounting the relevance of specific roles such as occupation in (gendered) attitude formation.",

          "abstract": "General strain theory posits that parental incarceration—and the corresponding parental absence—leads to youth delinquency and criminal legal contact. However, parental incarceration represents just one form of parental absence and comparatively little research considers how a common—and permanent—form of parental absence, parental death, may similarly precipitate youth criminal legal outcomes. We use data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a broadly representative cohort of youth born around the turn of the 21st century, to examine the relationship between parental death and youth criminal legal outcomes. We find that, net of observed characteristics associated with selection into this experience, parental death is associated with higher levels of youth delinquency and incarceration. Parental death is as relevant to youth criminal legal outcomes as parental incarceration. The associations are largest among boys who experienced parental death in middle childhood or adolescence relative to early childhood. These findings underscore the profound consequences of parental death on youth trajectories, highlighting the need to consider bereavement as a critical yet understudied dimension of social inequality and risk for criminal legal involvement.",

          "abstract": "The 1960s, 1970s and late 1980s were significant for Venezuela. However, this period of intense transition saw particularly strong growth, largely driven by unsustainable and impoverishing economic growth. On the other hand, this type of growth did not enrich the vast majority of Venezuelans. Thus, on the one hand, there was in fact the emergence of a virtuous circle and institutional plurality, which naturally lasted in the short term. Thus, the Chavista regime that later took hold in Venezuela largely promoted the significant emergence of vicious circles and a set of extractive institutions, strongly characterised by the very existence of economic destruction, promoted on the one hand by democratic stagnation. In this particular approach, I show some evidence that points to divergences regarding the plausible existence of abundant natural resources. Most countries that are rich in natural resources, for example, have similar characteristics, but are influenced, first by vicious circles, and secondly by the institutional extractivism existing in these countries. Examples such as Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Venezuela, Syria, Democratic Congo, and Congo Brazzaville reinforce the theory that abundance is primarily a promoter of political inconsistency, vicious cycles, and, above all, a large part of the multidimensional poverty that is significantly rooted in these countries in particular. Thus, during the vicious circle in Venezuela, on the one hand, the governmental incapacity promoted by the Chavista government consistently and continuously promoted the breakdown of social protection levels and, on the other hand, the significant increase of a significantly dual society, which is strongly persistent with non-inclusive and stagnant democracies. Democratic stagnation, however, was not economically and politically sustainable, and the marked differences consistently and plausibly led to the emergence of severe deprivation of freedoms, namely the deprivation of democratic freedoms and the deprivation of freedoms of access to basic needs. The lack of these freedoms led the country to institutional collapse and significant state collapse.",

Naturally, the abundance of natural resources, particularly for Angola, has nevertheless promoted vicious economic and political circles, which are in fact consistent with short-term objectives. Most of these cycles are in fact ongoing. On the other hand, another major feature highlighted in the study is that it shows, for example, an economy based on international market expectations, so it is international markets that largely control the Angolan economy. On the other hand, the increase in political inconsistencies and public policies aimed at a minority naturally contributed to the consistency of vicious circles and, on the other hand, to the continuity of economic destruction in particular.",

A promissory regime results around emerging science and technology, in which researchers seek to present their work in line with the expectation of disruptive but feasible technological innovation. In the fields of energy, materials and chemistry research, many turn to (prospective) techno-economic assessments as to respond to this demand. Based on fieldwork and an interview study, I show how these quantitative anticipations can function as ‘feasibility filters’ in the process of agenda-setting that implicitly translate the interests, infrastructures and imaginaries of large-scale industries into technical targets for laboratory science. Non-economic considerations come second, after the rate-determining step of the feasibility filter. Finally, I argue that the resulting, paradoxical dynamics of techno-economic alignment is at odds with calls in STS to open up sustainable transformation and innovation pathways via socio-political and economic alternatives.",

With few constraints there are only slight differences in estimation between the two approaches. With more and especially area-level constraints extreme errors in the SPM estimates begin to accumulate, and these are particularly pronounced for the low-frequency outcome. Additionally, where uncertainty ranges from MRP posteriors begin to widen we find they map to groundtruthed errors, providing a useful validity check when the true population distribution is unknown. This is the first direct comparison of MRP and SPM for small-area estimation. Alongside metrics for evaluating estimates, we highlight the value of area-level variables that constrain outcomes or that may capture varying processes over spatial units, and of a principled approach to model specification and uncertainty quantification – both central to MRP practice.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we present the Competency Explorer: a valid, user-friendly digital tool to assess civil servants’ views of the relative importance of competencies in their daily work. Through two studies of evaluation and modification in which 131 Dutch civil servants participated in a Q sorting procedure in combination with either a focus group or an individual interview, we developed a tool that is easy to use and enables its users to adequately reflect their views. A key finding from the development of the tool is the identification of 32 competencies that are demonstrated as meaningful and appropriate for civil servants in a large variety of positions and domains. This study provides insights into the competencies that matter for civil servants’ work and the tool can be used by researchers and practitioners for a wide array of learning and development purposes.",

          "authors": "Huabo LIU",
          "abstract": "This paper addresses the theoretical lag behind the widespread practice of interdisciplinary courses (IDCs) in higher education by proposing a dynamic evolutionary framework to reveal their generative logic and structural dynamics. Drawing on a \"core–periphery\" curriculum model, the study conceptualizes disciplinary programs as open knowledge networks and advances a Four-Stage evolutionary pathway for IDCs: peripheral emergence, core penetration, knowledge differentiation, and re-contextualization. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative cases—such as Bioinformatics and Environmental Economics—the paper argues that IDCs are not static content categories, but relational, contextual, and dynamic structural entities. Their evolution reflects both the curricular embodiment of Mode 2 knowledge production and the dialectical rhythm of \"differentiation–integration–re-differentiation\" in disciplinary development. The study further offers practical recommendations for university administrators and curriculum designers on dynamic curriculum governance, the institutionalization of the periphery as an incubation zone, and reforms in faculty evaluation and resource allocation to support sustainable interdisciplinarity. This framework offers a new theoretical lens for understanding curriculum evolution and informs the design of innovative, adaptive higher education systems.",

          "abstract": "Professional communication increasingly unfolds on digital platforms where traditional credentials no longer guarantee credibility. This working paper develops an integrated framework of hybrid epistemic authority to explain how organizational leaders construct professional credibility in environments driven by algorithms. Drawing on theories of epistemic authority, platform affordances, and professional self-branding, I conceptualize authority as simultaneously institutionally grounded and performatively achieved. The framework identifies eight interdependent dimensions: traditional competence, digital communication skills, strategic authenticity, contextual adaptivity, institutional embedding, strategic restraint, reactive authority, and emotional labor.\nPreliminary findings from interviews with eleven senior executives on their LinkedIn use reveal that authority construction requires continuous negotiation between competing necessities. These include authenticity versus optimization, visibility versus protection, and personal versus organizational identity. C-level leaders navigate these tensions through strategic practices that balance genuine expression with platform-specific performance demands. This framework contributes to scholarship on digital leadership, professional expertise, and platform governance by demonstrating that contemporary authority is no more solely possessed by credentials or defined by performance. Rather, it emerges out of a delicate interplay of communication and the sociotechnical constraints that we can’t control. The model provides an analytical means of dissecting how digital platforms alter professional credibility and the implications for equity, career sustainability and organizational communication.",

          "authors": "Tal Yaron",
          "abstract": "As groups grow in size, the complexity of collective decision-making increases exponentially, leading societies to concentrate authority in small hierarchical subgroups. While this enables coordination at scale, it systematically underrepresents the interests of broader populations and limits collective learning. Traditional voting mechanisms exacerbate these problems: binary choices, fixed option sets, and winner-take-all outcomes incentivize polarization rather than consensus-seeking.\nThis paper introduces a deliberative framework designed to support meaningful participation at scale. The framework combines three innovations: (1) open and continuous proposal generation, allowing participants to introduce new alternatives throughout the process; (2) continuous preference expression on a scale from strong opposition to strong support; and (3) real-time aggregation using the Consensus Algorithm, which calculates scores as Mean − SEM (standard error of the mean), yielding a confidence-adjusted estimate of collective agreement that penalizes uncertainty and protects minority positions.\nTwo proof-of-concept applications demonstrate the framework's practical viability. In the first, 53 participants converged on a single name from 26 proposals within approximately five minutes. In the second, 40 participants representing secular and religious perspectives jointly developed a social charter on religion-state relations over two sessions totaling 5 hours, achieving consensus above 60% on key provisions. These results suggest that appropriately designed deliberative technologies can enable rapid, inclusive decision-making on both simple and normatively contested issues—offering a pathway toward scalable deliberative democracy.",

We argue that criminal justice debt should not be viewed merely as a symptom of neoliberal austerity or as collateral consequence of punitive excess, but as a structural feature of settler governance. We reconceptualize criminal legal debt not as a marker of the punitive turn in U.S. criminal justice policy nor even as the application of recent neoliberal austerity policies to the administration of carceral institutions. Instead, we contend that such forms of state financial extraction must be understood as an integral feature of settler colonialism. In doing so, we shift attention from recent policy frameworks such as neoliberalism toward the deeper and underlying historical trajectories of criminal legal extraction that are rooted in the long-standing pattern of settler-colonial financial predation.",

To distinguish meaningful associations from chance, we use a permutation-based test that compares observed co-occurrence counts for each pair of considerations to counts from randomly shuffled data with the same overall frequencies. From the pairs that pass this test, we build networks for each policy and describe their main features, including central topics, clusters of related considerations, and bridge topics that link clusters. The results show that the three debates have different argument structures and illustrate a simple way to add statistical testing to topic co-occurrence analysis.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The social acceptance of health technologies is crucial for the effectiveness and sustainability of healthcare systems amid the demographic change. However, patients’ acceptance, which shapes technology use and compliance, is still insufficiently understood.\n\nMethods: In this study, we explore how perceived risks and perceived benefits relate to attributed value as a proxy for social acceptance. Unlike most studies that focus on individual technologies, we measure public perception of 20 very different types of health technologies—ranging from plaster cast and x-Ray to insulin pumps, bionic limbs, and mRNA vaccines. Through an online survey utilizing a convenience sample of 193 participants from Germany and Bulgaria, we assessed perceived risks, benefits, and overall value attributed to these technologies. The study presents a visual mapping of the technologies and investigates the individual and technology-related factors shaping these perceptions.\n\nResults: The findings suggest that perceived benefit is the strongest predictor for overall value (β = +0.886), while perceived risk plays a significant, but much smaller role (β = −0.133). Together, both factors explain 95% of the variance in overall attributed value (95%, R2 = .959). Further, individual differences, such as prior care experience and trust in physicians, significantly influences the perceptions of health technologies.\n\nConclusion: We conclude with recommendations for effectively communicating the benefits and risks of health technologies to the public, mitigating biases, and enhancing social acceptance and integration into healthcare systems.",

          "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
          "abstract": "Since Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin in 1928, the pharmaceutical sector has expanded rapidly, becoming one of the most powerful segments of the global economy today, with estimated annual revenues of approximately US$ 1.5 trillion and major corporations valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. Although scientific and technological advances and socioeconomic transformations have driven drug research and development, yielding substantial gains, critical scholarship has emphasized controversial practices of corporate influence - here synthesized as “Influence, Deviations, and Excesses” - that promote growth, profitability, and the consolidation of power, at times in conflict with the collective interest and public health. In this context, the present article adopts an exploratory-descriptive design and a mixed-methods approach, triangulating public datasets, institutional documents, and a critical review of the international literature to map and describe mechanisms of corporate influence in the pharmaceutical sector across eight axes: (i) lobbying and electoral financing; (ii) influence over regulatory and oversight bodies; (iii) influence on patient organizations; (iv) influence on the development of clinical guidelines; (v) manipulation, promotion, and concealment of pharmaceutical research and trials; (vi) ghostwriting; (vii) strategies of diagnostic expansion and disease promotion; and (viii) the funding and provision of benefits to prescribers and institutions, including psychosocial mechanisms and formative dimensions. The findings indicate that corporate influence is structured across multiple scales and operates in a manner that is simultaneously visible and diffuse. At the political level, lobbying and electoral financing emerge as central instruments for shaping the normative and regulatory environment, with a progressive expansion of investments. In the regulatory sphere, the recurrence of conflicts of interest in advisory committees and the circulation of personnel between agencies and companies suggest vulnerabilities to institutional capture, with implications for drug approval, oversight, and withdrawal processes. In the scientific domain, industry sponsorship is associated with biases that may affect everything from trial design and conduct to the selective publication of results, as well as practices such as ghostwriting and “market conditioning” strategies, undermining the credibility and circulation of evidence. In parallel, industry involvement is evident in diagnostic expansion and the medicalization of conditions of everyday life, enlarging markets and potentially obscuring social determinants and non-pharmacological approaches. In clinical practice, payments and transfers of value to prescribers and educational institutions are associated with shifts in prescribing patterns, increased costs, and preferential use of promoted drugs, including through low-value benefits mediated by cognitive biases.",

          "abstract": "Modernization theories predict increasing gender-egalitarian attitudes among younger cohorts. Yet, recent evidence points to substantial gender polarization within Generation Z. This short paper provides a systematic, cross-national and multidimensional analysis of gender differences in gender equality attitudes among Generation Z in Europe. Using microdata from six large-scale surveys, covering 82,187  individuals (born 1995–2009) across 24 European countries, we assess gender gaps across eight attitudinal dimensions of gender equality. We ask how attitudes differ by gender, how these gaps vary across countries, and how they relate to country-level gender equality. Our findings reveal widespread gender gaps, with young women consistently expressing more egalitarian views than young men. However, the magnitude of these gaps vary across countries and dimensions. Gender gaps are comparatively smaller for gender role norms, such as shared parenting, but larger for attitudes toward labor market fairness, perceptions of discrimination, and the salience of gender equality. Relating these patterns to the 2024 Gender Equality Index reveals that the relationship is not strictly linear across outcomes. Together, these findings challenge linear modernization narratives and underscore the importance of contextualized and multidimensional perspectives on gender equality attitudes among Generation Z.",

However, existing research has largely prioritised individual motivations, paying less attention to the shared meanings through which such behaviours are socially constructed. Drawing on Social Representations Theory (SRT), this study examines how collective understandings of second-hand shopping are organised and how they relate to broader circular-economy consumption behaviours.\n\nMethods\nWe report findings from a pre-registered study based on a nationally representative survey of Scottish adults (N = 1,516), which included a free-association task eliciting spontaneous meanings related to “buying second-hand.” The data were analysed using a mixed-method approach.\n\nResults\nThe results reveal a structured social representation of second-hand shopping that is predominantly practice-oriented and economically anchored, with strong emphasis on affordability and waste avoidance, with environmental concerns emerging in central elements. Five distinct cognitive clusters were identified, differing in their configurations of economic, moral, environmental, and pragmatic meaning constructions. CE-related behavioural engagement (particularly buying used, buying less, and zero-waste practices) was more strongly associated with cluster formation than sociodemographic characteristics.\n\nConclusions\nSecond-hand shopping is widely represented as an everyday, functional practice rather than an explicitly normative or policy-driven behaviour. While environmental meanings are increasingly integrated, collective representations remain grounded in resourcefulness and waste avoidance.",

          "abstract": "This article sheds light on dynamics of pacification and how they can be affected by insurgent extremity and violence against civilians. While previous research suggests that (civilian) deaths shape the probability of negotiations, it shows that the effect can take two directions. As increasing death tolls mean higher conflict costs, they can lower the probability of negotiations. At the same time, civilian killings may increase the conflict’s intractability and decrease trust between the parties, thus lowering the probability of negotiations. I argue that the direction of the effect of civilian targeting depends on insurgent ideology. When the insurgents’ extremity is low, they can use civilian targeting to exert power and pressure the government into negotiations. When their extremity is high, civilian targeting is more likely to have the opposite effect: Killing civilians can lower trust in the insurgents and entrench cleavages in society. Apart from this moderated effect via civilian killings, I also expect extremity to have a direct effect on the probability of conflict parties entering into meaningful negotiations. As high extremity increases both commitment and indivisibility problems, insurgents are less likely to meaningfully negotiate with increasing extremity. These expectations are supported by an analysis conducted using data on insurgent ideologies in civil wars between 1990 and 2020.",

          "abstract": "Opposition parties in modern democracies often find themselves having to balance their various functions and goals, such as representing their voters and influencing policy-making on the one hand, and criticising the government and presenting an alternative to it on the other hand. The emphasis on either of these functions leads to different strategies, measurable by confrontation or agreement with the government. Recent studies suggest that voters tend to reward opposition parties for confronting the government. However, these have relied on observational analyses and have not been able to investigate the underlying micro-mechanisms in detail.\n\nIn this paper, we present the results of a novel survey experiment conducted among 12,824 respondents in nine European countries. The respondents were shown several hypothetical government-opposition interactions regarding government legislation and were asked to rate the opposition’s response. We manipulate the legislation initiative’s subject, direction, and magnitude, as well as the opposition’s response, distinguishing not only between agreement and confrontation but also between ideological and other justifications.\n\nAmong other findings, we show that voters prefer compromise and agreement over refusal to compromise, but this preference is weaker the farther the proposed legislation is from the opposition’s ideal point.",

Adopting a helicopter view, this conceptual paper argues that badging systems are not only motivational features, as generally understood, but critical information infrastructures producing social ordering on digital platforms. Drawing from STS and social theory, the paper reconceptualizes badges as verifiable identification credentials that shape how users are known, classified, predicted and treated, often through automated systems. Using examples from the early web to the present, the analysis demonstrates that platform badges comply with the definitional characteristics and functions of traditional credentials. This reframing positions platforms’ badging as a crucial phase in the history of credentialing that can help understand future identification and decision-making practices in datafied automated societies. The paper concludes by outlining potential implications of the changing materiality of credentials and opening new avenues for empirical research.",

          "abstract": "Students who graduated in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic faced worsened conditions for labour market entry. Moreover, it is likely that the pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities in labour market entry between graduates. Using detailed Finnish administrative data and event study models, we estimate the effects of graduating during the pandemic on monthly employment statuses and earnings for a treatment group that graduated during COVID-19 compared with a control group that graduated exactly one year earlier. We differentiate between graduates of vocational education, universities of applied sciences and universities, as well as between having parents with a lower and higher educational degree. We find that the effects of the pandemic on employment and earnings were greater for graduates with a vocational degree than for those with a degree from a university (of applied sciences) but find little difference by social origin. By exploring the role of unemployment and student benefit take-up, we find that the negative employment effects of the pandemic on vocational graduates can be partly explained by a “discouraged worker effect”, in the form of graduates continuing or re-entering education. Jobless university graduates with highly educated parents were possibly holding out longer for better jobs using unemployment benefits.",

          "abstract": "This paper draws on process-relational perspectives to present an understanding of socio-environmental problems not as obstacles but as modes of existence. We argue that engaging with problems in this way unlocks their potential to be transformative, rather than merely resolving them. But how can those who set up and engage with processes of transformative change unlock this potential? This brings us to the topic of theorizing, as we argue that theorizing is an integral and fundamental part of engaging with problems. In this paper we develop an approach to theorizing for transformative collective action based on two key aspects: “Time”, building on Gilles Deleuze, and the “Complex We”, building on Marisol de La Cadena. As to the first, we explore how the past and future condition our understanding of problems, contrasting a linear, sequential view of time with a process-relational one where past and future are contracted in the present and are continuously reconfigured via processes of difference and repetition. As to the second, we introduce the \"complex we\", an emergent subjectivity as the agent of theorizing as that which supports reconfiguration of the past and the future. Together, these two aspects open up the transformative potential of socio-environmental problems beyond what could be conceptualized on the basis of linear time. We apply our approach to theorizing to a research project in Southern France, where problems such as tensions and conflicts over water availability are explored collaboratively. The paper concludes by discussing the strengths and limitations of our approach.",

          "title": "Insights into the relative efficiency of one- and two-stage research funding processes using an Agent Based Modelling approach",
          "authors": "Alexander Hulkes",
          "abstract": "All other things being equal, two-stage research funding processes that involve the initial submission of a relatively short proposal containing only minimal information (typically referred to as an outline proposal) followed by a preparation and submission of a full proposal will on average require less effort from their applicants than will single-stage processes. But it is likely that a funder operating a process which begins with a lower-effort outline stage will receive more applications than they might have expected to see had applicants been required initially to prepare a full proposal in a single-stage process. The net effect of these interacting and competing influences on the overall effort required in, and efficiency of, a funding process is not currently known and so is investigated in this work using an Agent-Based Modelling approach. The results of this model suggest that while the number of applications submitted will indeed increase, perhaps by as much as 40%, if two-stage processes are used, the level of applicant effort per unit output (that is, unit of funding awarded or number of awards made) may be reduced by around 15% to 20%. A weaker but more general interpretation, that does not rely so much on the specifics of the model, is that substantial increases in demand arising from use of outline processes might still come with an overall decrease in applicant effort. A reasonable conclusion is that more extensive use of two-stage research funding processes may lead to significant cost savings.",

          "title": "Artificial Intelligence Lives Among Us:  Dialogues on Its Social and Regulatory Impacts",
          "authors": "Juliano Maurício de Carvalho",
          "abstract": "This study examines the social and regulatory implications of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on its rapid popularization and disruptive potential. It adopts a qualitative, exploratory approach grounded in bibliographic and documentary research, with descriptive-analytical examination of international and national reports and regulatory frameworks. The paper contextualizes AI as a global debate topic present in multilateral organizations, educational environments, and corporate strategies, highlighting tensions between technological progress and social structures. It discusses the impact of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, on professional markets, education, and governance. International regulatory initiatives are analyzed, including the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the United Kingdom’s National AI Strategy, and U.S. actions to consolidate leadership in research and development. In Brazil, the study reviews the legislative trajectory culminating in Bill No. 2,338/2023, which proposes principles, rights, risk classification, and governance mechanisms for AI systems. Ethical dimensions—such as transparency, accountability, bias mitigation, and fairness—are addressed, along with challenges in translating normative concepts into algorithmic frameworks. The paper also explores controversies surrounding copyright and remuneration for creators whose works train AI models, as well as risks related to disinformation, deepfakes, and national security. It concludes by advocating adaptive regulation, inclusive governance, and continuous social dialogue in light of emerging issues concerning authorship, authenticity, and equitable labor transitions in the era of generative AI.",
