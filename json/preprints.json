          "title": "Toward Loopback Cinema: A Conceptual Framework for Emotion-Adaptive Narrative Film Systems",
          "authors": "Velayutham S",
          "abstract": "Contemporary cinema is fundamentally passive; narrative progression remains fixed regardless of the viewer’s emotional state, attentional engagement, or cognitive response. While interactive media have introduced branching structures through explicit user choices, such systems rely on conscious decision-making rather than implicit emotional feedback. This white paper proposes a conceptual framework for Loopback Cinema, an emotion-adaptive narrative paradigm in which a film continuously reshapes its storytelling trajectory based on the inferred viewer affective state.\nLoopback Cinema is conceptualized as a closed feedback loop between viewer emotional response and narrative generation, where affective signals serve as implicit inputs to a dynamic scene-selection process. The framework introduces the notions of continuous affective sensing, narrative state spaces, and loopback-driven scene orchestration, positioning cinema as a responsive system rather than as a linear artifact. Importantly, the framework is non-diagnostic and non-deterministic, functioning as a storytelling orientation mechanism, rather than a psychological assessment tool.\nBy reframing cinema as a living narrative system that listens to its audience, this study outlines a foundation for future research in emotion-adaptive media, affective human–computer interaction, and next-generation cinematic experiences.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Onodynamics, the study of sustained load in human and civilizational systems. It observes that many failures commonly attributed to moral, psychological, political, or economic causes are more accurately understood as capacity failures arising from sustained compression. By isolating compression as a governing condition rather than a situational stressor, this work defines a distinct scientific object concerned with regime behavior under load. The paper does not propose interventions, prescriptions, or optimization strategies. It names a condition, delineates its properties, and establishes boundaries on interpretation and use.",

          "title": "Preregistration Works: Increased Reporting Quality, Internal Validity, and Protocol Adherence in Animal Studies",
          "authors": "Julia Marie, Léa Menon; Celine Heinl; Timothy M. Errington",
          "abstract": "Background: Transparency is essential for reliable research but is often compromised, contributing to irreproducibility. Preregistration can improve transparency, limit selective reporting, and prevent post hoc hypothesis changes. Despite the clear benefits of preregistration in multiple fields, its effect on reporting  and quality  in experimental animal studies has not been studied.\n\nMethods: We collected preregistered protocols from Preclinicaltrials.eu and Animalstudyregistry.org, along with their corresponding manuscripts and matched it with control papers to evaluate reporting quality (ARRIVE essential 10), internal validity (SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool) and deviations between protocols and manuscripts. \n\nResults: Preregistered papers (n=22) scored higher on reporting quality than controls (mean=0.794 vs 0.637 author-matched (n=13) and 0.593 journal-matched (n=20); p&lt;0.001). They also displayed lower risk of bias, particularly for selection, performance, and detection biases. Consistency between preregistered protocols and manuscripts represented 47.6% of the answers, with highest consistency for primary outcomes, study type, and hypotheses. Frequent inconsistencies, 28.2% of the answers, also occurred, especially regarding secondary outcome reporting, bias-reduction measures, and animal numbers. \n\nConclusions: Preregistration stimulates high quality reporting, internal validity and consistent reporting in animal research. However, reporting across the board could be improved and undisclosed deviations to protocols remain common. Enhancing protocol templates with more detailed structure may improve reporting practices. Next steps would be to validate these findings, optimise preregistration formats, and guide journal policies supporting transparent reporting.",

          "authors": "David Moher; Kelly Denise Cobey; David Thomas Mellor; Anna Catharina Vieira Armond; Janina Ramos; Annette Nicole Brown; Maximiliano Sergio Cenci; Michael Halas; Susan H. Fox; Iain Hrynaszkiewicz",
          "abstract": "This multi-interest holder consensus effort highlights the essential influence and responsibility of Research-Performing Organizations (RPOs) in shaping the quality, transparency, and trustworthiness of scientific research. Despite the use of metrics to assess transparency and openness by academic journals and funders, most RPOs do not yet have  metrics/indicators or monitoring that address deep-rooted shortcomings in research practice and assessment. These shortcomings manifest as restricted access to research outputs, poor availability of underlying data and materials, infrequent reproducibility checks and direct replications, and ongoing incidents of research misconduct all contributing to erosion of public trust in research. Such issues are exacerbated by institutional incentive structures that reward the number of publications and journal prestige, while neglecting research credibility, societal relevance, and transparent communication. To respond comprehensively to these challenges, our working group reached consensus on six core practices for RPOs to monitor: data, code, and material sharing; open access publishing; prospective study registration; reporting transparency; disclosures of interest and funding; and verification efforts.\nCollectively, these six practices offer a pragmatic and flexible framework that RPOs can tailor to their local context. The paper provides an implementation guide for these practices and calls for renewed leadership by RPOs in realigning research(er) assessment and incentives to reward quality, transparency, and trustworthiness in research, closing persistent gaps, and reinforcing science’s credibility and utility for society.",

          "title": "Results from Randomized Controlled Trials are Highly Sensitive to Data Preprocessing Decisions: A Multiverse Analysis of 97 Outcomes",
          "authors": "Giuseppe Alessandro Veltri; Joshua Gilbert",
          "abstract": "The sensitivity of statistical results to data preprocessing decisions is well known, but the influence of preprocessing on empirical data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is less well quantified. We examine preprocessing sensitivity across 97 outcomes drawn from behavioral RCTs in the Item Response Warehouse. For each outcome, we apply a 4 × 3 × 3 grid of defensible preprocessing decisions (outlier handling, missing-data handling, and outcome transformation) and estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) in a fixed ANCOVA-style linear model. Across outcomes, the median within-outcome standard deviation (SD) of the ATE across pipelines is 0.045 and the median range is 0.116 (SD min–max: 0.005–0.355; range min–max: 0.013–0.787). Because one transformation option is standardization (an affine rescaling), we distinguish transformation-driven variation that is mechanical (unit changes) from non-mechanical variation due to nonlinear re-expression (shifted log transformation). In coefficient-scale decompositions, the transformation factor explains most of the dispersion in reported ATE magnitudes (median η²_transform = 0.811), but scale-free robustness analyses show a different pattern: decomposing variability in the treatment t-statistic (invariant to affine rescaling) reveals that outlier handling dominates changes in statistical evidence (median η²_outlier = 0.570) while the transformation component is small (median η²_transform = 0.014). A within-pipeline standardized effect-size decomposition (computed after all preprocessing steps, including the log branch) yields a similar pattern (median η²_outlier = 0.599; median η²_transform = 0.020). A linear-only, fixed-denominator effect-size analysis confirms that once unit changes are removed, remaining variability is driven primarily by outlier handling (median η²_outlier = 0.858), with missing-data handling contributing in some outcomes (median η²_missing = 0.094). These results imply that preprocessing decisions should be treated as an explicit component of the analytic model and routinely reported and stress-tested via multiverse-style sensitivity analyses.",

          "authors": "Christoffer Bruun Korfitsen; Helena Van Beersel Krejcikova; Camilla Hansen Nejstgaard; Isabelle Boutron; Lisa Bero; Asbjørn Hróbjartsson; Andreas Lundh",
          "abstract": "Objectives: To describe how medical journals identify and manage conflicts of interest of editors and peer reviewers, how policies are enforced, and whether practices are concordant with policies.\nStudy design and setting: Between April and September 2024, we contacted 250 medical journals, randomly sampled from Clarivate Journal Citation Reports. We sent a questionnaire related to the peer review process, practices for identifying and managing conflicts of interest of editors and peer reviewers, and enforcement of journal policies. We analysed open-ended responses using content analysis. In a subset of journals with conflict of interest policies, we assessed concordance between actual practice and policy content.\nResults: Of the 250 invited medical journals, 80 (32%) responded to the questionnaire (median completion of questions 94%). Seventy percent of respondents were editors, and 18% publisher representatives. Sixty-six percent of journals identified financial and non-financial interests of editors, 54% did not allow financial interests, and 46% did not allow non-financial interests. Peer reviewers with conflicts of interest were not invited by 66% of journals. Disclosures were required in peer review reports by 41% of journals, 22% verified all or some disclosure information, and 57% informed reviewers on how to handle conflicts of interest. If reviewers had conflicts of interest, 36% of journals would not use the review report. In cases where undisclosed conflicts of interest were identified before or after publication, more than one-third of journals either did not have procedures in place or respondents were unaware of their journal’s practices. For a subset of journals with public policies (N = 55 for editors and N = 54 for peer reviewers), some of the reported practices were discordant with the policy for editors in 45% and for peer reviewers in 50% of journals.\nConclusion: The majority of medical journals identify both financial and non-financial interests of editors, but not those of peer reviewers. Conflicts of interest are usually managed by disqualification, but journals often lack procedures, staff are unaware of practices, and practices are not aligned with policies, creating room for inconsistent management of conflicts of interest. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive policies and staff education to promote transparency and integrity in the editorial processes.",

          "title": "The Prospects and Challenges of Measuring a Person’s Overall Moral Goodness",
          "authors": "Jessie Sun; Eric Schwitzgebel",
          "abstract": "This paper integrates psychological and philosophical theory and research to explain what it would take to measure a person’s general morality (i.e., their overall moral goodness). Conceptually, to measure general morality, there must be general moral facts about people’s overall morality; the measure must correctly identify and weigh those facts; and the measure must apply clearly and consistently across people, groups, and time. We argue that it would be difficult to operationalize morality in a way that satisfies these requirements. Self-report, informant report, behavioral, and biological measurement approaches also have substantial methodological limitations. These conceptual and methodological challenges limit the validity of measures of general morality more than they do for most other psychological traits. This exercise also yields general lessons about the challenges that also confront the design of narrower, less ambitious morality measures (e.g., of specific moral virtues). Some—but not all—of these challenges can be mitigated when the measurement aims are more modest. It is therefore important to be transparent and intellectually humble about what we can and cannot conclude based on various moral assessments. Finally, we outline recommendations and future directions for psychological and philosophical inquiry into the development and use of morality measures.",

La muestra estuvo compuesta por 50 personas sordas con edades entre los 20 a 33 años edad, de la ciudad de Medellín, Colombia. Por medio de tareas se evaluaron sus HLSC, PV, MT y ToM, esta investigación tuvo un alcance correlacional, de cohorte transversal, observacional, prospectivo y analítico. En los resultados se evidenció una asociación estadísticamente significativa entre las HLSC y variables como escolaridad, ocupación y el uso de la LSC. Los análisis mostraron una correlación positiva significativa entre las HLSC y los dominios neurocognitivos de PV, MT y ToM, así como entre los mismos dominios. Esto respalda las hipótesis planteadas en la presente investigación. Se concluye que el acceso a la LSC fortalece las HLSC y mejora el desempeño en PV, MT y ToM en personas sordas, destacando la necesidad de atender sus necesidades lingüísticas, educativas y cognitivas de manera integral.",

          "authors": "Michael Stewart Cohen; Jean Decety",
          "abstract": "Inoculation interventions have been a major focus of recent research attempting to combat the influence of disinformation in our society. However, no prior work has examined whether these interventions specifically reduce the impact of unproven or false accusations against politicians, which is a major vector by which disinformation can influence voting behavior in democracies. Here we demonstrate, through 11 studies, that interventions designed to increase awareness of manipulative messaging, such as the use of emotionally-charged language, can reduce the impact of derogatory accusations on impressions of novel mock political candidates. Individuals who viewed video or gamified inoculations showed a reduced impact of accusations on subjective ratings for all candidates about whom accusations of misconduct were made, relative to those who did not receive the inoculation. These effects were strongest when the truth status was ambiguous, but there is also some beneficial impact even when an accusation is clearly refuted, i.e., a reduction in Continued Influence Effects. Overall, these findings indicate that inoculation interventions that train citizens to be aware of manipulative techniques can effectively reduce the impact of unproven derogatory accusations against politicians.",

          "abstract": "Opposition to artificial intelligence (AI) is widespread, but is it driven by deliberate reasoning or intuitive moral reactions? Across three studies, we examined how AI is moralized in public discourse, whether opposition generalizes across applications, and which individual differences predict resistance. In Study 1, we analyzed COCA news headlines from 2018–2024 and found that AI is moralized at levels comparable to GMOs and vaccines—two technologies whose moral dimensions have received substantial empirical attention. We also find that moralization of AI in the headlines increased sharply after January 2022 until December 2022. In Studies 2 and 3, we surveyed representative samples of Americans on their attitudes toward four AI applications. Most participants did not oppose AI; however, among those who did oppose AI-generated art, AI companionship, and legal AI, most indicated their views would remain unchanged even if AI proved beneficial—suggesting resistance stems from moral rather than pragmatic concerns. Structural equation modeling revealed that attitudes toward AI were best explained by a single latent factor, supporting the idea that AI moralization is domain-general rather than application-specific. Qualitative analyses uncovered the most common arguments people invoke to justify their stance and revealed how opponents and supporters differ in their reasoning. Together, these findings suggest that AI aversion is primarily moral in nature, implying that shifting public attitudes may require addressing moral concerns rather than relying solely on pragmatic arguments.",

          "authors": "Dalainey H. Drakes; Emmanuelle Rochon; Allison Ouimet",
          "abstract": "Purpose:  \nIntolerance of uncertainty (IU) is associated with poorer emotional wellbeing and worse \nprognosis of chronic physical health and pain conditions (CHPCs). Our current understanding of \nIU in CHPCs is siloed within the literatures on specific CHPCs. However, IU is consistently \nidentified as a risk factor for anxiety and depressive disorders. In this exploratory study, we used \na mixed methods design to better understand the role of IU and anxiety in people’s (n = 139) \nlived experiences of their CHPCs and how they respond to uncertainty across health and \neveryday contexts.  \n\nPrimary Results:  \nHigher acceptance of illness and perceived social support were related to lower IU and anxiety \namong people with CHPCs. Higher IU and anxiety were also related to lower scores on many \ndomains of quality of life. Our reflexive thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes: 1) \ndistressing ambiguous contexts are not limited to health scenarios and require management in \ndiverse ways; 2) interference of CHPCs affects multiple domains of life beyond physical health; \n3) navigating uncertainty for a chronic period changes coping abilities and identity development; \nand 4) responsivity to uncertainty is a multifaceted cognitive-behavioural and emotional\nphysiological response that hinders or promotes coping.  \n\nConclusions:  \nIU significantly impacts the lives of those with CHPCs and holds potential as a transdiagnostic \ntarget for early prevention and intervention. By tailoring therapeutic approaches to acknowledge \nthe importance of health-related cues while increasing tolerance of uncertainty, people with \nCHPCs will likely experience improved prognosis, wellbeing, and fulfillment.  \n\nKeywords: intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, chronic health, chronic pain, transdiagnostic, \ncontext, mixed-methods",

          "abstract": "Self-regulatory flexibility refers to the context-dependent use of self-regulatory strategies to manage conflicts in self-control. Theoretical models of regulatory flexibility from neighboring fields, such as emotion regulation and coping, have been adapted to the self-control context. In addition, recent self-control models have incorporated notions of flexibility. This chapter reviews these models and the relevant empirical findings on the role of regulatory flexibility in the domain of self-control. In addition, we discuss polyregulation as a potential instance of regulatory flexibility. Empirical research suggests that different aspects of flexibility may contribute to self-control success in daily life. However, many open questions remain concerning the prevalence, adaptiveness, and importance of flexible regulation compared to other predictors of regulatory success. The chapter concludes with recommendations for future research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Peritraumatic reactions during sexual assault are central to societal rape stereotypes and may play a role for post-trauma mental health. Nevertheless, existing research is limited. In this cross-sectional study, we explored a broad spectrum of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral peritraumatic reactions and investigated their associations with assault characteristics, sexual assault history, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression/anxiety.\nMethods: Recent sexual assault victims (N=425, 96% female, M = 26.20 years old) completed a 23-item peritraumatic reactions questionnaire developed in collaboration with lived-experience experts. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to identify latent peritraumatic reaction factors. Associations between factor scores, various assault characteristics, history of sexual assault, and current symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression/anxiety were assessed with t-tests, ANOVA, correlations and linear regressions.\nResults: EFA revealed six factors: Dissociation &amp; freeze, Cognitive strategies &amp; thought processes, Active defense behavior, Negative emotions, Perceived life threat, and Reactive surrender. Feelings of helplessness and nonactive behavioral responses, captured by the Dissociation &amp; freeze and the Reactive surrender factors, were much more pronounced than active resistance. Perpetrator strategies involving threats and physical violence were related to higher levels of most peritraumatic reactions, apart from Dissociation &amp; freeze. A closer victim-perpetrator relationship was associated with lower Perceived life threat, whereas a history of sexual assault was associated with higher levels of Reactive surrender. All factors except Cognitive strategies &amp; thought processes and Active defense behavior were positively correlated with post-traumatic stress and depression/anxiety symptoms, even when controlling for assault characteristics and sexual assault history.\nConclusions: These findings highlight the heterogeneity of peritraumatic responses and challenge rape stereotypes of the actively resisting victim by identifying reactive surrender as a common survival strategy. The robust associations between diverse peritraumatic reactions and post-trauma mental health propose these acute responses as vital clinical indicators for post-trauma adjustment.",

          "abstract": "Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors constantly change in everyday life, and dynamic personality theories emphasize the role of these short-term changes for understanding how momentary states give rise to more enduring personality patterns. Although the growing use of the experience sampling method (ESM) has made it more feasible to examine such theories, methodological challenges limit the inferences that can be drawn about temporal personality dynamics. This paper describes the rationale, procedure, and first half of the dataset of the Personality and Contextualized Experiences (PACE) Study, a large, multi-site ESM study that currently comprises 1,126 undergraduates (78,101 observations) across Canada, Germany, and the United States. Of these, 421 participants completed the entire study (baseline survey, ≥ 100 ESM surveys, and follow-up survey). The PACE Study aims to advance the study of temporal personality dynamics by combining a large sample with several methodological features targeting key design and measurement aspects for accurately capturing and interpreting these dynamics. The features encompass an experimental comparison of two sampling designs, retrospective assessments of missed states, and a personalized assessment of situational information. The study further includes a newly developed global self-report questionnaire intended to capture aspects of people’s dynamic patterns of states without requiring ESM data.",

          "abstract": "The self-importance of moral identity reflects the relevance of possessing moral traits as part of self (internalization) and of being seen by others as moral (symbolization). We examined gender, age, and cultural differences in both components across 67 countries using Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and Uz’s tightness–looseness indices. We fit linear mixed-effects models with individuals nested within countries. Women scored higher than men on internalization and symbolization, and age showed small, positive within-country associations with both components of moral identity. Symbolization was higher in countries characterized by greater power distance, stronger collectivism (lower individualism), and greater masculinity – but only among younger participants. Symbolization was also higher in culturally tighter contexts, but only when tightness–looseness was indexed using a combination index. Internalization was higher in countries with lower power distance, stronger collectivism (lower individualism), and lower uncertainty avoidance. Its association with tightness–looseness depended on operationalization: internalization was higher in culturally tighter countries on the domain-general and combination indices, but lower in tighter countries on the domain-specific index. Overall, these findings provide a cross-national portrait of the self-importance of moral identity, revealing robust demographic gradients and component-specific cultural patterns in how people value moral traits privately and in social self-presentation.",

Partners exhibited substantial similarity in all attitude dimensions. However, there was only little support that similarity predicted relationship satisfaction. Finally, romantic partners did not converge in their attitudes over time, indicating that couple similarity reflected initial assortment rather than convergence. The wide prevalence of ideologically congruent relationships may restrict the range of political views that individuals are exposed to, potentially playing a role in political polarization.",

          "authors": "Hari Srinivasan",
          "abstract": "Loneliness is widely reported among autistic adults and is associated with adverse mental health outcomes. However, loneliness in autism is often framed as a consequence of social isolation, reduced social motivation, or individual social difficulty. This paper argues that these framings—while consistent with general loneliness models—overlook a central feature of autistic loneliness: it frequently occurs amid ongoing social participation. Drawing on belonging theory, neurodiversity scholarship, epistemic justice, minority stress, and broader loneliness frameworks, this conceptual analysis introduces the Presence Without Belonging (PWB) framework. PWB distinguishes social presence from belonging and identifies three conditions required for belonging: recognition (being understood and taken seriously as a social subject), access (participation without extraordinary communicative, sensory, or temporal effort), and sustainability (participation that can be maintained over time without disproportionate cumulative cost). When one or more conditions is absent, participation may persist without belonging, producing loneliness despite contact. By reframing loneliness as a relational and structural outcome rather than an individual deficit, this analysis provides a foundation for more precise measurement, more accurate clinical formulation, and more responsible approaches to inclusion.",

          "authors": "Alana Arrouet; Jennifer Chandler; Steven Laureys; Roxane Hoyer",
          "abstract": "Moral decision-making can be understood along a continuum of integrative demands, reflecting the need to coordinate personal values with socially normative constraints. This review advances a temporally resolved framework of moral decision that maps increasing cognitive integrative demands onto a structured temporal cascade across three large-scale brain networks. The salience network supports rapid detection of morally relevant cues and early attentional orienting. The central executive network mediates mid-stage arbitration through conflict monitoring, and rule-outcome comparison. The default mode network contributes to later stages by retrieving autobiographical information and internalized norms for reflective, value-based evaluation. This cascade is indexed by temporally distinct electrophysiological signatures. Early affective-salience processing is reflected in rapid ERP modulations (P200, P260) and low-frequency oscillatory (delta, theta) synchronization. The transition to executive arbitration is marked by N200 activity and increases in midfrontal theta power, indexing conflict monitoring and control engagement. Later evaluative processes which track the retrieval of self-relevant information are captured by P300-like/LPP components and sustained oscillatory dynamics (alpha suppression and beta synchronization), reflecting motivational prioritization and the integration of affective and cognitive signals across the decision epoch. Drawing on neuro-imagery and neurostimulation studies, the cascade framework may help to understand how developmental change, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders differentially affect salience, control, and evaluative stages of moral appraisal. More broadly, the model offers a temporally grounded basis for neuroethical analyses of how neural markers of moral decision-making are interpreted in clinical and forensic contexts.",

          "abstract": "Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is typically described as an ‘attention problem’, yet attention is not unitary. This ambiguity limits clinical interpretation because the same label can reflect different processes, including failures of voluntary orienting, exaggerated involuntary capture of attention, unstable sustained attention, or dysregulated arousal. These different facets of attention have been rarely simultaneously investigated in a same protocol.   \nHere, we used the Competitive Attention Test (CAT) to dissociate and measure within a single paradigm voluntary attention orienting, involuntary attention, sustained attention, and phasic arousal. The performance of children and adolescents with ADHD were compared with those of age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) peers previously tested and included in a normative database (N=50). \nThe CAT revealed a selective profile. Voluntary attention orienting seemed preserved in patients with ADHD, and involuntary capture of attention was not increased relative to TD peers. However, patients with ADHD presented difficulties in sustained attention reflected by enhanced reaction time variability, as well as increased phasic arousal responses to unexpected stimuli. Beyond attentional measures, patients with ADHD also expressed more impulsive and hyperactive response patterns during task performance.\nTaken together, these results suggest that, in this sample, ADHD-related attention deficits are better characterized as a combination of sustained attention instability and arousal dysregulation than as impairments in the balance between voluntary and involuntary attention. By mapping multiple attentional processes onto dissociable behavioral measures within one task, this work provides an initial proof of concept that the CAT is particularly valuable for evaluating the ADHD population.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on Emotion Regulation (ER) has often focused on the social factors that influence the use of regulation strategies and has shown that ER has a strong social component. The present study adopts an individual differences approach and aims to investigate how two rarely-explored dispositions that relate to social behavior, rejection sensitivity and advice seeking, influence ER, while controlling for the effect of other variables, including personality traits. To this end, 96 individuals completed an online questionnaire that assessed their scores on the two dispositions and on the Five Factor Model traits, as well as the perceived use and effectiveness of 14 strategies. Hierarchical regression results showed that the two dispositions were differentially associated with the use and effectiveness of specific strategies, beyond other variables. Specifically, rejection sensitivity was negatively related to the use of Putting-into-perspective (p = .02) and to the effectiveness of Catastrophizing (p = .03), while advice seeking was inversely associated with the endorsement of Suppression (p = .001) and positively with the success of Other-blame (p = .008). Thus, our study suggests that these constructs are important when examining individual differences in ER and provides valuable insight into the understanding of regulation patterns.",

For the first time, across two experiments, we directly\ncompared two key experimental paradigms for studying lab-developed habits in\nhumans, the classic Outcome Devaluation task and a newer Response Remapping\ntask, by systematically manipulating time constraints for responses. In the outcome\ndevaluation task, longer preparation time led to more habitual actions,\ncounterintuitively, possibly due to response withholding biases that initially masked\nhabitual tendencies. In contrast, the response remapping task showed the expected\npattern – habits dominated under more response time pressure (200–500 ms) and\nweakened when more time was available. Overall, the response remapping task\nelicited stronger habit tendencies than the outcome devaluation task, suggesting that\neach paradigm engages distinct cognitive processes –response inhibition versus\nautomatic action selection– one requiring people to inhibit a learned response, and\nthe other relying on fast, automatic actions. Our findings reveal that habit expression\nis highly sensitive to task structure and underlying mechanisms.

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) constitute a highly scalable, low-barrier approach for early intervention. In this study, a micro-randomized trial was conducted to investigate the proximal (short-term) and distal (longer-term) effects of different EMIs based on positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).\nMethods: 72 participants at increased risk for developing mental disorders comprised the sample (67.6% female). They completed a 16-day intervention phase during which they received four pre-ecological momentary assessments (pre-EMA) at semi-random moments each day assessing proximal outcomes negative (NA) and positive affect (PA). Each day, two randomly-selected pre-EMAs were immediately followed by an EMI. Thirty minutes following each pre-EMA, NA and PA were assessed again. Before and after the intervention phase, distal outcomes symptoms of depression, anxiety and well-being were assessed.\nResults: Multilevel models showed proximal improvements in PA following EMIs based on positive psychology and ACT. NA decreased following positive psychology; ACT specifically improved NA during moments of higher NA at pre-EMA. The CBT-based EMI neither improved NA nor PA. Distal improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety and well-being were observed.\nDiscussion: This study provides support for the beneficial immediate effects of EMIs based on positive psychology and ACT on affect; symptoms of psychopathology and well-being improved on a distal level. Future research should further investigate the benefits of different EMIs in crucial moments (e.g., high momentary NA) to develop adequate just-in-time support.",

          "abstract": "Measures of dynamic constructs in everyday life, captured in intensive longitudinal data (ILD), may function differently across clustering dimensions, leading to measurement noninvariance. Cross-classified factor analysis (CCFA) has been used to test invariance across people and time, but additional dimensions remain largely unexplored. Situational characteristics–both perceived and objective aspects–may affect responses, making them an informative clustering dimension beyond time for measurement invariance investigations in ILD. Using ILD from 225 participants with up to 50 observations each, we applied the CCFA approach to test the measurement invariance of vigor across people and time and, newly, to examine situational characteristics as an alternative clustering dimension. Profiles of perceived situations for clustering observations were derived via latent profile analysis, complemented by more objective situational aspects: location, accompanying people, and main activity. For the vigor items, the measurement parameters varied substantially across participants, indicating noninvariance. While invariance held across time and objective situational properties, measurement parameters varied markedly across perceived situations. These findings highlight the need to move beyond time as a clustering dimension and, crucially, consider people’s situation perception when evaluating measurement invariance in ILD. The proposed CCFA usage can be copied to incorporate further clustering dimensions in future research.",

          "abstract": "The rise of digital fitness platforms like Strava has revolutionized the world of endurance sports by fostering social comparison and self-surveillance among athletes. This research delves into the psychological impact of such social comparisons on Strava users, exploring how the platform influences sport behavior, motivation, and mental well-being. It was hypothesized that adult endurance athletes with a strong social comparison orientation and low self-compassion would be negatively affected by Strava use. Additionally, it was assumed that women and younger users would be particularly susceptible to its effects. Furthermore, it was theorized that different sport motivations would shape the impact of Strava use. To address these questions, a mixed-methods approach was employed, combining a quantitative online survey and qualitative interviews. The online survey collected data from a diverse group of Strava users (N = 114), examining their social comparison tendencies and the resulting psychological effects. In addition, four in-depth interviews were conducted with long-time and new Strava users to gain insights into individual experiences and the nuanced effects of the platform. The results revealed that while Strava can boost motivation and foster a sense of community, it also poses significant risks, particularly for individuals prone to negative social comparisons and low self-compassion, particularly women. Contrary to the assumption that younger users would be more affected, the study found that health motives and social recognition as sport motives played a crucial role in amplifying the negative effects of Strava usage. Findings delineate a mechanistic pathway linking platform‑enabled comparison processes to motivation and mental health in endurance sport. Interventions that foster self‑compassion and recalibrate comparison‑prone motives may help maximize benefits while mitigating harms of social fitness platforms.",

          "abstract": "Perceiving social threats, especially expressions of anger, increases the speed of both action selection and execution. However, it remains unclear how individuals balance speed with achieving desirable outcomes, such as threat avoidance, under these conditions. To investigate this trade-off between decision’s speed and accuracy, we examined the kinematics of finger-reaching movements using a \"go-before-you-know\" paradigm. Participants chose between two empty outer chairs in a waiting room. Two central chairs were occupied by either two individuals with neutral expressions or one neutral individual and one threatening individual. The threatening individual expressed anger or fear at one of four intensity levels. The results showed that social threats generally invigorated action decision, as high-threat trials elicited faster movements with more direct trajectories compared to neutral trials. However, when participants chose to avoid angry individuals, the most frequent response, movements initially followed more central and slower trajectories until the decision was made, compared to when they approached angry individuals. These findings suggest that while social threats generally invigorate action selection and execution, the accumulation of evidence for the decision can be temporarily prolonged to enhance the likelihood of a favorable outcome, such as threat avoidance. We propose integrating these results with recent models of action decisions under perceived urgency to advance understanding of threat-related decision-making.",

Enhancing self-efficacy via\nvivid recall of personal memories is a promising approach. This study tested an autobiographical self-\nefficacy training as an intervention for STBs by examining its effects on STB precursors, namely\nperceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, in a healthy sample. Methods. Participants (n =\n105, 72% female) were randomized to a self-efficacy memory recall, a neutral memory recall, or a no\ntraining group.

Linear mixed models evaluated training\neffects. Results. Training did not significantly affect task-specific perceived burdensomeness (no training\nvs. self-efficacy: b = −0.01, 95% CI [−0.28, 0.26]; neutral vs. self-efficacy: b = 0.09, 95% CI [−0.18, 0.36]) or\nthwarted belongingness (no training vs. self-efficacy: b = 0.21, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.48]; neutral vs. self-\nefficacy: b = 0.22, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.48]), though the neutral group showed a greater increase in desire to\ndrop out (b = 0.33, 95% CI [0.02, 0.63]).

          "abstract": "Background: The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into mental health care represents a pressing scientific and ethical challenge. A critical global shortage of clinicians leaves the absolute majority of the world's population without access to mental health services, creating an urgent imperative for scalable, evidence-based solutions. While Single-Session Interventions (SSIs) offer a scalable modality, their deployment is constrained by the \"human factor\"-specifically, the critical shortage of trained professionals and community gatekeepers. However, a critical bottleneck remains while theoretical dissemination is feasible, the mass acquisition of clinical skills is impossible to scale, as high-fidelity training relies entirely on scarce human supervision. In this study, we propose a model for scalable professional training aimed at improving mental health outcomes at scale and resolving implementation barriers through a multi-Agent architecture. Specifically, we constructed and evaluated agents for Single-Session Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT-SSI) to demonstrate the \"Scale on Scale\" paradigm.\nMethod: Employing a mixed-methods design, this study developed and evaluated a novel AI-powered simulator for IPT-SSI. The system utilizes a Multi-Agent architecture (Trainee-Patient-Supervisor) where trainees engaged with a virtual patient to conduct a single-session intervention, receiving real-time and post-session clinical supervision. The system facilitates simultaneous mass practice, allowing unlimited numbers of practitioners to acquire complex skills concurrently within a safe, controlled environment. MHPs (N=72) completed a blended training program comprising a brief didactic unit and an experiential, supervised AI simulation.\nResults: Quantitative analysis demonstrated robust and statistically significant pre–post gains across key domains: IPT-SSI knowledge self-efficacy, attitudes toward intervention efficacy, and willingness to deliver the intervention. Conversely, changes in reported apprehension regarding delivery did not reach statistical significance. Qualitative evaluation confirmed that the system functioned as a high-fidelity clinical gymnasium, providing a safe space for deliberate practice. The machine’s contribution to human skill formation was perceived as high, successfully balancing rigorous adherence to the evidence-base with supportive, real-time scaffolding.\nConclusions: The findings validate the \"Scale on Scale\" paradigm, demonstrating that a Multi-Agent System can construct a complex, holistic pedagogical environment capable of facilitating simultaneous mass practice. By applying this architecture to IPT-SSI, the study illustrates a method for scaling evidence-based interventions without compromising fidelity. Ultimately, this approach may transform GAI from a theoretical promise into a systemic enabler, enhancing human capabilities to deliver safe, high-fidelity care in resource-constrained settings.",

We illustrate the pipeline functionalities (task-specific automation, sensitivity to individual profiles, lifespan robustness, and model-based interpretability) using four representative single cases: two adults performing the WCST and meta-WCST and two children, with typical development and ADHD, performing the Dev-meta-WCST.

          "abstract": "Forming novel friendships is an important aspect of emerging adulthood, yet little is known about how emerging adults identify potential friends in contexts where behavioral information is limited. We propose that emerging adults use value congruence to guide friendship formation when observable behavioral cues are constrained. Using an experimental approach across two studies, we investigated whether friendship interest in an unfamiliar individual was dependent on value congruence. In Study 1 (N = 322 university students; Mage = 20.70, SD = 1.62; 50% female), we evaluated value-expressive self-descriptions of peers, while in Study 2 (N = 451 university students; Mage = 19.88, SD = 1.64; 52% female), we examined friendship interest in the context of meeting someone online for the first time. Across both studies, we found associations between value congruence and friendship interest for conservation, openness, and self-transcendence values, but not for self-enhancement values. Additionally, we found that vignettes expressing openness and self-transcendence values generated higher friendship interest overall compared to those expressing self-enhancement values. Study 2 also revealed evidence for value incongruence effects, with participants reporting lower friendship interest when exposed to opposing values. These findings suggest that value (in)congruence plays a meaningful role in friendship formation among emerging adults, particularly when observable behavioral information is limited, with effects being most pronounced for values emphasizing the contrast between novelty-seeking and self-restraint.",

However, the biopsychological mechanisms linking early relational experiences to later personality-related difficulties remain insufficiently understood. This study protocol outlines a planned convergent mixed-methods pilot investigation examining the relationship between perceived narcissistic parenting, borderline personality traits, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning.\n\nThe study will recruit adults aged 18–35 who report elevated borderline personality features and retrospective experiences of narcissistic parental behaviors. A convergent mixed-methods design will be employed to integrate quantitative psychological assessments, physiological indicators of ANS regulation, and qualitative accounts of lived emotional experiences. Quantitative measures will assess perceived parenting style, borderline personality traits, emotion dysregulation, stress, and anxiety. Physiological functioning will be indexed through heart rate variability (HRV) as a marker of autonomic flexibility and regulatory capacity. Semi-structured interviews will further explore participants’ subjective experiences of parental emotional environments, coping strategies, and interpersonal patterns.\n\nData collection has not yet commenced. This protocol describes the theoretical framework, methodological procedures, and planned analytical approach for a future empirical phase. By integrating self-report, physiological, and narrative data, the study aims to advance understanding of how narcissistic parenting may contribute to both emotional vulnerability and biological stress dysregulation associated with borderline personality traits.

Dyads completed a previously validated experimental task designed to elicit HR fluctuations while jointly attending to emotionally evocative, 5-minute audiovisual stimuli.

Second, we found high correspondence between the two systems in quantifying dyadic HR synchrony using multiple analytical approaches.

          "abstract": "Besides its widespread recreational use, MDMA attracted the attention of many researchers and clinicians for its therapeutic potential for various mental disorders. Although recent clinical studies yielded promising results, MDMA has not been approved for medical use, partially due to the lack of clear insight into its neurobiological effects. In fact, although some suggest that MDMA’s therapeutic potential largely depends on the drug’s social effects, currently available scientific data depicts a somewhat ambiguous picture. Here we review currently available data on MDMA’s effects on social behavior in humans and laboratory animals, with particular focus on empathic aspects. We also try to summarize our current understanding of the pharmacological and neurobiological mechanisms, as well as the neurocircuitry affected by MDMA in relation to social behavior.",

          "authors": "Jennifer Meyer; Melanie V. Keller; Ronja Schiller; Martin Daumiller",
          "abstract": "The ubiquity of AI-generated feedback in education raises fundamental questions about how the source of feedback shapes learners’ processing and engagement with it. Evidence is emerging that AI feedback might elicit distinct psychological reactions differing from those elicited by hu-man feedback. However, the mechanisms behind empirically found differences are not yet well understood. The present study adds to this by examining perceptions of investment and judgment associated with social aspects of feedback in addition to feedback usefulness and actionability. We report experimental findings using a fake label paradigm, where the same feedback message is labeled as either coming from an AI system or a human instructor, in a sample of 282 US col-lege students on Prolific. We test the effects of provider labels on feedback perceptions and be-havior (revision engagement). Results show that students perceive the same feedback message differently: students report higher investment perceptions, personal relevance, actionability, and usefulness of the feedback when it is labeled as coming from a human instructor. We did not find significant differences in judgment perceptions and behavioral engagement regarding the feed-back and revision task. Further analyses indicated that investment perceptions, but not covariates such as AI competence perceptions, explain the differences between feedback conditions regard-ing usefulness and actionability. For theory, this implies that perceived investment might be one key relational appraisal through which provider labels (human vs. AI) shape perceived useful-ness and actionability, even with identical feedback content. Additionally, we explore the practi-cal implications for effectively implementing AI-generated feedback in the classroom.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: The etiology of hypersomnia remains largely unknown, while the concept of complex post-traumatic stress disorder has recently emerged in the field of psychotraumatology. This case series report aims at highlighting a possible association between hypersomnia and trauma-related disorders.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical records conducted as part of routine clinical practice. This case series comprises 17 consecutive patients previously diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia based on clinical and neurophysiological evaluations, all of whom underwent psychological and psychometric evaluations.\nResults: Two-thirds of patients met criteria for complex post-traumatic stress disorder. \nConclusions: This case series suggests that some cases of pathological hypersomnolence might be associated with traumatic disorders. Hypersomnolence may represent a response to traumatic memories, particularly in patients with complex traumatic histories, such as childhood abuse. The small sample size (n=17) limits the generalizability of the findings. This observation should be interpreted with caution, requires confirmation in a larger sample, but opens a potentially relevant line of research in the understanding of hypersomnias.",

          "abstract": "When speakers refer to objects in the world, they frequently overinform. Contrary to classical theories in linguistics, we hypothesise that overinformativeness is an efficient means of facilitating listener comprehension: speakers use redundancy to provide their listeners with search-efficient perceptual information. In Experiment One (N = 72), we operationalise search efficiency as the ease or difficulty of perceptual discrimination. We borrow methods from psychophysics to manipulate discriminability across attributes (material, colour) and across sensory modalities (audition, vision). We show that across both attributes and modalities, speakers overinform more often when the redundant information helps the listener perceptually discriminate the referent, thus aiding listener-search. Contrary to our expectations, we also find that speakers disproportionately overinform with colour information (relative to material). In Experiment Two (N = 97), we investigate the disproportionate use of colour directly, addressing explanations that appeal to colour’s perceptual salience by 1) dampening colour’s perceptual distinctiveness, and 2) controlling linguistic complexity both in terms of language production and retrieval effort. Contrary to widespread explanations, these factors cannot explain the disproportionate use of colour: colour is privileged in reference.",

          "abstract": "People vary in how their emotional experiences change over time, so dynamical systems theory has been suggested to understand daily emotion regulation processes. However, it is not clear whether dynamic changes in emotions over time, such as return to a person-specific affective baseline, reflect successful engagement in goal-directed emotion regulation or simply automatic fluctuations of a self-regulating system. In two experience sampling studies (5x/day for 21 days) with total N=450 young adult participants, we use person-specific change-as-outcome models, implemented through continuous-time modeling, to investigate dynamic changes in emotions while considering momentary goals to up or downregulate positive and negative affect. We show that people differ from each other in their attractor location (i.e., affective baseline) and their attractor strength (i.e., how quickly they return to their affective baseline) when not accounting for goals. We also show that people vary in whether their emotion systems respond to emotion regulation goals, highlighting that for about 65% of people, their emotions do not change based on their regulation goals. However, we show that individual differences in well-being and regulation strategy use are related to differences in simple and goal-directed changes in emotions. This highlights that emotion regulation success indicated by motivated changes in daily emotions is rare, but individual differences in these motivated changes in addition to simple emotion dynamics provide relevant insight into people’s emotional lives. This work highlights the importance of differentiating goal-independent fluctuations of dynamic affective systems from conscious emotion regulation in daily life.",

This tutorial provides an accessible yet rigorous introduction, designed to bridge the gap between statistical theory and practical application. After an overview of common applications, we discuss different ways of representing circular data mathematically and fundamental principles for working with them. We explain angular and vector representations and operations, including key considerations for implementing them in computer code. We then survey methods for visualizing circular data, including linear and polar plots and presentation of summary statistics. Next, we discuss circular measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape: how they relate to their Euclidean counterparts, and why they differ. Finally, we turn to more advanced topics of the kind needed to construct models of circular data. We introduce the most common circular distribution families, including circular analogs of the Gaussian distribution and their properties, as well as flexible distribution families that can describe skewed and heavy-tailed data. The tutorial takes a method-oriented approach, not tied to specific software, but highlighting factors relevant to experimental design, data analysis, and statistical modeling. A consistent theme is the need to rigorously account for the inherent periodicity of circular data. We also provide a consistent notation for circular statistics and parameters, addressing the lack of established conventions in the field.",

          "abstract": "Background: Dance is regarded as a multimodal experience which integrates movement, music, cognitive, and social engagement, potentially providing a non-pharmacological care approach for persons with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD). While numerous studies have investigated the benefits of dance for motor outcomes, less is known about the influence on cognitive and non-motor symptoms.\nObjective: To explore the scope, characteristics, and influence of dance-based interventions for PD, while examining how often cognitive and non-motor symptoms were analyzed relative to motor outcomes.\nMethods: Guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodological framework for scoping reviews, a search was carried out across three databases to identify relevant literature, followed by title, abstract, and full text screening by three independent reviewers. Data were extracted on study and intervention characteristics, outcome domains, and reported effects. \nResults: Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The most used interventions were tango and Dance for Parkinson’s Disease (DfPD) programs, typically delivered in community settings, twice weekly, for approximately 60 minutes per individual session. In contrast to motor symptoms, which were assessed most frequently (89%), non-motor and cognitive symptoms were assessed in 76% and 47% of studies, respectively. Motor outcomes demonstrated the most consistent improvements (84%), followed by non-motor improvements (53%) and cognitive gains (32%). Collectively, non-motor and cognitive outcomes were increasingly assessed within the last decade and demonstrated variable findings. \nConclusion: Although cognitive and non-motor symptoms have a well-documented impact on quality of life in PD, these domains have received less attention than motor outcomes within the dance-based literature. Measures of cognitive and non-motor outcomes, alongside longer-term interventions with larger samples, should be incorporated in future protocols for a better understanding of the multidimensional impact of dance in PD.",

          "abstract": "Background: Physical activity (PA) is essential for healthy development, yet less than a quarter of U.S. youth meet the recommended PA levels. Physical literacy (PL) has emerged as a holistic framework to support sustained PA through the integration of motivation, confidence, physical competence, and knowledge and understanding; however, the field remains limited by measurement challenges and insufficient attention to the social climate in which PA is experienced. Objective: To address this gap, the present study proposes and empirically tests social climate as a fifth core domain of PL and examines PL as a dynamic, interconnected system using psychological network analysis. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 771 youth (ages 9–14) enrolled in 24 afterschool programs serving underserved communities in the southeastern United States (2018–2024). Validated questionnaires assessed knowledge and understanding, motivation, confidence, and social climate, while physical competence was operationalized as objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA; daily and afterschool) using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Results: Domain-level networks revealed that all five domains were positively interconnected, with a particularly salient Social Climate–Knowledge–Motivation feedback loop. At the scale level, regulatory motivation of PA affect (PAR) showed the highest node strength, followed by social support from friends and autonomous self-regulation (TSRQA). Bridge analyses identified TSRQA, need for relatedness, and perceived PA ability as key connectors linking social, motivational, and cognitive processes. Conclusions: Findings provide empirical support for social climate as a core PL domain and highlight the integrated roles of motivational regulation (PAR), intrinsic enjoyment (PAII), and applied PA knowledge reflected in autonomous self-regulation (TSRQA) as strategic targets for PA interventions aimed at strengthening PL and promoting sustained youth PA engagement.",

          "abstract": "AI companies often anthropomorphize their products with the aim of increasing user engagement and trust. What downstream consequences result from such anthropomorphism?  One possibility is a deflection of perceived responsibility from the AI’s creators to the AI itself. Across two studies, we tested this hypothesis. In Study 1 (N = 309), participants interacted with an LLM chatbot that varied in anthropomorphic language (high or low) and completed behavioral and self-reported measures of trust. Anthropomorphism increased trust across all measures, with the LLM’s degree of emotional attunement fully mediating the relationship between anthropomorphism and behavioral trust. In Study 2 (N = 430), participants read six descriptions of an AI home assistant that performed a range of positive and negative actions. The assistant varied in anthropomorphism (high, low, or none). Participants provided ratings of responsibility to multiple actors, including the creators. The data revealed, first, that anthropomorphism increased blame directed toward the AI entity itself. Second, we found strong evidence for responsibility displacement: participants who attributed more responsibility to AI attributed less to the company that created it (r = -0.68). Together, these findings reveal perverse incentives in AI design: anthropomorphism simultaneously increases user trust while deflecting accountability from developers. These dynamics create a responsibility gap with significant implications for AI governance and institutional accountability.",

          "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) is highly capacity limited, and attention acts as a filter to ensure that goal-relevant information is encoded. While this filtering process has been well characterized under static fixation, eye movements are frequent during natural vision. Not only have eye movements been shown to disrupt perceptual processes, but the VWM filter itself has been shown to be susceptible to distraction-induced disruptions. Do eye movements similarly disrupt control over the attentional filter regulating access to VWM? Across three experiments, we tested whether the VWM filter persists across saccades or is temporarily disrupted. In a continuous report paradigm, participants remembered the colors of target-matching shapes while ignoring nontargets. Experiment 1 (no-saccade) confirmed robust filtering: performance decreased with increasing memory set size, indicating successful exclusion of nontargets. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants executed saccades before the onset of the memory display, which appeared after either a short (50 ms) or long (400 ms) post-saccade delay. Attentional filtering was ineffective immediately after a saccade but recovered by the longer delay, demonstrating a temporally-specific disruption of the VWM filter. Together, the results indicate that saccades interrupt the filter that governs VWM encoding and that attentional control must be re-established post-saccade. These findings extend the Filter Disruption Theory, showing that in addition to distraction, eye movements themselves induce a momentary loss of attentional control over VWM encoding, with implications for how visual cognition remains stable across gaze shifts.",

The current study examines the relationship between language patterns and social identity among NFL sports fans on Reddit.

Findings revealed that on game days, fans consistently employed more collective pronouns, exemplified by the frequent use of \"we,\" underscoring their affiliation with their respective teams. Counter to predictions, the increased use of we-words was higher among those whose teams lost than won, even though losing was associated with drops in positive emotions following the loss. Emotion words on the day following defeat reflected the emotional impact of unfavorable outcomes on fan discourse. These results align with social identity theories, highlighting the role of group membership in shaping linguistic expressions and providing empirical evidence for how sports fans navigate their identities through language on social media platforms. By anchoring the investigation in psychological theories of identity, this study advances our understanding of the interplay between social identity and language use, offering valuable insights into the emotional responses and communication behaviors of sports enthusiasts in the digital age.",

However, extant cross-cultural studies mostly considered cross-cultural differences only in either observers or targets. This preregistered study explored cross-cultural nuances in the attractiveness halo effect for Brazilian and German target men and women, as perceived by Brazilian and German observers. Facial photos of 583 targets were judged separately for attractiveness, prosociality, health, intelligence, social competence, familiarity, and physical and social dominance by 554 Brazilian and 326 German observers. Ratings between Brazilian and German observers for the same target group and attribute were strongly positively correlated, except for familiarity for German male targets. Attractiveness halo effects were overall strong (stronger for health, social competence, and familiarity compared to social dominance, prosociality, and intelligence) and mostly consistent for Brazilian and German targets and observers, with few exceptions. Only for physical dominance, associations were mixed by target gender and nationality. This study supports a putative universality of attractiveness halo effects and also contributes to a deeper understanding of subtle variations in the halo effects of men’s and women’s attractiveness in more individualistic versus more collectivistic cultures.",

          "abstract": "Background. Despite increasing availability of digital mental health interventions, most adolescents with mental health needs do not access effective care. Digital, self-guided single-session interventions (SSIs) offer a scalable, low-burden option, yet little is known about how youth engage with dissemination strategies designed to promote their uptake. Dissemination efforts are often ad hoc and insufficiently grounded in behavioral theory, limiting their effectiveness. This study applied the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation–Behavior (COM-B) model to examine factors shaping adolescents’ engagement with dissemination strategies for digitally delivered SSIs.\n\nMethods. Using a formative qualitative design, semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with adolescents with mental health needs. The interview guide, informed by the COM-B model, explored youths’ anticipated responses to encountering SSI-related information online and in community settings. Nineteen participants completed a demographic survey (mean age = 15.63 years; range = 13-19). Data were transcribed by a third party and analyzed using a structured codebook, with multiple coders contributing to iterative analysis.\n\nResults. Youth engagement with SSI dissemination was shaped by interrelated capability, opportunity, and motivational processes at the point of exposure. Limited awareness of SSIs and difficulty distinguishing them from other digital mental health services inhibited interpretation of SSI messaging. Opportunity-related barriers included limited time, inconsistent internet access, and reliance on social media-only dissemination, while trusted physical contexts and endorsements from peers or authority figures facilitated engagement. Motivational determinants included privacy concerns, anticipated enrollment burden, and affective reactions to mental health–related and algorithmically targeted advertisements, which often prompted disengagement.\n\nConclusions. Dissemination should be conceptualized as a modifiable behavioral process rather than a passive delivery mechanism. Theory-driven dissemination strategies that reduce cognitive and procedural friction, expand access across trusted contexts, and address both reflective and affective motivational processes may improve youth engagement with scalable digital mental health interventions.",

This study introduces the Integrative Model of Cognitive Load and Motivation in XR learning (IMCLM-XR), a conceptual model linking cognitive load theory and curiosity-driven learning models to understand how XR influences learning outcomes. A total of 282 medical students were randomly assigned to a traditional video-based condition, an AR-guided drawing condition, or an interactive VR lesson. Using Bayesian structural equation modeling, results showed that both AR and VR significantly reduced extraneous cognitive load and increased intrinsic motivation, though the latter did not directly predict learning performance. Agency, enhanced in VR, was associated with greater intrinsic motivation and reduced extraneous load. Crucially, extraneous load had a strong negative effect on perceived learning progress, which in turn predicted intrinsic motivation, revealing a key mediating pathway. These findings highlight how unnecessary cognitive demands not only impair learning performance but also disrupt learners' perceptions of progress, undermining intrinsic motivation. This study advances a unified theoretical perspective by demonstrating how optimizing extraneous load in XR environments supports both cognitive efficiency and curiosity-driven learning.",

          "abstract": "Social adaptation requires humans to respond to others’ nonverbal emotional cues by selecting and executing adaptive motor responses. In this chapter, we provide a general overview of how visual perception of others’ emotional expressions, particularly threatening faces and bodies, promotes rapid processing and elaboration of multiple opportunities for action, at different levels of complexity. Notably, we will highlight how subcortical and cortical neural pathways interact to flexibly orchestrate our social behavior in response to threatening expressions, ranging from simple stimulus-driven reactions to more elaborated goal-directed actions. We will review recent findings from research on humans and other animals and discuss clinical implications, as well as future challenges and perspectives.",

          "abstract": "Although many digital health interventions (DHIs) for HIV prevention have demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and, to a lesser extent, efficacy, few have achieved widespread dissemination beyond research settings. Reimagining existing multisession DHIs as single-session interventions (SSIs) offers a promising strategy to enhance scalability, given growing evidence that SSIs can effectively bridge treatment and prevention gaps. This study applied the Intervention Mapping (IM) framework, combined with single-session design principles, to adapt Keep It Up! (KIU!), a CDC-designated best-evidence HIV prevention program originally delivered across six months into a single-session format. Using a modified IM approach, we convened an expert and community advisory board (n = 13) to guide the study; across six steps, we prioritized key behavioral outcomes, identified corresponding objectives, and retained KIU!’s core theoretical determinants. The resulting program, Keep It Brief!, comprises three components: a universal HIV module, a tailored PrEP module reflecting users’ PrEP experience, and a relationship module adapted for participants who are single, monogamous, or in open/polyamorous relationships. Usability testing with 15 end users indicated high acceptability, engagement, and usability, supported by qualitative and quantitative feedback. Despite substantial changes from the original intervention, the modified IM approach proved practical in retaining essential mechanisms within a single-session format. We propose that adaptations of multisession interventions should not be evaluated on whether they outperform the original program, but by their ability to reach individuals or settings where multisession formats are infeasible, while producing meaningful change in core mechanisms. We also outline key challenges and recommendations for adapting multisession DHIs into single-session formats.",

          "abstract": "Past research suggests that smartphone use negatively impacts psychological well-being, but it has often overlooked the role of different smartphone use purposes. In two studies, we investigated how specific types of smartphone use – active and passive social use, news consumption, entertainment, and practical use – relate to psychological well-being. In Study 1, participants (N = 572) completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing self-reported smartphone use and psychological well-being indicators. Multiple regression analyses revealed that passive social smartphone use was linked to lower psychological well-being, while the remaining use purposes were not significantly associated with well-being. In Study 2, participants (N = 496) took part in a 10-day daily diary study, reporting their smartphone use and psychological well-being at the end of the day. Multi-level analyses showed that, at a between-person level, active social use was associated with higher positive affect and stress, while passive social use was linked to worse scores on all indicators of psychological well-being. In contrast, news consumption was associated with better scores on all psychological well-being outcomes. Entertainment was linked to lower positive affect and higher negative affect. Lastly, practical use was linked to higher negative affect and higher stress. At a within-person level, analyses showed that increases in active social use and practical use were linked to higher stress. Collectively, findings from the two studies highlight the nuanced effects of smartphone use on psychological well-being, underscoring the need for a more granular approach to understanding smartphone use and well-being.",

Using a naturalistic movie-watching paradigm, we integrated behavioral, cardiac, and fMRI measures in children (6–14 years) and adults (18–30 years), alongside independent ratings of experienced valence and arousal. Across age groups, positive and negative emotional content elicited coordinated changes in subjective experience, heart rate, and corticolimbic activity, including engagement of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Despite these shared patterns, marked developmental differences emerged. Children reported more positive affect, showed larger heart-rate deceleration, and exhibited stronger recruitment of thalamic and lateral prefrontal regions, consistent with more sensory-driven and effortful regulatory processing. Adults, in contrast, showed greater activation in hippocampal and posterior midline regions, suggesting increased reliance on memory-based and self-referential appraisal. During negative emotional content specifically, children preferentially engaged medial prefrontal regions, whereas adults showed enhanced lateral prefrontal recruitment, indicating a developmental shift from reactive to more deliberate emotion regulation. Importantly, models integrating behavioral, cardiac, and neural indices explained substantially more variance in internalizing symptoms than any single modality alone, highlighting the value of multimodal approaches for understanding developmental pathways to mental well-being.",

          "authors": "Julia M. Rohrer; Gregor Kachel; Richard McElreath",
          "abstract": "The city of Leipzig in Germany conducts large-scale school surveys of adolescents in secondary education schools. Following the regular surveys in 2010 and 2015, the 2020 survey had to be rescheduled to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this latest survey wave, the gender gap in general life satisfaction has significantly grown. While in 2010 and 2015 girls were somewhat less satisfied than boys (0.26 to 0.33 SD), in 2023 this gender gap had doubled (with girls 0.57 SD less satisfied). Why? Here, we probe various explanations, aiming to provide a template for researchers who are asking reverse causal questions (“What caused this?”). First, we find that the widening of the gender gap is much more pronounced among students with a migration background. This could plausibly be explained by a shift in the composition of the underlying population, with a strong increase of Syrian students, and a relative decrease of Vietnamese ones. Second, among students without a migration background, part of the increasing gender gap could potentially be attributed to survey mode: In 2023, for the first time, the survey was conducted on tablets—and unexpectedly, girls (but not boys) reported significantly lower satisfaction when surveyed on tablet rather than on paper. Third, beyond these two patterns, we still find significantly widening gender gaps in satisfaction with leisure time activities and relationships to friends. Thus, there may be a substantive increase in the gender gap in satisfaction in those two domains that is not readily attributable to changes in population and survey mode.",

          "abstract": "According to the attractiveness halo effect, global person perceptions are biased by physical attractiveness: More attractive people are ascribed positive attributes like competence, prosociality, and health, with cross-cultural variation in such perceptions. However, extant cross-cultural studies mostly considered cross-cultural differences only in either observers or targets. This preregistered study explored cross-cultural nuances in the attractiveness halo effect for Brazilian and German target men and women, as perceived by Brazilian and German observers. Facial photos of 583 targets were judged separately for attractiveness, prosociality, health, intelligence, social competence, familiarity, and physical and social dominance by 554 Brazilian and 326 German observers. Ratings between Brazilian and German observers for the same target group and attribute were strongly positively correlated, except for familiarity for German male targets. Attractiveness halo effects were overall strong (stronger for health, social competence, and familiarity compared to social dominance, prosociality, and intelligence) and mostly consistent for Brazilian and German targets and observers, with few exceptions. Only for physical dominance, associations were mixed by target gender and nationality. This study supports a putative universality of attractiveness halo effects and also contributes to a deeper understanding of subtle variations in the halo effects of men’s and women’s attractiveness in more individualistic versus more collectivistic cultures.",

          "authors": "Natascha Steiger; Olivier Desmedt; Pauline Billaux; Pierre Maurage; Mateo Leganes-Fonteneau",
          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Alcohol hangover is the most frequently reported adverse consequence of excessive drinking and is an important predictor of future alcohol use. Yet, despite hangover being centrally related to negative physical sensations, commonly used measurement tools focus on cognitive characteristics and fail to represent its interoceptive features. Bodily mapping allows to visualize and quantify subjective bodily sensations to efficiently measure alcohol-related bodily experiences (e.g., craving, intoxication). We present the first use of bodily mapping in a naturalistic study design to understand how subjective hangover sensations shape individual differences in interoceptive phenomenology and drinking patterns in young heavy drinkers.\n\nMethods: Heavy episodic drinkers (N = 34) completed a baseline assessment and at least three follow-up sessions during acute hangover episodes. Real-time data were collected using a smartphone-adapted emBODY tool, which generates topographical maps of bodily activation and deactivation. These body maps quantified the extent and intensity of bodily sensations related to hangover. Participants also reported prior-night subjective intoxication and current hangover severity. Linear mixed models and correlational analyses were used to assess within-subject associations with session-level variables and between-subject associations with individual drinking profiles. All analyses were pre-registered. \n\nResults: Topographical analyses revealed consistent patterns of bodily activation in the head, chest and abdomen and deactivation in the lower limbs during hangover episodes. Intensity, but not extent, of bodily sensations was significantly associated with hangover severity, independently of subjective intoxication of the previous night. Participants with high (vs. low) trait-level drinking scores reported more intense bodily sensations of hangover and more frequent hangovers, as well as stronger associations between sensation intensity and hangover severity. This association was also stronger as age increased.\n\nConclusions: Bodily mapping captured meaningful interoceptive patterns linked to subjective hangover severity and individual drinking behavior. These findings suggest that bodily sensations are a strong component of hangover experiences and may be heightened in individuals at greater risk for problematic use, offering new insight into the somatic processes that underlie vulnerability to alcohol misuse. Our results offer a proof of concept establishing the usefulness and feasibility of body mapping in naturalistic designs. They also underscore its potential as a scalable and intuitive tool to investigate embodied processes in addiction research, where interoceptive dimensions remain underexplored.",

A known problem in theory development through empirical findings is the statistical indistinguishability of CF and symptom network models in cross-sectional data. However, the extent of this problem and its implications have not been inspected formally for longitudinal studies. In this study, we sought to clarify the distinguishability between CF and symptom network models in longitudinal designs. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for indistinguishability in covariance for commonly applied vector autoregressive symptom network models and CF models and suggest a procedure for assessing whether a CF model can be refuted based on an estimated symptom network model. We give easy-to-implement R -functions for conducting the comparison. Numerical and empirical examples show that potential indistinguishability is relevant when interpreting the published literature. Overall, this study promotes comparative analysis of symptom network and CF models.",

          "abstract": "Frequently experiencing stress has been linked to detrimental life outcomes such as health problems and reduced quality of life. Interventions that can reduce different aspects of stress are thus of critical practical relevance. Neuroticism is one of the strongest risk factors for stress and recent research has shown that neuroticism can be changed through targeted interventions. Building on these findings, we examined whether a digital neuroticism intervention can reduce stressor occurrence, stressor perception, and stress levels in the general public (N = 461). Combining experience sampling, daily diary, weekly, and monthly assessments, we examined how changes in different aspects of stress unfolded across the intervention period, whether effects differed between treatment groups targeting different levels of neuroticism, and how changes in stress and neuroticism were related to each other. We found significant changes in different aspects of stress across the intervention period, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the first weeks of the intervention. Moreover, intervention groups differed in their effects, providing initial evidence that intervention strategies targeting the state level of neuroticism are most successful to reduce stress. Finally, we found reciprocal transactions between stress and neuroticism across the intervention period, indicating that decreases in both constructs may reinforce each other over time, with robustness checks especially favoring the stress to neuroticism pathway. Taken together, the present study provides evidence for the practical utility of neuroticism interventions and initial insights into the mechanisms of stress and neuroticism change, helping to clarify their theorized relation.",

This paper re-examines a previously reported finding that firstborns report less romantic jealousy than laterborns.

Across all samples and multiple robustness checks, we found no statistical support for the claim that firstborns report less jealousy than laterborns. Both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses did not support a birth order effect on jealousy (frequentist estimate:  r = .08, 95% CI [-.018, .172]).

Equivalence testing showed that latent trait estimates (θₚ) were practically invariant across all conditions, indicating that RTM is resilient to survey design and platform differences. Complementary eye-tracking and heart rate data revealed that multiple-item formats reduced perceptual and physiological demands, while single-item presentations elicited more intensive visual and pre-decisional processing. These findings demonstrate that RTM provides robust, psychologically meaningful estimates of both latent traits and underlying cognitive processes, supporting flexible survey implementation across contexts.

Results: The proposed framework outlines the main components of the feedback process: routine outcome monitoring system features that may facilitate some ways of use and not others, therapists’ and clients’ engagement with feedback, interpretation of the feedback information, therapists’ cognitive and emotional response to feedback, the therapeutic interventions influenced by feedback, activation of psychological change mechanisms, and treatment outcomes. It also specifies potential therapist-, client-, treatment-, and institution-related factors and summarizes variables that have already received some empirical support or have been theorized to play important roles in the feedback process.

          "abstract": "Simulation studies play a central role in methodological research by providing evidence about the empirical performance of statistical methods. At the same time, they involve substantial researcher degrees of freedom in the choice of data-generating mechanisms, methods, performance measures, and reporting decisions, which can undermine the credibility of their results. Preregistration has been proposed as a tool to increase transparency and reduce such flexibility, yet its role in simulation studies remains contested. In this paper, we discuss why researchers should or should not preregister their simulation studies, elaborating on the theoretical and pragmatic benefits as well as disadvantages of preregistration. Drawing on philosophical accounts, we argue that preregistration primarily reduces epistemic uncertainty about which simulation conditions were considered and why, which enables honest evaluation of whether results support the conclusions drawn. We argue that the resulting benefits depend critically on the aims of a study and its position within the methodological research cycle. Late-phase studies that investigate mature methods tend to benefit more, while early-phase studies investigating newly proposed methods generally benefit less from preregistration. We further discuss practical challenges specific to simulation studies, including the timing of preregistration, the role of preliminary simulations, and safeguards against post hoc registration. Finally, we outline concrete guidance on how to preregister simulation studies and discuss Registered Reports as a particularly promising format. Overall, we argue for a nuanced, purpose-driven use of preregistration that supports rather than hinders methodological progress.",

          "authors": "Silvy Collin; Heja Yakut",
          "abstract": "The distinction between episodic and semantic memory has long been central to theories of autobiographical recall, yet accumulating evidence suggests that this boundary is empirically less clear-cut. Autobiographical remembering is increasingly understood as a constructive process in which episodic and semantic components are dynamically integrated rather than retrieved in isolation. In this review, we adopt the theoretical stance that the relative weighting of episodic and semantic information during recall is flexibly modulated by multiple factors, including age, task demands, temporal distance, emotional salience, and communicative goals. We synthesize findings demonstrating how these factors bias recall toward more episodic or more semantic representations and examine how they interact with one another and with situational context. By outlining these modulating influences, the review aims to better understand the mechanics of the episodic-semantic continuum during autobiographical recall and to clarify implications for how autobiographical memory is studied and interpreted across contexts.",

          "authors": "Melanie Viola Partsch; David Goretzko",
          "abstract": "Evaluating and, if necessary, revising factor-analytic latent measurement models is a challenging task. By now, researchers can select from a toolbox of traditional and novel methods to evaluate global and local model fit. However, this toolbox lacks a method to evaluate model fit at an intermediate level facilitating a thoughtful revision process. In this study, we fill this gap with a machine learning (ML) approach to model fit evaluation. Specifically, we introduce an ML pipeline to classify the type and severity of misspecifications in multi-factorial measurement models. To build this pipeline, we trained three ML models that predict a) if the measurement model is correctly specified or if a latent factor, cross-loadings, factor correlations, or residual correlations have been neglected, b) if any, how many cross-loadings have been neglected, and c) if any, how many residual correlations have been neglected. All three ML models performed well overall, with performance drops mainly resulting from misclassifications by ± 1 cross-loading and ± 1–2 residual correlations, respectively. Consequently, the feedback of the ML pipeline must not be implemented in an exact manner. Instead, it points the user to the most likely source of misfit and indicates if the measurement model is not, mildly, moderately, or severely misspecified. This information provides helpful guidance in deciding if and how to revise the measurement model, the measurement instrument, or its underlying theory. We provide an open-access R implementation of the ML pipeline, discuss how to use it within a multi-method approach, and make recommendations on how to use its feedback for the next revision steps.",

Extant research, however, lacks insights into everyday mood regulation through music listening, especially on music streaming services, where users’ choices are shaped by both self-selection and algorithmically personalized recommendations. Hence, we tested MMT using a novel in situ approach and investigated whether variations in self- vs. algorithmically personalized music choices would moderate MMT’s pro-posed relationships between mood and music use. In a preregistered, two-week study, we combined experience sampling surveys with logged music streaming and audio feature metadata obtained via the Spotify API, utilizing 6,864 surveys from 144 listeners. Results largely indicated no support for MMT’s predictions. In addition, higher algorithmic personalization did not reinforce or distort MMT-related patterns.

One important component of the standard undergraduate programme are assignments, where skill development can be assessed and constructive feedback offered to enable students to continue to build upon their skills. In this case study, we submitted the assignments from a three-year Psychology undergraduate programme to ChatGPT using three levels of prompting – basic, intermediate, and advanced – to answer the question, can Gen-AI obtain a psychology bachelor's degree? Responses were reviewed by researchers experienced in assessment marking and deemed as pass or fail. We report on the finding that Gen-AI was capable of successfully passing almost all assessment types. Of 40 individual assessments, 36 were of passing quality. We discuss the implications of this susceptibility, where Gen-AI can be used positively as a learning tool but is simultaneously dangerous when it generates incorrect, but convincing, information. The positive marking approach enables incorrect values or basic formatting to be condoned reducing the desire or need for students to make significant effort to alter the Gen-AI content to evade detection. We recommend that traditional written assessments, where not invigilated, should be adapted either in terms of assignment or marking criteria to adapt to the aforementioned challenges.",

          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models offer powerful means for testing competing theoretical frameworks. A central challenge is determining which model best explains observed data, balancing goodness-of-fit with parsimony. Several fruitful approaches to model comparison have been used in the areas of cognitive and mathematical psychology, but the most popular in practice remain Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) that penalize model complexity as measured by the number of free parameters. Here, we revisit these conventional approaches to model selection on a sample case of the prototype and exemplar models of categorization. We highlight the limitations of parameter count-based complexity measures, showing that they may fail to capture a model’s true flexibility. We then introduce a Monte Carlo permutation testing approach as an alternative that has a rich tradition in many areas, but its use for model selection is still trailing that of AIC/BIC. We demonstrate that permutation testing offers at least three advantages: more robust comparison of models to chance, more robust comparison between models with equal or differing numbers of parameters, and quantification of uncertainty in model selection. After demonstrating how permutation testing offers a more nuanced and principled framework for evaluating cognitive models, we conclude with practical considerations for implementing permutation-based model selection in cognitive modeling research.",

This study investigated developmentally sensitive differentiation in maternal MST during dyadic interactions across two siblings aged 2.5 to 8 years. Using a within-family design, mothers were observed engaging separately with each child using a wordless picture book, allowing for direct comparison of maternal talk across siblings. Mothers demonstrated less verbosity, proportionally fewer perception terms and proportionally more cognition terms during interactions with older compared to younger siblings. Moreover, maternal adjustment in cognition term use across siblings was associated with developmental differences in theory of mind understanding, but not age, language, or IQ, suggesting maternal linguistic sensitivity to each child’s unique social-cognitive capabilities. This study highlights how maternal MST is dynamically shaped by the real-time needs and capacities of each child in the family system.",

          "abstract": "Children’s exposure to Mental state language (MSL) has implications for their social, emotional and cognitive developmental outcomes. Although parental MSL is found to vary as a function of child gender, gender differences in children’s MSL exposure are yet to be considered in the early childhood education and care (ECEC) context. This study examined whether changes in the gender composition of child-groups was associated with educators’ use of MSL during centre-scheduled playtime within toddler classrooms. We analysed educators’ MSL content types (perception, desires, emotion, cognition) across 182 interactional episodes with 13 educators. Results indicated that educators used more perception terms when the proportion of boys increased, and more desire terms when the proportion of girls increased. No significant associations were found for emotion, cognition, or overall MSL. Considering the developmental trajectory and functionality of children’s exposure to MSL content subtypes, these findings suggest that educators systematically change their language so that girls receive developmentally more advanced MSL content than boys at the same age. Given the established role of MSL in children’s social-emotional and cognitive outcomes, these findings have implications for ECEC policy and educator training. Addressing gender-related variation in children’s MSL exposure may help ensure equitable opportunity for language-mediated development in early childhood settings. \n\nKeywords: mental state language, early childhood education and care, toddlers, gender, socialisation",

          "abstract": "Children are adept statistical learners, capable of parsing streams of structured input into meaningful units, but the cognitive processes they engage during learning may differ from those of adults. To date, however, it is unclear how learners of different ages predict upcoming experience when navigating environments with complex structure, as well as how changes in predictive learning mechanisms influence structured knowledge acquisition. To address this question, we tested 106 children, adolescents, and adults, ages 8 - 22 years, on a predictive learning task, in which they experienced sequences of stimuli with a higher-order temporal structure. After an initial learning phase, participants’ explicit knowledge of the relations between stimuli was probed via two additional task measures. We used a recently introduced computational model to characterize participants’ response times during learning, and found that all participants relied on simple, recency-based prediction, anticipating that they would encounter stimuli they recently encountered in the past. With increasing age, however, participants demonstrated greater evidence of additionally relying on a more sophisticated learning mechanism, which captured a predictive representation of the conditional relations between stimuli. Though predictive learning changed with age, we found only weak evidence that these changes related to the acquisition of explicit knowledge of the environment. Our results suggest that the learning mechanisms through which people parse continuous streams of experience change with age, influencing their predictions about upcoming events.",

These tests were administered to five instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) to evaluate whether these models can function as effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) team members by contributing to action, transition, and interpersonal team processes. All assessments were performed on LLMs without human interaction. Our results revealed concrete strengths and shortcomings of LLMs to engage in teaming behaviours. LLMs performed well on tasks usually executed in action phases of teamwork, where a team engages in specific work tasks such as monitoring and coordination to meet team goals. In contrast, LLMs lacked the abstract reasoning and planning required to meet transition phases of teamwork. These phases are critical for self-reflection of past performance and planning for upcoming tasks in teamwork. Finally, LLMs displayed unique performance during interpersonal aspects of teamwork, predominately applying an integrating motivational style but failing to acknowledge negative emotional states of teammates. These findings reveal how contemporary LLMs may contribute to contemporary human-AI teams as team members and highlight the utility of experimental psychology in elucidating behaviours of non-embodied agents.",

Latent profile analysis was conducted in a representative community sample (N=1,200) using three apathy dimensions assessed by the Apathy Motivation Index (behavioral, social, emotional). Identified profiles were compared on social and occupational functioning, psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), depression, and anhedonia, with additional analyses adjusting for affective symptoms. Demographic predictors of profile membership were examined using exploratory logistic regression. \nA two-profile solution provided the best fit, reflecting differences in overall apathy severity rather than qualitatively distinct subtypes. The elevated apathy profile (17.2% of the sample) showed significantly higher levels of PLEs (p&lt;.001) and poorer functioning in activities, work-related skills, and social appropriateness (all ps&lt;.001). Interpersonal relationship functioning was higher in this profile (p&lt;.001). Most profile differences remained significant after controlling for depressive symptoms and anhedonia. Younger age was robustly associated with elevated apathy profile membership (OR=0.98, 95% CI [0.95, 0.98]).\nOverall, apathy in the general population appears best understood as a severity-based motivational vulnerability with domain-specific functional consequences and relevance for psychosis-spectrum traits.",

We examined what GPCs phonics programs teach and how those GPCs support a child’s ability to pronounce written words to understand how to create an optimized phonics program. We compared three phonics programs, Jolly Phonics, Letters and Sounds, and Read Write Inc., in terms of how well their GPCs enabled the decoding (pronunciation) of a naturalistic child vocabulary. Decodability was measured through an algorithm that simulates how many words can be decoded with each GPC taught. We quantified decodability in different ways to probe the potential impact of teaching GPCs that create ambiguity, either because the same letter(s) map to different phonemes, or because a more complex grapheme involving several letters subsumes letter(s) from simpler GPCs. Teaching more GPCs increases the number of words that can be decoded, although there are diminishing returns to teaching more rules given the cost in terms of instructional time. Moreover, teaching larger sets of GPCs can introduce GPCs that create ambiguity, which empirical studies show can negatively impact learning. We also use our algorithm to identify additional GPCs that could improve the potential effectiveness of existing programs. Our work provides targeted guidance pertaining to the factors that need to be considered in designing an optimized phonics program. It also offers an algorithm that can facilitate phonics program design and pinpoints empirical research needed to advance towards an optimized set of GPCs.",

Repeated exposure to the same VR stimulus causes a reduction in cybersickness, referred to as Cybersickness Abatement from Repeated Exposure (CARE). This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

In a sample of 100 adults across the lifespan, we found that EFT-cueing trials led to more future-oriented choices in younger adults, consistent with the extant literature, no choice differences in middle-aged adults, and fewer future-oriented choices in older adults. These findings suggest that EFT-cueing may not be an effective strategy to promote savings for all ages. Our design used common events for all subjects which allowed us to examine the relationship between events, finding that across age, cueing with rare, positive, and intense events led to more present-oriented choices, but may have limited our power compared to personally-relevant events.",

Prediction and prevention of suicidal ideation (SI) remain challenging, largely because traditional approaches have focused less on individual variability in its moment-to-moment fluctuations. To address this gap, we examined how group-level network models capture average dynamic associations over time, while person-specific networks reveal individual deviations in both contemporaneous and time-lagged relationships, clarifying how changes in cognitive or emotional states precede within-person changes and subsequent fluctuations in SI, particularly in relation to perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and hopelessness.\nMethods. Twenty-four psychiatric inpatients (75% female, mean age = 33.6, SD = 10.7) completed ecological momentary assessments (five prompts/day) for 28 days post-discharge, reporting passive and active SI, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and\nhopelessness. Data were analyzed using Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) to derive group- and individual-level networks.\nResults. Group-level GIMME networks showed contemporaneous and lagged connections between passive and active SI. Individual-level GIMME networks showed that for 30.4% of individuals, hopelessness mediated the link between interpersonal risk factors, passive, and active SI.\nConclusion. By identifying both shared and person-specific temporal pathways, these findings highlight the value of dynamic, idiographic assessment strategies for advancing precision psychiatry in suicide prevention.",

In a representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 956), the WCHS demonstrated strong internal consistency (α = .92) and robust two-week test-retest reliability (r = .80). People higher in the belief that words can harm tended to be younger, female, non-White, and politically liberal. People with higher WCHS scores rated themselves as higher in intellectual humility, empathy, moral grandstanding, and the belief in the importance of silencing others. They were also more likely to support political correctness and endorse trigger warnings and safe spaces. People who believed that words can harm had worse mental health: they reported being more anxious and depressed, less resilient, and having more difficulties in emotion regulation. The WCHS is a reliable tool for measuring beliefs about the harmfulness of words—a divisive issue within modern cultural discourse.",

          "abstract": "Feminization and safetyism are increasingly debated in public, but the underlying decision-making processes remain unexplained. This study examines orientation towards herds (normativity/safety) versus packs (hierarchical cooperation) using ipsative dilemmas (N = 351), integrating life history theory and feminist, social, and personality perspectives, differentiating by sex, personality, and milieu (wealth, education, politics, city size). Women showed stronger herd orientation than men, especially poor heterosexual female students; poor right-wing men showed strongest pack-orientation. Stability aspects (compassion, orderliness) predicted herds, while the Dark Tetrad traits predicted packs. Interactions between sex and milieu challenged ideological explanations with women’s herd tendency persisting across contexts and men’s pack orientation showing strategic flexibility. Life history theory best explained patterns: protection, safety, and normative decisions in women versus risk-taking in men to gain status. Micro-level sex differences may extend to institutional security trends, warranting replications to test macro-level effects.",

          "abstract": "Classic estimation of structural equation modeling (SEM) relies on explicit, closed-form derivatives and Newton-type optimizers like BFGS that use both gradient and curvature information. Although effective in many contexts, this approach can become unstable with small samples, model misspecification, or poor measurement quality. A more recent framework, computational-graph SEM (cgSEM), recasts SEM in a graph-based form with automatic differentiation and adaptive optimizers from deep learning, like Adam, that operate on gradients only. cgSEM’s original work showed that it could reproduce results from classic SEM. However, this equivalence was achieved by using Adam with strict, precision-based stopping rules, similar to those used in many classic SEM implementations, despite Adam being developed with stability-oriented optimization in mind. Thus, it remains unclear how cgSEM performs when Adam is used as intended. We compare classic SEM and cgSEM under maximum likelihood estimation, letting each implement its natural optimization strategy. In simulations, cgSEM showed higher admissible-solution rates and lower small-sample bias under challenging conditions, whereas classic SEM was consistently faster and showed lower large-sample bias with weak indicators. Ultimately, no single approach fits all; framework choice should be guided by the modeling context and which approach is more likely to yield usable results.",

          "abstract": "Does merely knowing that one will engage in conversation with an AI versus a real human differentially evoke anticipatory anxiety? Here we tested this question experimentally by asking participants to report their anticipatory anxiety and experiential expectations prior to engaging in each of two conversations: one with real humans and another with LLM-powered AI agents, with both held through the same real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech interface. Then, to evaluate how outcomes aligned with expectations, participants reported their actual experiences following each conversation. Results revealed significantly lower anxiety in anticipation of a conversation with AI partners compared to human partners, though this effect only emerged after initial novelty subsided. Strikingly, participants underestimated the hedonic favorability of AI conversations, ultimately liking them and feeling better after them than the human conversations in spite of relatively similar expectations. These findings support the notion that anxiety in anticipation of social interaction is substantially evoked by being perceived by another human, rather than the act of conversation itself. As social AI agents become pervasive across social domains, understanding the similarities and differences in the ways we relate to them will be important for maximizing the benefits they can provide and minimizing their potential for harm.",

          "abstract": "Scientific consensus messaging is among the most widely studied and cited approaches in climate change communication. Research consistently shows that scientific consensus messages (“97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is happening”) reduce misperceptions and enable climate change attitudes that reflect the scientific evidence. A concern, however, is that the effects of this and similar consensus messages may reflect memory and experimenter demand effects rather than genuine misperception correction. In this brief empirical note, we outline several theoretical arguments and reanalyze two large-scale secondary datasets from the United States (n = 6,301; van der Linden et al., 2019) and 27 countries (n = 7,000; Većkalov, Geiger et al., 2024), providing evidence that misperception correction following scientific consensus messages is unlikely to be driven by memory and experimenter demand effects alone. First, we show that consensus messaging reduces misperceptions compared to a control condition, even in the highly unlikely scenario that every post-test response at or near 97% reflects memory or experimenter demand effects. Second, we demonstrate that participants report being more persuaded by the scientific consensus message and update their personal beliefs slightly more when they indicate consensus estimates of 97% (vs. a different number) in the post-test. If the ‘97%’ responses were primarily driven by memory effects, we would expect the opposite pattern. Overall, scientific consensus messaging recalibrates scientific consensus perceptions and important attitudes, regardless of whether individuals report exactly 97% at post-test–reinforcing the importance of perceived scientific consensus as a ‘gateway’ belief to evidence-based climate change attitudes.",

          "authors": "Mike Hammes; Maleen Ritter; Timo Zimmermann",
          "abstract": "This study examines the relationships between mental toughness, sport satisfaction and job satisfaction, focusing on job satisfaction as the output-variable. We define mental toughness as a latent construct comprising grit and self-control, reflecting the psychological capacity to maintain goal pursuit and resilience across different life domains. Conservation of Resources Theory emphasizes that personal resources acquired in one domain, such as sport, can be transferred to another, such as work. Considering mental toughness as a personal resource, this framework suggests two competing mediational hypotheses: sports satisfaction transfers to job satisfaction through mental toughness (H1) or mental toughness promotes sport satisfaction, which in turn increases job satisfaction (H2). Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, self-reported data from N = 196 employed individuals were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Results supported hypothesis H1, showing a significant indirect effect (β = .20, p &lt; .01) of sport satisfaction on job satisfaction through mental toughness. In contrast, testing for hypothesis H2, we did not find an indirect effect between mental toughness and job satisfaction through sport satisfaction (β = .01, p = .85). The findings provide cross-sectional support for the resource-transfer mechanism proposed by COR, demonstrating how common variance of satisfaction in recreational sport and at work is statistically explained by mental toughness. Practically, the results highlight the value of promoting recreational sport participation first and mental training in organizations second to enhance employee satisfaction and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Music can be a powerful tool for evoking emotions and memories in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is commonly used in dementia care. Previous research suggests that memories evoked by music tend to vary depending on the experienced valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant) of the songs, show a reminiscence bump (RB) for events from mid-childhood/adolescence, and are linked to certain musical features, such as rhythm, in healthy older adults, but little is known about factors underlying music-evoked memories in AD. In the present study, we used a combination of behavioural ratings of emotional valence, familiarity, and autobiographical salience and musical features analyzed using music information retrieval (MIR) from 70 excerpts of traditional folk songs and popular music from 1950s to 1970s in healthy older adults (n = 40) and persons with mild (n = 29) and moderate/severe (n = 32) dementia to explore how emotional and memory experience of music, valence dependency of musical memories as well as the temporal gradient of the RB and predictive musical features of musical memories change from healthy ageing to advanced AD dementia. Compared to healthy older adults, we observed lower familiarity and autobiographical salience but comparable valence in the AD groups as well as increasingly linear relationship between valence and familiarity and autobiographical salience with advancing AD. Also the temporal gradient (RB) became steeper with advancing AD, peaking earlier in childhood. From musical features, less complex harmonicity predicted higher autobiographical salience and less strong pulse predicted higher familiarity across groups, but this latter relationship showed stronger valence dependency in AD. In conclusion, our findings provide novel insights on how factors associated with music-evoked memories change in the progression of AD, showing differential relationships from healthy ageing to advanced AD. The results can be beneficial in dementia care by helping in individualizing music interventions.",

          "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have lasting consequences for adult romantic relationships, yet dyadic studies of ACEs typically default to distinguishing couples by gender. We argue that this methodological convention may obscure theoretically meaningful trauma-related dynamics. In this study, we compared Actor–Partner Interdependence Models (APIMs) distinguished by gender versus ACE history using data from 202 Canadian couples (N = 404). Couples reported on ACEs, perceived partner responsiveness (PPR) and insensitivity, and sexual satisfaction. When distinguished by gender, models replicated prior literature, yielding strong actor effects for both men and women but small or inconsistent partner effects. By contrast, ACE-distinguished models showed that actor and partner associations localized to the ACE-exposed partner: higher PPR predicted greater sexual satisfaction for both themselves and their non-exposed partners, while greater insensitivity predicted lower satisfaction for both partners. No significant effects were observed for non-exposed partners. We argue that distinguishing dyads by ACE status broadens opportunities for inclusive research, tests of dyadic measurement assumptions, and theory-driven insights into how early adversity reverberates through intimate relationships.",

          "abstract": "Response time and other forms of process data are increasingly incorporated into psychometric models. A frequently overlooked challenge is that response time is often treated as exogenous, even though time use plausibly depends on latent ability. This paper investigates how causal relationships among ability, response time, and response accuracy can bias parameter estimation when conditioning directly on observed time or accuracy without modeling how time is generated. Using causal graphs, we show that when response time depends on latent ability, conditioning on response time can bias both item and person parameter estimates, while conditioning on accuracy can induce spurious associations between time and ability. Simulation results under an explicit data-generating process demonstrate that naive one-step estimation treating response time as exogenous yields systematic distortion in item parameter estimates. To address this problem, we propose a two-step estimation strategy that first estimates ability from response accuracy alone and then fits a time-augmented item response model conditional on these estimates. This approach substantially reduces estimation bias. An empirical analysis of TIMSS data provides evidence of endogeneity in response times and illustrates both the risks of naive conditioning and the value of diagnostic analyses based on structured patterns of time use.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous thought is often considered an unconstrained, internally generated mode of thinking that is independent of the present perceptual environment, making it difficult to study empirically. However, recent accounts have raised the possibility that the generation and content of spontaneous thought can be shaped by even weak perceptual constraints. We leveraged this new perspective to develop a novel approach using music, a ubiquitous stimulus that permeates our everyday environments, as a window into the mechanisms supporting spontaneous thought content. Adults spanning four age groups listened to music from ten different genres and completed the open-ended task of writing descriptions of any thoughts that arose. By applying natural language processing analysis to the spontaneous thought descriptions, we found that thoughts sustained while hearing music from the same genre shared greater semantic similarity than those sustained while hearing music from different genres, and participants from the same age group experienced more similar thoughts than those from different age groups. Properties that varied naturally with genre, including the music’s auditory features, expressed emotions, and contextual associations, all contributed significantly to explaining the greater semantic similarity of thoughts within genres. These results demonstrate that spontaneous thought is jointly shaped by perceptual and experiential constraints, opening new avenues for understanding when and why particular thoughts come to mind, with implications for creativity and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making depends on where attention is allocated and what information is sampled. Although attention plays a critical role in choice, its investigation has largely been limited to overt eye movements, leaving the contribution of covert attention unclear. Here, we combine an attentional probe with value-based choice to directly measure how covert attention is allocated to peripheral options during decision-making. We identify two fundamental features of the attention-choice relationship. First, attention and value interact bidirectionally: option value biases the allocation of covert attention, while covert attention in turn alters value representations and choice. Second, covert and overt attention exert dissociable – and competing – influences on choice behaviour. By demonstrating that attentional influences on decision-making extend beyond eye gaze, our findings challenge current gaze-based accounts of choice, and motivate decision-making models that incorporate covert attentional mechanisms alongside overt attentional dynamics.",

Hypersomnolence may represent a response to traumatic memories, particularly in patients with complex traumatic histories, such as childhood abuse. The small sample size (n=17) limits the generalizability of the findings.

In the task, participants make judgements about the\nsimilarity of predefined concepts of interest which are presented in triads. Based on those\njudgements, a similarity score can be calculated for each pair of concepts. Adding more concepts\nto a triads task design quickly leads to a combinatorial explosion of trials, which can make the\ntriads task inefficient. In our study, we explore two ways of shortening the triads task: leaving out\nconcepts from the pool and balanced incomplete block designs. We employed a triads task with\nconcepts from the topical domains of Open Science and digitization and examined how well\nsimilarity scores calculated from the complete triads task design and from reduced designs were\ncorrelated as a marker of correspondence. Reducing the underlying concept pool and thereby the\nnumber of trials in the triads task led to highly correlated similarity scores but is less efficient in\nreducing the number of trials than balanced incomplete block designs. Similarity scores from the\nbalanced incomplete block designs were highly correlated with those from the complete designs\nand higher compared to the correlations of similarity scores from split-half designs and the\ncomplete designs.

The experimental group viewed videos depicting risky driving behaviors and traffic accidents, whereas the control group viewed videos that were emotionally neutral. Perceived risk was assessed both pre- and post-intervention using a behavioral risk perception task that featured naturalistic driving scenarios. Participants in the experimental group showed a significant increase in perceived risk following the intervention, but no significant change was observed in the control group. Signal Detection Theory analyses indicated that these changes resulted from a modification in the decision threshold.

Perceived stress was assessed pre-post SPB and at no-exercise control times. Vagally-mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as an indicator of stress-related physiology (cardiac vagal activity) was assessed before, during and after SPB or control times. Perception of SPB as natural was assessed after exercises.\nResults: Per protocol Generalized Estimating Equations showed SPB lowered perceived stress compared to control times. vmHRV was higher during and after SPB compared to before but did not significantly differ from control times. When participants perceived SPB as more natural, perceived stress reduction was greater.  \nConclusion: SPB may help to immediately reduce perceived stress and increase vmHRV in daily life. Finding ways to ensure that SPB feels natural seems important to increase effectiveness in future stress management interventions.",

          "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a technique for the monitoring of cardiac signals using simple consumer-grade cameras, such as webcams. Its cost-effectiveness and accessibility make it a promising tool for widespread application, particularly in remote and resource-limited research settings. Yet, it remains unclear whether rPPG can accurately capture the moment-to-moment fluctuations in heart rate (HR) required for robust HR variability (HRV) estimation. In this study, we collected a novel dataset of 77 participants who completed three behavioral tasks under controlled laboratory conditions, designed to mirror the recording setup typically encountered in home-based online experiments. We validated four rPPG pipeline configurations against the electrocardiogram (ECG) ground truth, using a comprehensive set of measures capturing both signal quality and cardiac variability. Moreover, using data from an emotion anticipation task, we assessed whether, in a typical experimental setting, analyses based on rPPG data yielded statistical results comparable to those obtained from ECG. Our results indicate that rPPG is a promising tool for detecting HR and HRV at the group level, particularly in high-powered studies. At the individual level, rPPG reliably captures average HR, but the accuracy of individual-level HRV estimates remain limited. The findings underscore rPPG’s potential as a low-cost, non-invasive research tool, while highlighting the importance of managing its limitations such as sensitivity to excessive movement and poor illumination through thoughtful study planning and execution.",

          "abstract": "Understanding abstract phenomena is a fundamental human need. Emerging evidence increasingly points to the multidimensionality of abstract knowledge representations, with theories emphasising the importance of both embodied and linguistic influences. In the present paper, we argue that the strength with which embodiment shapes the representation of abstract concepts is moderated by cultural beliefs about ontological meaning. Specifically, we predicted that self-identified spirituality—a belief system guided by experiential approach to understanding reality—contributes to greater sensorimotor grounding of abstract concepts. As hypothesised, across 4 studies (N = 729; in the US and UK), Western spiritual beliefs involved stronger sensorimotor associations for highly abstract compared to concrete concepts. Importantly, religious beliefs that conceptually overlap with spirituality did not contribute to these associations. Further, as spiritual beliefs often involve greater rejection of external forms of knowledge, we also explored whether sensorimotor grounding predicted science rejection. Yet, these results were inconclusive. Altogether, individual differences in belief systems guide the mental representation of abstract concepts, with spiritual individuals likely feeling the meaning of words through linking abstract thought with bodily experiences.",

Cross-sectional research suggests the LPP decreases across childhood and adolescence, but few longitudinal studies have characterized within-person change. This study examined developmental trajectories of the LPP from late childhood through early adulthood and tested associations with internalizing symptoms. Participants were 297 females (ages 8-14 at baseline) who were majority White and completed four visits spaced 2-3 years apart. Electroencephalography recorded the LPP while participants viewed neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant images. Multilevel modeling tested the impact of age, emotion condition, and electrode site, as well as links to internalizing symptoms. Results showed that emotion modulation of the LPP decreased with age at Oz and Pz but not Cz, most rapidly in late childhood and early adolescence. Age effects were strongest at Oz, while emotion effects were strongest at Pz at younger ages and both Pz and Cz at later ages. Higher internalizing symptoms were associated with a blunted LPP to pleasant images in childhood and early adolescence.

          "abstract": "Negative perceptions of scientists represent a pressing societal challenge thwarting public acceptance of evidence-based solutions to global crises and emergencies. Integrating work on intergroup similarity and psychological distance to science, we experimentally test whether highlighting similarities between scientists and perceivers promotes favourable perceptions and trust in scientists across three experiments (N = 1189). We predicted that matching (similarity) versus mismatching (dissimilarity) scientists’ socio-demographic profiles to those of participants would lead to more positive judgements and increased trust in scientists. We found support for these predictions when participants compared multiple scientist profiles (Studies 1 &amp; 3), but not when evaluating a single scientist profile (Study 2). Overall, the current findings suggest that highlighting similarities between scientists and the public represents a novel and beneficial way for promoting favourable perceptions of experts.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The aim of the study was to examine the intrapersonal, everyday connections between the dimensions of aggression (internalizing and externalizing) that characterize individuals' everyday experiences. The study also aimed to assess the impact of internalizing aggression (anger and hostility) on externalizing aggression (physical aggression and verbal aggression) and vice versa.\nMethod: The study included 317 participants from Poland. Participants gave an average of 24.83 responses, resulting in a total of k = 7871 observations. Items from the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire were used to measure the four dimensions of aggression. To examine the daily dynamics of aggression, we used dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM).\nResults: Externalizing aggression was found to be positively related to internalizing aggression at both the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels. Our study also confirmed our hypothesis that an increase in internalizing aggression one day predicts higher levels of externalizing aggression the next day.\nConclusion: Our study provided unique insight into assessing the relationship between internalizing aggression (hostility and anger) and externalizing aggression (verbal aggression and physical aggression). Finally, the integration of our research with Wilkowski and Robinson's theory is pointed out.",

          "abstract": "Ruffalo argues that borderline personality disorder (BPD) meets Robins and Guze criteria for diagnostic validity and should be retained as a legitimate psychiatric diagnosis. This response challenges that conclusion, arguing that mid twentieth century biomedical validation models are inadequate for evaluating a construct that regulates identity, relationality, and social deviance. Although BPD may satisfy traditional validators, this does not establish epistemic soundness, ethical defensibility, or clinical legitimacy. Drawing on feminist, decolonial, neurodiversity, and lived experience-led scholarship, this analysis highlights diagnostic circularity, structural harm, and the exclusion of lived experience evidence.

          "authors": "Chris Ludlow; Armita Zarnegar",
          "abstract": "Case formulation plays a central role in psychological therapy, yet its narrative form limits empirical analysis and digital integration. This paper develops a theoretical framework that treats formulation as a structured representation of causal cognition—a generative process linking clinical observations to explanatory hypotheses. Drawing on advances in large language models (LLMs) and graph-based methods, it outlines a conceptual workflow for converting clinical text into machine-readable causal graphs constrained by psychological ontologies. The paper is conceptual in nature and employs simple worked examples to demonstrate how LLMs can identify causal information within narrative formulations and convert it into structured graphs. Within this framework, deep-learning semantic-similarity methods and graph-comparison metrics such as the Jaccard index—implemented in R—serve as illustrative demonstrations of how researchers might begin exploring causal representations using accessible tools, with more advanced graph-learning techniques offering promising directions for future work. Given the stochastic nature of LLMs and the evolving character of clinical reasoning, the aim is not traditional reliability testing but the development of representational principles that approximate clinicians’ explanatory models. Future systems may implement this interactively, prompting clinicians to confirm whether their reasoning has been accurately represented diagrammatically, thereby maintaining alignment between human judgement and its computational depiction. The paper’s contribution is therefore conceptual rather than empirical, offering foundational representational principles and a roadmap for integrating LLMs, graph analytics, and visual interfaces to support clinical reasoning, digital formulation tools, and the development of computational theories of psychological formulation.",

          "abstract": "How does long-term memory (LTM) support working memory (WM) performance? Proposed mechanisms include boosting, where LTM enhances WM representations through additional activation, but does not reduce WM load; chunking, where WM holds references to LTM, reducing WM load; and offloading, where LTM substitutes active maintenance in WM. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we measured the contralateral delay activity (CDA) during an alternative forced-choice WM task, in which some trials (varying in memory array set size) included a pre-learnt color-object binding. The CDA is a well-established neural correlate that indexes the amount of information actively stored in WM, allowing us to test between the three accounts by examining whether including pre-learnt bindings in a memory set of a given size reduced its amplitude compared to maintaining entirely new bindings.\nOverall, our findings supported the boosting account. Pre-learnt bindings improved performance for matching items in WM, but the benefit did not extend to newly encoded items, indicating no reduction in WM load. CDA amplitude increased with set size irrespective of whether the items were pre-learnt or new, reflecting active maintenance of all the to-be-remembered items. Overall, these results show that pre-learnt associations in LTM can boost WM performance without substituting for WM storage, providing evidence against offloading or chunking accounts in this context.",

This commentary argues that such framings are incomplete because they treat stigma as incidental and overlook the structural, epistemic, and iatrogenic harms associated with the BPD construct. Drawing on lived experience research, analyses of epistemic injustice, and evidence of harm arising from standard treatments such as dialectical behaviour therapy, I argue that BPD functions as a credibility-damaging and identity-eroding diagnosis rather than a neutral clinical descriptor. I further situate BPD within psychiatry’s historical regulation of gender and sexual nonconformity, highlighting its disproportionate impact on marginalised populations. Any meaningful discussion of CPTSD–BPD differentiation must therefore move beyond symptom overlap to address power, harm, and whose knowledge is permitted to shape psychiatric classification.",

In this study, we used resting-state fMRI in 148 university students to identify intrinsic network signatures associated with PEB and to test self-regulation as a mechanistic pathway. Whole-brain functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping showed that individual differences in PEB were associated with FCD in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a region implicated in inhibitory control. Follow-up seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses further indicated that functional coupling between the IFG and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was associated with PEB. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that trait self-regulation accounted for a substantial portion of both brain–PEB associations. Together, these findings provide a resting-state network account of PEB and highlight self-regulation as a central pathway through which intrinsic brain organization relates to PEB.",

We provide a step-by-step tutorial demonstrating how {rix} can be used to define, build, and share isolated, project-specific software environments that precisely capture R versions, package dependencies, system libraries, and integrated development environments. We further illustrate this workflow by reproducing a complete manuscript using Quarto and the {apaquarto} extension, showing how analyses, figures, and text can be regenerated in a single, executable pipeline.

Critically, the attitude-behavior gap manifested primarily at the attitude-intention stage rather than the intention-behavior stage. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that neuroticism strongly predicted inconsistent profile membership, whereas conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, and agreeableness predicted membership in higher-consistency profiles. These findings clarify where attitude-behavior gaps occur and demonstrate that personality traits systematically differentiate consistent versus inconsistent environmental engagement patterns.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with significant structural alterations in gray and white matter of the brain, which has potential implications for cognitive and emotional functions. These alterations appear to be related to alcohol use patterns. This study aims to systematically review voxel-based morphometry studies to identify consistent patterns of gray matter and white matter alterations in patients with AUD compared to healthy control subject and explore their associations with alcohol consumption patterns. A systematic review of neuroimaging studies was conducted, analyzing gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) differences between healthy individuals and patients with AUD. Special attention was given to the relationship between alcohol consumption variables (e.g., duration, quantity, frequency) and GM and WM volumes. AUD patients showed significant GM alterations in the right cingulate (SDM-Z = -6.013), right insula (SDM-Z = -6.088) and left Heschl gyrus (SDM-Z = -5.254) compared to healthy control subject. WM alterations were found in the corpus callosum (SDM-Z = -3.537). Meta-regressions revealed dose-dependent associations: AUDIT scores (SDM-Z = -3.143), drinks/day (SDM-Z = -3.504), lifetime drinking (SDM-Z = 3.460), and years of dependence (SDM-Z = 3.063) were each negatively correlated with regional GM volume. Earlier age at first drink was associated with WM volume in the corpus callosum (SDM-Z = 3.229). Longer abstinence was correlated with larger WM volumes. This meta-analysis underscores the associations between alcohol consumption patterns and brain structure and provides evidence of dose-dependent associations between alcohol consumption and neuroanatomical differences.",

In Study 1 (n = 224), adolescents completed a battery of six laboratory EF tasks; task-based EF showed little evidence of reliable associations with PEB, with only a small and non-robust link for trail-making performance. In Study 2 (n = 465), adolescents completed validated self-report measures of everyday EF; all three EF components correlated with PEB, but only inhibition and cognitive flexibility uniquely predicted PEB when modeled simultaneously, and these effects remained after controlling for demographics and the Big Five personality traits. Overall, typical everyday EF (especially inhibition and cognitive flexibility), as indexed by self-report, showed stronger and unique associations with everyday PEB than did optimal EF performance on laboratory tasks. Reducing demands on inhibition and cognitive flexibility in everyday choice environments may help promote adolescent PEB.",

Unlike more traditional EEG-measures of attention, NET considers where attention is directed to by correlating the teacher’s voice with the EEG-decoded stimulus. EEG data were collected while participants (n = 30) watched a video lecture on neuromyths that included attention manipulations (e.g., distraction, enhancement). Participants also provided self-reported attention ratings and completed a performance test on its content. The results indicated that NET was sensitive to decreases in external on-topic attention during distractions, supporting the potential of NET as an indicator of external on-topic auditory attention during learning.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed a positive association between self-control (SC) and pro-environmental behaviors (PEB). However, most of these studies have relied primarily on cross-sectional designs, thus limiting knowledge regarding the dynamic relationship between SC and PEB over time. The present study addresses this gap by adopting a longitudinal approach. In Study 1, SC and PEB were measured across two waves among 221 Chinese high school students. Cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) revealed that SC predicted subsequent PEB. In Study 2, SC and PEB were measured across three waves among 1,286 Chinese university students. The CLPMs replicated the findings of Study 1, demonstrating rank-order cross-lagged effects of SC on PEB. More importantly, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) revealed that SC was positively associated with PEB at the between-person level, such that individuals with higher SC exhibited greater PEB. However, no cross-lagged effects emerged at the within-person level, suggesting that changes in an individual's SC do not directly alter their PEB. These findings indicate that while SC is a stable trait associated with individual differences in PEB, naturally occurring SC fluctuations may not drive short-term behavioral change, highlighting the potential value of exploring strategies that minimize reliance on SC capacity or resources and considering SC as a criterion for selecting individuals for key environmental roles.",

          "abstract": "Nonhuman animals are relational, sentient, and existential beings, who form bonds with conspecifics, respond to others, and engage in meaningful relations with humans. They possess capacities for suffering, learning, and affective responses. They live as situated and embodied, who are vulnerable, finite, and encounter threat, fear, and loss. These features position nonhuman animals differently from purely ecological or biological entities, while situating them in close proximity to human existence and the social world. Individuals, therefore, need to maintain relations with nonhuman animals. When humans become relationally disconnected from them, however, nonhuman animals are not recognized as subject of experience, and are instead reduced to objects of exclusion, domination, and exploitation. The alienation from nonhuman animals, in turn, results in possible relational disconnection from other domains, particularly the social world. \nThe present conceptual work challenges contemporary anthropocentric models of theoretical frameworks, focusing on the being-in-the-world model. It critically reviews theoretical conceptualizations of human existence in both existential philosophy and existential psychology. It integrates empirical works adapted from existential psychology research and social psychology studies. The human-animal relational world of existence, in turn, is brought into view to redefine the largely ignored animal existence conceptualization within psychology. Nonhuman animals, therefore, are conceptualized as relational others, and are proposed to be incorporated into the model of being-in-the-world. In doing so, the model offers a more comprehensive understanding of human existence, while recognizing nonhuman animals as subjects of experience, capable of suffering, cognition, and relation.",

          "abstract": "Traits are the currency of personality psychology and social cognition, helping us understand and represent both real and perceived differences between people and groups. Here, we advance our understanding of trait language by revealing new insights into the content, structure, and evolution of trait words using large language models (LLM) and human raters. Across four studies, we: (a) introduce one of the most comprehensive trait lists to-date (2,847 trait words); (b) establish normative human ratings of these traits (from N = 3,070 English speakers) along 24 dimensions from past literature; (c) detect a four-factor structure of Fitness, Agency, Communion, and Traditionalism (FACT) from these dimensions; and (d) reveal systematic differences in the coherence, valence, and historical evolution of these dimensions and factors. Specifically, we find that the FACT model covers 96% of trait words. Moreover, these four factors differ in their coherence (e.g., Communion is the most semantic coherent while Traditionalism the least), valence (e.g., Communion and Agency show more alignment between their semantic direction and valence than Traditionalism and Fitness; Communion has more negative words while Agency and Traditionalism more positive ones); and historical usage (e.g., Fitness and Communion are older than Traditionalism; Communion is converging in semantic space while Agency diverging). These findings showcase new LLM-based methods for discovering and analyzing trait words. We close by motivating a functional constructivist view in which trait concepts are tools for social evaluation, shaped by the recurrent social interaction problems they help solve, and organized accordingly in semantic structure and use.",

          "abstract": "Story reading is often accompanied with mental visualization of the described scenes and events. Recent findings indicate that individuals who report not experiencing any visual imagery (a condition called aphantasia), also report being less absorbed and engaged when reading stories. In the present study, we explored how aphantasics (n = 8) and controls (n = 20) read imagery-rich stories. We recorded eye movements while participants were reading two short stories and analyzed fixation patterns in relation to the stories’ imagery content. We observed that imagery content influenced gaze fixation similarly in both groups. More specifically, under perceptual imagery, which involves sensory-rich content, the influence was the strongest, resulting in longer fixation durations during reading of the relevant words and phrases. Despite the same fixation patterns on imagery content, aphantasics reported experiencing less immersion in the stories. Furthermore, we tentatively observed that in control subjects, longer fixation duration on perceptual imagery content was correlated with higher experienced mental imagery, whereas in aphantasic individuals, this relationship did not hold and was even reversed. While our sample size is limited, our results may align with the account that imagery under aphantasia may be nonconscious rather than nonexistent. Given that only reported subjective experiences differed under aphantasia, the condition may primarily impair introspective access to mental images.",

          "authors": "Jürgen Kayser",
          "abstract": "Temporal principal components analysis (tPCA) is widely used to identify and quantify event-related potentials (ERPs). It is less commonly applied to single-trial EEG epochs, despite concerns about the low signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty about how single-trial components compare with those derived from averaged waveforms. Alternatively, averaged principal components (PCs) can be imposed on single trials via back-projection. This study evaluated the fidelity of single-trial and back-projected single-trial tPCA (covariance-based, unrestricted Varimax rotation) in representing meaningful averaged PCs by systematically comparing factor loadings and factor scores in two existing ERP datasets (72-channel, N=152; 67-channel, N=98), using both surface-referenced (infinity, nose) and reference-free current source density (CSD) transformations. In the 72-channel dataset with four balanced conditions (emotional hemifield paradigm), single-trial PCs closely matched those from averaged data, whereas in the 67-channel dataset with three imbalanced conditions (novelty oddball task), they did not. In contrast, across datasets and transformations, back-projected single-trial PCs consistently reproduced virtually identical averaged PCs. All single-trial tPCA solutions enabled full reconstruction of the original data matrix, confirming the methodological validity of back-projected decomposition, and critically, back-projection enabled reliable estimation of internal consistency for PCA-derived component measures at the single-trial level, with all component scores showing high or adequate reliability. These findings suggest that single-trial tPCA may approximate averaged solutions only when the variance structure is preserved, whereas back-projection provides a robust alternative by quantifying single-trial epochs relative to the averaged covariance structure, thereby maintaining component structure, integrity, and interpretability of trial-level component estimates in continuity with established ERP constructs.",

          "abstract": "Precision psychiatry aims to identify biomarkers and develop prediction models to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection. Despite extensive research, translating findings into clinically useful tools remains challenging. Here we argue that one key contributor to this translational gap is a pervasive misalignment between routine statistical analytic practices and the criteria for clinical utility. To address this, we introduce E2P (effect-to-prediction) Simulator, an interactive web tool for estimating the real-world predictive value and clinical utility of biomarkers and prediction models by accounting for real-world outcome base rates and measurement reliability – a procedure we term predictive utility analysis. Similar to how power analysis helps optimize research for statistical significance, predictive utility analysis can help optimize it for practical significance. The interactive nature of E2P Simulator makes this approach accessible to non-statistician researchers while also providing publication-ready figures to aid with transparency and standardization of reporting. We demonstrate its application in three key areas: diagnostic (depression, Alzheimer’s disease), treatment response (antidepressants), and risk (suicide attempts and psychosis onset) prediction, highlighting conditions under which we may expect clinically meaningful advances. While we focus on translational challenges in psychiatry, the framework and tools presented here address general statistical challenges and are broadly applicable across biomedical and behavioral sciences.",

          "abstract": "Xiang, Dorst, and Gershman (2025) recently challenged previous research and theory regarding the gambler’s fallacy. They concluded that when sequences of events are truly random, the fallacy is observed for binary predictions but not probability judgments and that binary predictions cannot be reconstructed from probability judgments, in contrast to most theoretical accounts. This “disconnection” implies that new theories may be needed. However, a reanalysis of Xiang et al.’s data using their methods and very similar methods yields strong evidence for a gambler’s fallacy for probability judgments (although not for all participants) and indicates that the gap between probability judgments and binary predictions was overstated. A version of Rabin and Vayanos’s (2010) model accounts for responses to both question types reasonably well, suggesting that such theories are not seriously threatened. Finally, we propose stratified random sampling of sequences as a more efficient method for presenting participants with representative sequences of events.",

However, empirical evidence linking reward processing to resilience remains indirect, as research to date has lacked prospective longitudinal mental health assessments and failed to control for interindividual variability in severity of stressor exposure. In a longitudinal study of at-risk individuals (N=230), we assessed reward system function at the neural level and in real life, while monitoring mental health and stressor exposure over time. Greater ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity during reward outcome and higher positive affect predicted higher stress resilience, whereas greater real-life positive affective reactivity predicted lower resilience. Crucially, blunted positive affective reactivity mediated the vmPFC association with higher resilience. These findings suggest that a well-functioning reward system buffers the negative impact of stress by promoting emotional stability in response to pleasant experiences.",

While beliefs and expectations are widely acknowledged as fundamental drivers of placebo effects – physiological improvements that result exclusively and directly from psychological processes – the role of attention is often neglected in theoretical accounts of the placebo phenomenon and remains poorly understood. We argue that placebo effects and health mindsets are a product of continuous interaction between attention, beliefs, and expectations. We end by discussing novel predictions generated by the Embodied Models of Health framework and highlight opportunities to leverage the role of attention in mind-body dynamics to improve health and wellbeing.",

          "authors": "Lukas Joscha Beinhauer; Jens Fuenderich; Frank Renkewitz",
          "abstract": "Heterogeneity in standardised effect sizes, such as Cohen’s d, provides evidence that a phenomenon varies across contexts or populations. One influential methodological explanation for such variation is that it arises from differences in measurement precision across studies. Such an explanation implies that correcting effect sizes for attenuation due to score unreliability should reduce between-study variability. We reanalyse data on a wide range of phenomena from large-scale collaborative projects, including the ManyLabs studies, Registered Replication Reports, and the Psychological Science Accelerator. Applying conventional attenuation correction procedures we find that differences in score reliability are small across data sets and can not explain effect size heterogeneity. Contrary to prevailing claims in the methodological literature on research synthesis, rather than decreasing heterogeneity, attenuation correction procedures increased heterogeneity for most phenomena. Therefore, we propose an alternative framework that treats standardised effect sizes as ratio variables to better understand how differences in score reliability relate to heterogeneity. Based on this framework we identify conditions under which attenuation procedures will necessarily increase effect size heterogeneity. Our re-analyses imply that between-study differences in underlying true score variances dominate the comparatively small variation in random measurement error. Such findings suggest that unreliability is unlikely to be a major driver of effect size heterogeneity for phenomena comparable to the ones reanalysed here. More broadly, the results suggest that meta-analysts should not expect that effect size heterogeneity can be reduced or explained by controlling for differences in measurement precision.",

          "abstract": "Reading, unlike spoken language, requires explicit instruction and sustained practice throughout life. Empirical evidence shows that most new words learned by older children and adults are acquired through reading. The Author Recognition Test (ART) is a widely used psychometric tool designed to assess print exposure indirectly. Although the ART has been adapted to various languages, no robust version existed for Spanish speakers in the Rioplatense region of Uruguay and Argentina. This article presents the development, adaptation, and validation of a Rioplatense Spanish version of the ART (ART-RP), based on data from two large-scale online studies.\nIn Study 1, 2347 participants completed the ART-RP along with a vocabulary test and a reading habits questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) models were used to analyze test structure and psychometric properties. In Study 2, an independent sample of 257 participants completed the ART-RP along with two reading tasks: a lexical decision task and a self-paced reading task. ART-RP scores correlated significantly with vocabulary scores, self-reported reading habits, and response latencies in both tasks.\nDespite some limitations in test informativeness at high ability levels, the results support the validity and reliability of the ART-RP as a measure of lifetime print exposure in Spanish-speaking populations. The test, including source code and item lists, is openly available for use in research and educational contexts.",

          "abstract": "Responses to Likert-type behavioral frequency (LBF) questions often do not consistently map onto objective numerical estimates. Prior research suggests that social and other comparisons may underlie this divergence, but the relative influence of different comparison standards—and the cognitive processes supporting them—remains unclear. Across two studies, we examined how comparisons to peers, averages, experts, past selves, and conceptually irrelevant standards shape LBF responses for common health behaviors (e.g., hand washing, flossing). Participants provided LBF judgments, absolute frequency estimates, and comparative judgments for each behavior. Study 1 showed that direct comparisons predicted LBF judgments above and beyond participants’ own absolute frequency estimates, with comparisons to experts and average others being especially influential. Even when controlling for shared methodological variance, all comparison types explained unique variance in LBF responses. Study 2 replicated this pattern of results. Moreover, additional analyses in Study 2 suggest that participants were not making precise, pairwise comparisons between numeric estimates, but were instead relying on more abstract, gist-like impressions of how their behavior compared to others’. Together, these findings underscore the importance of considering the comparative and interpretive nature of self-report measures, particularly in contexts where behavioral frequency carries social, normative, or evaluative meaning.",

          "abstract": "Loot boxes are the focus of growing research and regulatory attention. While they are frequently treated as a monolithic feature of games by researchers and policymakers, loot box implementations are not uniform: the features of loot boxes vary from game to game in ways that may have important consequences for player spending and behaviour. Despite this, previous attempts to classify loot boxes have either not focused on the impact of loot box features on player behaviour and spending, or have not attempted to fully map the different forms that loot boxes currently take. In this work, we attempt to illustrate the nuance present in loot box implementation in a featural model. Using our lived experience, a qualitative coding exercise, and consultation with an industry professional, we identify thirty-two features of loot box-like mechanics that might be expected to influence player behavior or spending, which we group into five domains: ​point of purchase, pulling procedure, contents, audiovisual presentation, a​nd salience​. Each feature is broken down into two or more categorization tags for a given loot box, and illustrative examples of each feature are provided. This work may serve to guide researchers in studying how different types of loot boxes may affect players, aid regulators in ensuring that any proposed legislation is sufficiently nuanced to handle the wide variation in loot box design, and help parents and players to better understand the inner workings of loot boxes during play.",

          "abstract": "Autistic people experience poorer health outcomes and significant barriers to healthcare. Research has historically excluded autistic people from underserved backgrounds, such as those from racially minoritised communities, low-income households, individuals with co-occurring learning disabilities, or those who are non- or minimally speaking. Consequently, there is limited evidence on how healthcare systems can meet the needs of the most disadvantaged. This paper evaluates an innovative practice in autism research, combining co-production with Participatory Systems Mapping and creative methods to explore the healthcare experiences of underserved autistic adults. We co-designed workshops with a steering group of autistic adults from underserved groups (n= 6) using persona development, user journey mapping, and stakeholder prioritisation to evaluate and interrogate causal relationships in healthcare access. Thirty-one participants took part across four workshops from underserved community groups in South Yorkshire. The sample included representation from Somali and Black African communities (35.5%) and participants from areas of high deprivation according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (Mdn= 2, Range= 1–9). There was also some involvement of autistic people with co-occurring learning disabilities and those who were non- or minimally speaking. Feedback from the workshops demonstrated that participants felt able to share ideas and experiences. A validated causal loop diagram was produced with the steering group (\"Misalignment-Invalidation Cycle\"), illustrating how communication barriers and clinician invalidation generate reinforcing loops of misalignment in understanding and disengagement from healthcare. Ultimately, this approach provides a practical blueprint for engaging underserved autistic people and generating actionable insights to inform more inclusive healthcare interventions.",

          "abstract": "The mainstreaming of generative AI tools has coincided with renewed attention to youth slang, exemplified by Oxford University Press’s 2024 Word of the Year “brain rot” and Dictionary.com’s 2025 Word of the Year “67”. These trends have intensified concerns about the spread of semantically opaque, deliberately nonsensical slang among Generation Alpha, often framed as evidence of mental or cognitive decline. We propose a socio-motivational framework that reframes brain rot slang in youths as a socially and psychologically meaningful form of everyday resistance to AI-shaped communication environments. Drawing on social identity theory, we argue that brain rot slang operates as a social creativity strategy that preserves human in-group distinctiveness against AI as a quasi out-group, shifting linguistic competition away from domains where AI excels and toward context-bound, rapidly evolving, absurd expressions. Integrating self-determination theory, engaging in the vernacular play of brain rot slang fulfils basic psychological needs by fostering relatedness through shared humour and peer recognition, supporting autonomy in self-expression, and building competence through mastery of rapidly changing interactional codes that maintain linguistic agency rather than offloading language generation to AI. Taken together, we outline a process model in which AI-shaped communication environments heighten threats to social identity motives and basic psychological needs, increasing brain rot slang use that may in turn buffer these threats. This perspective positions brain rot slang not as a deficit or pathology, but as a patterned form of AI resistance through which youths negotiate agency, competence, relatedness, and identity, in an increasingly AI-mediated communicative space.",

          "abstract": "Perception and decision-making are strongly influenced by previously presented information. Research on serial dependence has revealed significant attractive biases towards previous stimuli, suggesting that integrating information from both past and present stimuli is beneficial when representing information about the environment. Strong serial dependence is mainly found when consecutive stimuli are similar providing evidence that serial dependence supports continuity. Small changes in the stimulus are not perceived as meaningful stimulus changes and should hence be integrated. In the current study we examined the role of continuity further and presented sequences of Gabors which were similar in their orientation, but their spatial frequency was either constant or random. This created stable and unstable environments. \nWe consistently found serial dependence. Interestingly, serial dependence was stronger when the spatial frequency was random compared to constant. In stable contexts, predictive coding mechanisms might sharpen neural representations of the expected input, improve discrimination and reduce the need to integrate past information.\nAdditionally, a form of optimal integration was observed when the uncertainty of the final Gabor was low. Using similar orientations across longer sequences seemed to induce a form of optimal integration of past and present information, potentially creating the continuous perception of a single object when the current trial's uncertainty was low.",

          "abstract": "Past research suggests that smartphone use negatively impacts psychological well-being, but it has often overlooked the role of different smartphone use purposes. In two studies, we investigated how specific types of smartphone use – active and passive social use, news consumption, entertainment, and practical use – relate to psychological well-being. In Study 1, participants (N = 572) completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing self-reported smartphone use and psychological well-being indicators. Multiple regression analyses revealed that passive social smartphone use was linked to lower psychological well-being, while the remaining use purposes were not significantly associated with well-being. In Study 2, participants (N = 496) took part in a 10-day daily diary study, reporting their smartphone use and psychological well-being at the end of the day. Multi-level analyses showed that, at a between-person level, active social use was associated with higher positive affect and stress, while passive social use was linked to worse scores on all indicators of psychological well-being. In contrast, news consumption was associated with better scores on all psychological well-being outcomes. Entertainment was linked to lower positive affect and higher negative affect. Lastly, practical use was linked to higher negative affect and higher stress. At a within-person level, analyses showed that increases in active social use and practical use were linked to higher stress. Collectively, findings from the two studies highlight the nuanced effects of smartphone use on psychological well-being, underscoring the need for a more granular approach to understanding smartphone use and well-being.",

This is in the spirit of the original puzzle raised by (Katzman et al., 1988), who identified individuals whose cognitive abilities had been well above average despite post mortem revealing neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. More commonly these days, the term is used by neurologists to describe people who show comparable atrophy on a clinical brain scan, yet differ markedly in their cognitive function. This “puzzle” is important, particularly if we can identify factors, such as lifestyle choices, that might boost this reserve, allowing individuals to maintain their cognitive abilities for longer, despite brain atrophy.",

          "abstract": "Many students in STEM programs experience motivational declines early in their studies, which predict later academic difficulties and dropout. The psychological processes that make some students more susceptible to motivational declines in achievement situations are still not well understood. Drawing on situated expectancy-value theory, this study examined the motivational beliefs of beginning STEM students in Germany (N = 3,213) who completed a low-stakes, statewide test of math prerequisites. Students rated their test-specific motivation four times during the test as they worked on different math content (e.g., basic arithmetic, geometry, calculus). Cross-classified variance decomposition analyses indicated that variation in students’ test-specific motivation and performance was primarily due to differences between individuals (person-level variance) and, to a lesser extent, differences between tested math content (content-level variance) and residual situation-specific variance. Cross-classified random effects models further showed that test performance and the difficulty of different content areas predicted students’ motivational beliefs after working on each test section. Importantly, even after controlling for differences in actual test performance, students with higher prior math achievement and higher-quality learning opportunities in high school reported higher test-specific motivation. Cross-level interactions indicated that positive prior experiences boosted students’ test-specific motivation independent of their test performance. Students’ test performance predicted their later performance in math-intensive STEM courses. These findings suggest that efforts to support STEM students’ motivation should consider the lasting impact of previous experiences with math, as these experiences shape students’ perceptions and engagement with new achievement situations within STEM—even in the absence of situation-specific performance differences.",

To break this ceiling, we need to better understand what causes these differences, and whether similar viewing tendencies are also reflected in similar cognitive profiles in observers. To this end, we tracked eye movements during an image-choice task in which subjects selected images varying in arousal. We then conducted first-person interviews (micro-phenomenological and cognitive analysis) to understand their decision process and identify individual cognitive strategies. We provide a proof-of-concept bridge between first-person elicitation and eye-tracking, demonstrating that structured experiential profiles align with objective oculomotor indices. Quantitative variables were derived from qualitative first-person interview verbatim, and then analyzed by   Principal Component Analysis. We identified gaze parameters stable across trials and correlated them with the first three Principal Components. For instance, the gaze of participants who were more emotionally engaged was more driven by bottom-up visual saliency, and was more scattered across their preferred image. Our method uses the idiosyncrasy of gaze patterns as a structured signal reflecting personal decision process. We argue that observer-level factors derived from cognitive interviews can be integrated with image features to create individualized models of attention.",

          "authors": "Semih Can Aktepe; Daniel W. Heck",
          "abstract": "Binary judgments are widely used in psychological research to understand decision-making processes. Common analysis approaches include analysis of variance (ANOVA) of choice proportions, signal detection theory (SDT) of choice frequencies, and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) of dichotomous judgments. For substantive researchers, it may be unclear how these three methods differ. Therefore, we explain how the methods relate to each other and highlight their advantages and limitations. Given that a systematic comparison using empirical datasets remains lacking, it is difficult to judge the practical relevance of choosing a specific method. To address this gap, we compared ANOVA, SDT, and GLMMs using 20 openly available datasets featuring the illusory truth effect, a robust phenomenon frequently examined with binary judgments. GLMMs with a moderately complex random-effects structure produced more stable and conservative effect size estimates than the other methods. Moreover, GLMMs can resolve assumption violations of ANOVA and enable a direct interpretation in terms of SDT while being less sensitive to missing data. Overall, GLMMs are a theoretically sound and practically robust method and thus superior for analyzing binary judgments in social and cognitive psychology.",

          "authors": "Zhouzhou He; Niall Bolger; Kevin Ochsner",
          "abstract": "When someone shares their troubles with us, how do we decide how to respond? While decades of research has characterized how people talk about emotional events, less is known about how people choose to respond to others' distress. To address this issue, we bridged research from affective science and social psychology to develop the Regulator Beliefs about Social Regulation (RBSR) scale, which measures an individual's beliefs about the kinds of support distressed others might want and how they tend to act as social regulators of them. Three studies examined the nature of these beliefs and their impact on social interactions in close relationships. Study 1 used factor analyses to select 12 items for the RBSR scale that captured four theoretically meaningful and distinct beliefs. Study 2A showed that individuals with high RBSR scores are generally more emotionally expressive, better self-regulators, less lonely and experience more positive and less negative emotions. Studies 2B and Study 3A demonstrated that a regulator’s beliefs vary across situations and are sensitive to the intensity of a distressed target’s negative emotions. Study 3B found that, in real world interactions, the different kinds of beliefs assessed by the RBSR scale predicted target emotions, feelings of closeness and perceptions of their partner’s real-world regulatory behaviors. Taken together, this work is significant in at least two ways: Theoretically, it describes how beliefs about social regulation contribute to well-being. Methodologically, it offers a validated tool for assessing these beliefs across multiple kinds of social, affective, organizational and clinical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Does the utility of an outcome influence people's assessment of risk and uncertainty? Prominent theories propose that people rely on mental simulation to evaluate probabilities and risky events, yet prior empirical findings is mixed as to whether and how utility biases this process. Across four experiments (total N=206, with Experiment 4 pre-registered), we tested this question using a random generation paradigm, in which participants mentally simulated gamble outcomes and said them out loud. Then we compared these responses with probability judgments and predictions. While we identified individual differences, the majority of participants exhibited neutrality, with no systematic impact of utility on their sampling distributions. Nevertheless, an optimism subgroup emerged, with a larger proportion of optimistic participants when the monetary context was more salient. Additionally, outcome utilities have similar effects on probability judgments, predictions, and random generation tasks, consistent with the proposal that these tasks are related to each other and may all rely on mental simulation. These findings indicate that utility does not uniformly distort mental simulation, but can do so for a stable subgroup under particular motivational contexts, and they motivate cognitive models that capture both unbiased and optimistic forms of mental sampling.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: The aims of this study were to adapt the Modern Racism Scale (McConahay, 1986) to the German context and to test its psychometric soundness. The German MRS (GMRS) was developed within the German National Monitoring of Discrimination and Racism and is intended to capture racist attitudes towards ethnic and religious minorities. Methods: In two cross-sectional studies, we tested the GMRS in its factor structure and measurement invariance across non-racialized, racialized, and non-racialized individuals with a migration background, as well as gave initial evidence for convergent validity. Results: In Study 1 (N = 13.903), results from Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses using traditional fit indices indicated a one-factor and a two-factor solution consisting of the factors (1) denial of persistent discrimination and (2) perception of excessive demands and undeserved advantages. In Study 2 (N = 2.330), both factor solutions meet the traditional cutoffs, indicating an acceptable model fit as well. However, tailored dynamic fit indices, as a novel approach to evaluate model fit, were used to discuss potential misfits. In both studies, evidence for measurement invariance was provided on at least scalar level, and findings indicated initial evidence for convergent validity (e.g., including the propensity to make attributions to prejudice). Conclusions: The GMRS serves as a psychometrically sound instrument to measure modern racist attitudes towards ethnic and religious minorities in Germany. Limitations and practical recommendations of the scale are discussed.",

Electronic databases were searched for quantitative studies published between 2015 and 2025 assessing smartphone exposure occurring within the final 0–120 minutes before attempted sleep, including in-bed use. Primary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and global sleep quality.\n\nReporting followed PRISMA 2020 standards. Due to substantial heterogeneity in exposure definitions, outcome measures, and study designs, synthesis was conducted using Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM). Certainty of evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework, alongside structured evaluation of measurement validity, reliability, and fairness based on the AERA, APA, and NCME Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing.\n\nAcross included studies, later and more intensive smartphone use was generally associated with shorter sleep duration, prolonged sleep onset latency, and poorer subjective sleep quality, although effect sizes were small and certainty of evidence was predominantly low. Objective sleep measures yielded inconsistent findings. A pre-specified exploratory subgroup examining swipe-based dating application use identified no eligible studies reporting timing-specific sleep outcomes, indicating a current evidence gap.\n\nFindings support cautious interpretation and highlight the importance of measurement precision, exposure timing, and contextual moderators in future research.

          "abstract": "Survey measures are common in intervention research, but may suffer from biases such as socially desirable responding (SDR). While previous work demonstrates how unaddressed SDR can affect study results in observational contexts, the degree to which SDR may affect treatment effect estimates from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is less studied. To shed light on this issue, we examine empirical data from 10 RCTs from education, psychology, and health fields and compare estimated treatment effects from models that do and do not account for SDR. Results show that, with two exceptions, estimated treatment effects were mostly unaffected by SDR. We complement our empirical results with a simulation study to determine the degree of SDR necessary to bias treatment effects and find that severe SDR can bias treatment effects when not accounted for in the model. However, models accounting for SDR are more complex and produce estimates that are slightly downwardly biased despite being the data-generating model. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for researchers using survey instruments as outcomes in RCTs.",

Non-Negative Elastic Net Regression identified predictors of cPTSD. 83%met diagnostic criteria for cPTSD, with a further 10% meeting criteria for PTSD. Strongest predictors included homelessness, childhood abuse, residential care and child removal. Findings indicate trauma exposure is characterized by cumulative adversity and prolonged unsafe conditions rather than isolated events. Current diagnostic frameworks may inadequately capture these experiences, underscoring the need for trauma-informed approaches that recognize structural harm and exclusion from statutory support.",

          "abstract": "Item removal decisions in exploratory factor analysis (EFA) are often only loosely documented in methods sections, which limits transparency and makes results difficult to reproduce. This paper introduces EFA-Boosting, an iterative optimization algorithm designed to systematically identify and eliminate problematic items (e.g., cross-loadings, weak primary loadings, and Heywood cases) using configurable rules that produce a complete audit trail of every elimination decision. The algorithm follows a hierarchical logic in which structural violations are addressed before fit refinement, and it evaluates candidate solutions using a composite loss function that integrates RMSEA, SRMR, and CFI through adaptive weights. Because RMSEA can be spuriously inflated when degrees of freedom are very small, the RMSEA weight is automatically recalibrated when degrees of freedom fall below five; preliminary calibration studies indicated this threshold as appropriate for preventing spurious RMSEA inflation from driving elimination decisions. Monte Carlo simulations encompassing 27,000 replications across 54 experimental conditions demonstrated that specificity ranged from 95% to 100% in multifactorial models and from 85% to 92% in unidimensional models, while sensitivity averaged between 73% and 80% overall and exceeded 90% when models contained three factors with sample sizes of at least 500 observations. Comparative analyses against a threshold-based baseline procedure revealed that conventional loading-magnitude criteria achieved zero percent sensitivity because items with cross-loadings typically maintain high primary loadings that exceed standard\ncutoffs, whereas EFA-Boosting achieved 77.5% sensitivity with a Youden index of 0.74, representing a substantial improvement in detecting structurally problematic items. Although the algorithm does not eliminate researcher judgment regarding threshold selection, factor enumeration, or the balance between statistical and substantive criteria, it provides documented traceability that enables other researchers to examine and replicate the sequence of decisions that shaped the final factor solution.",

          "abstract": "Sensation seeking (SS) is the drive to pursue novel and intense experiences, often despite associated risks. Thus, it is commonly assumed to reflect a heightened valuation of stimulation. Yet, intense experiences are also highly informative, raising a key question: Does SS reflect a preference for intensity or for information/uncertainty? We address this in two studies. In Experiment 1, we fit learning-based choice models to a prior dataset and found that an uncertainty-weighted account explained behaviour better than a purely intensity-weighted account, with higher SS linked to reduced uncertainty aversion. In a preregistered Experiment 2, we investigated the joint contribution of intensity and uncertainty. We demonstrate that SS contributions are context-dependent: when stimulation was valued less, higher SS predicted greater uncertainty-tolerance (i.e., higher information-seeking). In contrast, when stimulation was highly valued, higher SS shifted toward uncertainty avoidance. By contrast, impulsivity (IP) showed a distinct profile consistent with uncertainty aversion when stimulation was valued less. These results reveal SS as a joint, context-dependent function of value and uncertainty processing, rather than a single process. This framework reconciles how SS can support adaptive exploration in some settings yet promote maladaptive risk in others, and it provides a mechanistic dissociation from impulsivity with implications for targeted intervention and developmental theory.",

          "abstract": "Longitudinal research on crowdsourced platforms faces substantial attrition, yet there remains little experimental evidence to guide design decisions. We conducted an experiment (N = 1,798) on Prolific, orthogonally manipulating payment rate (£6, £9, or £9/hour plus completion bonus) and session interval (1, 2, or 4 weeks) across five sessions. We also measured habitual tendencies using the Creature of Habit Scale (COHS) and recorded participants’ prior platform experience. Session interval strongly predicted retention: participants in the one-week condition were 1.6x as likely to complete all sessions as those in the four-week condition (80% vs. 50%). Payment rate, by contrast, had no significant effect on retention or response speed. At the individual level, prior platform experience was the strongest predictor of retention, with more experienced participants significantly more likely to complete all sessions. The two COHS subscales showed divergent effects: routine modestly predicted higher retention, whereas automaticity predicted lower retention, challenging the assumption that habit functions as a unitary construct. These findings suggest that researchers designing longitudinal studies on crowdsourced platforms may benefit more from shorter inter-session intervals than from incremental increases in compensation, and that individual differences in habitual tendencies shape attrition in ways that may affect sample composition over time.",

However, the failed replication study by Foody et al. (2015) typically goes uncited. Given their importance, I critically re-evaluate the results of both articles. I found several issues, the most important of which was that the central claim does not correspond with the reported analyses. When I extracted summary statistics from both studies and used them to conducte a multiverse analysis, that mapped directly onto the original claim (i.e., that the hierarchy condition reduced distress more than the distinction condition), null results were found under every set of conditions.

Using a reinforcement learning model, we simulate three different theorized strategies in an adversarial reward learning environment that requires very high variability. These mechanisms are (1) relying on a stochastic generator, (2) increasing one’s learning rate, or (3) upvaluing unchosen actions. A systematic parameter search and a policy gradient meta-learning algorithm both show that agents can adaptively increase variability with each of those strategies. Next, we fitted our model on existing datasets with humans, pigeons, and rats as subjects in adversarial environments. While all three species can engage in highly variable behavior, we find that only humans upvalue unchosen actions as a strategy to achieve variability.",

          "abstract": "The availability of real-world object stimuli that meet researchers’ requirements is an ongoing challenge in visual cognition research. While numerous manually curated object stimuli sets exist, stimuli features such as size, colour and orientation tend to vary widely within a given set, and may not be suitable for studies with specific requirements regarding these parameters. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate the generation of custom-made, highly realistic stimuli. Building on these developments, the present aim was to share a set of 200 AI-generated everyday object images for use in research. The objects were oriented as though ‘placed’ on a flat surface, such that they could be naturally embedded in virtual scenes. Moreover, they were created in greyscale and suitable for rendering in different colours. Here, we report the method used to efficiently generate the stimuli, as well as the results from a validation study in which we assessed the nameability, perceived realism and familiarity of the stimuli in a sample of 45 younger (18-35) and 45 older (65-85) adults. As anticipated, the majority of the stimuli were rated highly across all three measures, and no significant age differences were observed. The results thus validated most of the stimuli for future research. The stimuli, each in seven colours, and the corresponding validation scores are openly available for future use. To our knowledge, the current work is the first to develop an openly available AI-generated real-world object stimuli set with corresponding validation measures of nameability, realism and familiarity.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol is one of the most used substances globally, but motives for use vary and may shift across the lifespan. Drinking motives are commonly divided between 1) coping: to alleviate negative affect, 2) enhancement: because the feeling is nice, 3) social: to enhance social interactions, and 4) conformity: to fit in a group; and measured using the Drinking Motives Questionnaire Revised (DMQ-R). Given that social expectations and the neurological processes underlying alcohol use do not follow linear trajectories, the present study investigates how motives for alcohol use and their associations with use change across the lifespan without assuming linearity. Alcohol users (N = 908; 16-81yrs) completed the DMQ-R and measures of alcohol use severity. Generalized additive models assessed non-linear associations between, drinking motives, age, and alcohol use severity, including age-by-motive interactions to assess changes across age. Positive non-linear associations between each of the DMQ subscales and alcohol use severity were observed. Inverted U-shaped non-linear associations were found between age and coping and to a lesser extent with conformity, and negative, near-linear associations between age, and social and enhancement motives. The associations between motives and alcohol use severity followed non-linear age-sensitive trajectories: across age, coping and enhancement motives consistently predicted alcohol use severity, while social and conformity motives were predictive only in younger individuals. Our findings highlight the potential of a non-linear approach, showing that coping and enhancement motives are most consistently linked to alcohol use severity, their predictive value remains stable across the lifespan, despite an overall decrease in motive endorsement.",

We tested for non-invariance across countries and person characteristics (age, gender) using spike-and-slab priors. Critically, we simultaneously modeled measurement non-invariance and impact on the full latent structure, including factor correlations—a first for multidimensional (6-factor) models.\nResults. The six-factor structure was largely invariant across groups. Age moderated item intercepts (5/12 items), residual variances (6/12 items), and factor correlations. At least one dummy-coded respondent country identifier moderated at least one parameter for each item. Factor correlations were also moderated. \nConclusion. Results support partial invariance of the SFI and demonstrate how moderated factor analysis can reveal measurement heterogeneity unavailable from traditional approaches.",

          "abstract": "Humans can accurately categorize objects in dynamic scenes by relying on both static and dynamic cues. Inversion hinders recognition of static faces, static bodies, and dynamic body movements, but it remains unclear whether this eﬀect generalizes to other categories, particularly when only dynamic cues are available. Motion cues from videos of four animate and four inanimate object categories were converted into object kinematograms and presented upright or inverted in an online experiment. For each video, participants were asked to: 1) determine if the item in the video was an animal or not, 2) determine its basic-level category, and 3) name it. We also provided an “I don’t know” option for all three questions. Overall, the likelihood of choosing the “I don’t know” response was higher for inverted than upright stimuli across all three questions. After removing the “I don’t know” responses, the animate category showed a significant inversion eﬀect, while the inversion eﬀect for the inanimate category was not significant. For the second question, we found the inversion eﬀect to be variable across categories. While most animate categories (mammal, human, bird) showed significant inversion eﬀects, for reptiles we failed to find an inversion eﬀect. Surprisingly, some inanimate categories (vehicle, ball, pendulum) also showed a significant inversion eﬀect. These diﬀerences might be related to variability in typical object orientation or motion pattern symmetry across categories. These results showcase the orientation-dependence of object categorization based on dynamic cues and inform future models of object recognition that apply better to dynamic environments.",

In Studies 1 (N=667) and 2 (N=432), field surveys of people with leadership responsibility, revealed that leader identity predicted more strongly leaders’ motivation to build their personal identity around themselves as a leader than their motivation to engage in identity leadership (building a social identity around team members). Conversely, team identity more strongly predicted motivation to engage in identity leadership than motivation to build a personal identity as a leader. Team identity also predicted greater, whereas leader identity predicted less, team member-oriented organisational citizenship behaviour and resource-sharing with team members. Study 3 (N=60 leaders; 120 team members), a laboratory experiment with student groups, replicated these findings and examined resource-sharing behaviour in interacting teams. Studies 2 and 3 also examined brief self-reflection as a leadership development tool. Self-reflection on leader distinctiveness strengthened leader identity among new-group leaders, while reflection on team distinctiveness strengthened team identity among established-group leaders.

          "abstract": "The attentional boost effect (ABE) occurs when target detection in a primary task stream enhances memory for coincident but task-irrelevant information. However, it remains unclear whether this “boost” represents a true enhancement of memory fidelity or simply a biased recognition response. To address this, we developed a novel category-selective ABE paradigm that enables us to dissociate memory sensitivity from response bias. In Phase 1, participants categorized unique images from three semantically distinct object categories. In Phase 2, participants performed an auditory target detection task for infrequent oddball tones while object images were incidentally presented. Critically, the oddball tones were selectively paired with images belonging to only one of the object categories (“Target”). While we replicated the classic ABE finding of enhanced hit rate for Target versus Nontarget images, follow-up analyses using Signal Detection Theory metrics attributed this effect to a liberal shift in response bias rather than improved memory sensitivity. This suggests that the “boost” reflects an enhancement of category-level gist features rather than item-specific perceptual details. Trial-level analyses of pupillometry data at encoding revealed that pupil dilation predicted poorer item recognition, consistent with arousal’s suppression of peripheral information. However, this effect was attenuated in the presence of oddball tones, raising the possibility that the attentional boost acts through a disinhibitory mechanism that rescues de-prioritized information from suppression. Together, these findings provide a new perspective on ABE, revealing it may be a “fuzzy” memory effect that preferentially enhances the gist-level meaning of peripheral information.",

          "abstract": "Scientific consensus messaging is among the most widely studied and cited approaches in climate change communication. Research consistently shows that scientific consensus messages (“97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is happening”) reduce misperceptions and enable climate change attitudes that reflect the scientific evidence. A concern, however, is that the effects of this and similar consensus messages may reflect memory and experimenter demand effects rather than genuine misperception correction. In this brief empirical note, we outline several theoretical arguments and reanalyze two large-scale secondary datasets from the United States (n = 6,301; van der Linden et al., 2019) and 27 countries (n = 7,000; Većkalov, Geiger et al., 2024), providing evidence that misperception correction following scientific consensus messages is unlikely to be driven by memory and experimenter demand effects alone. First, we show that consensus messaging reduces misperceptions compared to a control condition, even in the highly unlikely scenario that every post-test response at or near 97% reflects memory or experimenter demand effects. Second, we demonstrate that participants report being more persuaded by the scientific consensus message and update their personal beliefs slightly more when they indicate consensus estimates of 97% (vs. a different number) in the post-test. If the ‘97%’ responses were primarily driven by memory effects, we would expect the opposite pattern. Overall, scientific consensus messaging recalibrates scientific consensus perceptions and important attitudes, regardless of whether individuals report exactly 97% at post-test–reinforcing the importance of perceived scientific consensus as a ‘gateway’ belief to evidence-based climate change attitudes.",

Building on an unexpected finding of stronger White–rich/Black–poor stereotyping among third-group individuals (e.g., Latine and Asian Americans) relative to Black and White Americans, we hypothesized that biased social sampling from network homophily might produce this stereotype. Supporting this possibility, we observed that (a) contact with Black people explained racial group differences in stereotyping and, crucially, (b) exposing participants to counterstereotypic (Black–rich and White–poor) exemplars decreased the degree of stereotyping across a number of procedural variations and to similar degrees across racial groups.

          "abstract": "Understanding conditional inferences is fundamental to human reasoning, allowing us to evaluate possibilities and predict outcomes. For instance, the conditional, “If you eat your broccoli, you’ll get a candy” can be interpreted literally, meaning eating broccoli is one way to get a candy, or pragmatically, implying it is the only way. Past studies find school-aged children (ages 7-12) struggle to arrive at literal meanings but, interestingly, compute adult-like, pragmatic interpretations at this age. An important limitation of past research is the lack of testing in contexts that support literal meanings. We conducted two studies to examine whether children can derive literal interpretations when supported by context. We found that preschoolers as young as 4 years old are adult-like in computing literal meanings when they are able to judge that the antecedent is not the only way to bring about the consequent, either because discourse introduces salient alternatives (Exp 1) or because the stated antecedent is not causally related to the consequent (Exp 2). These findings suggest that preschoolers have the logical ability and processing resources required to make conditional inferences when provided with contextual support.",

          "authors": "Michael Stewart Cohen; Mehak Sachdeva; Zening Duan",
          "abstract": "The 2016 U.S. Presidential election heralded the beginning of a political realignment in American politics. A key question for understanding this realignment is whether the Republican party’s shift towards right-wing populism was driven by Donald Trump’s candidacy, versus Trump’s political success being driven by dynamics in the electorate that predated his political rise. To address this question, we examined a corpus of Twitter posts written between July 2009 and February 2015, aggregated by U.S. county. The geographic distribution of psychological traits (personality, empathy, and moral foundations) was estimated by applying to the aggregated Twitter data lexica quantifying how strongly individual words predict psychological traits. The aggregate personality measures were then used to predict Donald Trump’s vote share in 2016, 2020, and 2024, as compared to Mitt Romney’s 2012 vote share, while controlling statistically for the 2000-2008 Republican vote share. Low agreeableness predicts support for Trump but not Romney, a novel result relative to other geographically aggregated data but consistent with prior survey findings relating this trait to right-wing populism. Low empathic concern also predicts vote share for Trump but not Romney. Finally, the degree to which tweets tend to reference unfairness and defilement exclusively predicts shifts towards Trump. Our analysis suggests that people in geographic regions that shifted rightward beginning in 2016 were already expressing emotions consistent with Donald Trump’s messaging in their social media postings before his political rise. Our analysis also provides novel evidence for the high value of aggregated social media data in elucidating voter psychology.",

Computational accounts emphasize aberrant precision-weighting of sensory evidence and prior expectations, but most empirical work has used simplified laboratory stimuli. It remains unclear whether these mechanistic accounts generalize to more naturalistic perceptual contexts. \n\nMethods\nWe developed virtual reality (VR) tasks simulating VDs in photorealistic scenes and explored associations between VD perception and psychosis-relevant traits in a non-clinical sample. 120 healthy adults completed three tasks designed to probe complementary aspects of perceptual inference: (1) a naïve detection task (NDT) assessing expectation-driven false percepts of unspecified visual changes; (2) a perceptual uncertainty task (PUT) testing how detection under ambiguous sensory evidence is shaped by recent trial history; and (3) an adaptive two-interval forced-choice task (2-IFC) quantifying bottom-up sensitivity to psychosis-like VDs. Psychosis-relevant traits were assessed using validated questionnaires of delusional ideation, anomalous perceptual experiences, and schizotypal traits. \n\nResults\nHigher levels of delusional ideation and schizotypy were associated with stronger expectation effects, reflected in increased false percepts in the NDT trial without changes and enhanced detection of near-threshold distortions when these trials followed distortion-present trials in the PUT. These traits were also linked to reduced 2-IFC perceptual sensitivity to VDs, particularly brightness changes.\n\nConclusions\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of VR-based VD assessment and provide initial evidence that individual differences in VD perception relate to psychosis-relevant traits. Results suggest contributions from both diminished sensory sensitivity and increased reliance on expectations in naturalistic perceptual contexts.",

The results show strong evidence of severe publication bias and extreme between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias-adjusted analyses reveal model-averaged effects approximately one-third the magnitude of unadjusted estimates (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.196, 95% credible interval from 0.000 to 0.323), along with wide prediction intervals spanning both large negative and positive effects (−1.521 to 1.908).

          "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to develop an RDoC-aligned precision psychiatry framework and multi-modal model for the implementation of precision psychiatry; by combining findings and theories from the fields of neurobiology, genetics, and psychology. Modern research has greatly advanced our knowledge of how disruptions in brain networks involve emotion, cognition, and behavior regulation in underlying mental disorders. However, research in these fields have yet to form a standardized framework for psychiatric disorders, limiting their effective application in clinical practice. Therefore, the secondary goal is to explain how interventions from these fields can support a more precise diagnosis and treatment planning framework, as well as identify the biological and neural pathways implicated in stress-related disorders. The integration of these methods allows for the identification of psychological profiles associated with differential responsiveness to interventions, such as psychotherapy and pharmacology. This responsiveness can be influenced by epigenetic regulation through molecular pathways associated with stress-related biological dysfunctions, learning, and neural plasticity. We also address common ethical, clinical, and implementation concerns surrounding precision psychiatry, including risks of stigmatization, limited generalizability, and discuss ways to reduce barriers to real-world clinical adoption. By combining epigenetic, neural circuit, and behavioral measures, this approach provides a framework for understanding how early life adversity, attachment, and individual differences interact to shape treatment response, offering a pathway toward more individualized and effective care.",

In the current study, we examined the impact of acoustic challenge (via speech-shaped background noise) on three language-related event-related brain potentials (ERPs): the N400 (linked to semantic retrieval), the P600 (linked to syntactic integration) and a late frontal response (linked to predictive processing).\n\nMethod: Young normal-hearing adults (N = 48) listened in quiet and in noise to contextually constraining sentences that ended in an expected word, an unexpected word, or a morphosyntactic violation of the expected word while EEG data were collected.\n\nResults: Replicating prior work, we showed that an N400 expectancy effect was both reduced in amplitude and delayed in onset latency in noise. We found that a P600 syntax effect was reduced in amplitude by the presence of background noise. We additionally observed that the P600 response was only present for trials in which the listener successfully identified syntactic violations (irrespective of noise). In contrast to the reductions in the N400 and P600, the late frontal response was not reduced in noise.\n\nConclusions: Collectively, this suggests that while semantic retrieval and syntactic integration may be impaired by acoustic challenge, listeners may still prioritize neural resources towards prediction-related processes to help compensate for increased perceptual demands.",

Yet we know little about the traits and situational factors that facilitate category learning and how those differ in older age. Here, we test the relationship between categorization performance and individual differences in a variety of cognitive abilities and aspects of state of mind and how those relationships differ in older age.\nMethod: Seventy-six young adults (18-29 years old) and 73 older adults (60-83 years old) underwent a cognitive assessment testing processing speed, working memory, verbal comprehension, and perceptual reasoning. Two experimental sessions followed where participants completed a categorization task and state of mind questionnaires assessing stress, motivation, mood, and sleep.  \nResults: Verbal comprehension and processing speed were significant positive predictors of categorization performance. This effect was not moderated by age groups. None of the state of mind variables was a significant predictor of categorization performance, and there were no significant age moderation effects on state of mind. \nDiscussion: We show that baseline cognitive abilities had stronger influence on category learning than state of mind variables regardless of age. Thus, interventions aimed at supporting learning new concepts in later life may be more effective to strengthen stable traits rather than attempt to directly manipulate transient states of mind.",

          "abstract": "Background: The Pavlovian go/no-go task is commonly used to measure individual differences in Pavlovian biases and their interaction with instrumental learning. However, prior research has found suboptimal reliability for computational model-based performance measures for this task, limiting its usefulness in individual-differences research. These studies did not make use of several strategies previously shown to enhance task-measure reliability (e.g., task gamification, hierarchical Bayesian modeling for model estimation). Here we investigated if such approaches could improve the task’s reliability. Methods: Across two experiments, we recruited two independent samples of adult participants (N=103, N=110) to complete a novel, gamified version of the Pavlovian go/no-go task multiple times over several weeks. We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to derive reinforcement learning model-based indices of participants' task performance, and additionally to estimate the reliability of these measures. Results: In Experiment 1, we observed considerable and unexpected practice effects, with most participants reaching near-ceiling levels of performance with repeat testing. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of some model parameters was unacceptable (range: 0.379–0.973). In Experiment 2, participants completed a modified version of the task designed to lessen these practice effects. We observed greatly reduced practice effects and improved estimates of the test-retest reliability (range: 0.696–0.989). Conclusion: The results demonstrate that model-based measures of performance on the Pavlovian go/no-go task can reach levels of reliability sufficient for use in individual- differences research. However, additional investigation is necessary to validate the modified version of the task in other populations and settings.",

A narrative synthesis of the selected studies was performed.\n\nResults: Four studies met the inclusion criteria: three randomized controlled trials and one nonrandomized quasi-experimental study. Interventions included self-reflection, feedback, education, and direct or indirect contact, targeting conditions such as cleft lip and palate, psoriasis, facial paralysis, and facial disfigurement. Education-only interventions showed limited impact, whereas education combined with direct or narrative-based contact produced significant improvements in attitudes. Indirect contact through online narratives also demonstrated promising effects, suggesting scalable, media-delivered approaches can reduce bias.\n\nConclusion: Findings highlight the limited effectiveness of education alone and the greater potential of contact-based strategies. These insights can inform the development of educational tools for healthcare, educational, and workplace contexts, supporting professionals who regularly interact with individuals with visible differences. Over time, such approaches could be integrated into wider disability awareness campaigns aimed at reducing stigma in the general population. Future research should assess the durability of these interventions and their impact on real-world behavior.

A pre-registered multiverse analysis (54,600 model specifications; 100 model families; 6 demographic groupings; 6 outcome measures) showed only one robust pattern of negative societal outcomes: larger cultural distance between geographic regions is associated with higher corruption, weaker democracy, lower social mobility, and greater risk of civil conflict. Distances between ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic groups were mostly benign, and educational distance was often associated with better outcomes. The results imply that what matters is not diversity per se, but whether culturally distinct groups are geographically segregated and therefore less likely to regularly interact to negotiate the cultural traits needed for cooperation and coordination.",

To address these limitations, we developed and validated the Word-Pseudoword Associative Learning (WPAL) task, a fully self-administered, web-based paradigm designed to provide a controlled and replicable assessment of declarative associative learning in Italian populations. Two parallel 40-item forms were constructed through a rigorous multistep procedure balancing real nouns and pseudowords across lexical, affective, and neighborhood metrics. \nNinety healthy adults completed the two parallel task forms one week apart in a counterbalanced within-subject design, with a 12-hour retention interval including either nocturnal sleep (SLEEP group, n = 52) or daytime wakefulness (WAKE group, n = 38). Psychometric properties, item characteristics, parallel-forms reliability, and sensitivity to time- and sleep-dependent changes in memory were evaluated.\nConvergent evidence supported statistical interchangeability between parallel forms. Learning trajectories and immediate recall performance were virtually identical across forms, and internal consistency was excellent for both versions. As expected, recall declined over the 12-hour interval in the overall sample. However, the reduction was significantly attenuated in the SLEEP compared with the WAKE group, demonstrating robust task sensitivity to time- and sleep-dependent memory stabilization.\nOverall, the WPAL offers a psychometrically validated, remotely deployable, open-access tool for assessing verbal associative memory in Italian adults. Its standardized construction, parallel-form equivalence, and demonstrated sensitivity to consolidation processes make it suitable for reliable and replicable within-subjects investigations in real-world settings.",

Drawing on allostatic load theory and systems neuroscience, I argue that this concept can be extended from individuals to political and institutional systems in a way that provides a mechanistic vocabulary for how structural stress destabilises population mental health. Using Iran as a case study, I outline how recurrent political crises, environmental degradation, prolonged sanctions, and scientific isolation interact to produce a state of national allostatic load (NAL). In this state, regulatory hubs weaken, defensive responses become chronically hyperactivated, and evidence-based functions including mental health research and care are progressively eroded. I propose model-based predictions linking features of NAL to rising psychiatric morbidity, service fragmentation and clinician burnout in Iran and arguably in other structurally stressed settings.",

Across two experiments, we examined the balance of proactive and reactive control in the AX-CPT under several negative affect and punishment manipulations. In Experiment 1, we compared cognitive control performance between two task phases: an Affect phase, in which emotionally evocative images were used to induce either Fear, Anger, or Neutral affect, and a Punishment phase, in which the threat of receiving mild electric shocks was either performance-contingent, or unavoidable. In Experiment 2, we examined cognitive control under punishment that was both unavoidable and uncertain, and whether effects of such punishment varied by individual differences in trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Across both experiments, we observed that threat of punishment was associated with increased proactive control, and that this effect was heightened when punishment was performance-contingent. In contrast, punishment uncertainty did not appear to modulate cognitive control outcomes at the group level. However, exploratory analyses suggested that punishment uncertainty might interact with individual variability in trait anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and threat-related physiological arousal responses to shape control outcomes. Together, our findings support an account in which the presence of a motivator, regardless of valence, facilitates increased proactive control. In contrast, the relationship between negative affect and cognitive control outcomes may be more complex, and vary both with contextual factors and individual differences.",

          "authors": "Melanie Bamert; Carole Lynn Rüttimann; Dario Baretta; Jennifer Inauen",
          "abstract": "Objective: Stress and affect are considered central to unhealthy snacking and dietary lapses, yet little is known about their temporal dynamics around such unhealthy eating events in daily life. We aimed to characterize the temporal trajectories of perceived stress, affect, and vagally mediat-ed heart rate variability (vmHRV; measure of cardiac vagal activity) surrounding eating events in daily life. \nMethods: We conducted two intensive longitudinal studies with healthy university students (Study 1: N = 67, days = 4, eating events analyzed = 139) and adults with a history of obesity actively engaged in weight loss maintenance (Study 2: N = 76, days = 6, eating events analyzed = 637). We used mixed-effects models to capture trends in stress and affect in the hours before and after the eating events. We additionally examined interindividual and contextual moderators.\nResults: Perceived stress did not show significant trajectories surrounding eating events. Be-fore unhealthy eating events, positive affect increased (Study 1), with curvilinear patterns indi-cating a reversal close to the event (Study 2). vmHRV decreased prior to unhealthy snacking (Study 1). After dietary lapses, negative affect decreased, and positive affect declined after eating events (Study 2). vmHRV decreased after unhealthy snacking (Study 1) or showed curvilinear patterns (Study 2). Trajectories were moderated by emotional eating style, unhealthy snacking habits, and social support.\nConclusions: These descriptive findings improve our understanding of stress- and affect-related trajectories surrounding eating events. The moderation results suggest that vulnerability to and recovery from unhealthy eating events is characterized by person-specific and context-dependent changes.",

          "abstract": "Conceptualized as distinct psychological functionings respectively linked to authentic-durable and fluctuating happiness, selflessness and self-centeredness have recently been the subject of an instrument development to evaluate their manifestations at the trait level. Along the lines of this work, the goal of the current research was to adapt the psychometric instrument at the state level: the Selflessness/Self-centeredness Inventory – State (SSI-S). Consistent with the trait version, both exploratory analysis (Study 1, N = 853) and confirmatory analysis (Study 2, N = 265) indicated that the SSI-S measured seven factors organized into two latent variables (i.e. selflessness divided into four components, self-centeredness divided into three dimensions). Study of validity and correlational analysis (Study 3, N = 1409) indicated that selflessness and self-centeredness were two distinct constructs, differently associated with mental health, interpersonal health, and pro-environmental outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment (CM) increases the risk of psychopathology. Besides CM types and severity, the timing of exposure is an important modulating factor in this association, as childhood and adolescence comprise sensitive developmental periods for brain maturation and socio-emotional development. Nevertheless, previously reported associations between the severity of subtypes and timing of CM and psychopathology have been heterogeneous and have hardly considered vulnerable groups broadly exposed to CM, such as out-of-home-placed youth. Thus, we investigated the association between CM types and timing and psychopathology in a sample of formerly out-of-home placed young adults (N = 185; 32% women, age mean = 26.38, SD = 3.49 years). CM was assessed using the Maltreatment of Abuse Chronology of Exposure Scale and general, internalizing and, externalizing problems were assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. We employed conditional random forest regression to estimate the importance of CM types (abuse, neglect, peer victimization, and sexual abuse), timings (ages 3–18) as well as CM severity, multiplicity, and duration on adult general, internalizing, and externalizing problems. We validated the results using diagnoses of mental disorders assessed in clinical interviews, which were classified under general, internalizing, and externalizing clusters based on the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology model. We found that CM severity and multiplicity were stronger predictors of internalizing problems than timing-specific effects of CM types. Abuse in early childhood and peer violence in late adolescence were stronger predictors of externalizing problems compared to global CM measures. Our findings highlight the importance of considering CM type and timing when testing CM-associated risks for psychopathology. This might further be valuable in therapeutic settings to guide maltreatment-informed interventions. Reducing violent caregiving environments in early childhood and preventing peer victimization in adolescence may be especially important in counteracting CM-associated risks of externalizing behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Despite vast racial disparities in economic outcomes, White Americans tend to overestimate their economic parity with Black Americans (e.g., Kraus et al., 2019). White Americans also tend to be less likely to hold an understanding of racism that is rooted in structural processes, relative to individual-level biases (e.g., Rucker &amp; Richeson, 2021b). Across three studies (N = 2124 participants), the present research explored whether White Americans’ misperceptions of racial economic inequality are explained, in part, by a general lack of exposure to information about structural racism. In Study 1, we measured the extent to which participants conceptualized racism in terms of structural factors. In Studies 2 and 3, we experimentally manipulated exposure to information about structural racism. Specifically, participants listened to an audio clip discussing structural roots of racial discrimination, a comparable audio clip on implicit racial bias, or no clip at all. In both studies, participants made estimates of Black-White economic inequality in income and wealth, then indicated their support for reparative public policies (e.g., affirmative action in hiring). Across studies, holding a structural understanding of racism, whether measured or manipulated, was associated with holding more accurate estimates of contemporary Black-White economic inequality (Studies 1 and 2) and greater support for racial equity-enhancing policies (Studies 1-3).",

          "abstract": "Questions of blame and punishment hinge on judgments of victimhood: who is a victim and who is a victimizer? The law presumes that we judge victimhood objectively, but science shows that victimhood relies more on biased perceptions than impartial facts. The disconnect between victimhood in the law versus victimhood in our minds undermines the quest for justice. In this review, we outline three psychological principles of victimhood and the trouble they cause in the judicial system, before proposing solutions to correct biases in victim perception. Principle One: Victimhood is subjective—legal judgments hinge on who seems like a victim. Principle Two: Victimhood is stereotypical—who seems like a victim is biased, people easily accept the victimization of the vulnerable (e.g., child abuse) but not the more powerful (e.g., spousal abuse towards men). Principle Three: Victimhood is sticky—once we identify the victim (or victimizer) in a situation, it is hard to change our minds. Failing to appreciate these principles leads to distrust of the law, denials of true suffering, and continued condemnation of the exonerated. Potential solutions involve victim impact statements, restorative justice, and acknowledgments of legal errors. Understanding the true nature of victimhood is essential for a fair legal system.",

          "authors": "Dirk Richter; Simeon Joel Zürcher; Kristina Adorjan",
          "abstract": "In high-income countries, psychiatric treatment prevalence has been increasing for many years. In recent years, developments in autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder have received considerable attention in both health policy and research. At the same time, the epidemiological prevalence of mental disorders is not increasing, with the exception of adolescents and young adults. In this contribution, we explore how the difference between epidemiological disorder prevalence and treatment prevalence can be better understood. To this end, we first provide an overview of the different types of prevalence and their methodological backgrounds. In this regard, we propose the thesis that the disorder prevalence is only partially related to the increase in treatment prevalence. The treatment prevalence is largely determined by sociocultural factors and only secondarily by medical aspects. We then present a theoretical model that addresses the sociocultural characteristics that exist on both the supply side (service providers) and the demand side (patients, service users). In this context, we distinguish between conceptual issues, characteristics of the healthcare system, and macrosocial and microsocial characteristics.",

In this study, we reanalyzed data from a previous experiment showing that gradiency, or sensitivity to within-category variation, predicts speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish but not in L2 English. Gradiency did not predict initial lexical activation in either language. In contrast, the present analyses revealed a different pattern for consistency: listeners with higher consistency exhibited higher initial lexical activation for acoustically compatible patterns for both /b/ and /p/ in L1 Spanish and for /p/ in L2 English, but showed no corresponding advantage in speech perception flexibility. Taken together, these findings indicate that speech perception consistency facilitates initial lexical activation to a large extent across languages, while playing a limited role in speech perception flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Cybersickness, or sickness caused by virtual reality (VR), represents a significant threat to the usability of VR applications. Repeated exposure to the same VR stimulus causes a reduction in cybersickness, referred to as Cybersickness Abatement from Repeated Exposure (CARE). This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

          "abstract": "A big part of intervention development is testing before implementation. Bridging the gap between observational findings gained from interviews, focus groups, and correlational studies, theoretical science-focused evidence from experiments, and the gold-standard in intervention testing in large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remains a challenge in behaviour change intervention development. \nThis article introduces Proof-of-Principle RCTs (PoP-RCTs) as an intermediate step in bridging this gap. PoP-RCT are designed to test whether the intervention changes specific targeted mechanisms of action (MoAs), thus having the potential to change the behaviours targeted, before instigating larger trials. By focusing on the MoAs, PoP-RCTs offer a critical step that ensures theoretical assumptions are validated using experimental methodology, improving the overall rigor of intervention development. \nPractical case studies are included to illustrate real-world application of PoP-RCTs in health psychology. Highlighting their role in refining interventions before full-scale RCT testing, in work on recovery of activity after stroke. Following interview studies, evidence was obtained that greater perceived control predicted better and faster recovery. These studies were followed by experimental testing of interventions to enhance perceived control, in studies we now term PoP-RCTs. Having demonstrated that the interventions could change perceived control, a full trial found that they were effective in increasing activity.\nTaken together, we think PoP-RCTs are already an implicit part of intervention development. Proposing this as an explicitly labelled step between experiments and RCTs, could improve effectiveness/efficacy and increase intervention success.",

          "abstract": "Background: Early detection of colorectal cancer can save lives, yet screening uptake is suboptimal. Several determinants increase uptake, including modifiable theoretical determinants (i.e., self-efficacy), and non-modifiable determinants (i.e., past behaviour). \nPurpose: To develop theory-based public health messages and test their effects on target mechanisms of action (MoAs, self-efficacy and intentions) in an experimental Proof-of-Principle Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT).\nMethods: Messages were developed systematically linking determinants, MoAs, and behaviour change techniques and four were selected for testing. Participants were randomly allocated to receive an online message (targeting self-efficacy, emotion, automatic influences, and self-image) or no-message. Participants (N=404) were over 50 years old (M=59.85, SD=7.31), female (N=248, 61.7%), white (N=384, 95.3%). Participants reported past behaviour, negative beliefs, and the outcomes self-efficacy and intentions. \nResults: There was a 3-way interaction between past behaviour, negative beliefs, and messages on self-efficacy F(14, 370)=2.94, p&lt;.001, pη2=.100, and intentions F(14, 370)=4.29, p&lt;.001, pη2=.14. Messages did not affect prior-testers. The self-efficacy, emotion, and automatic messages increased self-efficacy amongst never-testers with negative beliefs. The self-image message reduced intentions in never-testers, F(4,384)=3.88, p&lt;.001, pη2=.004. The self-efficacy and emotion messages increased intentions for non-responders with negative beliefs. \nConclusions: The messages worked conditionally to increase self-efficacy and intentions. However, their impact varied across context, with one message even producing  detrimental effects. Thus, even theory-based interventions benefit from pre-testing effects on outcomes, before selecting which messages to implement, evaluating their impact on screening behaviour, and ultimately on colorectal cancer detection.",

          "abstract": "Transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) individuals face significant psychosocial stressors, notably discrimination and violence, which substantially increase their susceptibility to mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies link direct discrimination, victimization, and internalized stigma to heightened psychopathology, highlighting how these stressors challenge psychological needs and mimic traumatic stress effects. Resilience factors such as strong community connections and supportive family relationships are essential in mitigating these negative impacts. Additionally, gender affirmation practices are crucial for enhancing mental health outcomes. This study aims to synthesize existing literature and identify risk and protective factors linked to trauma-related psychopathology in TGNC populations. Culturally competent interventions that validate TGNC identities are imperative. Integrating Minority Stress Theory (MST) and intersectionality enriches the understanding of how societal stigma interacts with health outcomes across diverse identities. However, there is a critical gap in longitudinal research exploring the causative factors behind mental health disparities. Such research is essential for developing focused interventions that incorporate resilience-enhancing and gender-affirming strategies. Future strategies should create inclusive environments that promote acceptance and reduce stigma. Beyond clinical interventions, systematic measures such as inclusive policy-making, educational reforms, and enhanced access to gender-affirming healthcare are necessary to comprehensively support the mental health of TGNC individuals. These measures aim to dismantle systemic barriers and foster a societal shift towards greater acceptance and understanding, providing the essential support needed for the well-being of TGNC communities.",

          "abstract": "Armed conflicts are associated with profound and long-lasting mental health consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has been linked to alterations in neural processing in both affective and non-affective domains. While numerous studies have documented such alterations shortly after traumatic events, far less is known about their long-term persistence, their intergenerational transmission, and potential differences between victims and perpetrators of mass violence. Addressing these gaps, the present pre-registered study examined neural and psychological correlates of trauma among civilian survivors and civilian former perpetrators of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda, as well as one of their offspring. Participants completed questionnaires assessing traumatic exposure and PTSD symptomatology, alongside four electrophysiological tasks targeting affective (threat processing, emotion recognition) and non-affective (sensory gating, auditory oddball) processes. Thirty years after the genocide, survivors exhibited higher PTSD symptom severity than former perpetrators, particularly for re-experiencing, hyperarousal, and avoidance. In affective tasks, survivors showed enhanced neural responses to threat and emotional stimuli, with some alterations persisting into the next generation. These effects were less pronounced or absent in former perpetrators and their offspring. In contrast, non-affective tasks revealed robust sensory and oddball effects but no consistent associations with PTSD in either group. Overall, the findings suggest that long-term neural alterations following genocide are more prominent in affective processing and are especially evident among survivors, the primary targets of the violence. The study further highlights selective intergenerational transmission of trauma-related symptomatology and demonstrates the feasibility of conducting electrophysiological research in post-conflict, non-Western contexts.",

It is unclear, however, how internal working models influence actual peer encounters in real-time. In this preregistered study, N = 133 adolescents and young adults (n = 65 maltreated; 11–24 years) from a longitudinal cohort played Cyberball ostensibly with two peers, both introduced before the game via descriptive statements: The Target peer was constructed to implicitly resemble participant’s one of the parents, and the Control peer resembled someone else’s parent. We recorded event-related cardiac slowing during my-turn (micro-inclusion) and not-my-turn (micro-exclusion) events. We observed differential cardiac responses to the two peers, which further varied by maltreatment status and age. During micro-exclusion, nonmaltreated participants showed greater cardiac slowing to Target, whereas maltreated participants showed greater cardiac slowing to Control, suggesting that participants selectively generalized their expectations. Cardiac slowing to Target was most pronounced in younger participants and diminished with age, suggesting that parental cues exert a stronger influence on peer interactions at younger ages. Together, our findings suggest that cardiac slowing can index rapid processing of representation-based expectations during social interactions and may thus constitute a mechanism by which internal models impact social functioning.",

          "authors": "Jet Lageman; Johannes Jacobus Fahrenfort; Heleen A Slagter",
          "abstract": "Active inference has emerged as an influential theoretical framework in cognitive neuroscience, offering a unifying account of perception, action, and cognition under the single principle of sensory prediction error minimization. Yet, despite its growing prominence, the framework is often criticized for the difficulty of extracting qualitatively distinct, falsifiable predictions and its lack of clear empirical grounding. This review addresses these concerns by systematically outlining and evaluating key predictions of active inference across four domains that span the action-perception cycle: action planning, decision-making, motor control, and sensorimotor adaptation. For each domain, we contrast active inference with leading alternative accounts, including optimal (feedback) control theories, utility-based theories, reinforcement learning, equilibrium point hypothesis, and motor command theories. We show that active inference uniquely predicts reliance of goal-directed action on optimistically biased prior beliefs, maximization of information gain when options have equal utility, scaling of random exploration with the precision of policy beliefs, context sensitive encoding of sensory predictions in motor cortex, early and non specific sensory attenuation necessary for movement initiation, and precision weighted scaling of motor output. Overall, we find that while existing work is broadly consistent with some of these predictions, empirical support overall remains fragmentary, as most studies were not designed to distinguish between active inference and competing theories. We highlight key areas where findings are promising, while emphasizing the need for theory-driven experiments that can adjudicate between accounts. In this way, active inference can move beyond a formal mathematical framework toward an empirically grounded theory of brain function.",

(2020)’s approach to determine error rates for human-only, human-AI, and AI-only screening at both the title-abstract and full-text stages. This analysis used data from collaborative projects focused on SRMA screening, including Synergy, IMPROVE, FORAS, and MetaPsy. Our overall weighted error rate was 3.51% (95% CI 0.42%-6.60%), likely influenced by lower error rates at the full-text level (0.15%, 95% CI 0.00%-2.61%) and for AI-assisted methods (1.13%, 95% CI 0.00%-9.38%). False exclusions, which can significantly affect SRMA outcomes, had the highest error rate at 10.89% (95% CI 4.43%-17.35%). Because gold standards are not perfect, they may include even more false exclusions due to incomplete assessment at the full-text level. AI techniques such as the noisy label filter (NLF) and large language models (LLMs) are well suited to identifying these false exclusions and reducing human workload. Furthermore, we propose a screening error origin model (SEOM) with potential error threats (PETs), highlighting the importance of clearer communication between human and AI agents, for instance, regarding label uncertainty. Future research could focus on specific PETs to minimize their impact and thereby decrease overall error rates.",

          "abstract": "Humans have idiosyncratic and stable eye-scanning tendencies when exploring visual scenes. For instance, some people are more drawn to semantic objects while others are more drawn to emotional content. These individual variations are usually considered as a \"noise ceiling\" for fixation predictability. To break this ceiling, we need to better understand what causes these differences, and whether similar viewing tendencies are also reflected in similar cognitive profiles in observers. To this end, we tracked eye movements during an image-choice task in which subjects selected images varying in arousal. We then conducted first-person interviews (micro-phenomenological and cognitive analysis) to understand their decision process and identify individual cognitive strategies. We provide a proof-of-concept bridge between first-person elicitation and eye-tracking, demonstrating that structured experiential profiles align with objective oculomotor indices. Quantitative variables were derived from qualitative first-person interview verbatim, and then analyzed by   Principal Component Analysis. We identified gaze parameters stable across trials and correlated them with the first three Principal Components. For instance, the gaze of participants who were more emotionally engaged was more driven by bottom-up visual saliency, and was more scattered across their preferred image. Our method uses the idiosyncrasy of gaze patterns as a structured signal reflecting personal decision process. We argue that observer-level factors derived from cognitive interviews can be integrated with image features to create individualized models of attention.",

          "abstract": "Background: There is a paucity of valid instruments to assess behaviours directly related with greenhouse gas reduction. In this study, the Climate Mitigation Behaviour Scale (CLIMBS) was developed, adapted from the General Ecological Behaviour framework to capture everyday climate-relevant behaviours across key domains.\n\nMethods: An initial 30-item pool including mobility, food, consumption, and engagement themes was refined through expert review and administered to adults participating in an intervention study in Sweden (N = 694). Items used five-point response formats aligned to behavioural frequency. Dimensionality was tested using bifactor item factor analysis (graded response model). Reliability was evaluated via ordinal α and McDonald’s ω. Associations with related constructs, including sustainability interest, knowledge, lifestyle, climate importance, and worry, assessed external validity.\n\nResults: A bifactor model with one general factor and four orthogonal domains showed the best fit (RMSEA = .045, CFI = .92, TLI = .91). After removing seven weak items, the final 23-item scale showed a strong general dimension (ω_total = .83, Ω_H = .69). Subscale reliability was acceptable (α = .68–.85). The general factor showed moderate to strong associations with related constructs (r = .39–.55, all p &lt; .001), with negligible age and gender effects. A reduction of the full scale resulted into an 8-item short form (CLIMBS-8), which correlated highly with the general factor (r = .91). \n\nConclusions: CLIMBS is a psychometrically supported measure of climate change mitigation behaviour with a dominant general factor and interpretable domains. The CLIMBS-8 provides a brief alternative with minimal loss of information.",

          "abstract": "Measuring how well an individual can imagine performing movements is of considerable interest to researchers, clinicians, and practitioners. However, quantifying movement imagery ability is a remarkable challenge due to its covert and multidimensional nature. While self-report questionnaires and measurements of neural activity have been proposed as tools to quantify movement imagery ability, these approaches face significant limitations. In the present manuscript, we propose that objective behavioral measurements (i.e., specific tasks) provide a promising avenue for the assessment of movement imagery ability. To this aim, we have developed an online platform (https://movementimageryability.github.io/) for the archiving and sharing of free, open-source tasks to examine movement imagery ability, alongside self-report questionnaires. This tutorial introduces the first behavioral tasks included, assessing aspects of generation, maintenance, manipulation and inspection of movement imagery (i.e., Chronometric Radial Fitts’ Task, Imagined Finger Sequence Task, Hand Laterality Judgement Task, Mental Body Rotation Task, Final Position Judgement Task). Further, we provide guidelines on the use of the tasks and the platform, and on contributing to the expansion of the platform and the collection of reference norms. The platform aims to enable valid and reliable assessments of individual movement imagery abilities in a standardized, open-source, and efficient way.",

          "abstract": "This study offers an empirical investigation of selflessness conceptualized across three core dimensions (connectedness, impermanence, and disidentification) within the framework of the SelfCenteredness/Selflessness Happiness Model (SSHM; Dambrun &amp; Ricard, 2011). We examined whether these dimension predicts non-attachment, which in turn predicts authentic happiness, and explored alternative sequencing among the components. A sample of 214 regular meditation practitioners completed validated self-report measures, and five structural equation models were tested. Two models met acceptable fit criteria and were retained for interpretation. Across retained models, all three selflessness dimensions were associated with non-attachment, which consistently emerged as a strong proximal predictor of authentic happiness. Model comparisons further indicated that positioning disidentification as an intermediary process linking impermanence (and to a lesser extent connectedness) to non-attachment provided the most coherent representation of the data. An alternative configuration also supported an indirect pathway from disidentification to authentic happiness through impermanence and non-attachment, whereas the corresponding pathway through connectedness did not reach statistical significance. Taken together, these findings support the SSHM and suggest that selflessness-related dimensions may be hierarchically organized, with disidentification operating as a key process linking self-related insights to non-attachment and well-being. These results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying authentic happiness and have implications for meditationbased and therapeutic approaches targeting selflessness",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal social touch is a powerful form of communication whose meaning depends on the relationship between partners. This becomes especially salient in adolescence, where gender plays a central role in shaping the physical, neuropsychological, and social factors underlying touch preferences. Here we explore how gendered touch preferences within friendships evolve from adolescence to adulthood. Using the HandsOn mobile App, 59 adolescents (from 10 to 18 years of age, Mage = 14.1) and 54 adults (Mage = 29.5) created heatmaps on full-body avatars to indicate body zones they found soothing or unpleasant to be touched by a female or male friend. Touch to intimate versus social body zones was more unpleasant for female vs male participants, and for adolescents vs adults. Gendered intergroup differences emerged during adolescence, with girls reporting a specific aversion to touch from male friends. Our App provides a safe environment for adolescents to reflect on physical aspects of their socio-affective identity that are often treated as taboo. We highlight the need to further examine the intra-personal, inter-personal and inter-group factors shaping adolescents’ touch norms and behaviours. Such insights can guide educational practices and interventions aimed at fostering socio-emotional learning and well-being of individuals and inclusive communities.",

          "abstract": "Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), a laboratory representation of risky foraging, serves as mainstay of pre-clinical anxiety disorder research, motivated by an impact of anxiolytic drugs on cautious behaviour. While cautiousness appears to be a stable behavioural trait, growing evidence suggests that it is not strongly related to self-reported anxiety. Here, we ask more broadly which psychiatric symptom dimensions relate to AAC behaviour, using a cross-sectional, data-driven, exploration-confirmation approach across two large online samples (N1 = 315; N2 = 690). In a previously validated task, participants chose whether, and when, to approach rewards under varying threat probability and magnitude. They then completed a comprehensive psychiatric questionnaire battery with a known three-factor structure. A broad psychopathology factor, mainly related to impulsivity and OCD symptoms and not specifically linked with anxiety, showed the strongest relation to all behavioural readouts. Higher symptom scores related to decreased passive avoidance, increased behavioural inhibition, and reduced sensitivity to threat features. This factor was also associated with an altered subjective model of threat and reward relations in the environment. Broad and unspecific associations with same directional patterns but smaller magnitudes were found between individual questionnaire scores and behaviour, underscoring the status of transdiagnostic dimensions. Crucially, no associations were found between behaviour and transdiagnostic anxiety-depression, or with gender. This study highlights that cautiousness in AAC tasks is comprised of two components, which are independently associated with transdiagnostic psychopathology but not specifically or particularly strongly with self-reported trait anxiety. Our cross-sectional findings underline the complex interplay of behavioural predispositions and psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Understanding mental health as a complex system has motivated the adoption of time-varying network models to explore how the dynamics of psychological variables change over time. While existing time-varying network models assume gradual change, shifts in symptom dynamics such as transitions between healthy and disordered states may occur rapidly. This could manifest as abrupt, qualitative changes between distinct states, often labelled as regime switches. In this scoping review, we identified and synthesized statistical approaches for modeling such phase transitions in the behavioral sciences that could be applied to network models. Our review yielded 40 studies across different fields, featuring 56 statistical analyses in total. Most analyses (71.4%) were based on Hidden Markov Models, which can be extended flexibly to model unobserved, recurrent states in various scenarios. Other approaches included change point models (14.3%), which identify shifts directly in the observed time series, and threshold models (12.5%), which model regime switches triggered when a dedicated threshold variable is crossed. We describe these approaches, their applications, and their data requirements, and assess their strengths and limitations for modeling shifts in the dynamics of time series. Notably, several approaches already include multilevel or multivariate-extensions, making them promising candidates for modelling changes in network dynamics in mental health. In sum, our review highlights the broad potential of regime-switching models to enrich the understanding of dynamics of mental health processes.",

However, the use of life satisfaction data relies on strong assumptions, including 1) linear scale use, 2) interpersonal comparability, and 3) intertemporal comparability. Each of these depend on the shape of the reporting function: the process by which individuals convert latent life evaluations to numerical responses on a bounded scale. To understand the properties of this reporting function, we conducted theory-informed cognitive interviews with 100 residents of the United Kingdom and explored first-person accounts of life satisfaction scale use. While our results confirm previous psychometric validations of life satisfaction scales, we also find systematic violations of all three assumptions. For example, many respondents do not use the top of the scale, major shocks appear to alter the meaning of the points on the scale, and respondents rarely describe their own scale use as linear.",

          "abstract": "Pathological health anxiety is characterized by persistent uncertainty about one’s own health state and by a dynamic oscillation between safety-seeking behaviors to reduce uncertainty and avoidance of information that trigger anxiety. Building on cognitive-behavioral models of pathological health anxiety we propose a computational model of pathological health anxiety within the Active Inference framework. In a series of simulations, we formalized and systematically tested several theoretical assumptions on core features of pathological health anxiety: a) difficulties maintaining a previously inferred health state; b) a pessimistic prior belief on one’s health state and impaired belief updating after checking and avoiding information; and c) altered assumptions and learning about the trustworthiness of internal and external information for inferring one’s health state. Across simulations, we demonstrate that these mechanisms might not only explain persistent misinferences of being seriously ill, but also several further core features of pathological health anxiety: the persistence of uncertainty about one’s health state, the transient and short-term relief by reassurance, and the intra- and interindividual waxing and waning of safety-seeking and avoidance behavior. We provide testable predictions about belief and behavior dynamics. Several implications for further empirical and clinical research are derived.",

Prior research indicates that trust shapes individuals’ readiness for climate action. Accordingly, the perceived credibility of communicators, particularly their trustworthiness, is a central driver of audiences’ acceptance of information and recommendations. Guided by Source Credibility Theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, this mixed-methods study examines which communicators are perceived as trustworthy in integrated climate–health communication and whether expert recommendations align with public trust.\nThe study combined qualitative interviews and an online survey with open-ended responses from experts across various fields, followed by a quota-representative survey of the German general public (N = 1,130). Experts nominated communicators across scientific, medical, institutional, educational, and community-based sectors and made stronger distinctions between communicators for climate action and health topics. In contrast, public trust patterns were highly consistent across both domains, largely independent of the communication topic. Scientists, medical professionals, and public health institutions received the highest trust ratings, whereas the federal government and public figures were trusted the least.\nOverall, the results highlight alignments and discrepancies between those who shape communication strategies and those who receive them. Aligning communication strategies with audience perceptions of credibility and integrating trusted professional and community-based communicators may strengthen Planetary Health communication and enhance readiness for climate action.",

The model was applied to arithmetic test data from second- to sixth-grade elementary school students. Diagnosis was conducted in the second grade, and the effects of mastery on mathematics ability growth from the third to sixth grades were assessed. The results showed that attribute mastery in second grade influenced both the intercept and slope of individual ability growth, highlighting the importance of early-stage diagnosis in supporting mathematical development. Potential extensions of the proposed RDC–MGC model are also discussed.",

Though research on TPS in the treatment of cognitive disorders is present, there are currently no systematic reviews that focus solely on the use of TPS in cognitive disorders of aging. The primary objective of this literature review is to determine what cognitive disorders of aging have been studied with TPS as a treatment, and to narratively summarize what is known about the effectiveness of TPS treatment on neurocognitive performance and neuroimaging metrics. The study protocol will follow PRISMA-P guidelines and the completed review will follow PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Scopus will be searched to find peer-reviewed primary literature. Included literature will focus on the use of TPS in the treatment of at least one cognitive disorder of aging, with the relevant population defined as adults 50 years old or older. Searching and screening will be organized in Covidence and both screening and data extraction will be completed by at least two independent reviewers. Data will be synthesized narratively, with a focus on general themes and patterns, accounting for expected heterogeneity. Primary outcomes will include cognitive disorder treated (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment, etc.), treatment protocol (number of sessions, length of treatment, etc.), outcome measures split into cognitive performance measures and neuroimaging measures, reported side effects/adverse events and relevant results. Any additionally relevant outcomes will be considered as part of narrative completeness. No ethics approval is needed, and findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal(s).

Now, language-based AI assessment of personality holds promise for the future. However, AI has a history of bias towards African-Americans, and modern language-based personality modeling should be examined for possible biases across Black and White research participants. To our knowledge, only one prior study has done so. The present study builds on Oltmanns et al.’s (2025) language-based personality models from N = 1,405 life narrative interviews with community older adults, this time examining the effects by race (Black and White American older adults). Personality was modeled using LIWC, BERTopic modeling, and fine-tuning of the RoBERTa language model (c.f., Oltmanns et al., 2025) for FFM personality traits. Results indicate significant differences in associations between personality and LIWC and BERTopic variables across race. Further, some fine-tuned RoBERTa language models for\npersonality maintain relatively strong predictive performance for both groups, while others demonstrate a drop in predictive performance for Black participants (e.g., extraversion). Moreover, several models show mean-level prediction differences across groups, at small-to-moderate effect sizes, and small calibration errors indicating differences in predicted variance across groups. The findings provide important perspective regarding the language modeling of personality across race in American older adults and indicate there is work to be done to ensure fair performance of language-based AI modeling of personality across race. Implications for advances of language-based AI modeling of personality are discussed.\nKeywords: language, natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), personality, five-factor model, big five, racial differences",

          "abstract": "Across three studies, we examined how outcome preferences shape predictions when prediction-relevant information must be actively acquired through search versus passively received. Participants in our studies predicted the color of randomly selected squares from grids that either were fully visible or required self-directed search to uncover. Consistent with prior work on confirmation bias and selective exposure, Study 1 found that outcome preferences biased search behavior: participants preferentially sampled evidence associated with preferred outcomes and adjusted how much information they gathered based on early evidence. Surprisingly, however, these search biases did not translate into stronger wishful thinking compared with a passive search context, in which all information was immediately available. At first glance, this appears inconsistent with theories of motivated reasoning (e.g., Kunda, 1990), which suggest that flexibility in search should amplify the impact of directional motives. Closer inspection, however, revealed a countervailing process: the magnitude of desirability bias in predictions decreased as participants searched more extensively. In other words, while outcome preferences shaped both the direction and extent of search, prolonged search also attenuated wishful thinking, producing comparable overall bias across active and passive search conditions. Follow-up Studies 2 and 3 suggest that mechanisms related to effort justification and selective stopping of search could account for this pattern of results. Together, these findings highlight a more nuanced view of motivated cognition, in which outcome preferences, search strategies, and effort jointly determine the expression of motivated bias in predictions.",

          "abstract": "Song et al. (2016) proposed a framework to build trainable excitatory-inhibitory recurrent neural networks with user-specified biological mechanisms. These models allow researchers to simulate a miriad of neural, cognitive and behavioral hypothesis through neural circuits, making them one of the most powerful simulation tools for theoretical cognitive modeling nowadays. In the present study we find that using ReLU on weights (not nodes) to set the excitatory and inhibitory populations (Dale's principle) leads to a catastrophic loss of connections beyond user control, compromising its reproducibility and comparability. We explain the reasons behind this connectivity pruning and study its impact through a reproduction of a recent simulation study about activity-silent working memory based on Song et al. (2016)'s framework. We show that ReLU leads to a loss of up to 95% of connections, makes connectivity patterns dependent on the task and biological features of the model, impairs training and modifies neural dynamics in unpredictable ways. Moreover, we show it makes training substantially less efficient and prone to performance issues.

          "abstract": "Psychological theories of media use often assume that subjective motivation affects observable behavior. Using video games as a test case, we examine this assumption by pairing repeated self-reports of motivation with objective digital trace data at scale. Across two datasets comprising tens of thousands of hours of gaming behavior, we test predictions derived from self-determination theory and the Basic Needs in Games (BANG) model, which posit that autonomy, competence, and relatedness experiences drive engagement. Study 1 (preregistered) analyzes 11k daily observations from 555 U.S. players with 30 days of multi-platform digital trace data. Study 2 (exploratory) examines 102k sessions from 9k PowerWash Simulator players, linking in-game experience prompts to behavioral logs. In both studies, need satisfaction was robustly associated with subjective states but showed weak or null associations with short-term gaming behavior, including subsequent play, session length, and return latency, across extensive preregistered and robustness analyses. These findings reveal a substantial motivation–behavior gap and suggest that SDT-based accounts may overestimate the role of need satisfaction in explaining when or how much people play.

Primary research reporting burnout statistics in practicing PAs was included. Data were pooled using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models.\nResults\nEighteen studies (N = 47,098) were included.

          "abstract": "Interpersonal, societal, and political interaction is aided by accurately understanding how other people think and feel. Yet, research demonstrates broadly shared misperceptions of others’ thoughts, feelings, and actions in a variety of contexts—a phenomenon known as pluralistic ignorance. Despite a century of research and theory on pluralistic ignorance, limited work systematically considers possible drivers of these patterns of misperceptions, leaving us with a poor understanding of how to address the phenomenon. In the present work, we draw on theories from psychology and related social science disciplines to construct a systematic framework of the potential causes of pluralistic ignorance. Our framework proposes that pluralistic ignorance can emerge from three broad categories of psychological and contextual factors: a) information availability, b) heuristics, and c) directionally motivated reasoning. In each section, we discuss research and theory supporting possible explanations for pluralistic ignorance and promising directions for corrective interventions.",

          "authors": "Kamil Safader",
          "abstract": "Persistent differences between autistic and neurotypical cognition are widely documented across perception, reasoning, and social interaction, yet existing explanations remain fragmented across disciplinary levels. This paper proposes a unified account grounded in predictive processing, information theory, representational format, and phenomenology. It explains these differences as systematic consequences of how cognitive systems selectively attenuate information to explicit inference. We argue that the critical distinction does not concern the capacity for prediction as such, but the manner in which predictive systems attenuate low-probability, high-information signals. Informational attenuation is introduced as a common organizing mechanism linking multiple explanatory levels. At the computational level, it defines a principled trade-off between informational fidelity and computational efficiency, grounded in information-theoretic relations between probability and surprisal. At the algorithmic level, this trade-off is implemented through precision weighting and thresholding processes that determine which signals are propagated or suppressed. At the representational level, differential attenuation shapes predictive format itself, biasing cognition toward either compressed content or formal structure. At the phenomenological level, the same mechanisms account for systematic differences in experiential organization, explaining why some forms of cognition are characterized by transparency and immediacy, while others involve heightened explicitness and structural salience. At the social and interactional level, differential attenuation explains how inductively reinforcing norms support epistemic stability—and why structurally oriented agents may experience such normativity as opaque, underdetermined, or coercive. By linking these levels through a single mechanistic principle, the proposed framework avoids reductionism, deficit-based framing and explanatory fragmentation.",

          "abstract": "Encounter with supernatural agents and other drug-occasioned immaterial entities are a common aspect of psychedelic experiences. However, existing theories offer incomplete explanations for this phenomenon. This paper proposes a theoretical model of psychedelic supernatural agent experiences grounded in active inference. We review recent theoretical models of psychedelic neurological activity to explain how increased entropy under psychedelics alters precision weighting, creating the cognitive conditions under which supernatural agent inferences are recruited to generate perception. We relate this to predictive processing accounts of supernatural agency detection outside psychedelic contexts, emphasizing the role proximate and remote contexts play in strengthening priors of agency presence. To explain these phenomena absent strong pre-existing beliefs, we propose an integrationist approach– that SA inferences are uniquely capable of addressing altered sensory evidence arising across the brain’s modalities within a coherent perceptual model, restoring error minimization capacities via reorganization of phenomenal self-models and instantiation of alternative agency inferences. This model offers a potentially generalizable cognitive account of supernatural agent encounter across altered states, and forwards several theoretical consequences consistent with current evidence which can be further empirically validated.",

The first condition is irreproducibility, demonstrated  by one or more failed efforts at replication or conditions that make replication impossible. We offer a novel typology of four categories of replication efforts. We propose a rule of thumb for how many failed efforts at replication might be required for each type of replication effort before the original finding is deemed irreproducible. The second condition for a putative vampire article is that it is cited affirmatively in public policy, the scholarly literature, or private communications, after the first condition is met. We discuss rules of thumb for how many such affirmative citations might lead qualified researchers in that subfield to propose correction, retraction, or editorial note of concern for the article in question. Our first case concerns aerial shooting at coyotes and the second case predicts over-fishing. We discuss the damaging effects of vampire articles and why the metaphor has heuristic value and utility.

          "abstract": "For African American women, intersectional stress has been theoretically and empirically linked to cognitive and behavioral manifestations of overcontrolled coping. These coping responses may be adaptive in the short-term while contributing to emotional distress in the long-term. Cultural adaptations, which validate extant environmental stressors while exploring flexibility in coping response style, may be critical to enhancing the usefulness and effectiveness of emotion regulation treatments for Black women. To date, there are no culturally-adapted treatments targeting transdiagnostic emotional challenges for African American women. This project combined Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) emotion regulation skills, a Single-Session Intervention (SSI) format, and community-based participatory methods, to develop the first culturally-adapted DBT emotion regulation skills SSI for Black women. The intervention was developed iteratively using literature review, expert consultation, and a series of two focus groups (n = 9) made up of Black women, 18-65, endorsing emotion dysregulation and race-based stress. The final 60-minute, virtual, clinician-led intervention focuses on 1) The Biopsychosocial Model Integrated with Gendered Racial Stress 2) Dialectics of Superwoman/Strong Black Woman Beliefs 3) Reducing Emotional Vulnerability by Addressing Bodily Needs and 4) Behavioral Strategies to Change Emotions and Increase Positive Emotions. Materials for therapists to administer the treatment are included as supplement. Findings indicated that participants found the intervention to be highly acceptable and culturally relevant. This project provides initial support for a novel culturally-adapted DBT emotion regulation skills SSI for African American women. It emphasizes the importance of taking a culturally-responsive approach to understanding emotional challenges and suggests that brief, adapted treatments have the potential to reach and support communities typically marginalized.",

          "authors": "Artem Kryvosheia",
          "abstract": "Background:\nFalse memories and confabulations are both forms of memory distortion, but they differ in typical aetiology and clinical meaning. False memories are common in healthy cognition and often arise from source-monitoring errors, schema-driven reconstruction, and exposure to misleading post-event information. Confabulation is most often observed following neurological insult and reflects impaired reality monitoring and executive control.\n\nAims:\nThis narrative review integrates contemporary cognitive and clinical neuroscience accounts of false memory and confabulation, with a focus on mechanisms, neural correlates, identification and differential diagnosis, interventions and risk mitigation, and therapeutic and forensic implications.\n\nMethods:\nTargeted searches prioritised systematic reviews, meta-analyses, preregistered studies, and clinically informative lesion or case series evidence, with emphasis on literature published since 2015. Classic foundational work was retained where necessary for definitional and theoretical grounding.\n\nResults:\nEvidence converges on a reconstructive model of remembering in which episodic retrieval is guided by prior knowledge, goals, and contextual cues. False memories are best explained by interactions between gist-based reconstruction and failures of source monitoring, moderated by plausibility, repetition, social influence, and warning or feedback procedures. Confabulation is characterised by a breakdown in control and verification of retrieved information, linked to dysfunction in prefrontal systems and their interaction with medial temporal and diencephalic structures. Recent lesion-network mapping work suggests that spontaneous confabulation reflects disruption within a functionally connected network involving orbitofrontal and subcortical regions.\n\nConclusions:\nMemory distortion is not a discrete pathology but a graded outcome of otherwise adaptive reconstructive processes. Clinically, distinguishing false memory from confabulation requires attention to elicitation conditions, suggestive influences, neurological status, and patterns of monitoring failure. In psychotherapy and forensic interviewing, risk reduction depends on non-suggestive practice and early collection of uncontaminated accounts. In neurorehabilitation, management of confabulation is supported by structured cueing, external verification, and metacognitive strategies, although controlled trials remain limited.",

          "authors": "Maximilian Fascher; Krysztof Krasowski; Markus Muehlhan",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Neural drug cue reactivity (DCR) is a central paradigm in addiction neuroscience for probing how drug cues acquire excessive motivational salience in substance use disorders (SUDs). However, the field faces challenges in clinical translation, replicability, and within-group designs are susceptible to visual confounding due to stimulus matching. A complementary approach is to examine case-control contrasts to identify SUD-specific neural architecture while mitigating effects of task-design variability. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify convergence effects in the contrast drug &gt; control cues between SUD and control groups. ALE results were supplemented by assessing behavioural domains, meta-analytic connectivity profiles, robustness to publication bias, and study-level modulators using penalised logistic regression. Results: The ALE analysis revealed one reliable convergence cluster in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), associated with reward, reasoning, and social cognition. Penalised logistic regression indicated that contributions to this cluster were less likely in alcohol DCR studies and were sensitive to matching conditions for human content. vACC DCR effects contrasted with neutral control cues were invariant across abstinence periods, whereas DCR contrasted with natural reward cues declined with longer abstinence. Conclusion: This meta-analysis replicates context-sensitive SUD-specific DCR convergence in vACC regions intersecting reward pathways and the default-mode network yet limited support for striatal centredness. The review recapitulates these results by discussing current challenges in balancing personalisation and standardisation, the use of motivationally inert versus salient comparators, and argues for careful deliberation when inferring evidence for hyperreactive reward responses.",

However, the failed replication study by Foody et al. (2015) typically goes uncited. Given their importance, I critically re-evaluate the results of both articles. I found several issues, the most important of which was that the central claim does not correspond with the reported analyses. When I extracted summary statistics from both studies and used them to conducte a multiverse analysis, that mapped directly onto the original claim (i.e., that the hierarchy condition reduced distress more than the distinction condition), null results were found under every set of conditions.

In this study, we investigated the influence of the decision-maker (AI vs. human) on fairness perception, trust, and emotional responses in participants (N = 329) who are allocated university course topics. While the allocation process was identical, participants were either told that a human lecturer or an AI made the decision based on the same pieces of information. Furthermore, we manipulated whether the corresponding decision-making process was explicitly communicated as fair or whether no comment was made regarding the process’ fairness. Finally, we assessed how favourable students rated the outcome of the allocation process. Against our hypotheses, Bayesian evidence indicated that neither the decision-maker nor whether the decision-making process was communicated as fair had an impact on students' fairness perception, trust, or emotional responses. Students’ evaluations of the university course topic allocation process were strongly associated with the favourability of the outcome.  Given that an AI can better optimize allocations according to students’ preferences than human decision-makers, these findings support a broader implementation of AI-based decision-making in the context of allocation decisions at university.",

These effects were more pronounced among optimists. These findings document the existence of optimistic distortions even in an environment where personal consequences were salient. The study’s implications extend to both individual judgment as well as institutional decision-making, emphasizing the need for strategies that counteract bias while recognizing the positive psychological functions of optimism during crisis.",

          "authors": "Lola Seyll; Pauline Joy Atete; Vincent Sezibera; Patrick Fery; Emilie A. Caspar",
          "abstract": "Over the past decades, clinical neuropsychology has expanded substantially worldwide, contributing to improved patient care and diagnostic accuracy. However, this development has progressed unevenly across regions. While advanced training programs, professional recognition, and standardized assessment tools are well established in North America, Europe, and Australia, neuropsychology remains emerging or largely nonexistent in many low- and middle-income countries. In these contexts, access to training, supervision, and culturally appropriate assessment tools remains limited. A central challenge concerns the widespread use of neuropsychological tests developed and normed in Western settings, which may not adequately account for differences in language, education, culture, and lived experience. When applied without appropriate adaptation, such tools risk misclassifying cognitive functioning and overestimating impairment. This methodological paper addresses these issues by presenting a framework for the selection, adaptation, and preliminary evaluation of neuropsychological measures in Rwanda, a country facing a growing need for cognitive assessment due to demographic aging and the high prevalence of neurological disorders, yet where neuropsychological tools are currently scarce. Drawing on cross-cultural neuropsychological principles and existing African initiatives, we developed a context-appropriate cognitive screening battery targeting core domains, including attention, executive functions, memory, and language. Task selection prioritized open-access measures, minimal logistical demands, and reduced cultural bias, while ensuring accessibility across diverse educational levels, socioeconomic backgrounds, and rural–urban contexts. Pilot data collected in Rwanda were used to assess the feasibility and relevance of the adapted battery. Most tasks elicited expected cognitive effects, supporting their suitability as screening tools. However, culturally unfamiliar stimuli in naming tasks highlighted the need for further adaptation. Overall, this work provides a practical, theory-driven approach to developing culturally fair neuropsychological assessments and offers a foundation for future norming efforts and similar initiatives in other settings.",

          "abstract": "Music is a cultural universal, yet the conceptual boundary between “music” and “non‑music” remains theoretically unsettled. This study used behavioral measures to examine the perceptual judgments of listeners from Brazil, China, and the United States as they classified short sound excerpts and rated their perceived musicality. Participants (N = 103) completed an online survey featuring 24 two‑second stimuli drawn from 11 sound categories, including traditional music from 130 societies and non‑musical sounds from established auditory taxonomies. Descriptively, the mean proportion of “music” classifications was 0.51, with substantial category‑level variation: traditional vocal and non‑vocal music received the highest endorsement rates, whereas speech and environmental sounds received the lowest. Musicality ratings showed a parallel pattern. Inter‑participant agreement, quantified using Krippendorff’s α, was moderate at the aggregate level (α = .73) but generally low within categories.\n\nTo complement these descriptive patterns, mixed‑effects models were used to assess whether sound category or country predicted responses while accounting for participant‑ and stimulus‑level variability. Both models revealed large, reliable effects of sound category: the two traditional music categories were far more likely to be judged as music and received substantially higher musicality ratings than all other categories. No other category differed significantly from the reference, and country effects were small or nonsignificant. Together, the descriptive and inferential results indicate that listeners share strong intuitions about prototypical musical sounds, but judgments become highly heterogeneous for ambiguous cases, suggesting that the concept of music may be graded and context‑dependent rather than sharply bounded.",

          "abstract": "Standard measures of abortion attitudes, such as the American National Election Survey’s four-point scale, do not capture public opinion on the dimensions that structure the post-Roe abortion policy landscape. While these traditional measures rely on broad, categorical distinctions, contemporary policy debates increasingly hinge on two specific factors: the reason for seeking an abortion and the gestational age of the fetus. To address this mismatch, I develop an original survey instrument that measures opinion along these dimensions. Using data from a large-scale survey (N = 69,752), I show that continuing to use the ANES scale introduces partisan-driven, nonrandom measurement error. Specifically, Democrats and Republicans who select the same ANES response hold systematically different policy preferences, and respondents with comparable policy preferences select different ANES answer choices depending on their partisanship—with Democrats anchoring their answers to a more permissive baseline. These findings underscore the risk of relying on broad-based attitudinal scales that do not evolve alongside the policy debates they are meant to capture.",

          "abstract": "Research on the psychology of divine forgiveness has expanded in recent years, yet most studies rely on cross-sectional designs and generalized measures that do not capture how forgiveness-related processes unfold following specific instances of personal wrongdoing. Guided by a Christian-sensitive relational spirituality model of personal sin, the present study used an incident-anchored longitudinal design to explore two central processes involved in experiencing reconciliation with God—engaging in repentance with God (ER) and experiencing absolution from God (EA)—over a 16-day period beginning within 24 hours of a self-identified wrongdoing. U.S. Christian adults (N = 175) who met the inclusion criteria completed assessments on days 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Multilevel growth model comparisons favored a logarithmic trajectory for both processes, indicating rapid early increases that tapered over time. Although these two processes unfolded in parallel, ER was higher on day 1 and EA increased more steeply over time. Baseline relational spirituality variables predicted individual differences in trajectories of change: ER increased more steeply among participants reporting lower day 1 divine struggles, whereas EA increased more steeply among those reporting higher day 1 communion with God and lower divine struggles. Prospective within-person associations suggested asymmetric temporal dynamics for ER and EA: positive within-person deviation in ER more clearly preceded higher subsequent EA than the inverse, and positive within-person deviation in EA (but not ER) modestly predicted higher subsequent communion with God. These findings further our understanding of how experiences of divine forgiveness unfold following specific incidents of personal wrongdoing.",

We first replicate standard speech-music categorization results (N=108). Then, we depart from the typical experimental procedure by asking new participants (N=180) to sort and label the stimulus material, without predefined categories. Hierarchical clustering of participants’ stimulus groupings reveals multiple organizing dimensions, with the speech–music distinction reliably present but secondary under label-free conditions. By reverse-engineering the relationship between sorting behavior, acoustic features, and semantic labels, we characterize how speech–music categorization relates to other salient perceptual dimensions and how its behavioral prominence depends on task constraints.",

          "abstract": "In this commentary we review the recent approval of escitalopram for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in children and adolescents. We critically discuss the FDA approval document and the approval trial. In the approval trial, efficacy was not clinically meaningful, statistical significance uncertain, and there were significantly more adverse events with escitalopram than with placebo. Relative to placebo, children and adolescents exposed to escitalopram were more likely to become suicidal than to experience a clinically relevant improvement in anxiety. Overall, the harm/benefit ratio seems problematic for escitalopram for pediatric GAD.",

          "abstract": "Background \nVisual distortions (VDs) are frequently reported but insufficiently characterized in early psychosis and may reflect alterations in perceptual processing. Computational accounts emphasize aberrant precision-weighting of sensory evidence and prior expectations, but most empirical work has used simplified laboratory stimuli. It remains unclear whether these mechanistic accounts generalize to more naturalistic perceptual contexts. \n\nMethods\nWe developed virtual reality (VR) tasks simulating VDs in photorealistic scenes and explored associations between VD perception and psychosis-relevant traits in a non-clinical sample. 120 healthy adults completed three tasks designed to probe complementary aspects of perceptual inference: (1) a naïve detection task (NDT) assessing expectation-driven false percepts of unspecified visual changes; (2) a perceptual uncertainty task (PUT) testing how detection under ambiguous sensory evidence is shaped by recent trial history; and (3) an adaptive two-interval forced-choice task (2-IFC) quantifying bottom-up sensitivity to psychosis-like VDs. Psychosis-relevant traits were assessed using validated questionnaires of delusional ideation, anomalous perceptual experiences, and schizotypal traits. \n\nResults\nHigher levels of delusional ideation and schizotypy were associated with stronger expectation effects, reflected in increased false percepts in the NDT trial without changes and enhanced detection of near-threshold distortions when these trials followed distortion-present trials in the PUT. These traits were also linked to reduced 2-IFC perceptual sensitivity to VDs, particularly brightness changes.\n\nConclusions\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of VR-based VD assessment and provide initial evidence that individual differences in VD perception relate to psychosis-relevant traits. Results suggest contributions from both diminished sensory sensitivity and increased reliance on expectations in naturalistic perceptual contexts.",

Four consecutively sampled stroke survivors (mean chronicity=18 months, SD=10) with mild (n=3) or moderate (n=1) cognitive impairment received 35 hours of CICT. CICT combined two empirically supported approaches: Speed of Processing Training (SOPT) and behavior change techniques from Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) adapted to transfer gains from in-lab cognitive training to daily life. The latter featured IADL training following shaping principles and a suite of behavioral techniques, called the Transfer Package, to promote participation in cognitively-based functional activities outside of the lab. Outcome measures assessed cognitive processing speed (Useful Field of View, UFOV) and IADL performance outside the treatment setting (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, COPM). All three participants with valid UFOV data displayed meaningful improvements after treatment in cognitive processing speed (M=64%, SD=40, d'=1.58). All three with COPM data reported meaningful improvements in satisfaction with IADL performance (M=2.87, SD=1.5, d'=1.91). Values of d' ≥0.57 are large. Per structured interviews developed for this study, the IADL improvements present after treatment lasted for at least a year. These promising findings warrant further study.",

          "abstract": "Many people adjust their speech to accommodate listeners who may face comprehension difficulties, including older adults and non-native speakers, giving rise to registers such as Elderspeak and Foreigner-Directed Speech. In the current pre-registered study, we investigated whether non-autistic speakers similarly modified their speech in interactions with listeners who disclosed they were autistic. We used the Map Task paradigm; 33 participants (mean age = 36 years) gave verbal instructions to a confederate in two conditions: one in which the confederate disclosed being autistic and the other in which they did not. Participants did not show evidence of linguistic accommodation toward the autistic listener on any of the linguistic measures we coded for, including speech rate, syntactic complexity (e.g., MLU), semantic complexity (e.g., type-token ratio) and discourse features (e.g., repetitions). Although there was no average difference on these measures between the autistic and non-autistic listener conditions, exploratory analyses showed that more positive attitudes toward autism were associated with lower degree of accommodation to the autistic listener on one measure, MLU. No associations were found between level of contact and degree of accommodation. These findings suggest that an autism label alone does not cue linguistic accommodations, and that more positive attitudes towards autism may reduce the likelihood of linguistically accommodating autistic listeners.",

          "abstract": "Learning to recognize and produce foreign speech sounds can be challenging, particularly when only subtle differences distinguish these new sounds from phonemes in the native language. Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

          "abstract": "Most autistic children have language delays, which can result in challenges with comprehending narratives. We explored how unscripted narratives produced by parents might be tuned to support their child’s language comprehension, and how children visually follow along with their parents’ speech. Data from English-acquiring 18 autistic (48-78 months) and 18 language-matched non-autistic children (32-50 months) and one of their parents were analyzed (n = 36). We examined variables related to topic identification and maintenance, including how often parents mentioned the narrative’s topic, how they referred to it (e.g., “the pig” vs. “it”), and how much children looked at it. Results indicated many similarities between groups, but also some key differences: parents of autistic children produced shorter narratives and talked about the primary character proportionally more than parents of non-autistic children. In both groups, children looked at the primary character more than other characters, and the parent’s proportion of topic reference was positively associated with children’s proportion of looking at the primary character. Similar patterns arose with the full sample of autistic children, which includes children who had not been able to be matched on language (n = 32). These findings suggest that parent input to autistic children may be tuned to support challenges that autistic children might experience, such as slower language processing or distractibility by unrelated story elements, and, given this tuned input, autistic children were successful, at least in the sense of looking at the primary character, in following along with the narratives.",

However, the failed replication study by Foody et al. (2015) typically goes uncited. Given their importance, I critically re-evaluate the results of both articles. I found several issues, the most important of which was that the central claim does not correspond with the reported analyses. When I extracted summary statistics from both studies and used them to conducte a multiverse analysis, that mapped directly onto the original claim (i.e., that the hierarchy condition reduced distress more than the distinction condition), null results were found under every set of conditions.

          "authors": "Adrian Meule; David R. Kolar",
          "abstract": "People with emetophobia (specific fear of vomiting) are prone to experience disgust and tend to interpret feelings of disgust as signs of imminent vomiting. Accordingly, they typically avoid situations they believe might increase the likelihood of vomiting or expose them to others vomiting. Because of this, vomit-related stimuli are often used as part of exposure exercises during treatment. To examine relationships between emetophobia symptoms, disgust, and avoidance behavior in more detail, the current study tested 126 participants (77% female) who completed self-report measures on emetophobia symptoms, disgust propensity, disgust sensitivity, and state disgust, and performed a behavioral approach test (BAT) involving a vomit-like substance in the laboratory. Higher emetophobic symptomatology related to higher disgust sensitivity but did not relate to disgust propensity. Both emetophobic symptomatology and disgust sensitivity—but not disgust propensity—related to higher state disgust before the BAT. In contrast, higher disgust propensity—but not emetophobic symptomatology or disgust sensitivity—related to larger increases in state disgust from before to after the BAT and to higher avoidance of the vomit-like substance. Results suggest that people with emetophobia may not be more easily disgusted by external stimuli than people without emetophobia but their subjective feelings of disgust are driven by their expectations and their tendency to evaluate the experience of disgust more negatively. This implies that the aim of exposure exercises should not be reducing vomit stimuli-induced disgust intensity but modifying patients’ expectations and interpretation of feelings of disgust.",

          "abstract": "Cologna et al. (2025) compared perceived scientist trustworthiness across 68 countries/regions and examined its associations with individual- and country-level factors. While the authors reported that the scale did not satisfy metric and scalar measurement invariance, their subsequent cross-national/regional comparisons and regressions were nonetheless conducted using weighted means of observed item scores, implicitly assuming cross-country/region comparability at the observed-score level. Using the publicly shared dataset, we re-evaluated these conclusions by systematically applying measurement alignment under four analytical paths: pooled-sample versus country/region-specific confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), each estimated with and without weights. Across all specifications, cross-national/regional CFA supported configural and metric invariance but failed to establish scalar or strict invariance. Importantly, under the analytical path most closely corresponding to the original study (pooled CFA with weights), only the competence and openness factors yielded admissible aligned solutions within the four-factor model. Using aligned latent scores for these two dimensions, country/region rankings changed for 62 of the 68 countries/regions. Substantive conclusions also differed: associations between perceived scientist trustworthiness and science-related populist attitudes or social dominance orientation were near zero or non-robust, whereas attitudes toward science remained strongly and positively related. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that cross-national/regional comparisons based on observed-score averages may be misleading when measurement equivalence is not established, and that latent-variable approaches such as alignment provide a more defensible basis for international inference.",

Sixty adults (30 MCI, 30 healthy controls), aged 50-86 years, completed neuropsychological testing, the Facial emotion composite Task, and structural MRI. \nOur results revealed no significant gray matter volume differences between groups. Cortical thickness analyses identified two regions with reduced thickness in MCI: the right superior parietal lobule and the left posterior insula. Results revealed that greater regional volume predicted better sadness recognition in MCI, whereas this association was negative in healthy controls. These findings suggest that early MCI involves selective thinning in association cortices supporting attention and salience processing. The sadness-specific interaction indicates that patients with MCI may draw on structural reserve within the superior parietal lobule to support recognition of subtle negative expressions, highlighting early parietal involvement in socioemotional decline.",

          "abstract": "Political scandals can shape entire elections and political structures within society. Scholars have long pointed to different strategies politicians can use to respond to such scandals—finding strategies like denying may be more effective than apologizing. However, a recent trend suggests politicians increasingly respond to accusations of scandal by emphasizing how they (or their political in-group) have been victimized. These victimhood strategies may be highly effective by garnering sympathy and reducing blame, but have yet to be studied in political scandal research. Across 3 studies in the United States (N = 2,541), we show that when politicians respond to scandal accusations by emphasizing their own (or their political in-group’s) victimhood, participants see them as more moral and less responsible for the scandal. Additionally, people are more sympathetic to politicians emphasizing victimhood as compared to apologizing and control conditions. Victimhood strategies do not reduce competency evaluations—potentially making these strategies especially effective. While responding by highlighting victimhood is less effective than denial, victimhood strategies positively benefit reactions to scandalized politicians with people from across the ideological spectrum. Further these strategies work similarly well for male and female politicians. These findings underscore how responding to scandal with victimhood can significantly and positively influence the publics’ perceptions of a scandalized politician—highlighting the powerful influence of victimhood in political scandal research.",

Although the conceptualization of emotion is a matter of much debate, two key features pervade affective frameworks despite diversity in theories and disparate usage of terms: (a) the assumption of an innate and universal valence-determining process, and (b) a conceptual approach involving the grouping of multimodal responses into unitary emotion states, often viewed as genetically inherited patterns with situation-specific aims. These features heavily inform psychotherapy theories and popular framings of psychological experience. I first subject these features to a critical examination. I then demonstrate how they can obscure more critical and meaningful targets and foster unwarranted assumptions, potentially contributing to iatrogenic effects and limited treatment efficacy, suboptimal intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning, and concerns pertaining to social control and justice.\n \nKeywords: affect, emotion, valence, emotion regulation, intervention science",

          "abstract": "There are unique challenges to recruiting and retaining couples in relationship research. This study used a mixed-methods approach to understand characteristics that predict participation in a dyadic relationship study. We recruited a racially diverse sample of 59 undergraduate students to complete a set of quantitative measures.  Of these participants, 26 completed a semi-structured qualitative interview, and 17 completed repeated-measures surveys. Of the 59 initial participants, 30 (51%) were willing for their partner to take part the study. We found evidence that both relationship perceptions and mental health symptoms influenced participation. Individuals who reported using domination during conflict with their partner were less likely to participate in the qualitative interview. Discrimination was negatively associated with likelihood of participation in the qualitative interview, but was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Relationship quality, separation during conflict, and anxiety symptoms were positively associated with one’s likelihood of willingness for their partner’s involvement in the study, and there was a negative association for depression symptoms. Interpersonal trauma exposure was negatively associated with willingness for partner involvement but was not statistically significant (p=0.07). Participants were asked to describe their thoughts about dyadic research participation. We found that an individual’s perceptions of their partner’s interest and availability to participate were additional factors that predicted willingness for their partner to be involved in the study. Despite the involved nature of repeated-measures research, participants identified few perceived barriers to survey completion. Our findings add nuance to the field’s understanding of who participates in relationship science research, but also why these individuals choose to take part. The results also highlight methodological implications for consideration when conducting relationship research.",

          "abstract": "Neurolinguistic research on syntactic processing has utilized Node Count, the number of structure-building steps executed at each word, to investigate how the effort invested in structure building affects brain activity. However, several recent studies cast doubt on the presumed link between Node Count and processing effort; they observe negative correlations between Node Count and reading times. Addressing this disagreement, we analyze information-theoretic measures and reading times using three large-scale naturalistic datasets in English across different grammar formalisms: phrase-structure grammar, dependency grammar, and combinatory categorial grammar. This study establishes a dual nature of Node Count: we conclude that it indexes two opposing forces—processing facilitation due to predictability in immediate regions and processing inhibition due to contextual semantic integration in spillover regions. We also demonstrate that Node Count has a unique psycholinguistic value as an index of human prediction, since its facilitatory effect explains reading time variance beyond that captured by a Transformer-based language model. These results highlight the role of structural representations in human language processing and underscore the need for a careful interpretation of the observed correlations between Node Count and brain activity in neurolinguistic studies.",

          "abstract": "Estimating the minimum sample size needed to reach a target performance in machine learning models is a recurring problem in applied research. Unlike many traditional statistical settings, where tools such as GPower can provide closed-form answers, machine learning rarely offers analytic formulas for sample-size planning. In this article, we propose a Monte Carlo simulation approach that uses empirical learning curves and power-law fitting to estimate the required sample size for a given, fixed modeling pipeline. The method uses a Monte Carlo resampling design with a fixed test set, evaluates several training sample sizes through repeated stochastic runs, then: (1) builds learning curves, (2) fits a power-law model to extrapolate, and (3) identifies the sample size that satisfies explicit criteria for mean performance, probability of success, and stability. We implement the procedure in R through the ml_sample_size() function in the easyML package, supporting both classification and regression with common algorithms (e.g.,Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, GLM) for tabular data typical in the social, health, and \nbehavioral sciences. A key limitation is that the recommended sample size n∗ is conditional on the chosen hyperparameter configuration. When hyperparameter tuning is planned, n∗ should be treated as a lower bound, and additional observations may be needed to reflect the added complexity tuning typically introduces. Finally, we provide applied examples using simulated and real datasets to show how the method can support prospective study planning.",

This research tests whether trust in neighbors plays a similar role. Methods: Analyses using data (N = 1,762) from the Midlife in the U.S. study tested whether SES (educational attainment, income, and assets) and trust in neighbors interacted to predict two indices of metabolic syndrome, a marker of cardiovascular and diabetes risk. These two metabolic syndrome indices were the number of dimensions on which participants met clinical risk cutoffs and a diagnosis. Results: SES interacted with neighborhood trust to predict the number of dimensions on which risk cutoffs were met (b = 0.08, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.14], p = 0.014). Lower, but not higher, SES participants met risk cutoffs on fewer dimensions when they had higher trust in their neighbors. The same pattern emerged for the diagnosis outcome, although in this case, the significance of the SES x trust in neighbors interaction depended on the covariates included. Conclusions: Living in neighborhoods where individuals trust each other may protect the health of individuals with lower SES, and investing in programs that build trust among neighbors may reduce health disparities.",

          "abstract": "Affective vocalizations are central to human social experience yet researchers debate their nature. Across two preregistered studies (N=842), we tested the diagnosticity and contextual malleability of real-life laughter and crying vocalizations. Using human data and machine learning methods we demonstrate that real-life laughter and crying vocalizations are perceptually diverse, with ~40% of the vocalizations perceived as conveying atypical affective messages. This vocal diversity was also reflected by the distinct acoustic features of typical versus atypical vocalizations. Finally, we demonstrate that co-occurring visual context has profound impact on the perception of real-life laughter and crying vocalizations, especially when vocal cues are ambiguous. Together, we show that real-life vocalizations convey both typical and atypical affective cues and highlight the striking role of contextual information and multimodal integration in facilitating emotion understanding in everyday life.",

          "abstract": "Five years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this report examines the current state of the U.S. teaching profession using national survey data collected from PK-12 teachers in spring 2025. Results suggest cautious improvement in teacher morale, stress, mental health, and retention compared to 2023, indicating increased stabilization across the profession. However, persistent challenges remain, particularly related to workload, emotional exhaustion, student behavior, chronic absenteeism, and uneven parent support - especially for discipline. Differences across school types and poverty contexts reveal that teachers in traditional public, charter, and Title I schools continue to experience greater strain than their peers in private and hybrid school settings. Findings also highlight strong teacher support for cell phone bans, and growing but under-supported interest in using artificial intelligence in their instructional practice.",

          "authors": "Alzbeta Bartova; Thordis Reimer; Gerardo Meil; Pedro Romero-Balsas",
          "abstract": "Paid parenting leave (PPL) policies have become a central pillar of contemporary welfare states, supporting gender equality, labour market participation, child well-being, and long-term social sustainability. As these policies have expanded in scope, duration and objectives, however, the terminology used to describe them has evolved unevenly across countries, international organisations, databases and academic research.\n\nThis Policy Brief argues that terminology is not merely a semantic or technical issue, but a core element of governance and knowledge production. The concepts used to name, classify and aggregate parenting leave entitlements shape how policies are designed, monitored, evaluated and compared. Inconsistent terminology weakens cross-national comparability, obscures policy effects and undermines evidence-based policymaking.\n\nDrawing on a comprehensive review of international regulations, comparative databases, national terminologies and academic research, the brief demonstrates that traditional distinctions between maternity, paternity and parental leave no longer adequately capture the diversity and complexity of contemporary leave systems. While diversity in national terminology is both inevitable and normatively meaningful, the absence of a harmonised comparative framework has become a major obstacle to effective monitoring, policy learning and research synthesis.\n\nThe brief concludes that harmonisation of terminology at national level is neither feasible nor desirable, but that harmonised terminology for comparative and monitoring purposes is essential. It proposes the systematic use of an umbrella concept of parenting leave, disaggregated by entitlement type, while always retaining national legal terms and contextual specificity.",

          "abstract": "Despite the Netherlands’ reputation for transparency, public sector corruption and integrity violations remain persistent issues, particularly in transport security environments. This article reports insights based on an exploratory qualitative case study of airport policing of corruption by the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (KMar) at a regional Dutch airport. Grounded in a theoretical understanding of corruption as a socially constructed and discursively mediated phenomenon shaped by institutional logics, professional identities, and operational constraints, we draw on in-depth interviews with KMar officers (N=12) and participant observations (N=3) to deliver a “thick” description of how airport KMar officers perceive, define, and make sense of the nature of corruption, and how this perception affects their work practices in policing corruption. Two distinct logics – socially-reinforced moral licensing and integrity-draining demands – constitute this process of social construction, leading to blind spots in policing and paradoxical moral hazards for officers to engage in corruption. These novel insights expand prior research on the process of social construction of corruption and corruptibility in security forces, with important implications for theory and practice.",

Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake.\n\nMethods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours.\n\nResults: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits.\n\nConclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.",

Digital platforms offering online post-divorce help may provide scalable, affordable, and accessible support for divorcees during this transition. The study examined the long-term effects (five years) of a post-divorce targeted digital mental health intervention on divorcee’s labor market attachment and income. Participants (n=1,856) were divorcees from a nationally administered randomized controlled trial (RCT) tracked over a five-year period post their RCT participation using Danish national register data. Cumulative and by-year effects of treatment on labor market income, weeks on sick leave benefits, weeks on welfare benefits, and share of year unemployed were obtained using linear and count models. The study protocol was preregistered. Over the follow up period, participants in the treatment group spent fewer weeks on sick leave benefits and accumulated higher labor market income. By-year estimates for labor market income passed preregistered significance levels, but accumulated effects estimates and estimates for sick leave benefits did not. Digital health interventions may be a low-cost, high scalability way to address negative life consequences of divorce. However, more—and higher powered—research projected are needed to obtain better knowledge of their full potential.",

          "abstract": "Purpose – This study examines the de-escalation techniques police officers employ during everyday encounters with civilians and assesses how the use of these techniques varies when civilians exhibit different emotional and behavioral states. \nDesign/methodology/approach – We systematically analyzed body-worn camera footage from 82 real-life police-civilian interactions in the Netherlands, coding 35 distinct de-escalation techniques. Using Firth’s logistic regression with cluster bootstrap, we assessed differences in technique use for interactions involving civilians showing intoxicated, incomprehensible, or heightened emotional behavior, compared to interactions with civilians not exhibiting these behaviors. \nFindings – Officers employed the full range of de-escalation techniques, most frequently utilizing communication strategies. The use of specific techniques varied with the civilians’ emotional and behavioral states. For 22 de-escalation techniques, the odds that officers use them proved to be either significantly higher or lower in the investigated types of interactions. Sixteen techniques were specific for one type of interaction (e.g., civilian showing incomprehensible behavior), while six were significant for more than one type of interaction. Most differences were observed in interactions with civilians exhibiting heightened emotional behavior, where, for example, the odds of officers remaining calm were higher compared to interactions with civilians not showing such behaviors.\nOriginality/value – Few studies have examined officer de-escalation techniques in real-life interactions using body-worn camera footage. This study advances our understanding of what de-escalation entails in daily practice and how officers adapt their techniques to the civilians’ emotional and behavioral states.",

          "abstract": "This article challenges dominant views that partisanship informs the formation of social relationships and that ordinary Republicans and Democrats loathe each other. Evidence for these claims generally comes from studies in which respondents reject fictitious out-partisans. However, in most encounters, partisanship is often invisible, or ambiguous, and few people care about it. Using an original survey module, we show that only 15 percent of respondents know the partisanship of a recently met acquaintance, and few consider it important. Selection experiments further show that preferences for co-workers, neighbors, and recreational partners are barely shaped by politics: when partisanship is invisible, people seldom seek it out. Only when presented with explicit information about partisanship -- which is rare in everyday life -- do partisan preferences emerge. These results temper concerns about widespread out-partisan avoidance, and reveal limitations of survey experiments. While partisan labels evoke hostility, actual out-partisans seldom do.",

          "abstract": "Background: Improving students’ diet is a public health priority, yet interventions often fail to address the structural barriers students face, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. This study aimed to assess how students involved in a co-creation process (i.e. a student citizens’ assembly) conceptualise and prioritise solutions to improve students’ access to healthier, more climate-friendly diets.  \nMethods: This participatory research took place at a French university (Sorbonne Paris Nord) located in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs of Paris. A student citizens’ assembly was conducted with the aim to co-create concrete proposals that would enhance students’ access to sustainable diets and physical activity. The assembly involved 27 students randomly selected among a pool of volunteers. Over three days in November 2024, students received awareness-raising and training, deliberated among themselves then with institutional and local stakeholders, and formulated proposals. For each proposal, students were asked to rate anonymously their approval on a 10-point scale. Proposals related to diet (i.e. not physical activity) were analysed a posteriori using two complementary frameworks: the DONE framework classifying determinants of diet (individual, interpersonal, environmental /policy) and the FAO dimensions of sustainable diets (health, ecological, socioeconomic, cultural). \nResults: Overall, 31 proposals were formulated, of which 77% targeted environmental and policy determinants of diet (e.g. institutional regulations, university policies, food assistance solutions, improved food affordability and availability, food labelling). Other proposals referred to individual (19%) and interpersonal determinants (3%). In addition, 39%, 29%, 23% and 10% proposals addressed the health, socio-economic, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively. Mean approval ratings (SD) for each proposal ranged from 6.7 (4.0) to 9.7 (0.9), with a mean (SD) value for all proposals of 8.6 (0.7). Proposals addressing the socio-economic dimension received the highest approval ratings (mean [SD] 9.0 [0.6], vs 8.4 [0.6], 8.4 [0.8] and 7.9 [0.4] for the health, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively).\nConclusion: The predominance of environmental and policy measures targeting economic access to food highlights the importance of co-creation and its value to align interventions with participants’ needs and expectations. One major challenge that warrants further investigation is the capacity of stakeholders to implement such proposals, and to evaluate their effectiveness.",

          "authors": "Hector Cebolla-Boado; Alvaro Suarez; Michael Borchgrevink Lund",
          "abstract": "Research on migrant perinatal outcomes has much focused on how and why migration protects against unhealthy low birth weights, often overlooking the emerging risk of fetal macrosomia among immigrant populations. We propose a multi-sited, life-course framework that links early-life exposure to nutritional deprivation in mothers' countries of origin to perinatal outcomes in destination. Using unconditional quantile regression on Spanish birth registry microdata linked with historical FAO nutritional series, we reveal a dual pattern: immigrant status confers protection at the lower tail of the birthweight distribution but predicts excessive growth at the upper tail. To explain this paradox, we test competitive nutritional mechanisms. We find that adjusting for historical caloric availability yields null results, ruling out simple energy-deficit hypotheses. In contrast, adjusting for the scarcity of key macronutrients—specifically Fats and proteins—attenuates the macrosomia risk by nearly 80% at the 95th percentile. This validates a qualitative nutritional mismatch mechanism: metabolic efficiency programmed by early lipid scarcity becomes maladaptive in the obesogenic destination environment. Heterogeneity analyses confirm that this mechanism is specific to populations undergoing drastic lipid transitions such as Latin Americans, highlighting the enduring biological legacy of origin-country nutritional ecologies.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the influence of entrepreneurialism on the self-conceptions and practices of contemporary artists, highlighting the interplay between traditional artistic values and emerging entrepreneurial norms. We explore the sociological processes through which precarious labor markets and entrepreneurial discourses have reshaped artistic subjectivities. Artists today navigate fragmented careers marked by overwork, uncertainty, and excessive self-promotion, while simultaneously reinterpreting ideals like autonomy, creativity, and authenticity through entrepreneurial lenses. We underscore the ambivalence artists experience in engagements with entrepreneurialism: some embracing it as a pathway to fulfillment, while others critique its alignment with market logics. By situating entrepreneurialism within broader cultural and structural contexts, we reveal the ways that it naturalizes precarious conditions and reinforces individual responsibility for success. Ultimately, this work calls for critical engagement with the entrepreneurial spirit that shapes modern art worlds and emphasizes the need to address structural inequalities in creative industries.",

          "authors": "Panchami Jose; Moumita Koley",
          "abstract": "This article discusses how neoliberal market forces and the increasing dominance of ranking frameworks shape doctoral education in private universities in India. Based on thematic analysis of interviews with 25 doctoral students from three private institutions and analysis of policy documents on research incentives of 11 private universities, this study examines how processes of neoliberalisation along with the old hierarchical social relations shape the everyday conditions of doctoral work in private universities. We show how stipends, fees, working hours, publication mandates, and incentive structures function not simply as academic requirements but also as mechanisms of financial extraction, labour control, and institutional branding. In doing so, we argue that doctoral students in private universities are systematically positioned as low-cost, multi-purpose labour pools whose contributions are mobilised to compete in the academic market. This pressure includes pressure to generate ‘publishable units’ in a short time frame. Here, the private universities instrumentalise student research to climb ranking ladders and transform it into a scheme of metric accumulation and institutional branding. By analysing how national metrics are translated into internal incentive formulas and contractual arrangements, the study contributes to debates on academic capitalism and audit culture. The article adds to literature on neoliberalisation of higher education and describes how the Indian case both resonates with global trends and presents specificities shaped by the sudden expansion of private universities and national rankings.",

Como parte dessa forma mais externa a matemática geralmente aparece como mais um recurso retórico à disposição da teorização. A análise se direciona em três direções: (i) o Teorema de Sonnenschein‑Mantel‑Debreu (SMD), cuja prova pode ser entendida como a impossibilidade lógica de derivar comportamento racional agregado a partir de preferências individuais racionais, e sua consequência na microfundamentação de teorias macroeconômicas, (ii) na Teoria Monetária Moderna (MMT) e (iii) na possibilidade ou não da planificação econômica na sociedade capitalista.

          "authors": "Kenjin B. Chang; Abby Fammartino; Timothy Mateer; Vidita Save; Lori Rosman; Nancy M. Wells",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Research on institutional dining interventions often emphasizes the potential of behavior-change strategies to prime individuals toward healthier, more sustainable diets. While these solutions can be effective in shifting diner behavior, their ability to contribute to larger food systems transformation ultimately depends on how likely prospective implementers are to adopt and maintain them. With a focus on university foodservice, we explore the role of intervention acceptability in institutional dining research by identifying the indicators used to evaluate this dimension of intervention performance and examining how their incorporation aligns with the values of decision-making stakeholders.\nMethods: We conducted a scoping review to identify the metrics used to measure the acceptability of institutional dining interventions. After thematically arranging these metrics into indicator groups, we calculated the frequency with which individual acceptability indicators were reported and then asked foodservice stakeholders to rank those indicators based on relative importance. \nResults: From the 116 included studies, we identified eight acceptability indicators evaluating the impacts of institutional dining interventions on (1) diner experience, (2) dietary health, (3) dietary sustainability, (4) food prices, (5) operating costs, (6) staff satisfaction, (7) institutional sustainability, and (8) organizational culture. While most studies included some metric of intervention acceptability, the frequency with which individual acceptability indicators were reported varied by theme, with more studies evaluating changes in organizational culture than all other indicators combined. However, the frequency with which acceptability indicators were reported was not predictive of how indicators were perceived by decision-making stakeholders. Rather, seldom-reported themes, like diner experience, were rated as more important while frequently reported themes, like organizational culture, were rated as less important.\nDiscussion: Efforts to align institutional dining research with the goals of foodservice stakeholders are needed to scale these solutions across institutions. Our findings demonstrate how current evaluation approaches fail to consistently represent the priorities of the decision makers responsible for managing foodservice change. To accelerate the adoption of institutional dining interventions, institutional dining research must move beyond assessing changes in food choice alone and recruit evaluation frameworks that consider the indicators of intervention acceptability prospective implementers care about.",

          "abstract": "Transgender individuals who do their gender in ways that allow them to pass as cisgender (i.e., who appear to others to be 'not trans') are theorised to hold a 'passing privilege'. Using matched survey and register data on the population of transgender individuals who have changed their legal sex in Denmark, we investigate the relationship between passing and outcomes related to mental health, social life, and education and the labour market. Our findings confirm that higher levels of passing are associated with increasingly favourable outcomes across all domains. Individuals who pass to a high degree report less life dissatisfaction, fewer suicidal thoughts, less social isolation, and fewer difficulties in daily life settings. Higher passing is also associated with substantial educational and labour market advantages, including increased employment rates, particularly for trans men. While trans men and trans women place similar importance on passing, and often face similar privilege increments when passing to a higher degree, trans men are much more likely to pass at high levels and thus to enjoy the privileges associated with passing.",

          "abstract": "This paper provides a methodological contribution to the study of historical income inequality by examining the construction and use of social tables for the nineteenth century. In a period when modern household surveys were absent, social tables represent one of the only feasible approaches for providing distributional evidence for the entire population. At the same time, existing studies rely on a wide range of assumptions, classifications, and data treatments, which makes comparisons across countries and over time difficult. The paper reviews the main methodological challenges involved in constructing social tables, including class definitions, within-group inequality, units of analysis, and the external validation of income levels and subsistence benchmarks. Using simulations and historical examples, it shows how alternative methodological choices can generate substantial differences in inequality estimates. It finally proposes a set of guiding principles and template structures aimed at improving comparability, while still preserving the country-specific nature of historical evidence.

          "abstract": "Population-level research on intersex individuals has been impeded by the difficulty of identifying this population in large-scale data. In this paper, we develop a novel strategy for identifying intersex individuals using ICD-10 diagnostic codes in population-wide health registers. Applying this approach to Danish data spanning 1994-2022, we provide the first population-level examination of the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders in the intersex population. We identify intersex traits in 1.6% of the Danish population - rising to 2.5% among the 1994-2022 birth cohorts, for whom diagnostic data cover the entirety of their lives. We disaggregate the intersex population into six subgroups based on the type of intersex-related diagnoses and examine the risk of fourteen clusters of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. Across all subgroups, the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders is substantially elevated relative to the endosex population, although specific risk profiles vary: some subgroups show broad elevations across disorder categories, whilst others exhibit more selective patterns. These patterns persist after controlling for age and assigned sex, as well as after the inclusion of sibling fixed effects. Our findings highlight the need for mental health support tailored to individuals with intersex traits. Our ICD-based identification strategy addresses longstanding methodological barriers to intersex research and offers a replicable approach for population-level research beyond mental health and across contexts with comparable health data.",

Although this proposition is ideal to expect, in practice, more precisely in the developing countries like Bangladesh, where the job opportunities are scarce, only a handful of organizations can afford or have the strategic objective to implement career development policies for its employees.

This paper argues that such narratives create a neglected externality: by emphasizing individual effort and downplaying structural constraints, they shift poverty explanations toward personal blame and fuel aporophobia—aversion toward the poor—and related exclusionary attitudes. A conceptual framework links aporophobia to contractualist ideas of reciprocity and social membership, and a simple belief‑formation model formalizes the mechanism. Using cross‑country data from the World Values Survey and a U.S. experiment, the study shows that stronger meritocratic beliefs correlate with attributing poverty to laziness and with harsher attitudes toward immigrants. A luck‑focused informational prime produces varied behavioral responses in a dictator game and interacts with meritocratic beliefs in shaping sensitivity to need. The findings underscore how narratives shape deservingness and suggest that reducing poverty requires challenging the normative assumptions embedded in meritocratic framings.",

          "abstract": "Ethnic conflicts are a major threat to global peace and security and have historically caused immense human suffering. To explain ethnic conflict, research has identified ethnic power relations (EPR) as particularly relevant. Accordingly, ethnic conflicts are the result of competing ethno-nationalist claims to state power. If politically relevant ethnic groups are not appropriately represented in the government, they are likely to develop grievances and in turn mobilize for rebellion. Research on ethnic power relations has evolved into a comprehensive research field, which led to the creation of numerous datasets, aggregated into the EPR-data family. The paper advances empirical research on ethnic power relations by providing new data, which allows more fine-grained and dynamic conceptualization and measurement of the phenomenon. I introduce the Ethnic Composition of African Governments (ECAG) dataset, which provides individual-level data on the ethnic affiliation of more than 11,000 ministers. It includes 37 African countries each covered monthly from independence until December 2019. The paper illustrates how the data can be used to compute measures of (proportional) representation of ethnic groups and highlights crucial differences to the established EPR-data family, which relies on expert evaluation of ethnic group’s access to state power. Additionally, I provide a case study of how ethnic power-relations influenced the outbreak of the Tigray war in Ethiopia, highlighting the issue of token representation.",

          "abstract": "Research on migrant perinatal outcomes has much focused on how and why migration protects against unhealthy low birth weights, often overlooking the emerging risk of fetal macrosomia among immigrant populations. We propose a multi-sited, life-course framework that links early-life exposure to nutritional deprivation in mothers' countries of origin to perinatal outcomes in destination. Using unconditional quantile regression on Spanish birth registry microdata linked with historical FAO nutritional series, we reveal a dual pattern: immigrant status confers protection at the lower tail of the birthweight distribution but predicts excessive growth at the upper tail. To explain this paradox, we test competitive nutritional mechanisms. We find that adjusting for historical caloric availability yields null results, ruling out simple energy-deficit hypotheses. In contrast, adjusting for the scarcity of key macronutrients—specifically Fats and proteins—attenuates the macrosomia risk by nearly 80% at the 95th percentile. This validates a qualitative nutritional mismatch mechanism: metabolic efficiency programmed by early lipid scarcity becomes maladaptive in the obesogenic destination environment. Heterogeneity analyses confirm that this mechanism is specific to populations undergoing drastic lipid transitions such as Latin Americans, highlighting the enduring biological legacy of origin-country nutritional ecologies.",

Here we draw on the history of social movements, the social science of collective action, and our experience in the climate movement to make concrete suggestions for increasing climate mobilization. While moral motivations are important for some participants, they have proven inadequate; here we urge a focus on people’s immediate material interests. We build upon recent proposals to center “transformative adaptation”. Unlike shallower forms of climate adaptation, transformative adaptation involves major changes to social and economic relations. We argue that campaigns for transformative adaptation could grow climate mobilization because they can accomplish five goals at once: deliver direct material benefits, appeal to a politically diverse public, foster democratic and equitable institutions, increase climate resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

          "abstract": "This article challenges dominant views that partisanship informs the formation of social relationships and that ordinary Republicans and Democrats loathe each other. Evidence for these claims generally comes from studies in which respondents reject fictitious out-partisans. However, in most encounters, partisanship is often invisible, or ambiguous, and few people care about it. Using an original survey module, we show that only 15 percent of respondents know the partisanship of a recently met acquaintance, and few consider it important. Selection experiments further show that preferences for co-workers, neighbors, and recreational partners are barely shaped by politics: when partisanship is invisible, people seldom seek it out. Only when presented with explicit information about partisanship -- which is rare in everyday life -- do partisan preferences emerge. These results temper concerns about widespread out-partisan avoidance, and reveal limitations of survey experiments. While partisan labels evoke hostility, actual out-partisans seldom do.",

          "abstract": "The occupational aspirations young people hold steer their educational decisions and guide their labor market trajectories, thereby channeling them into aspiration-specific socioeconomic pathways. They have long been understood as central in the intergenerational transmission of (dis)advantage. Yet aspirations on the level of detailed occupations, and their dependence on parental occupations, have received little attention. This is because conventional accounts treat aspiration formation as rank-seeking, suggesting that adolescents seek status or prestige as a function of parental standing, with higher parental positions resulting in adolescents aspiring higher. Using recent data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) and recent advances in the statistical modelling of network-type data, we show that aspirations are more than abstract socioeconomic ambition; they are distinctly role-seeking, with adolescents aspiring to specific occupations. Young people envision their future work lives in terms of explicit jobs and occupational roles. These occupationally anchored aspirations vary systematically with parental occupations, and this variation exists far beyond occupational ranks. Focusing on the occupation-to-occupation links between parents and children reveals a stronger intergenerational link than previously recognized, indicates aspiration formation to be more stratified than conventionally assumed, and opens new avenues for understanding the intergenerational transmission of inequality.",

This paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding these\nphenomena through the lens of active inference and the free energy principle. We argue that\nprospect theory's central features are consistent with computationally efficient solutions to decisionmaking\nunder uncertainty within the thermodynamic constraints of neural computation. Loss\naversion implements adaptive precision-weighting of prediction errors, allocating greater\ncomputational resources to negative deviations that threaten survival. Reference dependence\nimplements efficient predictive coding, transmitting only surprising deviations from expectations.\nProbability weighting reflects optimal precision allocation across the probability range when\nmaintaining full Bayesian representations would exceed metabolic budgets. This framework is\nsupported by converging evidence: neuroimaging studies show unified value coding with\nasymmetric precision for losses; pharmacological manipulations reveal dissociable neurotransmitter\nsystems for value encoding versus loss sensitivity; and metabolic manipulations including hypoxia,\nglucose depletion, and circadian mismatch modulate prospect theory parameters in predicted\ndirections. Developmental evidence shows that children display probability weighting patterns\nopposite to adults, with gradual transformation through experience pointing at calibration rather\nthan to genetic determination. We propose that prospect theory patterns reflect how biological\nsystems navigate uncertainty under fundamental energetic constraints, with implications for\nunderstanding decision-making architecture and reconceptualizing rationality.",

Through in-depth interviews and document analysis we explore PSMF translation in six cases, revealing three distinct “PSMF translation” approaches: Responsive, Proactive and Mediative. These categories demonstrate senior leaders are intentional actors who rework private sector logic to fit functional nonprofit needs, bridging the dual demands for commercial efficiency and social impact.

Through advertisements, slogans, in-house incentive programs and company policies, the Company has achieved what could be described as a shift in employee attitudes towards working using video mediated communication channels – so-called video meetings. The shift is however, far from comprehensive and this consciously constructed understanding of video-mediated communication co-exists and conflicts with multiple other meanings both explicit, implicit and purposefully ignored.

          "authors": "Mario Cardano",
          "abstract": "The paper reflects on the use of the evidential paradigm in ethnographic research. Ethnography, and social research more broadly, must address the invisibility of action's meaning and the definitions of situation. For accessing these \"internal states\"—beliefs, meanings, values—a semiotic orientation toward reading traces, signs, clues, and minor details is essential. The specificity of this reading practice emerges through comparison with medical diagnosis, revealing a critical difference: unlike patients who collaborate in diagnosis, research participants deploy dissimulation and simulation as self-protection. Drawing on Becker's insight that participants orient performances toward more consequential audiences (superiors, peers) rather than ethnographers, and Anteby's analysis of resistance strategies, the paper demonstrates how the evidential paradigm addresses this opacity through attention to \"expressions given off\" and unwitting testimonies. The paper subsumes the evidential paradigm under abductive logic, thereby addressing Ginzburg's ostensible resistance to this framing. Ethnographic fieldwork becomes the theatre where evidential paradigm and abductive inference operate together. Following Peirce's classical definition, enriched by Walton and Eco's contributions, the paper adopts Eco's distinction of three abductive types: overcoded, undercoded, and creative. Each type is illustrated through Sherlock Holmes' adventures—Ginzburg's exemplar of the evidential paradigm—and through the author's ethnographic studies on nature sacralization in Italian communities and childhood vaccine hesitancy across seven European countries. The paper concludes that the evidential paradigm guides the ethnographer's gaze toward marginal details and unwitting testimonies that trigger abductive reasoning—the core engine of ethnographic practice.\nKeywords: Evidential paradigm, Ethnography, Abductive reasoning\nForthcoming in Sociologica vol. 20, num. 1, 2026",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Despite growing evidence that Not in Employment, Education or Training youth (NEETs) are a heterogeneous population with diverse risks and resources, policy, research and practice have often treated them as a uniform group. Grounded in a life-course and developmental perspective, this study explores the heterogeneity within a group of Portuguese NEETs with three main objectives: (i) to characterise the psychological functioning of NEETs; (ii) to identify distinct psychological profiles; and (iii) to examine how these profiles relate to other variables with well-being and mental health.\nMethod: A sample of 241 NEETs (18-29 years) from the Porto Metropolitan Area completed standardised measures of stress, quality of life, perceived social support, resilience, and behavioural problems. \nResults: A cluster analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Psychologically Adaptive (34.0%), Moderately Vulnerable (46.5%), and Psychosocially Vulnerable (19.5%). These groups differed significantly across all psychological variables, while age and time in NEET status were not distinguishing factors. Gender, educational attainment, and involvement in the justice system emerged as key differentiating factors. \nConclusion: Findings support the view that NEETs are not a psychologically homogeneous group, highlighting the cumulative effects of disadvantage and the protective role of psychosocial resources. Unpacking this heterogeneity provides new insights for research and strengthens the design of more tailored, developmentally sensitive interventions and policies.",

          "authors": "Alec Cali",
          "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy is often characterized as a lack of scientific literacy or as a consequence of anti-scientific thinking. To expand beyond the scope of these individual-level explanations, this article undertakes a more comprehensive examination of hesitancy as a rational response to the confluence of two factors: first the hegemonic ideology of neoliberal health, and second perceptions of diminished institutional reliability. The present study draws on focus groups conducted after the height of the COVD-19 pandemic to investigate the political and economic logics underpinning vaccine refusal. The analysis indicates that participants employ a sophisticated understanding of the health system and political economic beliefs when determining the reliability of individuals and the health decisions to be made. Participants cited the opioid crisis, the revolving door, and perceived disenfranchisement as evidence that public health is undermined by \"elite capture\" and corporate profiteering. It is argued that these perspectives align with prevailing neoliberal ideologies, culminating in the emergence of a \"biological consumer patient.\" This study posits that vaccine hesitancy functions not merely as anti-scientific refusal but as a strategic navigation technique through a healthcare system defined by neoliberal responsibilization and perceived institutional failure.",

          "authors": "Xin Hong",
          "abstract": "In April 2024, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) experienced its heaviest rainfall in 75 years, which triggered widespread urban flooding and prolonged disruptions. This study assesses the spatial impact and post-rainfall recovery of the event using the U-Net deep learning architecture on daily PlanetScope satellite imagery captured on a pre-rainfall date and on a series of post-rainfall dates between 14 and 27 April 2024. Multi-temporal land use and land cover (LULC) classifications were generated using a U-Net model trained via transfer learning, and the LULC categories were water, vegetation, built area, and bare ground. The multi-temporal LULC classifications were further applied for change detection analyses to map flooded areas and track temporal recovery across LULC categories. The U-Net model for LULC classification achieved over 95% overall accuracy and a Kappa statistic of 0.927. The change detection and inundation recovery showed that approximately 23.8 km² —nearly 10 times the area of Downtown Dubai—was flooded. The flood affected the built area and bare ground most, while vegetation exhibited higher flood resilience. Although rainfall ended by April 17, 95% of flooded areas remained submerged three days later, and 37% were still underwater by day ten. These findings reveal the limitations of urban drainage systems in Dubai and the value of high-temporal remote sensing and deep learning for flood monitoring. This study offers a practical and replicable framework to support urban flood risk assessment, resilience planning, and climate adaptation in the Persian Gulf region, characterized by rapid urbanization and fragile arid environments similar to Dubai.",

          "abstract": "In any product whose evaluation involves taste factors, subjectivity is a determining factor. For this reason, a rating or evaluation system is sometimes proposed to help potential consumers navigate different decision-making alternatives. In recent decades, the wine sector has been characterized by the use of ratings issued by specialized critics. This access channel serves as a means of knowledge for potential customers who have not physically seen the product and who, upon seeing the ratings received by these critics, see them as an influential factor in their final decision-making. Making a decision based on the numerical rating given by a wine reviewer after tasting a wine, where the wine is awarded the maximum score (100 points), can have a positive influence on the consumer's decision. However, not all critics, and consequently their ratings, have the same relevance to the final buyer. This work designed a methodology and proposed a formulation that objectively assesses the real influence of a wine's highest rating by a critic, based on its increased online visibility, search volume, and references in digital media. Several indicators were designed to compare the influence of different critics' scores over a time horizon of one to four weeks after a wine received its highest rating. The study examined whether the highest rating awarded by a specialized wine reviewer has the same impact in all cases or whether it depends on the critic. It also determined the duration of its influence over time.",

Using longitudinal bibliometric data from Scopus covering more than 32 million researchers, this study provides a global assessment of how the pandemic disrupted international researcher mobility between 2020 and 2022. Pandemic-related “lost mobility” is estimated using counterfactual trend extrapolation based on pre-2020 trajectories. International researcher mobility fell short of expected levels by an estimated 14,703 movements (±2,791), corresponding to a 3.7% loss. Although observed mobility rebounded by 2022, it remained below counterfactual trends. Effects varied widely across countries and were asymmetric: losses in incoming mobility were strongly associated with destination-country COVID-19 policy stringency and political regime type, whereas outgoing mobility showed no comparable relationship. These findings underscore the institutionally mediated nature of scientific mobility during global crises.",

          "abstract": "Educational inequalities in childlessness have grown across cohorts. It remains unclear to what extent this development was driven by a decline in resources and abilities in groups with low education. Using high-quality Norwegian population registers (n=683,882 men born 1963-1991), we find that increasing educational inequalities in childlessness are mirrored by growing educational gaps in employment participation and income. Educational groups have diverged on resources (parental income rank) but converged on abilities (relative cognitive ability). Regression models show that changes in the composition of educational groups in terms of parental income explain 6%-7% of the growth in educational gaps in childlessness, employment participation and income. In contrast, gaps in life outcomes would have grown more than observed had educational groups not converged on cognitive abilities. We conclude that relative education-specific changes in financial resources and cognitive abilities explain little, if any, of the growing educational inequalities in the life outcomes studied.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nMedical Data Integration Centers (DIZ) have been established at German university hospitals to collect, transfer, consolidate, and process routine clinical data and make it available for health research. Consideration of sex and gender benefits research and enhances the quality of medical care. We therefore argue that DIZ staff members need to be well-informed and knowledgeable about sex and gender aspects in clinical data. Only then they can inform about research quality gain and advise researchers on thoughtful selection of study cohorts, appropriate encoding of sex and gender information, and the benefits of considering gender distributions.\n\nObjective: \nThis work systematically analyzes the awareness of sex and gender among technical and scientific staff members at DIZ. The  survey will guide  future recommendations for handling sex and gender aspects in clinical research. \n\nMethods: \nUsing an online survey, we assess how  knowledgeable DIZ staff currently are regarding sex, gender and gender scores. The survey  was distributed in February 2024 to all 38 DIZ in Germany via a national mailing list. It was structured into three topics: (1) perception of  sex and gender in medical research, (2) consideration of sex and gender during data collection, and (3) consideration of sex and gender in data use and reuse. We analyzed the collected data with descriptive statistics and checked for correlation within the dataset.\n\nResults: \nAfter a four-week response period, 74 current employees had fully completed the questionnaire and an additional 62 had partially completed it. The survey results show a lack of knowledge and awareness regarding sex and gender aspects among DIZ employees indicated by a high amount of ``No\" and ``I don't know\" answers, specifically regarding sex- and gender-specific training, official recommendations, and team policies.\n\nConclusion: \nAs essential links between clinics and researchers, DIZ employees need targeted training on sex and gender aspects to better support and advise research efforts. We provide first recommendations for the different levels of administration to improve knowledge and awareness of sex and gender aspects in medical research data.",

The study reveals that\nwomen demonstrate significantly higher interest and participation in IRGY than men, especially\nthose engaged in housework/ casual wage work. A central benefit of IRGY for women lies in its\nrole in easing their entry or return to the labor market through flexible and locally available\nemployment provided by the government. In a context where female labor force participation has\nhistorically remained low, the paper shows how access to public employment can facilitate\nwomen’s participation in the labour force, expanding the pool of working women, not just\nredistributing work among those already employed, making IRGY a novel intervention in urban\nemployment policy.",

          "authors": "alessandro maresca",
          "abstract": "Contemporary climate governance is saturated with ethical language: intergenerational justice, the rights of future generations, planetary survival. Yet when one examines the instruments through which this governance is being assembled—green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, collateral frameworks—one finds a different register of obligation. This article distinguishes ethics, the universalising horizon that legitimates green finance, from morality, the obligations encoded in the exchange-forms of loans, bonds, and repo collateral—covenants, eligibility criteria, step-ups, verification protocols. Drawing on Strathern's relational anthropology, it analyses these instruments as devices that perform successive cuts: operations that sever ecological relations from their context, exteriorise obligations into detachable rights, and eclipse the conditions of their production. Each cut—from loan to bond to asset-backed security to repo collateral—reassigns responsibility from situated relations to increasingly impersonal infrastructures of circulation. With Guyer, the article tracks the temporalities these instruments enact: how coupon calendars, taxonomy reviews, and collateral eligibility compress planetary futures into sequences of near-term obligations—overnight rolls, quarterly reviews, annual KPIs—privileging continuous liquidity over thick, extended commitments. Drawing on Karatani's theory of exchange-forms, the analysis reads this trajectory as a rearticulation of the capital–nation–state complex at planetary scale, asking whether green finance opens toward new forms of association or remains enclosed within the inherited trinity. The apocalyptic register of climate discourse—tipping points, runaway warming, the end of the world—is taken seriously through de Martino's distinction between apocalypse with and without eschaton. Green finance, the article argues, stages a controlled apocalypse without eschaton: existential threats are converted into review cycles, covenants, and term sheets, while the decisive moment of world-refoundation is continually deferred. If a climate constitution is being written, it is being written in the moral language of eligibility, seniority, and pledgeability—under the ethical sign of planetary survival.",

          "authors": "Vishesh Leon Diengdoh",
          "abstract": "Multi-level governance (MLG) emphasises the importance of subnational institutions and actors in climate governance. From an MLG perspective, state legislatures and legislators in India represent potentially important but empirically underexamined sites of climate governance, given their roles in articulating local concerns, exercising policy oversight, and holding executive actors accountable. This study provides the first systematic synthesis of climate-related legislative discourse in India by examining over three decades (1993–2025) of legislative questions from the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly. Using a public corpus of 9,522 questions retrieved from the National eVidhan Application (NeVA) portal, the study applies an iteratively developed keyword-based annotation approach to distinguish between explicit climate discourse and implicit climate-relevant engagement. The findings show that explicit references to climate change are exceedingly rare, accounting for 0.06% of all legislative questions, consistent with the limited formal integration of state legislatures within India’s climate governance framework. In contrast, legislators frequently engage with climate-relevant sectors such as coal, flood, forests, and irrigation, framing these issues primarily through administrative and financial concerns rather than through climate change narratives. This pattern highlights the unrealised potential of subnational legislatures as sites of climate governance. By focusing on legislative attention and discourse, this study contributes new empirical evidence on subnational climate governance in the Global South and highlights opportunities for mainstreaming climate-change discourse within legislative processes.",

With the growing potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to reshape library collections, services, and workflows, public libraries must determine how to engage with these technologies while maintaining longstanding library values. Despite widespread discussion of AI’s impact on public libraries, to our knowledge there exists no published analysis of American and Canadian public library AI policies to date. In this paper, we address this gap first through an environmental scan of public library websites to identify publicly available AI policy statements. We then analyze these policy statements according to how they include library values. In our scan of over 200 library websites, we identified just 16 publicly available AI policies. ese policies all govern internal or staff usage rather than patron usage. All policies reference at least two library values, with privacy and security the most frequently cited.",

Cognitive dissonance occurs when people face situations that do not confirm their expectations.

This argumentative study compares dissonance and dissociation using a critical realist and argumentative research process using publicly available information and scholarly literature. Using the confronting coercive WT model to illuminate these concerns, we argue that dissociation is a response recorded in the design of these WT practices and participant statements and is often mistaken for dissonance. Deliberate use of forced cognitive dissonance during involuntary treatments aligns with the conditions that may cause dissociation. Therefore, planning to enforce cognitive dissonance during WT is likely to be harmful and, given this potential, may be regarded as malpractice.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the evolution of urban imaginaries and their influence on infrastructure design, focusing on Japan as a case study. The futuristic visions of the 1970s, illustrated by Gunther Radtke and groups such as Archigram, celebrated speed, growth, and technology. By contrast, the ecological, economic, and social crises of the 21st century have fostered imaginaries centered on sobriety, resilience, and inclusivity. These shifts raise key questions: how can we reconcile past legacies with present challenges, and how can infrastructures anticipate the needs of a changing world?\nJapan, marked by demographic decline yet persistent large-scale technological projects, offers a privileged lens. Campaigns to dismantle obsolete infrastructures in rural areas show pragmatic adaptation, while the SCMaglev train embodies faith in technological progress. These tensions echo broader debates opposing advocates of ecological degrowth to defenders of modernization.\nThrough case studies on mobility, energy, and ecological infrastructures, the article shows how imaginaries shape design choices. It highlights the challenges and opportunities of transition toward sustainable and resilient models, stressing the importance of inclusive, transdisciplinary dialogue to define the values and priorities guiding future infrastructures in an uncertain world.",

          "abstract": "Formal early childcare has a strong equalizing potential, yet access remains socioeconomically stratified. This study examines how these socioeconomic inequalities emerge and widen across three stages of the formal early childcare access process: intention to use early childcare during pregnancy, application, and actual access during the child’s first year. Using longitudinal data on approximately 2,000 families in France, collected during pregnancy and followed one year after birth, we document a progressive widening of gaps along the access pathway. Compared with high–socioeconomic status (SES) households, low–SES households are about 18% less likely to intend to use early childcare, 25% less likely to apply, and 46% less likely to obtain access. To identify the determinants of these gaps, we combine machine learning for variable selection with decomposition analyses that quantify the contribution of observable factors at each stage across a wide range of 39 predictors. At the intention stage, most of the SES gap is accounted for by differences in observable characteristics related to resources, constraints, and available alternatives, with norms contributing little. At subsequent stages, inequalities increasingly reflect institutional barriers. The largest disparities emerge at the access stage, where spot allocation-related factors favoring higher-income, working, and earlier-applying households, and knowledge of the childcare system, account for most of the gap. Overall, the results show that socioeconomic stratification in early childcare access is closely linked to the timing and design of access processes, even in systems intended to be universal.",

          "abstract": "While workplace networks shape employees’ perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, prior research has primarily emphasized organizational and leadership-related factors. This study adopts an egocentric network perspective to explore how employees’ workplace network characteristics—such as network size, relationship closeness, multiplex ties, and employee-organization relationship (EOR) norms—are associated with their organizational identification, well-being, and intentions to leave, within both advice and friendship networks. The findings reveal the nuanced patterns in these associations across the two network types. A larger friendship network corresponds with higher organizational identification and well-being, whereas the size of an advice network does not show a significant relationship with employee outcomes. Relationship closeness within advice networks is linked to greater organizational identification and well-being, while closeness within friendship networks does not show a significant association. EOR norms within both advice and friendship networks are positively related to employee outcomes. Additionally, the higher proportion of friends in advice networks corresponds with greater well-being and lower turnover intentions, while having supervisors as friends is associated with lower well-being. This research contributes to employee and organizational communication literature by highlighting the relevance of personal network dynamics in understanding employee attitudes and behaviors.",

          "authors": "Aaron Gray",
          "abstract": "Much work in feminist social epistemology shares the basic assumption that ignorance generated by silencing (and related phenomena) is undesirable. While true in many contexts, I depart from that consensus, introducing and offering a philosophical account of a social epistemic practice that I term ‘hushing-up.’ This practice has emerged organically in response and in resistance to sectarian bigotry in Northern Ireland (NI), and contributes to post-conflict transitions away from social and political polarisation and its derivative harms to individuals and collectives. In spaces where hushing-up is deployed, ignorance of peoples’ community background is intentionally cultivated as a strategy in opposition to bigotry, while bigoted or sectarian displays incur social costs. Positioning hushing-up against existing accounts of political ignorance, and contributing to the idea of an epistemology of ignorance, I distinguish between performative partisanship (involving ignorance driven by social rewards for showing group allegiance) and pressured partisanship (involving ignorance driven by the avoidance of social sanctions for displaying indicators of disloyalty to a group). On the account I defend, shifts in social norms are central to addressing some forms of harmful ignorance. I argue that hushing-up succeeds in doing this in two ways: first, by reducing the rationality of pressured partisanship by providing alternative social support to that provided in polarised social spaces such that the cost of dissent is lowered; and secondly, by disincentivising performative partisanship through increasing the difficulty of identifying targets and ensuring that bigoted displays are met with disapproval in spaces where that norm is in force.",

          "abstract": "Employee-organization relationships (EORs) have been widely examined in the scholarship of internal public relations. While previous research has focused on organizational- and leadership-level factors that shape EORs, the influence of employees’ peer networks has not received much attention. Drawing from a social influence perspective, this study examines EORs as a product of normative influence within employees’ instrument and friendship networks—those networks composed of coworkers with whom employees share information or advice and those they consider friends. An egocentric online survey was conducted to examine the effects of EOR norms on employees’ EOR perceptions and how such normative influence is moderated by structural network characteristics (i.e., network size, relationship closeness, and network density). We found that employees’ EOR perceptions were highly consistent with the EORs of their instrument and friendship ties across all dimensions. Moreover, network size and relationship closeness were directly and positively associated with certain dimensions of EORs. Relationship closeness also played a moderator role for some dimensions of EOR. Our research findings suggest the importance of organizations creating a positive relationship environment and dynamics among employees.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in digital technologies create opportunities to support circular economy strategies for mass-produced consumer and industrial goods. Building on the CE-RISE project, this study evaluates how Digital Product Passports (DPPs) and related digital innovations can improve circular outcomes across selected value chains. We combine secondary data analysis of production and trade statistics with a PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence. The empirical scope covers heat pumps, PV panels, printers, ICT equipment, and batteries. We report baseline material flows and circularity indicators for Europe (2010-2023), highlight differences between the EU27 and non-EU Europe (CH/NO/TR), and quantify a DPP scenario with confidence intervals. For the EU27 in 2023, current circularity is 14.8% and the DPP scenario implies 45.0% (95% CI: 28.6-61.4), corresponding to potential savings of 2.5 Mt and EUR 27.9 bn (95% CI: 1.1-3.8 Mt; EUR 12.7-43.1 bn). We also provide a proxy estimate of refurbishment-related employment exposure based on Eurostat production value per employee in NACE J. The paper provides an evidence-informed baseline for estimating DPP-enabled gains and for monitoring future policy impacts.",

          "abstract": "This paper offers a conceptual exploration of urban inertia through the lens of spatial memory, situating the discussion explicitly within architectural and urban planning prac- tice. Drawing on a metaphor derived from a fixed spatial trajectory, the study examines how remembered routes and habitual spatial practices persist despite changing social and environmental conditions. Rather than treating inertia as a social reluctance or planning failure, the paper reframes it as a spatially produced condition embedded in architec- tural form, planning logics, and everyday use. Building on discussions of spatial memory, path dependency, and the social production of space, the paper argues that urban inertia emerges when inherited spatial configurations continue to guide movement and perception beyond their original context. By framing participation as a spatial design instrument, the paper highlights the role of architecture and planning in supporting collective reori- entation. Spatial memory is thus approached not as an obstacle to be erased, but as a condition to be critically reworked through design. Shared as a preprint, this text invites interdisciplinary discussion while remaining grounded in design- and planning-oriented inquiry.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates continuing vocational education and training (CVET) in three institutional contexts: Germany, Sweden, and The United Kingdom. Drawing on the first wave of PIAAC survey data’s unique questions and data availability, we analyse linkages between institutional regimes and socio-economic gradients in CVET participation and barriers to participation including self-reported constraints and lack of intrinsic interest. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that differences in CVET participation reflect educational, labour market, and welfare state institutions. Results show that Sweden’s universal-collectivist regime fosters the highest participation with minimal disparities, while Germany’s corporatist regime shows lower participation and higher stratification. The UK’s liberal-individualist model exhibits moderate participation but sharp socio-economic inequalities, emphasizing financial and employer-related barriers. Resource constraints such as time and money emerge as prominent barriers across institutional contexts. We thus shed light on different skill formation institutions and the differences and similarities in human behaviours and perceptions across them. Our exploratory measurement of interest opens pathways for future research that was not thought possible with existing PIAAC data. These findings contribute to long-term institutional analysis and theory, and inform policy interventions to reduce barriers, increase interest, and support disadvantaged groups.",

This article is the product of a meeting of editors of academic journals across political science, sociology, and communication science to discuss the issue of LLMs in academic publishing. We argue that peer review is an essential and irreplaceably human component of social science: if elements of the research process traditionally done by humans are substituted by AI, humans should increase their involvement with the evaluation of research.  We present a scenario-casting exercise illustrating four possible equilibria for the incorporation of LLMs into the publication ecosystem, and we discuss the various levers that academic journals have at their disposal to navigate the changing landscape.  We emphasize that adaptive policies with built-in evaluation mechanisms, feedback loops, and a capacity for revision are required, along with new streams of metascientific data to remain up to date as AI and its adoption continue to evolve.",

          "abstract": "Despite scientific consensus on the realities of climate change, environmental policy remains among the most contentious issues in the United States Congress. How are local economic realities reflected in political representation amid polarization? Using original data on campaign commitments and legislative activity, we examine whether climate disaster risk and energy-sector composition are associated with greater pro-environmentalism among congressional politicians. We find asymmetric partisan effects. Republicans representing districts with higher baseline vulnerability to climate disasters are more likely to adopt pro-environmental campaign commitments and support pro-environmental legislation in Congress. Democrats from districts with high dependence on carbon-intensive industries for constituent employment are less likely to advocate for pro-environmental policies during campaigns, but they consistently maintain strong pro-environmental legislative records, regardless of district composition. These findings reveal that local economic pressures correspond with some Republicans' support for climate action while Democratic behavior remains largely stable, identifying promising opportunities for cross-party coalition building.",

          "abstract": "The majority of the widely-discussed “sex recession” reflects a symmetric rise in virginity \naffecting both genders equally. A companion paper, however, documented an additional \nasymmetric component: a post-2012 widening of the male-female gap in sexlessness among the \nsexually experienced. This study investigates the distributional mechanism underlying that \nasymmetric gap using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The analysis focuses on \nnever-married, sexually experienced adults aged 25-34—old enough to have accumulated \nmeaningful partner histories, young enough to reflect contemporary market dynamics, and \nrestricted to those actively in the dating market; similar male-specific redistribution appears in \nbroader sexually experienced samples, indicating the pattern is not driven solely by marital \nselection. Among this population, I find a male-specific collapse of the “moderate middle”: the \nshare of men with 3-5 lifetime partners fell from 30.3% to 21.5% (-8.8 percentage points) \nbetween 2006-2010 and 2015-2017. This loss bifurcated: +4.4 pp shifted to the 1-2 category \n(exclusion) and +4.4 pp shifted to 6+ (concentration). Women’s distribution remained stable. \nThe upper tail (10+ partners) actually declined slightly for both genders, suggesting \nconcentration operates specifically in the 6-9 range—not through extreme accumulation. \nBecause this redistribution occurs within the middle of the distribution rather than the extreme \nupper tail, it is poorly captured by standard inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficients) and to \nanalyses focused on top-end accumulation. This distributional pattern—middle collapse rather \nthan upper-tail growth—has gone unrecognized in prior work. The asymmetric gap decomposes \nevenly into exclusion and concentration.",

We asked GPT to evaluate identical startup pitches varying only the founder’s name, shaping gender and race perceptions. Across 26,000 evaluations, GPT did not systematically assign lower scores to underrepresented minorities but avoided ranking them last without increasing winning likelihoods. To explain these patterns, we conducted “Second Opinion” experiments where GPT evaluated pitches alongside inputs simulating human bias. GPT more readily corrected explicit, identity-based bias than bias framed as neutral business critiques, with corrections limited in magnitude. We theorize these findings reflect symbolic compliance: LLMs suppress overt discrimination without substantively altering evaluative logic, allowing inequality to persist in AI-supported strategic evaluations.",

          "authors": "Yeray Barrios-Fleitas; Arend Rensink",
          "abstract": "Research on team diversity increasingly adopts multitype and multidimensional designs, yet the measurement of diversity remains methodologically fragmented. Although existing frameworks distinguish theoretically meaningful diversity types, the indices used to operationalize them are expressed on heterogeneous and non-comparable scales. As a result, researchers face persistent difficulties in interpreting coefficients, comparing diversity between attributes or types, and integrating diversity measures into multivariate, longitudinal, or optimization-based models. To address this limitation, we propose a systematic normalization of multitype team diversity indices. Building directly on Dawson’s measurement framework, we derive the theoretical maximum of each diversity index according to its corresponding assumptions regarding diversity type, attribute scale, and team size. Using these maxima, all indices are rescaled to the unit interval [0-1], preserving their substantive meaning while making them directly comparable. This normalization completes an essential but previously implicit step in multitype diversity measurement and provides a unified, interpretable metric that strengthens the methodological foundations of cumulative research on team diversity.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Recent evidence suggests a substantial temporal change in the traditional U-shaped age-wellbeing relationship in many countries. From a sustainable wellbeing perspective that emphasises intergenerational equity, we examine how wellbeing was reallocated across age groups in 28 OECD countries between 2008 and 2024. \nMethod: We analyse life evaluation (0–10 scale) data from the Gallup World Poll at four anchor years (2008, 2011, 2019, 2024), using country-specific models and two classification approaches (quadratic and confidence-interval-based). We assess cross-national heterogeneity, methodological sensitivity, and sustainable wellbeing implications through age-group reallocation patterns.\nResults: Age-wellbeing profiles varied greatly across countries, with classifications sensitive to functional form, age boundaries, and temporal pooling. We identified five patterns: (1) sustainable (8 countries including Eastern Europe, East Asia, Chile: broad-based gains across all age groups), (2) unsustainable (14 countries across North, Western and Southern Europe, North America, and New Zealand, characterised by early-adulthood decline alongside substantially better outcomes in late adulthood; Spain exemplified the starkest contrast (-1.34 point-change for ages 18-29, and +0.83 for ages 70-79)), (3) no significant age-based reallocation (Turkey, Israel), (4) reverse patterns (United Kingdom, Ireland: late adulthood fared worse than early adulthood), (5) mixed/unique patterns (Australia, Denmark).\nConclusion: Age-wellbeing profile classifications are sensitive to methodological choices, though reallocation patterns provide robust evidence about distributional dynamics. Half the sample showed unsustainable trajectories, raising profound intergenerational equity concerns. Eight countries achieved sustainable, broad-based gains, all starting from low baselines, which suggests that equitable trajectories may be more easily achievable when aggregate wellbeing is improving rather than declining. Addressing unsustainable patterns requires comprehensive policy attention and routine age-disaggregated monitoring.",

The collocation  patterns were analysed in terms of their frequency, syntactic structure, and discourse using a qualitative approach. The findings reveal that verb-noun collocations such as elected pope, pope said, and cardinals held were the most frequent. The findings also reveal that pre-election coverage emphasises suspense  and  secrecy  while  post-election  coverage highlights institutional legitimacy, authority and continuity. Three main themes were also identified including “Papal Identity and Authority”, “Church Governance and Hierarchy” and “Ceremonial and Liturgical Roles”. The findings highlight that collocations are not just grammatical but ideological.

For grave good/feature counts, the app builds on Nørtoft (2022) to estimate exclusivity (here called “prestige”) values of grave goods/features, or other count (hoard/house artefacts) as input in the app’s inequality measurements such as the Gini and Absolute Gini. For physical measures, inequality calculations are based directly on e.g. measured house floor areas. The results are presented in interactive plots, which can be downloaded. The app also features an interactive time atlas and simple and flexible tools to dynamically visualize trends and developments of wealth display and inequality for any drawn area of the atlas, based on results and data submitted by myself and (optionally) by users. Thus, as more people use the app and add their results, archaeologists collectively build an empirical overview of wealth display and inequality through time from multiple complementary modes of wealth expression with potentially global coverage, which can be dynamically combined and visualised in the QuantWealth’s wealth and inequality trendplot.",

          "authors": "Ilona Ogurcova",
          "abstract": "The efficiency and quality of healthcare services increasingly depend on the application of advanced governance, risk management, and control models. Internal audit, when conducted in line with international professional standards, has the potential to act not only as a control mechanism but also as a strategic partner contributing to organizational resilience and value creation. In 2024, The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) introduced the Global Internal Audit Standards, strengthening the emphasis on professionalism, independence, competence, and strategic alignment of the internal audit function across all sectors, including the public healthcare system.\nThis article examines the challenges of applying these global standards within the Lithuanian healthcare sector, focusing on a specific regulatory requirement that mandates medical or health sciences education for the head of internal audit (the so-called internal medical audit). Through a systematic analysis of the Global Internal Audit Standards, national legislation on public sector internal audit, and sector-specific regulations issued by the Ministry of Health, the study identifies a fundamental normative tension between international audit professionalism and sectoral qualification restrictions.\nThe article argues that internal audit effectiveness derives primarily from professional audit competencies, independence, and risk-based methodologies rather than from subject-specific clinical education. Drawing on an analogy with information technology audits, the analysis demonstrates that complex, knowledge-intensive sectors can be audited effectively through professional internal auditors who engage subject matter experts without compromising objectivity. The findings suggest that the current regulatory model risks professional isolation of healthcare auditors, reduced audit value, weakened organizational resilience, and inefficient allocation of scarce healthcare resources.\nThe article concludes that aligning national healthcare audit regulation with the Global Internal Audit Standards would strengthen governance, enhance risk management, and enable internal audit to function as an integral component of professional management and innovation within healthcare institutions.",

Employing the synthetic control method, we create a counterfactual scenario to estimate how Hamburg’s tourism trajectory might have unfolded without the construction of the Elbphilharmonie. Contrasting recent debates highlighting the often underwhelming nature of 'star architecture', our findings indicate that the concert hall has had a major effect on tourism: In the seven and a half years from its opening in January 2017 to the second quarter of 2024, the Elbphilharmonie is estimated to be responsible for 13 million additional overnight stays, despite the period covering the covid pandemic.",

          "authors": "Maria Sironi; elisa tambellini; Bruno Arpino",
          "abstract": "Loneliness poses significant health risks for older adults, comparable to smoking and obesity. While research has examined concurrent factors like partnership status and health conditions, few studies adopt a life course perspective to understand how family histories during adulthood shape loneliness in later life. This study addresses this gap by examining how partnership and parenthood trajectories relate to loneliness among older adults in the UK. Our analyses use prospective cohort data, which allow us to measure variables – including early-life confounders – at multiple phases of the life course, rather than relying on retrospective (and potentially biased) recall. Specifically, using cohort data from the National Child Development Study, we analyze adults born in 1958, employing sequence and cluster analysis to identify typologies of family trajectories, and regression models to assess associations between these trajectories and loneliness outcomes at ages 61-66. Additionally, we explore the role of current social connections in reducing loneliness. By accounting for the interplay of family-life experiences, this research provides novel insights into how the timing and sequencing of family transitions influence emotional well-being in older age, showing that those following less standard trajectories are at higher risk of perceiving loneliness. Current interactions with kins and friends contribute to reduce the negative association between specific family trajectories and loneliness later in life.",

          "abstract": "This paper shows how women’s short-term fertility intentions changed during the unfolding polycrisis between 2020 and 2022 in the Czech Republic and how this change was stratified by education and household income. We describe changes in short-term fertility intentions using predicted probabilities obtained from ordinal logistic regressions of short-term intentions on education level/income quartile over years, while controlling for age, parity, partnership status, and employment status. Data come from the second cycle of the Generations and Gender Survey (GGS-II), wave 1 from the Czech Republic, which was conducted between 2020 and 2022. Short-term fertility intentions declined in most education and income groups between 2020 and 2022. Only among women in the highest income quartile, there is no apparent decline in short-term intentions from 2020 to 2022. Among women with lower education, short-term fertility intentions declined more rapidly than among women with higher education. There apparently is a much stronger demographic resilience among women in the wealthiest households. Resilience among the rich was likely boosted by the tax reform of 2021, which reduced the tax rate of individuals in the highest income quintile by almost 5 % on average, while the tax rate in the lowest quintile dropped only by 2 %. This tax change could have weakened the sensitivity of the richest individuals to the unfolding polycrisis.",

          "abstract": "Rising political violence and affective polarization pose a pressing threat to democratic stability, challenging classic theories of state formation that emphasize the state’s monopoly on legitimate force. Reducing citizen support for violence against politicians is therefore crucial to safeguard democratic institutions. To examine how this can be addressed, we use two pre-registered survey experiments in France and Belgium that manipulate politician characteristics (gender, age, and party) and violence’s severity. We find that extreme violent attitudes remain rare, although support for verbal abuse online is substantial. Importantly, our results reveal that such attitudes are  largely unrelated to affective polarization. We then show that simple interventions (humanizing politicians through perspective-taking or stressing the importance of ideological pluralism for democracy) reduce support for political violence. These findings suggest that protecting institutions requires addressing underlying societal predispositions by promoting empathy and reinforcing norms of political tolerance.",

Second, we test the polygenic prediction of psychiatric diagnoses and psychotropic medication use applying the recently developed phenotype differences model, which estimates direct genetic effects free from environmental confounding and requires genotyping of only one sibling. Third, we assess whether the relationship between polygenic risk and mental illness varies by parental education. \nGroup differences in the PGSs were minimal. In within-family analyses, we found direct genetic effects in 7 of 12 outcome-PGS combinations. Results are contrasted with between-family analyses of unrelated individuals. Evidence that parental education moderates polygenic risk was weak and did not hold up under stringent statistical tests, highlighting challenges detecting gene-environment interactions in mental illness.",

Teachers describe a noticeable shift around 2022, coinciding with the rising visibility and popularity of the manosphere, when some boys’ misogyny became more explicit, emboldened, and unchecked. Building on Moloney and Love’s (2018) work on ‘virtual manhood acts’ (VMAs), we determine five normative manhood acts now visible offline: (1) backlash misogyny; (2) homosocial harassment; (3) humour-as-baiting; (4) sexualisation of women; and (5) disinvestment in schooling. Highlighting the inextricable relationship between online misogyny and gendered power dynamics in physical educational settings, we underscore how certain boys’ increasing disregard for consequences reflects a renewed model of masculinity rooted in backlash politics, manosphere ideologies, and a broader far-right, anti-establishment orientation toward selfhood, community, and society.",

A longitudinal survey was conducted five times between May and November 2025, and data from 153 domestic students were analyzed. The cultural influence of buildings was estimated using intraclass correlation coeﬃcients (ICC) derived from linear mixed-eﬀects models. The overall ICC was 0.075 (95% CI: [0.000, 0.258]), indicating that approximately 7.5% of response variance was explained by building diﬀerences. For “willingness to participate in dormitory events,” ICC reached 0.279 (p&lt;0.001). Analysis of cultural similarity among new residents in co-ed buildings revealed no significant diﬀerence between similarity to same-sex seniors (95.1%) and opposite-sex seniors (95.7%; p = 0.160). However, co-ed buildings showed significantly lower event participation willingness compared to single-sex buildings (p&lt;0.05).",

          "abstract": "Students in compulsory education spend a considerable amount of time in the classroom interacting with peers and teachers, from whom they receive feedback and signals about their academic competencies. We develop a theoretical framework that integrates the role of teachers’ evaluations, the labeling effect, the categorical judgements model, the big-fish-in-little-pond, and the rational choice theory for understanding categorical inequalities generated within the school environment induced by classroom peer comparison. We argue that teachers, via attributing marks to students, create Teacher-Induced Student Hierarchy (TISH), and the perception of one’s position in this hierarchy affects\nsubsequent educational outcomes, but heterogeneously depending on students’ ascriptive characteristics. We exploit the idiosyncratic variation generated by differential teachers' grading standards across classrooms to identify the effect of TISH. The relative student's position in the classroom hierarchy, net of her absolute performance level, raises the probability of enrolling in the academic track, the expectation of university enrolment, and levels of academic competencies. We observed that boys and students from lower SES backgrounds, who typically have weaker academic standings, are more responsive to their placement in the TISH. Some of these effects seem to stem from the influence of TISH on some socio-emotional skills.",

          "abstract": "A longstanding debate in research on peer effects concerns whether exposure to high-achieving classmates enhances or depresses students’ academic performance. While normative models emphasize positive spillovers, social comparison theories highlight negative contrast effects, and empirical evidence remains mixed. Moreover, it is unclear whether peer effects operate similarly across institutional contexts. This study addresses these issues through a comparative analysis of Italy and Norway, two educational systems that differ markedly in competitiveness, tracking, evaluation practices, and gender norms. Using harmonized, population-wide administrative register data, we follow three full student cohorts from Grade 5 to Grade 8. This longitudinal design allows us to control for prior achievement—an advantage unavailable in international assessments such as PISA, TIMSS, or PIRLS. We estimate value-added school fixed-effects models that exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in peer composition. Across both countries, higher average peer achievement is associated with lower individual performance, consistent with social comparison mechanisms. Exposure to top-performing peers has negative effects, while exposure to low-performing peers has positive effects. These patterns are similar across countries and do not vary systematically by gender, suggesting that peer comparison processes are remarkably stable across institutional contexts.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation is often framed as marginally important to addressing climate change, and as socio-technically difficult and ineffectual. We combine theoretical and empirical analyses to show that adaptation—especially via economic development—is actually often the dominant driver of climate-sensitive societal outcomes, especially on smaller space and time scales. This aligns adaptation with markets and governance incentives. For these reasons, widely studied climate-sensitive outcomes such as crop yields, affluence, and damage and death rates from climate-related hazards have broadly and steadily improved over the past several decades, as have indirectly climate-sensitive outcomes such as mortality from violence and self-harm. These improvements provide important context to recent pessimistic studies of adaptation that focus on outcomes’ marginal sensitivities to climate. They also underscore the importance of economic development to human well-being, and they suggest that economically costly climate policies could harm climate-sensitive outcomes. Moreover, we show that the range of plausible greenhouse gas emissions scenarios has narrowed, providing greater clarity to the temperatures and types of impacts society must adapt to. Our analyses highlight where adaptation and development are currently underappreciated in climate change research and policy.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the African Cabinet Politics (ACP) dataset, a new comprehensive data collection on cabinet politics in Sub-Saharan Africa. The dataset covers 40 countries from their independence to the end of 2019 and provides monthly information on cabinet composition, ministerial appointments, dismissals, rearrangements, and individual ministers’ tenure in office. Offering comprehensive geographical and fine-grained temporal coverage as well as a Wikidata integration that provides extensive minister-level biographical information, the ACP dataset substantially extends existing data resources on cabinet politics. The paper illustrates the analytical value of the dataset through descriptive analyses and two empirical applications. First, it documents long-term trends in cabinet size and cabinet instability, showing a steady expansion of cabinets and volatility in cabinet changes over time. Second, it examines how political regimes affect the tenure of ministers, demonstrating that dominant-party regimes exhibit the most stable cabinets, while personalist dictatorships are characterized by high turnover, with military regimes and democracies displaying similar patterns. A further application revisits the evolution of female representation in African cabinets, showing distinct trajectories for democracies and autocracies that converge over time. Accordingly, the ACP dataset provides gives scholars a new opportunity to test and refine theories of elite management and executive governance in Africa.",

Contributing to levelling this understanding beyond Western liberal media spaces, the paper provides a panoramic snapshot of the state of public service fact-checking in the controlled media spaces of Southeast Asia (SEA): 31 qualitative interviews were conducted with fact-checkers and media professionals after the January 2025 US government turnaround on then existing foreign development programmes and while two major US Big Tech sponsors were reviewing their commitments to fact-checking. What stands out upon characterising the regional fact-checking movement, is the standardly accounted-for magnitude of this—until then—predominantly US-Euro pro-democracy and corporate support. That the regional free press and digital rights activist space has acted as the birthplace of the regional fact-checking movement is however often overshadowed. This misproportion supports the tacit but flawed assumption that fact-checking in SEA is a copy of the US newsroom model of fact-checking. In turn, this assumption, firstly, eclipses the regional movement’s foundational interest in safeguarding collective memory alongside its interest in countering populist politics, secondly, befogs a movement piggybacked by corporate interests, thirdly, fails to account for a fact-checking culture not originally centred around data for building quantitative objective truth.",

Using a balanced panel of county-level crime data spanning 1980–2020, this paper estimates the short- and long-run effects of hurricanes of varying intensities that affected U.S. counties between 1990 and 2010. Findings indicate that while minor hurricanes have little effect on crime, major hurricanes cause significant increases in property crime. In the decade following exposure to major hurricanes, property crime rates rise by 8.5% relative to the baseline mean, imposing an estimated per-capita social cost of $120 on treated counties. These effects are largely driven by evacuation orders and selective out-migration in the short run and by declining per-capita incomes in the long run. Furthermore, hurricane effects are disproportionately larger for counties with less disaster experience and lower incomes, which risk losing 1.4% and 2.2% of per capita GDP, respectively, due to hurricane-induced crime. Overall, the findings underscore the need for greater resource allocation toward vulnerable communities and increased investment in disaster resilience measures to mitigate the economic and social consequences of climate change.",

The article contextualizes the intersecting impacts of trauma, colonization, and systemic violence on these mothers and highlights how body mapping functions as a therapeutic and advocacy tool enabling the reclamation of cultural identity and self-care. FIY integrates trauma-informed, feminist principles with Indigenous and South Asian spiritual teachings to support holistic healing and empowerment. The article also discusses the importance of culturally grounded, trauma-informed care, addressing the ongoing challenges marginalized mothers face within health and social systems. Through the blending of body mapping and FIY, this work advocates healing as a political praxis that re-centers marginalized voices and knowledge in pursuit of justice and wellness.",

          "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

Drawing on data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), linked with district-level information on local labor markets (NUTS-3), we apply logistic regression models to explore gendered patterns of STEM aspirations. Findings show that boys are more likely to aspire to STEM careers in local contexts with a high prevalence of STEM occupations, which is mainly due to increased aspirations for non-academic STEM careers. By contrast, girls’ career aspirations do not significantly vary with local STEM prevalence, even in local contexts with relatively high shares of women employed in STEM. These results suggest that STEM-intensive local labor markets reinforce gendered patterns of STEM aspirations, especially among adolescents oriented towards non-academic career paths. Efforts to promote gender equity in STEM (e.g., school interventions) would benefit from incorporating strategies that address the segregating impact of local labor market structures.",

          "authors": "Norah MacKendrick",
          "abstract": "In the United States, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has captured public attention. While MAHA espouses some positions supported by peer-reviewed research (e.g., ultraprocessed foods are harmful to health) it simultaneously promotes scientifically dubious claims (e.g., vaccines are dangerous). How can social scientists make sense of these incongruent positions surrounding public health, science, and risk? To answer this question, this paper systematically examines the discursive politics of MAHA’s political arm by analyzing official government communications published during the first year of the second Trump administration. It finds that key MAHA actors root their claims in a “populist science” that speaks the language of science while claiming to disembed knowledge systems from corrupt institutions that harm ordinary people. By constructing a dichotomy between “good” and “captured” science MAHA rhetorically consolidates control over what counts as legitimate expertise. MAHA’s political discourse strategically ignores peer-reviewed evidence linking chronic disease to social inequality, racism, and economic disparities, revealing MAHA’s alignment with nationalist, anti-regulatory politics. Rather than democratize risk governance, MAHA substitutes one set of institutional authorities for another. The paper demonstrates how science populism functions as a governance strategy that reconfigures the boundaries of legitimate expertise to align with nationalist and anti-regulatory politics.",

          "authors": "Hiroshi Honda; Hitoshi Kakidani; Motonori Tomita; Tetsuo Nakano; Hideki Tohda",
          "abstract": "Industrial biotechnology plays a central role in contemporary innovation systems; however, the professional positioning of industrial bioengineers within international engineering qualification frameworks remains insufficiently clarified. This study presents a data-informed institutional analysis of how industrial bioengineering is recognized within professional qualification systems by combining a comparative review of international qualification frameworks with quantitative analysis of membership statistics from Japan’s Professional Engineer system. The review indicates that bioengineering is most often positioned primarily within biomedical engineering, while comprehensive qualification categories encompassing genetic engineering, cell engineering, and industrial bioprocess engineering, such as those institutionalized in Japan, are rarely explicitly articulated at the international level. Moreover, analysis of division-level data across 20 engineering disciplines in Japan further shows that organizational engagement, measured by organization rates, exhibits a negative but statistically non-significant association with division size. This trend suggests that in large divisions where holding the qualification itself provides practical advantages, such as preferential evaluation in public procurement, incentives for active participation in professional organizations may be relatively weaker. In contrast, smaller divisions display greater variability in organization rates and appear more sensitive to qualitative institutional factors. Within this context, the biotechnology division is distinctive, exhibiting both the highest organization rate (59.4%) and the highest female representation (13.4%) among all divisions. These characteristics are consistent with the nature of industrial biotechnology, a field characterized by rapid technological advances and persistent ethical, safety, and regulatory challenges that require continuous human interaction and collective professional governance. Using Japan’s Professional Engineer (Biotechnology and Bioengineering) system as an implemented reference, this study highlights the importance of institutionalizing industrial bioengineering through professional qualification frameworks and encourages economies to consider similar approaches to support sustained professional engagement.",

          "authors": "Pavlos Mavromatis",
          "abstract": "Embodied and relational approaches to socio-emotional development increasingly emphasize lived experience, interaction, and situated awareness, yet few frameworks systematically integrate movement-based practices with established psychotherapeutic theory. This theoretical review examines the convergence between Argentine Tango (tango) and Gestalt Therapy (GT), proposing an embodied, relational framework for socio-emotional development and relational awareness. Tango is conceptualized as an improvisational, dyadic practice that operationalizes core GT principles, including contact, field regulation, phenomenological awareness, experiential cycling, and creative adjustment. Drawing on empirical findings from psychology, neuroscience, and movement science, the review synthesizes evidence indicating that tango participation supports emotional regulation, empathy, social bonding, embodied awareness, and motor-cognitive integration. Through this synthesis, tango is positioned as a structured somatic laboratory for experiential GT processes and relational learning, offering a concrete context in which therapeutic mechanisms unfold in vivo. Despite promising outcomes, existing research remains predominantly outcome-focused, and systematic, process-oriented investigation of tango’s specific mechanisms of change is limited. This framework establishes a foundation for future interdisciplinary research and applied exploration of tango-informed GT practice across therapeutic, educational, and movement-based contexts.",

          "authors": "Nadine R. Jackson",
          "abstract": "This essay investigates prisons in the U.S. South as infrastructures of state-manufactured socio-\necological warfare. Drawing from necropolitics, carceral geography, and political ecology, I\npropose carceral socio-ecological violence as a framework for analyzing how incarceration\nproduces environmental violence that extends beyond confinement. Prisons contaminate\necosystems, dismantle community knowledge systems, and undermine the social cohesion\nrequired for collective survival. EPA compliance data from 232 facilities across thirteen states\n(2019–2024) reveal sustained and extreme violations: wastewater discharges exceeded federal\ntoxicity thresholds by 2,400%, and radiological contamination persisted for twelve consecutive\nreporting cycles. Over 72% of these violations occurred in communities facing structural\npoverty, racial segregation, and political disenfranchisement—elements of a broader strategy of\nstate-sanctioned abandonment. The essay examines the 2025 rollback of environmental\nprotections, including the closure of environmental justice offices, deletion of compliance and\nviolation records, and mass exemption of industrial polluters from federal law. In response, I\npropose a community-based Environmental Justice Governance Framework rooted in collective\nautonomy, including independent monitoring networks, direct community control over\nenvironmental and public health decisions, and decentralized resource infrastructures. Carceral\nsocio-ecological violence exposes how mass incarceration, environmental degradation, and\nepistemic erasure function as interlocking systems of racial control. Affirming the necessity of\nabolition, I call for the transfer of environmental and public health governance to communities\nhistorically targeted by state violence and systemic neglect.",

          "authors": "Fumiya Uchikoshi; Ryota Mugiyama; Shohei Yoda; James M. Raymo",
          "abstract": "In this study, we propose and evaluate a new framework for understanding “lowest-low” fertility in East Asia, emphasizing the link between the desire for children and marriage. Recognizing that delayed and declining marriage is the primary reason for low fertility in the region, we posit that marriage decisions are shaped by intentions or incentives (not) to have children. We evaluate this hypothesis using Japan as a case, a society where parenthood is an integral part of the “package” of normative family expectations accompanying marriage, especially for women. After confirming that attitudes toward marriage and fertility are strongly correlated, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of first marriage using nationally representative longitudinal data. We find that, net of marriage desires, (1) women and men with no desire to have children marry significantly later than those who desire children, and (2) uncertain attitudes toward parenthood are also associated with later marriage for men, but not women. The link between negative or uncertain fertility desires and delayed marriage among men is partially explained by their lower engagement in efforts to find a marriage partner. These results provide insights for policy discussions about declining fertility in East Asia, especially concerns that pro-natalist policies are mistargeted.",
