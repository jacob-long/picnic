          "title": "Tracking transformative agreements through open metadata: method and validation using Dutch Research Council NWO funded papers.",
          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer; Jeroen Sondervan",
          "abstract": "Transformative agreements have become an important strategy in the transition to open access, with almost 1,200 such agreements registered by 2025. Despite their prevalence, these agreements suffer from important transparency limitations, most notably article-level metadata indicating which articles are covered by these agreements. Typically, this data is available to libraries but not openly shared, making it difficult to study the impact of these agreements. In this paper, we present a novel, open, replicable method for analyzing transformative agreements using open metadata, specifically the Journal Checker tool provided by cOAlition S and OpenAlex. To demonstrate its potential, we apply our approach to a subset of publications funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and its health research counterpart ZonMw. In addition, the results of this open method are compared with the actual publisher data reported to the Dutch university library consortium UKB. This validation shows that this open method accurately identified 89% of the publications covered by transformative agreements, while the 11% false positives shed an interesting light on the limitations of this method. In the absence of hard, openly available article-level data on transformative agreements, we provide researchers and institutions with a powerful tool to critically track and evaluate the impact of these agreements.",

          "authors": "Dunigan Parker Folk; Chenxi Wu; Steven Heine",
          "abstract": "Across two studies (Total N = 1,659), we found evidence for cultural differences in attitudes towards socially bonding with conversational AI. In Study 1 (N = 675), university students with an East Asian cultural background expected to enjoy a conversation with a chatbot (vs. with a human) more than students with European background. Moreover, they were less uncomfortable and more approving of someone else socially connecting with a chatbot (vs. human) than the students with a European background. In Study 2 (pre-registered; N = 984), we found similar evidence for cultural differences comparing samples of Chinese and Japanese adults currently living in East Asia to adults currently living in the United States. Critically, these cultural differences were explained by East Asian participants increased propensity to anthropomorphize technology. Overall, our findings suggest there is cultural variability in attitudes towards chatbots and that these differences are mediated by differences in anthropomorphism.",

          "abstract": "How cross-culturally consistent and general are relationships between song and speech? Ozaki et al. (2024) analysed singing and speaking from their 75 coauthors speaking 55 languages, concluding that songs are “slower and higher and use more stable pitches than speech”. However, the degree to which their findings would generalise to other speakers of their languages remains unclear. We will test the replicability of Ozaki et al.’s findings using matched singing and conversational speech audio recordings from 15-30 participants per language in 26 sites around the world (collected as part of a broader study of global song/speech relationships [Savage et al., In Principle Accepted]). Using Peer Community In Registered Reports (PCI-RR)’s “Programmatic” track will allow us to replicate and extend Ozaki et al.’s original findings in a rigorous and equitable manner by allowing each local research team to lead its own separate first-authored Stage 2 Registered Report based on a single shared Stage 1 protocol. This will allow us to test the replicability of Ozaki et al.’s original findings across diverse languages while also giving each team the flexibility to pursue their own exploratory analyses in directions most relevant to their local context. Regardless of results, our multi-site large-scale replications will enhance our understanding of cross-cultural relationships between music and language and provide a template for equitable global collaboration using PCI-RR’s Programmatic track.",

          "abstract": "Western music is enjoyed by millions worldwide, but this enjoyment can be severely disrupted when instruments or voices are out of tune with each other. Both hearing loss and aging may degrade pitch perception, potentially affecting the ability to detect mistuning. For younger listeners with normal hearing, mistuning perception in music relies on both beats (amplitude fluctuations between closely spaced frequency components) and inharmonicity (non-integer frequency relationships between components from different sources). This study investigated the associations between hearing loss and age with mistuning detection in music, as well as with beat and inharmonicity detection. We tested groups of younger and older listeners with normal hearing and older listeners with hearing loss (N = 91 total). Results showed that older listeners with normal hearing performed similarly to younger listeners. In contrast, hearing loss was associated with poorer mistuning detection but was not associated with poorer performance in our measures of beat or inharmonicity detection. Reduction of either beating or inharmonicity cues in music had comparable effects across all groups. Overall, the results suggest that hearing loss, but not age, is associated with poorer mistuning detection in music, but that similar cues are used by all groups to detect mistuning.",

          "title": "On being different: Exploring the relationship between dissimilarity and social inclusion in the workplace",
          "authors": "Onur Sahin",
          "abstract": "In this dissertation, I investigate how being different from the majority of one’s colleagues shapes social inclusion perceptions at work. In Chapter 1, I introduce the relational demography approach and ingroup projection model as the frameworks of my dissertation and summarize the methods, findings, and broader implications of the empirical chapters that follow. In these chapters, I utilize a multi-method approach consisting of desk research, experimental studies, and large-scale correlational studies to offer six significant contributions to the literature. First, in Chapter 2, an analysis of diversity statements of 84 Dutch private and public organizations showed that most statements include both surface-level (readily visible, such as gender and ethnicity) and deep-level dimensions (more underlying, such as personality and sexual orientation). However, surface-level dimensions were more often included, without clear differences between statements of private and public organizations. Second, in Chapter 3, experimental studies (N = 128 in Study 1; N = 196 in Study 2, recruited via Prolific) established the causal relationship between dissimilarity and social inclusion. Third, in Chapter 4, a survey study with 887 employees of a public organization in the Netherlands revealed that deep-level dissimilarity, rather than surface-level dissimilarity, related to social inclusion and that inclusion explained the relationships between dissimilarity and work-related outcomes. Fourth, in Chapter 5, a survey study with 6,312 employees of another Dutch public organization accounted for multidimensionality and revealed that as employees perceived dissimilarity on more dimensions, they perceived less inclusion. Furthermore, the results showed that dissimilarity in personality, ethnicity/cultural background, age, level of education, work experience, and disability negatively related to perceptions of inclusion, offering a more nuanced understanding of the dissimilarity-inclusion relationship. Fifth, a review of the relational demography literature in Chapter 6 identified four general mechanisms theorized to explain why dissimilarity relates to outcomes: 1) uncertainty, 2) trust, 3) disapproval, and 4) initiated interaction between colleagues. A survey study with 2,409 UK residents (recruited via Prolific) confirmed that all four mechanisms uniquely explained the dissimilarity-inclusion relationship. Sixth, and finally, I found support for the indispensable role of the organizational climate for inclusion across Chapters 4, 5 and 6. In these chapters, a positive climate for inclusion buffered the negative relationships between dissimilarity and outcomes. My research argues for a broader consideration of dissimilarity dimensions beyond the dimensions diversity policies typically focus on, emphasizing the importance of recognizing multidimensionality and the crucial contextual role of climate for inclusion. This dissertation not only enriches our understanding of workplace diversity, but also offers actionable opportunities to mitigate social inclusion disparities.",

          "abstract": "Images generated using artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly realistic, sparking discussions and fears about an impending “infodemic” where we can no longer trust what we see on the internet. In this preregistered study, we examine whether providing specific media literacy tips about how to spot AI-generated images can reduce susceptibility to AI-generated visual misinformation (AIVM). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, reading specific media literacy tips, general media literacy tips, or no media literacy tips (control). The general tips provided tips on how to spot misinformation, while the specific tips provided more detailed tips for how to detect AIVM. Results showed that specific tips increased headline discernment between true and false information more than general tips. Both media literacy interventions reduced belief in AIVM compared to control, but specific tips reduced belief in AIVM more than general tips. Finally, both specific and general tips also reduced belief in real headlines compared to control, with no difference between them. In an information environment that sees increasing prevalence of AIVM, it may be worth being specific about how to detect misinformation online rather than only providing general information.",

          "authors": "SHABNAM SALEHI; Roozbeh Naghshineh; َAli Ahmadian",
          "abstract": "Abstract. In recent years, neuroscience-based methodologies have influenced architectural planning and urban studies. Since spaces are designed around proxemic relationships, studying mind-environment interactions can offer new design approaches for human spaces. Furthermore, with the prevalence of COVID-19 and the “social distancing” policy recommended by WHO, its application may affect proxemic presuppositions. Consequently, this may change individual and social proxemic distances, followed by new dimensions in urban space components. This paper addresses the hypothetical changes in mental proxemics in the face of pandemic social distancing restrictions. This study examines and measures the mental proxemics of individuals at personal and social distances in urban spaces. The research method is quasi-experimental; primary data were collected through testing participants with a portable EEG (Electroencephalogram) device, questionnaires, and library studies. All subjects were randomly selected, and the study samples were paired before participating in the designed test. The findings demonstrated that the mental proxemics of individuals at social distances were affected during the COVID-19 period. However, to define the exact amount of variation, further tasks should be implemented. These changes could influence the effective dimensions in the design of urban furniture to achieve soothing distances in urban life.",

          "abstract": "Objective\nNeighborhood adversity predicts mental health and cognitive outcomes, but little is known about structural factors that may buffer these links. The current study addresses this gap by assessing the role of protective factors in the association of neighborhood deprivation, threat, and segregation with psychopathology symptoms and cognitive outcomes. \n\nMethod\nLinear mixed models were run in the ABCD sample of 11,868 participants to test associations of neighborhood Area Deprivation Index (ADI; deprivation), crime (threat), and dissimilarity and interaction index (segregation) with attention difficulties, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), and fluid and crystallized cognitive performance. School environment, neighborhood education child opportunity index, neighborhood cohesion, and access to green space were tested as moderators of the association of neighborhood adversity with outcomes. \n\nResults\nHigher access/quality of educational resources buffer the association of neighborhood deprivation with crystallized cognitive performance. Supportive school environments were associated with lower externalizing symptoms, particularly for youth in low threat contexts. Further, for racial/ethnic minority youth living in low-segregation neighborhoods, higher neighborhood access/quality of educational resources related to lower internalizing symptoms.\n\nConclusion\nWhile adverse neighborhood environments are associated with higher psychopathology symptoms and lower cognitive performance, some aspects of neighborhoods may buffer this association. Understanding these patterns is necessary for informing structural interventions that might reduce disparities in mental health and cognitive function.",

          "authors": "Jason Geller; Sarah Elizabeth Colby; Yanina Prystauka; Julia R. Drouin",
          "abstract": "Eye-tracking has become a valuable tool for studying cognitive processes in second language (L2) acquisition and bilingualism (Godfroid et al., 2024). While research-grade infrared eye-trackers are commonly used, there are a number of issues that limit its wide-spread adoption. Recently, consumer-based webcam eye-tracking has emerged as an attractive alternative, requiring only internet access and a personal webcam. However, webcam eye-tracking presents unique design and preprocessing challenges that must be addressed for valid results. To help researchers overcome these challenges, we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on visual world  webcam eye-tracking for L2 language research. Our guide will cover all key steps, from design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package `webgazeR`, which is open source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing visual world experiments with webcam eye-tracking. To demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Spanish visual world paradigm (VWP) and show competition within and between L2/L1. This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct visual world  webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

          "abstract": "Dominant groups often resist possible changes to the hierarchical status quo. Might such tendencies be partly rooted in negative—yet potentially malleable—meta-beliefs about how disempowered groups would use power if they gained control? We investigate these questions across three studies and eight independent samples (Total N = 7,460 analyzed responses) in the context of Black-White relations in the United States. Specifically, we examine White Americans’ meta-beliefs about whether Black Americans desire power to structure society into a hierarchy in which they are dominant versus to institute equality for all groups (i.e., meta-dominance beliefs). Across 6 cross-sectional sub-samples (Study 1, Samples A-F; N = 3,383), we developed and validated a measure of meta-dominance, and found that White Americans varied substantially in their beliefs about how Black Americans would use power. Critically, Whites’ meta-dominance beliefs were uniquely related to their opposition to policies empowering Black Americans as well as their support for efforts to maintain Whites’ position atop the social hierarchy, even when controlling for a range of relevant constructs. In two pre-registered experiments among White Americans (Studies 2-3; N = 4,077), one of which was a registered report, we tested two possible causal pathways that might explain this relation: (1) “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” and (2) “Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs”. We found evidence in support of the “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” pathway, but not for the latter Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs” pathway. We discuss our findings’ implications for theories of hierarchy-maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Trust involves making oneself vulnerable by relying on the expectation that others will reciprocate and act in a trustworthy manner, leading to mutual benefit. In behavioral economics and psychology, the Trust Game is a widely used paradigm to measure trust. The repeated Trust Game is a modified version of the Trust Game in which participants encounter the same partner(s) multiple times, allowing for reputation and trust learning. The aim of the present meta analysis was to identify features of the repeated Trust Game, participant characteristics, and manipulations of partner trustworthiness that affect trust learning. This is the first meta-analytic study to specifically assess trust learning in the repeated Trust Game and included 404 effect sizes from over 8,000 participants from 68 studies. Our findings indicate that the partners’ behavioral trustworthiness, in the form of their reciprocation rate, is by far the most influential factor in participant trust learning (β = 3.0). Furthermore, the results reveal that manipulating prior information about partners can have an effect on the amount of learning, but only for manipulations of trustworthiness/morality. Notably, in ingroup-outgroup studies, participants learn from their partners’ trustworthiness and it is not affected by their partners’ group membership.",

We investigated this in two pre-registered studies. In study 1, we found that advertising slogans by ChatGPT-4 were of significantly higher quality (more novel, meaningful and persuasive), but of lower diversity, than those by human creators. In Study 2, we found that Gen-AI assistance significantly enhanced the slogan quality for less creative individuals. However, the latter Gen-AI enhancement was not realized by egocentric creators (objectively less creative but self-reporting high subjective creativity). The egocentric creators also preferred their own lower quality slogans over the ones provided by Chat-GPT4. These findings show that while Gen-AI is efficacious in creative marketing tasks, its adoption and enhancement potential may be hindered by human ego.",

Key model metrics—including precision, recall,\nand F1-score—highlighted the self-attention mechanism’s ability to capture subtle visual cues dispersed across each drawing. Despite these encouraging results, the study\nacknowledges limitations such as the subjectivity of artistic interpretation, potential\nbiases from a limited sample, and the need for further ethical and explainability considerations.

          "abstract": "Repair can help extend clothing lifecycles. However, this behavior is infrequent in high-income countries, especially among younger adults who often lack practical repair skills. In this quasi-experiment, we tested whether a group workshop could motivate repair and reduce consumption in young adults. Participants were assigned to a skills workshop (n = 62) or a control group (n = 51) who only received a persuasive message about clothing repair. The workshop strongly increased self-efficacy both immediately after the workshop and four weeks later. Although the workshop did not impact environmental attitudes or emotions associated with repair, workshop participants reported moderately higher intentions to repair their clothes and identified more with others who did (but these effects were not durable). The workshop did not increase the number of self-reported repairs nor reduce purchases four weeks later. There was some evidence for lower disposals at follow-up (but the effect was uncertain). A single workshop may thus spark motivation but not materialize in behavior changes four weeks later. This study highlights the importance of hands-on practice for boosting self-efficacy and demonstrates how quasi-experimental designs with follow-up surveys can contribute to understanding the potential of behavioral interventions.",

However, it has not been investigated whether identity processes, as described by this model, are general across various domains or domain-specific.The main objective of this study was to address this gap in knowledge by exploring whether identity processes, as described by the model, are general or specific across the domains of future goals related to education and friendship. Further objectives included testing the five-dimensional dual-cycle model among young people in Serbia and deriving identity statuses based on the identity processes in these two domains. Two adapted versions of the Dimensions of Identity Development Scale (DIDS) were created: one for future goals related to education and another for future goals related to friendship. The sample consisted of 955 high school and university students. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a domain-specific identity processes model, which included the five original factors of the DIDS. Configural, metric, and scalar invariance across gender were established. Cluster analysis identified six identity statuses: troubled diffusion, carefree diffusion, foreclosure, ruminative moratorium, achievement, and a cluster representing a combination of educational foreclosure and friendship carefree diffusion. The findings suggest that identity processes, according to the five-dimensional dual-cycle model, are domain-specific. However, identity statuses across the domains of future goals related to education and friendship are congruent for the majority of individuals. These results highlight the importance of exploring both domain-specific and shared factors in identity development in future research.",

          "title": "Building an Integrative Perspective of Trust by Drawing on Social Attitude Research",
          "authors": "Nicole Methner; Melanie C. Steffens; Susanne Bruckmüller",
          "abstract": "Trust lies at the heart of human interaction and of societies in general. Multiple research fields within and beyond psychology address trust as a research topic. However, even within psychology, different traditions have developed various and sometimes (apparently) contradictory perspectives on trust. This includes such different approaches as trust as choice behavior and trust as evaluation and has led to various inconsistencies in findings and methods. This review reconciles such different approaches, systematizes the heterogeneity of concepts, and raises new questions for future research by approaching trust from a social attitude perspective. Specifically, we suggest drawing parallels to attitude research, as both concepts share core characteristics. For instance, both attitudes and trust can be conceptualized as having cognitive, affective, and behavioral components, and on different abstraction levels. Based on these and other such parallels, we illustrate how insights from the attitude framework suggest solutions to key puzzles in trust research. That is, we show how previous debates and problems in attitude research, such as attitude-behavior-inconsistencies, and the solutions that have been developed for them, can help resolve similar issues in trust research, such as the inconsistent findings between self-reported trust and trust behavior. We also draw on the attitude framework to reveal unstudied questions and to outline promising avenues for future trust research (e.g., by drawing on insights from self-perception theory). Overall, using the attitude framework to build bridges between various streams of trust research is a promising start towards a comprehensive understanding of trust that can considerably benefit future trust research in various research fields.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, I examine the widespread phenomenon of decline narratives in human societies, where the past is idealized as a “golden age” characterized by extraordinary abundance, strength, longevity, and supernatural powers, in contrast to a flawed present. Drawing on ethnographic, historical, and psychological evidence, I explore the cultural manifestations and cognitive foundations of these narratives. The analysis highlights the roles of cognitive biases such as rosy retrospection and narrative inflation, as well as the strategic use of temporal distancing to rationalize fantastical beliefs by situating them in a distant, unfalsifiable past. By comparing decline narratives in traditional societies with progress narratives in modern, industrialized contexts, I discuss how these contrasting frameworks shape cultural attitudes toward tradition and change and consider their broader implications for understanding how cultural narratives influence human behavior.",

The ultimate result is that, on the one hand, individuals' past memories and real-time feelings can be understood to some extent by observing their behavior, and on the other hand, their behavior can be shaped by influencing their feelings and memories.",

Psychologists tend to measure curiosity via behavioural tasks or\nvia self-report personality trait questionnaires, and each measurement method has particular strengths\nand findings related to curiosity’s predictors, putative mechansims, and outcomes. Although behavioural and self-report trait measures of curiosity have rarely been assessed within the same study, recent years have seen the beginning of such an endeavour, and this integration could permit cross-pollination of ideas and hypotheses for future research. After providing a brief review of behavioral and self-report measures of curiosity, I summarise how current evidence supports only mild overlap between the two measurement methods, with positive relations depending on the particular task measure and particular facet of trait curiosity chosen. Divergence between task and trait measures could suggest different cognitive/emotional mechanisms supporting the need to know. Employing multiple personality trait measures with behavioural tasks can help to gain an understanding of the boundaries, inconsistencies, and similarities between different measurements of curiosity.",

          "abstract": "The most pressing issues we face involve resolving conflict between our moral beliefs. However, the mechanism by which agents evaluate moral trade-offs is poorly understood. We extend and test a psychological framework of moral trade-offs, under which judgment is a product of revising relevant beliefs to achieve coherence, in response to structural constraints imposed by the decision problem. Whilst traditional applications of coherence to moral judgements have been post-hoc, coherence on our view is causally involved in judgement. We develop a novel experimental dilemma concerning the issue of climate justice, which enables decision relevant beliefs to be measured before and after the dilemma is evaluated. We also estimate the coherence between these beliefs and their consistency with available choice options. Across two studies (N= 851) we examine the core predictions of this framework, including the causal role of coherence-based belief change in moral judgement. In both studies, participants re-evaluated their beliefs to become more internally coherent and more consistent with their judgement, polarising the beliefs of participants reaching competing conclusions. Coherence and consistency also separately predicted metacognitive properties of judgement such as confidence and perceived task difficulty. Network analyses demonstrated a restructuring of the belief network and an increase in the strength of partial associations between beliefs over judgement. Overall, these results provide strong support for a coherence-based framework of moral trade-offs. Whilst judgement involves revising beliefs to achieve a coherent arrangement, the choice option selected depends on the aggregate weight of these beliefs once the revision process is completed.",

This study aimed to enhance the understanding of attachment security and belonging as protective factors against depression in LGBTQ+ adults. Using a correlational, survey-based design (N = 364), we examined whether a sense of belonging (SOB) to the LGBTQ+ community mediates the association between attachment security and depression and whether this mediation varies across levels of SOB to the general community. Regression model results generated with Hayes’s PROCESS macro for SPSS indicated that SOB to the LGBTQ+ Community mediated the negative association between attachment security and depression, providing support for this protective mechanism and conceptually replicating prior research. No evidence emerged that this mediation effect varied with SOB to the general community. Exploratory analyses suggested that anxious and avoidant attachment may differ in the extent to which SOB to the LGBTQ+ and general communities mediate their relationships with depression. Despite appropriate statistical power, the study’s cross-sectional nature limits causal inferences. The findings have implications for addressing health inequities, increasing access to LGBTQ+ Community resources, and promoting LGBTQ+ well-being.",

The present study probes whether childhood violence exposure influences implicit bias and psychopathology differentially depending on the participant’s relationship with the perpetrator (i.e., in-group vs. out-group member) at the time of exposure. We administered a minimal group assignment paradigm and implicit association test to 455 young adults aged 18-25. Young adults who experienced out-group violence in childhood showed stronger implicit in-group favoritism compared to those who experienced in-group or no violence. Implicit out-group favoritism was associated with increased alcohol use.

Each component of state empathy—including emotion sharing, perspective taking, and compassion—was significantly predicted by theoretically-relevant trait measures. However, trait empathy explained limited variance in daily experiences overall, ranging from just 3% for emotion sharing to 15% for perceived empathic efficacy. Adding emotional valence as a predictor improved model fit and variance explained for most state experiences, highlighting the crucial role of context.

We analyzed these stories using large language models. We found that although stereotypes are considered products of social learning about groups, they varied considerably across perceivers and situations. Intersectional stereotypes showed evidence for dominance effects of “Asian” and “unattractiveness”, potentially due to their lower representativeness in the U.S. population and uniform stereotypes across situations. These findings highlight the complex variability of stereotype content in naturalistic contexts, opening new doors to reducing intergroup biases.",

          "abstract": "Developmental dyslexia (DD) is characterized by difficulties in reading due to a core impairment in phonological awareness. The clinical manifestation also includes a more general auditory verbal short-term memory (vSTM) dysfunction. However, little is known about the behavioral and brain basis of vSTM deficits in children with dyslexia, failing to understand factors that may account for co-occurrence of deficits or substantial heterogeneity within DD. \nThe study identified deficiencies in vSTM within a large cohort of children with DD and examined their neuroanatomical alterations. 81 children with DD and 17 typically developing (TD) children completed an experimental repetition task, which evaluated two components of phrases, namely length (6 and 9 syllable phrases) and meaning (more or less meaningful phrases). In addition, a battery of reading, phonological, and verbal memory tasks was administered to DD children, which were used for preliminary examination of different subtypes of dyslexia.  Structural brain T1-weighted MR images were analyzed to investigate the neural correlates of vSTM deficit in children with DD. \nBehavioral results showed that children with DD had impaired phrase repetition compared to TD, especially when repeating long and non-meaningful phrases. Crucially, lower repetition performance on long or non-meaningful phrases was associated with greater cortical thickness in the left temporoparietal area in children with DD. Finally, two distinct DD subtypes with disproportional deficits in phonology and vSTM were identified, demonstrating different repetition patterns. Those with primary vSTM deficits showed lower repetition performance and decreased cortical thickness in the left precentral gyrus compared to those with primary phonological processing deficits. This study covers topics central to understanding neurocognitive diversity in dyslexia and may suggest that verbal memory ability may be an important area for future intervention.",

To answer this important question, we develop a theoretical framework based on two popular evaluation methods in eyewitness research—receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and expected utility analysis. This framework contains two key components. First, we present an investigator signal detection model, which illustrates that ROC analysis examines investigator performance rather than eyewitness performance. Investigators use eyewitness evidence to classify suspects’ guilt or innocence—and lineup ROC curves capture their operating characteristics under different decision criteria. Second, we discuss the connection between ROC and expected utility, which highlights the dynamic nature of investigator decision making. The expected utility of investigator classification decisions is influenced not only by the quality of eyewitness evidence but also by factors such as investigators’ decision criteria, prior evidence, and consequences of the decisions. As its parameters embrace police investigative practices throughout different stages, the expected utility approach provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating investigator performance. To effectively evaluate and improve lineup practices, researchers need to consider not just witnesses but also the role played by investigators.",

All participants were experiencing elevated depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score of ≥2) and endorsed wanting mental health support but being unable to access it. We asked participants an open-ended question gauging perceived barriers to accessing care (“what has kept you from getting support when you wanted it?”), and a binary item gauging perceived current need for mental health support (“right now, do you feel that you need support for emotional or mental health problems?”). Via thematic analysis of responses to the perceived barriers question, we identified a total of 13 categories of barriers. Across all participants, 42.48% (n=52) endorsed family-related barriers and 31.71% (n=39) endorsed finance-related concerns. We conducted Chi-square analyses, examining rates of endorsing specific barriers as a function of (a) perceived current support need and (b) demographic variables (e.g. race/ethnicity, gender). In the current study, all adolescents endorsed similar categories of treatment access barriers, regardless of race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and level of depression.

Four profiles based on access to socioeconomic resources (SER) and multi-domain cognitive functioning were identified, including two profiles characterized by moderate-to-high-SER (74.5%) and two profiles characterized by low-SER (25.5%). Among youth in low-SER environments, 88.6% demonstrated cognitive performance scores similar to youth with moderate-to-high access to SER (“cognitive resilience”), whereas 11.4% demonstrated markedly lower performance relative to the other profiles (i.e., 1.3 to 2.3 SD below the sample mean; “cognitive vulnerability”). Ridge regression identified ecological factors associated with profile membership at the individual level and within family, neighborhood, and school contexts. Suburban residence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30), advanced pubertal maturity (OR = 1.20), bilingualism (OR = 1.14), and greater caregiver monitoring (OR = 1.10) were most strongly associated with lower-SER youths’ membership in the resilient versus the vulnerable profile.

Subjective difficulty concentrating frequently coincides with perseverative thought and may function as both mechanism and clinical consequence of perseverative thought. Although cognitive theories suggest a bidirectional relationship between perseverative thought and difficulty concentrating, experimental and longitudinal investigations provide mixed evidence. The current study addresses this gap by testing a bidirectional relationship between momentary perseverative thought and difficulty concentrating using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) (8 surveys per day for 14 days) with 200 adult community participants (N = 155 with compliance ≥ 70%) oversampled for moderate/severe perseverative thought. Multilevel modeling tested concurrent and time-lagged associations. Difficulty concentrating and perseverative thought were concurrently and prospectively related within-person: higher difficulty concentrating at T-1 predicted higher perseverative thought at T, and higher perseverative thought at T-1 predicted higher difficulty concentrating at T (β = .19 – .20, p &lt; .001). Findings held when controlling for the outcome at T-1 (β = .02 – .06, p &lt; .001). These findings demonstrate covariation between difficulty concentrating and perseverative thought within-person in daily life consistent with theoretical models that predict bidirectional relationships. Findings suggest that intervening on difficulty concentrating and/or perseverative thought may reduce the “vicious cycle” of perseverative thought episodes.",

These findings are robust across analytic choices, but generalizability and discriminant tests provided mixed evidence.

          "abstract": "Synchrony has been proposed as a relevant phenomenon for investigating social neurophysiological and psychological processes, with inter-brain synchrony, in particular, presumed to facilitate the functional integration of multiple brains. However, the lack of an accepted definition and a cohesive theoretical corpus that allows hypothesis-based approaches, often combined with less robust empirical methods, might hinder progress in this field. To address this, we propose a definition of inter-brain synchrony and link various theoretical contributions to justify the existence of meaningful temporal alignment between different brain activities. Furthermore, we propose a set of methods aimed at minimizing bias in the collection of evidence supporting this neural mechanism. Our approach entails extracting instantaneous phase data from Hilbert-transformed EEG time series recorded from individuals under different experimental conditions that account for the synchrony’s confounding factors such as shared attention, cognitive, and motor dependencies. We then propose multiple data analysis strategies, including circular statistics combined with permutation testing, and mutual information. Finally, we present an example of a potential application within the context of cooperation in nuclear families. We believe that, by employing such methods consistently, the concept of inter brain synchrony is falsifiable. Whether this phenomenon is empirically supported or not, it will contribute to advancing our understanding of the social brain.",

          "abstract": "Standardized, granular measurement of social communication behaviors, such as social gaze during natural interactions, is needed for a range of psychiatric applications including diagnosis and detecting clinical change in conditions such as autism. Computational approaches show promise in automatically measuring social behaviors within natural settings. This study aims to automatically measure social gaze features from videos of dyadic conversations, characterize autism-related differences, and capture individual-level differences. 46 autistic Participants and 36 neurotypical Participants, aged 8-29 years, engaged in a brief video-recorded conversation with a research staff member (Partner). An automated social gaze detector was trained to detect whether each partner was looking at the other and achieved 89% cross-validated accuracy with human annotations. Comparing detailed automatic gaze measurements, autistic Participants spent less time looking at Partners and engaging in mutual gaze than neurotypical Participants did. They also initiated mutual gaze less frequently and had shorter mutual gaze episodes, but did not differ in mutual gaze counts. A social gaze summary score fusing individual variables correlated specifically with ADOS-2 Social Affect scores and not Restricted and Repetitive Behavior scores. A cross-validated multivariate classification model using gaze features was able to make individual-level diagnostic prediction (autism versus neurotypical) with 73% accuracy. This study provides a framework for automatically quantifying social gaze behaviors with high granularity and demonstrates its use in psychiatric research. This framework has a potential for enhancing measurement of social skills and tracking therapeutic progress in autism and other psychiatric conditions.",

In an effort to understand and mitigate these effects, researchers have sought to explain the psychological appeal of conspiracy theories. This article presents a wide-ranging systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on conspiracy beliefs. We analyzed 971 effect sizes from 279 independent studies (Nparticipants = 137,406) to examine the relationships between psychological motives and conspiracy beliefs. Results indicated that these relationships were significant for all three analyzed classes of motivation: epistemic (k = 114, r = .14), existential (k = 121, r = .16), and social motivations related to the individual, relational, and collective selves (k = 100, r = .16). For all motives examined, we observed considerable heterogeneity. Moderation analyses suggest that the relationships were weaker, albeit still significant, when experimental (vs. correlational) designs were used, and differed depending on the conspiracy measure used. We statistically compare the absolute meta-analytic effect size magnitudes against each other and discuss limitations and future avenues for research, including interventions to reduce susceptibility to conspiracy theories.",

          "abstract": "The striking constraints of some human cognitive processes stand in stark contrast to the near\nlimitless capability of others. While we can acquire and flexibly use vast amounts of information,\nthe amount we can process at any one time is often stiflingly limited. Here, we integrate ideas\nfrom information-theory, cognitive science, and neuroscience to offer a unified account of why\nprocessing is often so limited. We argue that this reflects a fundamental tradeoff between\nrepresentational efficiency and processing efficiency. ‘Representational efficiency’ refers to how\nmuch and how compactly information is represented by an agent, that is directly related to its\ncapacity for generalization. We distinguish this from ‘processing efficiency’, which refers to how\nmany representations can be processed at the same time. We show that maximizing\nrepresentational efficiency to optimize the capacity for generalization — a characteristically\nhuman cognitive strength — comes at the expense of surprisingly strict limits in processing\ncapacity, an equally characteristic human weakness that has been observed in a variety of\ncognitive tasks. We refer to this as the “curse of generalization,” and formulate this first in\ninformation theoretic form, and then demonstrate it in a neurally motivated model of a set of\ncanonical cognitive tasks that have been used to demonstrate the strict limits in human\nprocessing capacity. We suggest that the tension between representational efficiency and\nprocessing efficiency imposes a fundamental constraint on information processing, that may\nprovide a unified explanation for a wide range of psychological phenomena, from performance\nin the tasks on which we focus to representational learning and skill acquisition more broadly, as\nwell as the performance of modern machine learning architectures that exhibit generalization\ncapabilities comparable to humans.",

Apart from one study that personalized more than one IBI component, studies did not find a significant positive effect of personalization on mental health outcomes or adherence.\nDiscussion: The results reveal a gap between the theoretical potential of personalization in IBIs and the current evidence supporting its impact on outcomes and adherence. The diversity in personalization strategies across studies further complicates the ability to draw definitive conclusions.

To deepen our understanding of young readers’ expectations, needs, and desires for a robot that supports reading, we conducted co-design sessions followed by a semi-structured interview with children aged 5-9 years (30 typical readers and a case series of 5 children with poor reading, with 4 engaged in targeted reading intervention at the time the study was conducted). We conducted a thematic analysis of interview data using a reflexive and inductive approach. We found that children designed robots that could deliver reading-specific support alongside more general emotional support. Key functional features and capabilities included prosocial behaviours (smiling, play, conversation), breadth of knowledge that assumed access to information about many topics, including core academic skills (reading, mathematics). Key aesthetic features included colourful, compact, and customisable designs. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of social robots to support reading and suggest that children are very much open to interacting with reading robot companions.",

          "abstract": "Despite the substantial role of extended relatives in childcare in China and worldwide, their involvement in the care of autistic children remains understudied. This quantitative study aims to characterise the role of extended relatives in caring for autistic children, and to examine the relationship between the stigma and support provided by extended relatives. Using a cross-sectional design 233 Chinese parents of autistic children were recruited by convenience and snowball sampling. The results showed that Chinese autistic children have frequent interactions with their extended relatives, with 40% living in extended family households. Extended relatives are a common source of support, and their support is considered helpful by many parents. Linear regression analysis indicated that household structure and extended relatives’ stigma towards the autistic child have a significant effect on both the frequency and helpfulness of support. Living in a nuclear or extended family household significantly moderated the effects of extended relatives’ stigma on their support. In families living apart from their extended relatives, stigma towards the autistic child and stigma towards parents were both negatively associated with the support offered by extended relatives. In contrast, when living with extended relatives, stigma towards the parent was positively associated with support, while stigma towards the autistic child was unrelated to the support provided. Our findings highlight the important role of extended relatives in the care for autistic children. Caregiver interventions should consider including extended relatives in the programme focus to address stigma and strengthen family support.",

          "abstract": "The N2pc is widely employed as an electrophysiological marker of an attention allocation. This interpretation was largely driven by the observation of an N2pc elicited by an isolated relevant target object, which was reported as Experiment 2 in Eimer (1996). All subsequent refined interpretations of the N2pc had to take this crucial finding into account. Despite its central role for neurocognitive attention research, there have been no direct replications and only few conceptual replications of this seminal work. Within the context of #EEGManyLabs, an international community-driven effort to replicate the most influential EEG studies ever published, the present study was selected due to its strong impact on the study of selective attention. We revisit the idea of the N2pc being an indicator of attentional selectivity by delivering a high powered direct replication of Eimer's work through analysis of 779 datasets acquired from 22 labs across 14 countries. Our results robustly replicate the N2pc to form stimuli, but a direct replication of the more influential N2pc to color stimuli technically failed. We believe that this pattern not only sheds further light on the functional significance of the N2pc as an electrophysiological marker of attentional selectivity, but also highlights a methodological problem with selecting analysis windows a priori. By contrast, the consistency of observed ERP patterns across labs and analysis pipelines is stunning and this consistency is preserved even in datasets that were rejected for (ocular) artifacts, attesting the robustness of the ERP technique and the feasibility of large-scale EEG replication studies.",

          "abstract": "We investigate how context granularity, i.e. whether fine or coarse distinctions need to be made, influences an emerging lexicon. We conduct an agent-based simulation of a concept-level reference game, in which agents learn to communicate about concepts that are operationalized by combining multiple objects. We create three experimental conditions by manipulating the context in which the instances of the target concept appear: In the fine context condition, agents must make precise distinctions between similar targets and distractors. In the coarse context condition, targets are easy to discriminate because they share no overlapping features with the distractors. In the mixed baseline condition, both fine and coarse distinctions are necessary.\nOur results suggest that agents adapt their communication strategies to the granularity of the context in which they learned the concepts. In the fine context and baseline conditions, agents develop a communication protocol heavily based on one-to-one mappings between messages and concepts. Conversely, in the coarse context condition agents communicate more efficiently by vastly relying on abstract references that may refer to more than a single concept but are unambiguous in context. These results show that ambiguity emerges in coarse contexts and that ambiguous abstract terms are used for more efficient communication.",

We present three experiments – two behavioural and one neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging: fMRI) – that tested whether personally-valued voices engage reward-motivated behaviour and associated brain responses. Using novel voice incentive delay (VID) tasks, we show that listeners respond faster in anticipation of hearing the speaking voice of their music idol than when anticipating an unfamiliar voice or a pure tone (Experiment 1). Importantly, we found a dissociation between “wanting” and “liking”, where both voices were perceived as explicitly more pleasant than a tone, but only anticipating the idol voice elicited faster reaction times. A second behavioural experiment indicated that familiarity alone was insufficient to engage stronger reward-motivated behaviour in comparison with an unfamiliar identity (Experiment 2). These behavioural patterns were further reflected in brain responses, where the idol voice most strongly engaged brain regions associated with reward processing while responses to other familiar and unfamiliar voices were often equivalent (Experiment 3). Taken together, these studies provide evidence that voices can be effective rewards, in particular when they are associated with intense parasocial interest. Future research should determine whether these findings generalise to personally known individuals.",

          "abstract": "Music training is widely claimed to enhance nonmusical abilities, yet causal evidence remains inconclusive. Moreover, research tends to focus on cognitive over socioemotional outcomes. In two studies, we investigated whether music training improves emotion recognition in voices and faces among school-aged children. We also examined music-training effects on musical abilities, motor skills (fine and gross), broader socioemotional functioning, and cognitive abilities including nonverbal reasoning, executive functions, and auditory memory (short-term and working memory). Study 1 (N = 110) was a 2-year longitudinal intervention conducted in a naturalistic school setting, comparing music training to basketball training (active control) and no training (passive control). Music training improved fine-motor skills and auditory memory relative to controls, but it had no effect on emotion recognition or other cognitive and socioemotional abilities. Both music and basketball training improved gross-motor skills. Study 2 (N = 192) compared children without music training to peers attending a music school. Although music training correlated with better emotion recognition in speech prosody (tone of voice), this association disappeared after controlling for socioeconomic status, musical abilities, or short-term memory. In contrast, musical abilities correlated with emotion recognition in both prosody and faces, independently of training or other confounding variables. These findings suggest that music training enhances fine-motor skills and auditory memory, but it does not causally improve emotion recognition. Observed advantages in emotion recognition likely stem from preexisting musical abilities and other confounding factors such as socioeconomic status.",

Students were classified using latent profile analysis, based on different patterns of perfectionistic strivings and concerns. We identified four profiles: concerned (28.1 %), ambitious (27.8 %), perfectionists (23.9 %), and non-perfectionists (20.1 %). Ambitious students were the most engaged and concerned were the least engaged in their studies, whereas perfectionists, followed by concerned, expressed the highest exhaustion, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Friends’ support showed the most prominent interactive effects with perfectionism. When students received enough support from family and friends, ambitious expectedly showed adaptive well-being, while perfectionists still expressed more depressive symptoms. Interestingly, when students did not receive support from family or friends despite needing it, perfectionists and ambitious did not differ in their depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of support. These findings indicate that it is important to recognise and support students with different perfectionistic tendencies for reducing students’ emotional distress.",

          "abstract": "People with autism or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) take longer to recognise emotions associated with certain facial expressions. While this effect has been sufficiently documented, its specificity received less attention. Since both conditions lead to increased reaction times on a wide variety of tasks, it is unclear whether differences in responses are specific to emotion recognition or due to attenuations of more basic sensory or motor processes. Therefore, we pair the use of a sensitive morphing task assessing emotion discrimination threshold (EDT), i.e., how much information is needed to correctly recognise an emotion, with a control task measuring species discrimination threshold (SDT). We hypothesise specific increases of EDT in adults with ADHD or autism, and differences in gaze patterns, specifically in dwell times and number of saccades. We assess our hypotheses in autistic adults with (n = 23) and without co-occurring ADHD (n = 23), adults with ADHD (n = 24) and a comparison group of typically-developing adults (n = 24). Our data supports differences in facial emotion recognition between adults with ADHD or autism and the comparison group. Furthermore, an explorative sample of adults with co-occurrence of ADHD and autism performed comparable to adults with either autism or ADHD, suggesting that a co-occurrence is not associated with additive or interactive effects. Importantly, EDT was equivalent in adults with ADHD as well as autistic adults with or without co-occurring ADHD when including SDT in the model. Moreover, there were no differences between groups in terms of gaze patterns. Similar emotion discrimination thresholds in autistic adults with and without co-occurring ADHD suggest shared mechanisms in autism and ADHD influencing facial emotion recognition. Similar gaze patterns indicate that differences in facial emotion recognition are not due to differences in attention to facial landmarks or information gathering strategies.",

Furthermore, it's unclear if distinct memory mechanisms for different social attributes might distort our representations of these social networks. Here, we study the relative contributions of shared contexts and personality traits when learning friendships in a social network. Specifically, we were interested in whether trait valence or specific contexts shape how humans remember friendships in social networks. Through varying levels of network topological complexity, we find the contexts where people know each other are most memorable and that better contextual retrieval uniquely relates to better recall of friendships. Moreover, subsequent computational modeling revealed that participants' biases for encoding a network member's personality traits and network position has a downstream impact on friendship recall. These results suggest contextual memory can serve as a scaffold for mapping out dyadic friendship relationships in social networks, and illustrates the acute nature by which a person's personality traits impact memory of their respective friendships. More generally, our findings give insights into how the same social network can be represented differently depending on individual learning biases and experience.",

Since drinking motives are proximal predictors of initiation and escalation of alcohol use, accurate measurement of these motives is crucial. This study assessed the psychometric properties – factor structure, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability- of the 12-item, 18-item, and the original 20-item versions of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire (DMQ). We also examined the associations between drinking motives and alcohol use outcomes using network analysis. A total of 434 adults (77.4% female) completed the baseline session and 130 (85.3% female) participated in a follow-up approximately two weeks later. Results showed that the subscales of the DMQ have good internal consistency ( .80) regardless of version. Test-retest reliability was acceptable to good (rs= .71 to rs= 83) but was higher for social and enhancement than for conformity and coping motives. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 12-item short form outperforms the original 20-item version and the more recently proposed 18-item version. Partial correlation networks including DMQ subscales and alcohol outcomes revealed consistent positive association between social motives and binge drinking, alcohol use quantity per drink occasion and enhancement motives, while frequency of use was primarily associated with coping motives. However, while associations amongst drinking motives were identical in the 12- and 18-item version, these differed from the 20-item version. This study demonstrates how network models can be valuable tools in the validation and comparison of questionnaires and shows that the 12-item DMQ could be a good alternative for the often used longer forms.",

We found that parafoveal magnification significantly augmented parafoveal processing, enabling word-initial letters and contextual predictability to interactively influence the prelexical activation of parafoveal targets. Our findings showed that the degree of parafoveal processing can be increased by perceptual magnification of preview information. This enhancement made orthographic information of the parafoveal target word accessible earlier, which in turn interacted with contextual factors to shape the graded activation of prelexical candidates for the target word. Our results demonstrate the utility and potential of parafoveal magnification as a novel tool for studying the temporal dynamics and attention allocation in parafoveal processing during reading.",

          "authors": "Christos Halkiopoulos",
          "abstract": "The attentional probe paradigm involves presenting participants with different messages simultaneously through two distinct information channels within the same modality. By measuring reaction times to modality-specific probes that can appear in either channel, this paradigm enables the assessment of attention allocation between these channels. Since the 1980s this paradigm has become prominent for investigating attentional biases in the processing of emotional information. The best-known version of it, the dot-probe technique introduced by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata (1986), uses the visual modality. What is less well-known is that I had previously introduced the attentional probe paradigm in 1981 in the auditory modality in a modified dichotic listening experiment with pure tones as auditory probes. Using this tone-probe technique this study investigated the contrasting ways in which repressors and sensitisers (Byrne,1961) handle threatening information. Criticisms from a contemporary perspective notwithstanding of the rather limited initial study, it was concluded that sensitisers displayed an attentional bias favouring the processing of threatening stimuli, whereas repressors appeared to avoid the optimal processing of such stimuli.  This paper presents a historical reconstruction of how I developed the attentional probe paradigm, how I first applied it in the auditory modality, and how it was subsequently used in the visual modality. It also introduces a multimodal version to be used in further research and offers a critique of extant research relying exclusively on decontextualized stimuli.",

          "abstract": "We study abstraction in an emergent communication paradigm. In emergent communication, two artificial neural network agents develop a language while solving a communicative task. In this study, the agents play a concept-level reference game. This means that the speaker agent has to describe a concept to a listener agent, who has to pick the correct target objects that satisfy the concept. Concepts consist of multiple objects and can be either more specific, i.e. the target objects share many attributes, or more generic, i.e. the target objects share fewer attributes. We test two directions of zero-shot generalization to novel levels of abstraction: When generalizing from more generic to very specific concepts, agents utilize a compositional strategy. When generalizing from more specific to very generic concepts, agents utilize a more flexible linguistic strategy that involves reusing many messages from training. Our results provide evidence that neural network agents can learn robust concepts based on which they can generalize using adaptive linguistic strategies. We discuss how this research provides new hypotheses on abstraction and informs linguistic theories on efficient communication.",

          "abstract": "This study used a person-oriented approach to investigate what kinds of perfectionistic profiles can be identified among general upper secondary students (N = 2005, girls = 53.1 %) and whether perceived support from various sources (i.e., teacher, school psychologist, family, friends) moderates the links between perfectionistic profiles and students’ well-being (i.e., engagement, exhaustion, depressive symptoms, anxiety). Students were classified using latent profile analysis, based on different patterns of perfectionistic strivings and concerns. We identified four profiles: concerned (28.1 %), ambitious (27.8 %), perfectionists (23.9 %), and non-perfectionists (20.1 %). Ambitious students were the most engaged and concerned were the least engaged in their studies, whereas perfectionists, followed by concerned, expressed the highest exhaustion, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Friends’ support showed the most prominent interactive effects with perfectionism. When students received enough support from family and friends, ambitious expectedly showed adaptive well-being, while perfectionists still expressed more depressive symptoms. Interestingly, when students did not receive support from family or friends despite needing it, perfectionists and ambitious did not differ in their depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of support. These findings indicate that it is important to recognise and support students with different perfectionistic tendencies for reducing students’ emotional distress.",

          "abstract": "Drift diffusion models (DDMs) are pivotal in understanding evidence accumulation processes during decision-making across psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Hierarchical drift diffusion models (HDDM), a Python library for hierarchical Bayesian estimation of DDMs (Wiecki et al., 2013), has been widely used among researchers, including those with limited coding proficiency, in fitting DDMs and other sequential sampling models. However, issues of compatibility in installation and lack of support for more recently Bayesian modeling functionalities poses serious challenges for new users, limiting broader adaptation and reproducibility of HDDM. To address these issues, we created dockerHDDM, a user-friend computational environment for HDDM with new features. dockerHDDM brings three improvements: (1) easy-to-install once docker is installed, ensuring reproducibility and saving time for researchers; (2) compatible with machine with apple chips; (3) seamlessly integration with ArviZ, a state-of-the-art Bayesian modeling library. This tutorial serves as a practical, hands-on guide for researchers to leverage dockerHDDM’s capabilities in conducting efficient Bayesian hierarchical analysis of DDMs. The notebook presented here and within the docker image will enable researchers with various programming levels to model their data with HDDM.",

Using Peer Community In Registered Reports (PCI-RR)’s “Programmatic” track will allow us to replicate and extend Ozaki et al.’s original findings in a rigorous and equitable manner by allowing each local research team to lead its own separate first-authored Stage 2 Registered Report based on a single shared Stage 1 protocol. This will allow us to test the replicability of Ozaki et al.’s original findings across diverse languages while also giving each team the flexibility to pursue their own exploratory analyses in directions most relevant to their local context. Regardless of results, our multi-site large-scale replications will enhance our understanding of cross-cultural relationships between music and language and provide a template for equitable global collaboration using PCI-RR’s Programmatic track.",

Effortful threat avoidance has been less extensively studied. Work in rodents suggest that reduced effortful threat avoidance characterizes depressive phenotypes and is responsive to antidepressant medications, while increased effortful threat avoidance characterizes more anxiety-like phenotypes and is responsive to anxiolytic medications. A parallel dissociation in humans would have clear clinical implications.  Here, we investigated whether dimensions of depressed and anxious affect do indeed differentially impact effortful reward pursuit versus threat avoidance in humans. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling revealed that component decision-making mechanisms underlying effortful reward pursuit were differentially impacted by latent dimensions capturing the depressive symptoms of apathy versus anhedonia. Meanwhile, only the latent dimension tapping worry-related symptoms significantly impacted effortful threat avoidance, increasing willingness to exert effort to avoid threat and reducing sensitivity to threat magnitude.",

We replicated this test across two distinct moral dimensions: harm to innocent people and contamination of nature’s purity. Our findings show that all message versions had strong immediate persuasive effects relative to a control condition, and much of those effects remained after a three-week period.

We show that unemployed people are also rated the lowest when compared to a high-high occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). In Study 2, we replicate these findings with university students (n = 193) and show that unemployed people are also blatantly dehumanized when compared to the same targets. In Study 3, we show that vocational integration workers (n = 123) also rate unemployed people lower than employed people on both dimensions and facets, but not on morality.

The present research explored variation in profanity use when generating jokes. A sample of adults (n = 618) completed a creative humor production task, and text-mining methods detected and coded the appearance and severity of profanity. Random forest models were used to identify potentially important predictors, such as variables relevant to profanity generally (e.g., age, gender, and personality traits) and variables specific to humor creation (e.g., humor self-concepts and self-ratings of their jokes’ funniness). Profanity in the jokes was reasonably common, used by 22% of the sample, diverse in type, and generally mild in severity. The random forest models identified a set of uniquely important predictors. Profanity use and severity were marked by being younger, identifying as male, rating one’s own jokes as funny, and expressing more confidence in one’s ability to be funny and make others laugh—a true profile in boorishness. The discussion explores roles for personality in indecorous humor and the broader question of strategic aspects of humor creation.",

Results: Longitudinal relationships varied by gender, such that more frequent gaming at T2 predicted less time spent on social media use at T3 in girls (but not boys) and, more frequent internalising symptoms at T2 predicted reductions in gaming frequency at T3 in boys (but not girls). There was no evidence that time spent on social media or gaming frequency predicted later internalising symptoms among girls or boys. Sensitivity analyses which distinguished active versus passive social media use replicated these findings.

Method: Propensity score matching and difference-in-differences estimation were used in a pre-test/post-test control group design to assess the impact of FBB on the mental wellbeing (assessed via the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, SWEMWBS) of participants designated at-risk (N=46 aged 12-14, 81.6% boys), passive learners (N=72, aged 12-14, 84.7% boys), and role models (N=35, aged 12-14, 85.7% boys), with matched control samples derived from a subset of the #BeeWell cohort study (N=8,015). Results: A significant intervention effect was observed for at-risk youth, with FBB leading to an increase of approximately 2.4 SWEMWBS points (d = 0.44).  No intervention effects were observed for passive learners or role models. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence indicates that FBB can improve mental wellbeing of at-risk youth.

In a pilot study (N = 50), we identified credible dynamic bipartisan norms (e.g., increasing bipartisan support for poverty assistance). In Study 1 (N = 389), Democrats and Republicans underestimated in-party and out-party support for these norms and misperceived trends, believing Republican support had declined when it had actually grown. In Study 2 (N = 1,187), exposure to dynamic bipartisan norms reduced ideological polarization but did not significantly reduce affective polarization, suggesting that shifting policy attitudes does not necessarily foster cross-party goodwill.

While an important call to boycott the tournament spread worldwide, research has yet to document the motives underlying a boycott of such a mega sporting event. We investigated fans’ intentions to boycott the 2022 FIFA World Cup in four countries of the Francophonie engaged in the World Cup (N = 1,635). We found that being highly identified with the team and enjoying football for aesthetic pleasures predicted rejection of the boycott, while the most robust predictor of boycott intentions was a concern for environmental issues. When assessing actual boycott behaviours among fans after the World Cup (N = 286), we found a significant decrease compared to boycott intentions. Importantly, this intention–behaviour gap was true even for politicised fans with high awareness of social and environmental issues who initially planned to boycott the tournament. We discuss the paradox of calls to boycott mega sporting events: Unlike other consumption products, these events often have no alternatives, which influences fans’ decisions not to boycott. As a consequence, boycott behaviours mirror one’s fandom rather than political values, and boycotters are those barely interested in these events in any case.",

          "abstract": "It has been argued that social processes are relevant to belief formation and maintenance and thence to persecutory delusions – the fixed false beliefs that others intend harm. We call this the social turn in delusions research. It suggests that paranoia is the purview of a specialized mechanism for coalitional cognition – thinking about group membership and reputation management. Here we suggest instead that a simpler, parasocial, learning mechanism may underwrite persecutory and other delusions. We make our case in terms of computations (prediction, not coalition), algorithm (association rather than recursion), and implementation (dopaminergic domain-general rather than social-specific regions). We conclude with suggestions for adversarial collaboration that will clarify the contributions of domain-general versus social-specific processes to delusions.",

At face value, that assertion is not surprising as a consistent line of research has previously established that relationship in Western countries (5–7), which has been relied upon in policymaking (8,9). Research conducted subsequent to Tang et al. in Mainland China has also replicated the relationship (10).\n\nHowever, unfortunately, Tang et al. suffered from a fundamental flaw. That study did not, in fact, measure ‘problem gambling’ as traditionally defined because Tang et al. significantly modified the measurement scale. Instead, Tang et al. measured only ‘problematic participation in gacha mechanics’ and proved various relationships existed between that construct and other variables, which arguably is less meaningful (11,12). The development of that new scale lacked transparency and evidence of reliability and validity. It is unclear whether that new measure is related to ‘problem gambling’ and, if so, to what extent. In any case, it is not, and cannot be used as, a direct replacement without further validation\n\nTang et al. could not in fact have been able to report on any issues concerning ‘problem gambling’ because by definition, they did not measure ‘problem gambling.’ They should not have claimed to have been able to test or comment on any psychological relationships concerning ‘problem gambling.’ The current framing of that paper and its conclusions are misleading to readers whose attention are not specifically drawn to this highly significant measurement modification.

In this paper we (1) conducted an exploratory cluster analysis on their textual justifications of their moral responsibility ratings using word-embeddings and (2) investigated the correlation between moral responsibility ratings and the proportion of words participants use from each cluster. We found that participants who used more words from the “event detection” cluster were more likely to attribute higher moral responsibility to the humanoid robot.

Two pre-registered experiments (Study 1: N = 461; Study 2: N = 444) found that, for the same hotel review, third-party reviewers were perceived more favorably than self-reviewers (i.e., hotel managers), leading to more positive evaluations of the hotel. Reviews attributed to AI writers negatively impacted impressions of the reviewer and diminished the review’s impact, with third-party reviewers more negatively affected by AI writer labels than self-reviewers. AI labels of user-generated content can therefore move people out of their default impression formation state. We demonstrate theoretical advancements for warranting theory and AIMC.",

          "abstract": "*This is a preprint and has been accepted for publication by Cognitive Development* Children’s metacognitive monitoring is typically considered as a domain general skill that can be applied in different tasks and situations. However, this assumption lacks empirical evidence as few studies tested whether children’s accuracy of monitoring judgments as well as their monitoring behaviours are consistent across tasks. It is also not clear if children who provide more accurate monitoring judgments also show more frequent monitoring behaviours. In the current research study 53 elementary school children’s metacognitive monitoring was assessed with four tasks: on the one hand, the accuracy of children’s monitoring judgments was assessed with two computer-based tasks (one task required monitoring of memory and the other task required monitoring of reaction times); on the other hand, the frequency with which they engaged in monitoring behaviours was assessed with two construction tasks. Correlational analysis showed that there was no significant association between children’s monitoring judgment accuracies. In turn, children’s monitoring behaviour on two construction tasks was significantly positively associated. Intercorrelations between children’s monitoring judgment accuracies and monitoring behaviours showed that children who more accurately monitored their reaction time showed significantly more monitoring behaviour when working on construction tasks. Conversely, children’s monitoring judgment accuracy on a memory task was not associated with their monitoring behaviour. These findings suggest that the processes underlying children’s monitoring judgments may be task specific, whereas their tendency to engage in monitoring behaviours may be domain general.

However, participants might perceive the repetitive self-reporting in these data collection techniques as burdensome and demotivating, resulting in decreased compliance rates. In this tutorial paper, we present a user-centered approach aimed at making participation in experience sampling and daily diary studies a meaningful and fun experience for adolescents. Methods. In three major research projects that took place between 2019 – 2023, more than 4,000 Dutch adolescents participated (12 - 25 years old). To improve the participants’ user journey, adolescents were invited to co-design our studies and share their expertise in interviews (n = 459), focus groups (n = 101), design decisions (i.e., A/B tests, n = 107), pilots (n = 163), exit interviews (n = 167), and by answering user experience questionnaires (n = 2,109). Results. Across projects, we discovered five different main intrinsic and extrinsic motives to participate in intensive longitudinal studies: (1) rewards, (2) fun and interest, (3) helping science or the greater good, (4) helping the scientist or another person, and (5) gaining self-insight. We provide concrete examples of how we tailored our study designs to address these specific motives to optimize youth engagement. Conclusions. The engagement of adolescents in intensive longitudinal studies can be enhanced by making it a meaningful and enjoyable experience, aligned with their own motives.",

          "abstract": "The fashion industry is a major environmental polluter, and behavioral scientists can investigate strategies to reduce obstacles to second-hand sustainable solutions. We propose an evolutionary framework rooted in the Parasite-Stress Theory of Values as a comprehensive explanation for the cultural, individual, and situational differences in second-hand clothing, postulating that second-hand clothing triggers evolved pathogen-avoidance mechanisms that form a barrier to second-hand purchases. This barrier can be mitigated by hygiene-related sensory cues, like a clean-laundry odor. In a field study (N = 257), we counterbalanced three odor conditions (clean-laundry, citrus, and regular store odor), and found that clean-laundry scent significantly boosted purchasing behavior by overriding the negative effect of germ-aversion. Indeed, among store’s customers, higher levels of pathogen avoidance resulted in less spending and more negative attitudes toward second-hand clothing. Further support for our mechanistic model is provided by the lab pilot study—where clean-laundry scent was shown to significantly reduce pathogen concerns, while enhancing garments’ perceived value and appeal—and by experimentally increasing pathogen saliency in survey responders, resulting in more negative second-hand clothing attitudes. This research highlights the critical role of pathogen avoidance mechanisms and cleanliness cues in overcoming psychological barriers to effectively promote sustainable consumer practices.",

Several studies have demonstrated that increased perceptual fluency, induced by high versus low color contrast of presented statements, results in higher truth judgments. According to the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis, the unexpected switch from several low-fluency stimuli to a high-fluency stimulus is assumed to enhance perceived truthfulness. In two online studies (one preregistered), we aimed to replicate the central finding by Hansen, Dechêne, and Wänke (2008; Journal of Experimental Social Psychology) that discrepancies in color contrast influence truth judgments. Additionally, we extended the original design by varying the length of stimulus blocks presented in low or high color contrast. Contrary to previous findings, neither the level of perceptual fluency nor unexpected discrepancies in fluency affected truth judgments even though high-contrast statements were read faster than low-contrast ones, indicating that processing fluency was successfully manipulated. A meta-analysis combining our two experiments with published studies shows that the effect of perceptual fluency induced by color contrast on truth judgments may not be as robust as previously thought.",

          "authors": "Robin Gerrits",
          "abstract": "Although word production is considered a strongly left hemispheric lateralized function, its cerebral asymmetry varies among individuals. The most popular way of determining hemisphere dominance is to calculate a laterality index (LI) by comparing brain activity between the two hemispheres. Large LIs can readily be classified as left or right dominant, but there is no consensus on how to treat bilateral LIs indicating (near) symmetrical activity. The problem with interpreting very small LIs is perpetuated by a lack of reliability, stemming from the challenge of systematically investigating these uncommon cases \n(usually ≤ 10% of a sample). To address this gap, we performed two studies that investigated the reliability and across-methods generalizability of bilateral LIs obtained from functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCDS), an ultrasound-based approach that measures cerebral blood flow velocity. In Study 1, we compared reproducibility of bilateral LIs (n=35) and clearly lateralized LIs (n=32) during a letter verbal fluency fTCDS task across two sessions. While left-lateralized classifications were highly replicable (97% reproduced), poorer reproducibility was observed for bilateral classifications (51% reproduced). In fact, dichotomous left-right categorization yielded more reliable outcomes than assigning participants with bilateral LIs to a separate category (80% reproduced). Study 2 assessed whether small fTCDS asymmetry extended to other instruments for determining cerebral laterality (visual half field method and fMRI). Participants consistently classified as bilateral by fTCDS (n=18) also exhibited reduced group-level asymmetry in these other methods. Based on these results, we suggest that LIs reflect a combination of idiosyncratic cerebral asymmetry, state-dependent fluctuations, and measurement noise. Our findings also indicate that a subset of the population has a neural system for word production that is inherently weakly lateralized, although true hemispheric equivalence is likely extremely rare. Finally, we offer recommendations for classifying asymmetry in clinical and research contexts.",

          "abstract": "It is common in behavioural sciences to require subjects of an experiment to sign an informed consent form. The form explains the procedures and risks, and the signature certifies that the subject is aware and consents. The motivation for this requirement – protection of the subject – is noble and uncontroversial, but the implications do not all align with that motivation. I argue that the subject's signature is often unnecessary. Signature commits – rather than protects – the subject, and produces a trace with sensitive personal information that prevents full anonymization and puts a burden on the investigator and institution to protect and curate that information. Trust based on shared norms is replaced by a contract that has to cover every eventuality and thus may be hard to understand. Those downsides are absent when a signature is not gathered. Signed consent might protect the investigator or institution, but that is distinct from protecting the subject. The decision to gather a signature should be justified to the IRB by the investigator, rather than the decision to not gather it. A well-designed informed consent form, unsigned, can protect both subject and investigator.",

          "abstract": "Recent developments suggest that Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach for approximating empirical correlation matrices of item responses by utilizing item embeddings and their cosine similarities. In this paper, we introduce a novel tool, which we label SEMbeddings. This tool integrates mpnet-personality (a fine-tuned embedding model) with latent measurement models to assess model fit or misfit prior to data collection. To support our statement, we apply SEMbeddings to the 96 items of the VIA-IS-P, which measures 24 different character strengths, using responses from 31,697 participants. Our analysis shows a significant, though not perfect, correlation (r = .67) between the cosine similarities of embeddings and empirical correlations among items. We then demonstrate how to fit confirmatory factor analyses on the cosine similarity matrices produced by mpnet-personality and interpret the outcomes using modification indices. We found that relying on traditional fit indices when using SEMbeddings can be misleading as they often lead to more conservative conclusions compared to empirical results. Nevertheless, they provide valuable suggestions about possible misfit, and we argue that the modification indices obtained from these models could serve as a useful screening tool to make informed decisions about items prior to data collection. As LLMs become increasingly precise and new fine-tuned models are released, these procedures have the potential to deliver more reliable results, potentially transforming the way new questionnaires are developed.",

          "authors": "Timo Kvamme; Merlin Monzel; Yoko Nagai; Juha Silvanto",
          "abstract": "Aphantasia, characterized by absent or reduced visual mental imagery, has been associated with alexithymia and negative mental health outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these associations remain unclear. Since mental health is closely linked to interoception, we examined whether interoceptive processing plays a role in these relationships, assessing self-reported imagery vividness (VVIQ), subjective interoceptive accuracy and attention, alexithymia, and mental health, including anxiety and depression, in individuals with (n = 153, VVIQ = 16–32) and without aphantasia (n = 680, VVIQ = 33–80). The results revealed distinct patterns between these groups. In the aphantasia group, higher VVIQ was associated with greater alexithymia and poorer mental health outcomes, suggesting that individuals with weak imagery (hypophantasia) exhibited more emotional difficulties than those with almost no imagery (core aphantasia). In contrast, in the non-aphantasia group, VVIQ correlated negatively with alexithymia and positively with mental health, aligning with previous research indicating a protective role of vivid imagery. Structural equation modelling confirmed that alexithymia strongly mediated the link between VVIQ and negative mental health outcomes in both groups, reinforcing alexithymia as a mediator between imagery ability and well-being. Another key factor in these relationships was the ratio between subjective interoceptive accuracy and attention, which mediated the relationship between VVIQ and alexithymia and mental health outcomes. These findings highlight the heterogeneity within aphantasia, distinguishing hypophantasia from core aphantasia and revealing distinct interoceptive and mental health profiles.",

We present meta-analytic insight of relationships between FWSS and various antecedents and outcomes derived from the Career Construction Model of Adaptation (CCMA) based on K = 74 studies, k = 80 independent samples, and N = 27,643 individuals.

FWSS is also strongly associated with work engagement (rc = .39). The relative weights analysis confirms the distinct relationship between FWSS and PCBs. Additionally, the mediation analysis indicates that career adaptability acts as a mediator between FWSS and PCBs, offering deeper insights into the role of FWSS within the CCMA. Finally, demographic and contextual variables, such as age and cultural individualism, influence some of the examined relationships. The meta-analysis contributes to a refinement of the CCMA and future research on the role of FWSS in career development.",

          "abstract": "In three experiments (n = 20 each), we investigated the mechanisms by which the metacognitive system produces the confidence serial dependence (CSD) effect in a series of perceptual decisions. We found that confidence ratings were systematically attracted to those in preceding trials (similar to “confidence leak”), even with matched performance. We further found that CSD required explicit confidence judgments in preceding decisions and was largely independent of preceding motor response patterns. By comparing a factorial combination of computational models, we found that CSD arises from the jittering of a fixed decision criterion template based on past information instead of from dynamically updating criteria across trials. As our study focuses on decisions on a lab-based visual motion task, our model needs to be tested against data from other tasks and scenarios. Our results suggest that our metacognition adapts in response to recent perceptual decisions.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol consumption can pose health risks and cause social problems, hence harmful drinking is a global health concern. Acculturation has been theorized and examined as a key driver for drinking behaviors. In this State of the Science article, we define sociocultural and psychological acculturation, and describe three causal theories associated with socialization and learning, stress and coping, and accessibility and opportunity. Data have shown small-to-moderate associations linking acculturation factors to drinking outcomes. Many existing studies measure acculturation with demographic proxies and static cultural orientation indicators. Underlying causal mechanisms are typically inferred rather than tested directly, with limited focus on key proximal factors such as stress responses, drinking motives, and cultural norms. Furthermore, current alcohol interventions lack alignment with acculturation science and fail to target modifiable, drinking-related factors. To advance the field and bridge research-to-practice gaps, studies should move beyond broad demographic markers and examine systematically the psychological and social pathways linking acculturation to alcohol use. We advocate for the adoption of context-specific measures, daily life study methods to capture acculturation’s dynamic effects on drinking, and research across diverse global populations. We call for the field to integrate the acculturation framework into broader alcohol research and interventions to address individual and cultural variations in drinking behaviors, incorporate sociocultural influences into existing models of alcohol use to bridge gaps in generalizability, and enhance intervention effectiveness.",

Across six studies, we tested the possibility that simulation affects decisions by making people more likely to choose options they simulate. Study 1 first established a correlation between how much people naturally simulated an option for an upcoming personal decision over one week and the likelihood that they would choose that option. Studies 2a and 2b demonstrated that simulation caused a small but significant increase in the likelihood a person would choose the simulated option for their personal decision relative to a non-simulated option. Finally, Studies 3, 4a, and 4b, revealed that simulation shapes decisions in controlled laboratory experiments where options were matched on initial preference. This work suggests that episodic simulation may contribute to a feedback loop, reinforcing preferences by making people more likely to choose options they simulate.",

By drawing on and extending warranting theory, this paper examined how source roles (self vs. third party) and writer labels (AI vs. human) interact to affect impression formation and message effects in the AIMC setting of hotel reviews. Two pre-registered experiments (Study 1: N = 461; Study 2: N = 444) found that, for the same hotel review, third-party reviewers were perceived more favorably than self-reviewers (i.e., hotel managers), leading to more positive evaluations of the hotel. Reviews attributed to AI writers negatively impacted impressions of the reviewer and diminished the review’s impact, with third-party reviewers more negatively affected by AI writer labels than self-reviewers. AI labels of user-generated content can therefore move people out of their default impression formation state. We demonstrate theoretical advancements for warranting theory and AIMC.",

The phenomenological gap between culture-level ecological variables and individual complexity is large, and yet socio-ecological theory suggests the larger cultural context could systematically influence individual thought complexity. The present 3 studies evaluate this relationship by using culture-level ecological stressors to predict individual integrative complexity of political speeches (Studies 1 and 2) or a survey of socioecological stressor recognition to predict the complexity of open-ended opinion statements from laypersons (Study 3). Specifically, Study 1 evaluated political speeches across 9 nations from 1990 to 2023, and Study 2 evaluated political speeches across 50 U.S. states from 2000 to 2023. Increased culture-level resource scarcity was associated with lower individual-level complexity in both Studies 1 and 2, but increased economic inequality/diversity was associated with lower complexity only across nations in Study 1. Using a nationwide survey of American participants, Study 3 showed that increased awareness of socioecological stressors decreased complexity. Analysis of complexity subtypes suggest these effects are likely due to both cognitive strain (all three studies) and strategic defensive of beliefs (Study 3). This multi-method, multi-national set of findings suggests that socio-ecological theories can be better applied to understand the ecological origins of complex thought.",

Yet our scientific understanding of how we express positive emotions is largely based on posed displays. Here, we empirically test how 22 positive emotions are expressed on the face using the participant-negotiated episodic recall method. European respondents (n = 163) narrated emotional events from their lives (data collected from 2018 to 2020). Frequency analyses of the extracted facial expressions (67, 279 datapoints) mostly supported our pre-registered hypotheses for each of the 22 emotions. The results from our confirmatory analyses are illustrated with the aid of animated videos: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pTz_cObpFEYs5hsGUGOPVjUd0nq0Acgt?usp=drive_link. We also applied network models to exploratorily probe whether discrete positive emotions would be associated with specific patterns of facial behaviors. Consistent patterns of facial expressions were found for 19 positive emotions; some were simple (e.g., hope, interest), while others were highly complex and involved multiple facial actions (e.g., amusement, triumph). Together, these results provide a tentative map of what specific positive emotions look like when spontaneously shown on the face. Importantly, none of the positive emotions were expressed merely by smiling alone, demonstrating that people show that they feel good in a wide range of qualitatively different ways.",

Few studies to date, however, have examined the relationship between MW and more severe mood health outcomes, including bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD) risk and mood symptoms in emerging adults. Across two pre-registered studies (Study 1: Spring 2019, n = 132; Study 2: Spring 2020, n = 133) we assessed associations between self-reported BSD risk and mood symptoms with overall, positive-valence, and negative-valence MW-frequency four times a day across 14 consecutive days. No significant associations emerged between overall MW-frequency and BSD risk or mood symptoms across both studies. In Study 1, BSD risk was associated with increased positive MW-frequency, which held when controlling for current symptoms. In Study 2, mania symptoms were associated with greater positive MW-frequency, and both depressive and manic symptoms were associated with greater negative MW-frequency. These findings suggest mood-congruent associations between positive-valence MW and BSD-relevant risk and mood symptoms, whereas negative-valence MW was associated with both depression and mania mood severity. Further work is warranted to investigate the translational relevance of thought patterns in everyday life with mood disturbance dimensions.",

While social context influences prosocial behavior in healthy individuals, its role in the development of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. We hypothesized that situation-specific prosocial behaviors would predict long-term psychiatric symptoms in individuals with common psychiatric disorders. \n\nMethod. In a 1-year longitudinal cohort study (n = 4484 at baseline), we followed a population sample with self-reported psychiatric disorders to investigate if six situation-specific prosocial behavior subtypes were associated with and predictive of alcohol use, substance use, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Prosocial behaviors were assessed at baseline, while psychiatric symptoms were measured at baseline and monthly. Multiple regression and latent class linear mixed models were used to identify associations and predictions.\n\nResults. Reduced anonymous prosociality at baseline was associated with (β = -.250, p = .007) and predictive of (β = -.025, p = .005) later alcohol use. Increased public prosociality was associated with (β = .226, p = .011) and predictive of later substance use (β = .024, p = .002), and increased emotional prosociality was associated with (β = 1.17, p &lt; .001) and predictive of later anxiety symptoms (β = -.128, p &lt; .001). No predictive effects were found for depressive symptoms.\n\nConclusions. Situation-specific prosocial behaviors predict subsequent alcohol use, substance use, and anxiety symptoms in psychiatric disorders. Our findings suggest that prosocial subtypes may inform both risk and resilience factors and can guide prevention efforts and mental health treatments.",

We discuss the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying semantic construction and pragmatic inference, emphasizing their interdependencies. Findings on the neural correlates of pragmatic processes, such as speech acts and conversational implicatures, challenge traditional distinctions and reveal fluid boundaries across the continuum. Case studies on turn-taking and gesture pragmatics illustrate the utility of integrating annotated naturalistic data with neurophysiological methods to investigate communicative language use. By leveraging multimodal frame-semantics based annotation of naturalistic datasets, this work provides critical tools to understand how meaning emerges and operates at the interface of linguistic form, meaning, and social interaction, paving the way for refined neurophysiological mapping methods of linguistic phenomena.",

Two studies reveal unique patterns for each construct in predicting IWAH across levels (i.e., community, country, &amp; all humanity): while perceived moral similarity predicts IWAH across levels, social hope predicts IWAH within community and country, and PSSA predicts IWAH globally. Study 2 experimentally manipulated each construct and found that the social hope task increased IWAH across levels.

The current research builds theory regarding when and why the business case for diversity increases versus decreases support for diversity. Drawing on Prospect Theory, we first demonstrate that increasing diversity is viewed as risky because diversity is perceived as having more upsides, but also more downsides, compared to homogeneity. Next, we theorize that, although the business case for diversity is typically framed in terms of the benefits that diversity offers (i.e., gain-frame), the business case is more likely to boost support for diversity when framed in terms of the losses that diversity can prevent (i.e., loss-frame). Finally, we theorize that because risk perceptions are the underlying mechanism, the differential effects of a gain versus loss framing for the business case are more likely to emerge when people have stronger perceptions of diversity as risky. Seven multi-method studies, including surveys, archival analyses, and experiments, support our model of diversity as risky and offer important insight into how to increase support for diversity.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the experience of minority stress among LGBTQ+ youth varies across regions with high and low levels of stigma (e.g., laws, policies, and cultural norms that limit the lives of individuals with stigmatized identities). Some evidence suggests that stigma can undermine response to individual-level psychosocial interventions among youth, creating the need to identify factors that may buffer against minority stressors’ effects in high-stigma contexts. Social support may be one such factor. Therefore, among LGBTQ+ youth who received a digital, single-session intervention (SSI) focused on minority stress, we investigated whether structural and internalized stigma and social support predicted intervention response, independently or interactively. Specifically, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth in environments characterized by high stigma would report weaker SSI responses. Further, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth who perceived higher social support would report stronger SSI responses. We also tested structural stigma and social support as moderators. Using data from a previously-completed randomized evaluation, we analyzed data from 244 LGBTQ+ adolescents, aged 13 to 16 years, across 181 counties in 46 U.S. states, who engaged with the SSI. We created a factor representing structural stigma using confirmatory factor analysis at the county level. No evidence emerged for structural stigma or social support as a moderator of intervention effects on internalized stigma, identity pride, or mental health-related outcomes, either at post-intervention or at 2-week follow up. Results speak to the potentially broad utility of the SSI tested in this trial for LGBTQ+ youth with limited access to mental health support.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Extant survey measures of subjective response to alcohol, an important risk factor for alcohol problems, query the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects but do not consider how intensely individuals experience them. We tested whether new measures of the intensity of alcohol effects, alongside the “number of drinks,” contributed uniquely or interactively in predicting alcohol problems. We examined associations among these subjective response variables with race and sex assigned at birth. Method: Participants (N=246; 18-50 years; 44.3% Black; 55.7% White; 58.4% assigned female; 41.6% assigned male) were oversampled for alcohol-related risk and completed an online survey. Participants reported the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects (ASQ; Fleming et al., 2016), the intensity of these alcohol effects, alcohol-related problems, and covariates (heavy drinking frequency, tolerance, demographics). Results: According to confirmatory factor analyses, two factors underlay the ‘number of drinks items (“stimulation-number of drinks,” “sedation-number of drinks”), and the same for the alcohol effect intensity items (“stimulation intensity,” “sedation intensity”). Stimulation intensity and sedation-number of drinks were significantly associated with, and interacted to predict, alcohol problems; individuals reporting both greater stimulation intensity and needing more drinks to experience sedation showed greatest risk. Black relative to White individuals reported greater intensity of, and needing more drinks to feel, stimulation. Male relative to female individuals reported needing more drinks to feel sedation. Conclusions: Participants’ self-reports of the intensity of alcohol effects may capture an important aspect of subjective response that could improve existing survey-based measures of this important alcohol-related risk factor.",

          "authors": "Annika Boldt; Yishu Sun; Kobe Desender",
          "abstract": "When assessing our decisions, the normative strategy involves giving equal weight to each evidence sample when computing confidence. However, recent findings suggest that the brain tends to overweight decision-congruent information when forming confidence judgements (i.e., positive-evidence bias). Here, we re-analyzed nine datasets from human participants who judged the average color of eight shapes and gave their confidence. This task precisely allowed us to disentangle the impact of choice-confirming and choice-conflicting evidence on the formation of confidence. Strikingly, participants overly relied on evidence that conflicts with their choice, contrary to the normative model and the PEB. To explain this response-incongruent evidence effect in the computation of confidence, we fitted an extended log-posterior-ratio for confidence model to our data and show that the same robust averaging principle that influences decisions also accounts for these confidence effects: incongruent evidence receives a stronger weight in the computation of confidence because it lies closer to the category boundary around which there is heightened sensitivity. In a preregistered experiment, we then empirically demonstrate that an experimentally induced shift in the category boundary affects the computation of confidence in otherwise identical stimuli. We conclude that confidence depends on dis-confirmatory evidence due to downstream consequences from decision-making mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Recent years have seen multiple reports of disruptive behaviour at live music events, leading many to question the capacity of audiences to regulate their behaviour. This matters both for positive audience experience and for crowd safety. Whilst some previous studies have examined violence in music audiences, there is almost no research looking at the current phenomenon of varied forms of disruption, the psychological antecedents of disruptive behaviour, and potential mitigations. We report three studies addressing these questions experientially, observationally, and statistically, with interviews (n = 27), an ethnographic field study (n performances = 13, n interviews = 44), and a pre-registered questionnaire survey (n = 2,025). Results suggest that audience perceptions of disruption are partly contingent upon perceived group norms. Reports of disruption are more likely to occur where there is normative misalignment between disparate groups in attendance at the same event. Audience members do attempt to regulate each other’s behaviour, based on expectations of support and normative alignment, but some interventions can themselves be disruptive. We offer recommendations to venues and event organisers on how to reduce disruptive behaviour, based on social identity and group norms.",

          "abstract": "Cybersickness, or sickness caused by virtual reality (VR), represents a significant threat to the usability of VR applications. Repeated exposure to the same VR stimulus causes a reduction in cybersickness, referred to as Cybersickness Abatement from Repeated Exposure (CARE). This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

          "abstract": "The capacity of music to alleviate stress has been the subject of extensive research. Yet, findings from laboratory studies remain inconsistent, which has been linked to heterogeneity of the music stimuli used. To address the need for standardized, pre-tested music stimuli, we developed the Music for Stress Alleviation (MUSA) playlists and conducted an initial validation of their effectiveness. Six playlists were curated for stress reduction, containing instrumental music with a low tempo, low arousal, and neutral to positive valence, and representing various genres (piano, ambient, jazz, lounge, guitar, and lo-fi). Sixty healthy female participants were assigned to one of the six playlists. Pre- and post-listening, we measured participants’ affective states using the Relaxed Positive Affect (RPA) and Safe/Content Positive Affect (SCPA) scales of the Types of Positive Affect Scale, and the Good-Bad and Calm-Nervous dimensions of the Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire. All playlists led to significantly increased RPA (medium-to-large effect sizes), while a subset also enhanced SCPA, Calm, and Good mood. Participants rated the playlists as highly relaxing. These findings provide initial evidence of the effectiveness of the MUSA playlists for music-induced stress relief. Further studies in larger and stressed samples are needed to confirm and expand on these findings.",

The present work explores the relationship between identification with all humanity (IWAH) and three constructs largely overlooked in related work: perceived moral similarity across humanity, perceived similarity of oneself to animals (PSSA), and hope for society (i.e., social hope). Two studies reveal unique patterns for each construct in predicting IWAH across levels (i.e., community, country, &amp; all humanity): while perceived moral similarity predicts IWAH across levels, social hope predicts IWAH within community and country, and PSSA predicts IWAH globally. Study 2 experimentally manipulated each construct and found that the social hope task increased IWAH across levels. Both perceived moral similarity and PSSA tasks increased IWAH within community, with smaller but similar effects on global IWAH. These findings provide novel insight into causal mechanisms underlying IWAH, with implications for interventions fostering global human identification.",

Second, we explore the role of the brain’s emotional and decision-making systems in motivating climate action. We also highlight neuroscience’s potential to predict population- level behaviours and aid in the systematic development of interventions. By addressing current knowledge gaps, we identify the next steps for deepening our understanding of the interwoven connections between climate action and the brain.",

A key conundrum is why their prognoses are often poorer than children with evidenced brain lesions. How can children with early focal lesions acquire language so well compared with children with DLD who do not present with gross neurological abnormalities? A possibility raised by Dell and Chang (2013) is that learning is fundamentally derailed by an exemplar-based learning style. Such a process has been robustly demonstrated in studies of artificial neural networks. This theoretical article discusses exemplar theory, the role exemplars may play in language development, and surveys evidence suggesting an exemplar-based learning style in DLD. It concludes that this provides an interesting new approach to both explaining the condition, and designing new therapies.",

We present a large-scale cross-cultural study examining aesthetic preferences across five distinct modalities extensively explored in the literature: shape, curvature, colour, musical harmony and melody. Our investigation gathers 401,403 preference judgements from 4,835 participants across 10 countries, systematically sampling two-dimensional parameter spaces for each modality. The findings reveal both universal patterns and cultural variations. Preferences for shape and curvature cross-culturally demonstrate a consistent preference for symmetrical forms. While colour preferences are categorically consistent, relational preferences vary across cultures. Musical harmony shows strong agreement in interval relationships despite differing regions of preference within the broad frequency spectrum, while melody shows the highest cross-cultural variation. These results suggest that aesthetic preferences emerge from an interplay between shared perceptual mechanisms and cultural learning.",

Participants completed measures of dark personality traits and made decisions about sharing others' personal information in pre-test and post-test conditions with varying levels of incentives. Results indicated no significant relationship between dark triad scores and decisions to share information in the initial introduction stage or in the presence of incentives.

          "abstract": "Objective: Extant survey measures of subjective response to alcohol, an important risk factor for alcohol problems, query the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects but do not consider how intensely individuals experience them. We tested whether new measures of the intensity of alcohol effects, alongside the “number of drinks,” contributed uniquely or interactively in predicting alcohol problems. We examined associations among these subjective response variables with race and sex assigned at birth. Method: Participants (N=246; 18-50 years; 44.3% Black; 55.7% White; 58.4% assigned female; 41.6% assigned male) were oversampled for alcohol-related risk and completed an online survey. Participants reported the number of drinks to experience alcohol effects (ASQ; Fleming et al., 2016), the intensity of these alcohol effects, alcohol-related problems, and covariates (heavy drinking frequency, tolerance, demographics). Results: According to confirmatory factor analyses, two factors underlay the ‘number of drinks items (“stimulation-number of drinks,” “sedation-number of drinks”), and the same for the alcohol effect intensity items (“stimulation intensity,” “sedation intensity”). Stimulation intensity and sedation-number of drinks were significantly associated with, and interacted to predict, alcohol problems; individuals reporting both greater stimulation intensity and needing more drinks to experience sedation showed greatest risk. Black relative to White individuals reported greater intensity of, and needing more drinks to feel, stimulation. Male relative to female individuals reported needing more drinks to feel sedation. Conclusions: Participants’ self-reports of the intensity of alcohol effects may capture an important aspect of subjective response that could improve existing survey-based measures of this important alcohol-related risk factor.",

          "abstract": "The subordinate meaning of a homonym becomes temporarily more accessible after it is encountered, an effect termed word-meaning priming. Over the longer-term, word-meaning priming is better maintained across periods of sleep compared with wakefulness. This has been explained as sleep actively consolidating episodic memories related to recent linguistic events (Gaskell et al., 2019). Here, we tested this hypothesis by investigating whether word-meaning priming can be boosted following sleep using targeted memory reactivation (TMR), a technique of biassing specific memories for sleep-based consolidation by presenting information-associated sensory cues during sleep. Experiment 1 confirmed that word-meaning priming is elicited with the inclusion of encoding instructions that are necessary for a TMR manipulation. In Experiment 2, 40 (of 80) homonyms were primed toward their subordinate meaning in an exposure phase via a sentence, which was also associated with an auditory cue (the homonym) for TMR. Participants then took a ~2 hour nap, where half of the cues from exposure (memory cues) were replayed with the aim of strengthening the subordinate sentence meaning, along with 20 cues that had not been encountered previously (control cues). After sleep, there was an overall word-meaning priming effect, however there was no additional benefit of TMR on priming, nor did TMR benefit the recall of contextual information. Interestingly, there was an increased sleep spindle/beta band power response to memory cues relative to control cues, indicating cue-evoked memory reprocessing during sleep. These findings imply a bounded role of sleep in actively consolidating linguistic-related memories.",

          "abstract": "Creative ideas often stem from a deliberate process involving the exploration and exploitation of our existing knowledge. This study explores the cognitive mechanisms behind creative problem-solving, focusing on the phases of idea generation and evaluation in the Remote Associates Test (RAT). Generating novel ideas relies on an effective, goal-directed search through semantic memory, while evaluation requires the careful assessment of potential ideas for their appropriateness. These phases are analogous to semantic control processes, which manage the search, manipulation and selection of knowledge in line with specific goals. The current work investigates how individual differences in these cognitive processes relate to performance in divergent and convergent thinking tasks, by deconstructing the standard RAT to isolate generation and evaluation processes. Further, we examined the role of retrieval strategies, specifically clustering (grouping related concepts) and switching (moving between different areas of semantic space), in creative thought. Our findings indicate that the ability to generate ideas under multiple constraints predicts fluency in divergent thinking tasks, while strong evaluation skills may inhibit originality. Furthermore, the analysis of clustering and switching strategies reveals that effective semantic search involves a balance between deep exploration of specific conceptual areas and broad exploration across different semantic clusters. These findings suggest that multiple strategies can lead to creative success, underscoring the importance of flexible cognitive strategies in navigating the semantic space during creative problem-solving.",

          "abstract": "Introduction \nCreative Health can be described as creative approaches and community-based activities which have benefits for health and wellbeing. Health professionals are seeking specific evidence-based education to equip them with the knowledge needed to advise, and recommend community-based programmes and creative arts therapies. The current review seeks to understand ‘What is known about how visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing are embedded in health and medical education?’. Given that Creative Health is a general term that can be applied to a vast array of activities the current scoping review focuses on visual and performing arts, to facilitate more specific discussions.\n\nMethods\nA systematic search across six different databases [CINAHL, ERIC, Medline, AMED, Proquest Dissertations, and Web of Science] identified 6090 papers. The core search terms were 1. Visual arts; performance arts and creative writing 2. Tertiary education and 3. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the characteristics learning activities. Thematic analysis was used to identify the intended learning outcomes from visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing in health professional education. \n\nResults\nOf the 6417 articles originally identified, 284 studies were included in the analysis from 34 different countries. Nursing was the most represented profession, followed closely by medicine. An extremely wide range of art practices were identified including graffiti, sculpture, clowning, cinematic arts, music, creative writing, poetry, dance, photo, and art viewing. The review characterises how visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing are currently being used, including the group size, setting, engagement style, and collaboration with creative practitioners. Surprisingly, only 10% of studies identified educated professionals on the evidence base underpinning creative interventions and therapies, and no mention of social prescribing was identified. Finally this review highlights that professional development (promoting empathy, communication, preparedness for practice, negative attitudes), clinical practice (critical thinking, specialist knowledge, clinical skills), and personal development (self-awareness, wellbeing) are the intended learning outcomes from visual arts, performing arts, and creative writing in health professional education.\n\nDiscussion\nThis review highlights the need for more educational provision in relation to patient-focussed outcomes, in community arts, creative arts therapies, and social prescribing. Future curricula could engage arts practitioners and cultural spaces more directly to support experiential learning approaches and evaluate creative techniques to identify if they can enhance student learning. Together these findings will equip medical educators and creative practitioners to join forces to develop engaging opportunities for authentic creativity, that are matched to specific learning outcomes mandated by professional registration bodies.",

          "abstract": "A metacognitive learner acts in a planful way, monitors their progress, flexibly adapts their strategies, and reflects on their learning. Unsurprisingly, a metacognitive approach to learning is an important predictor of children’s academic performance and many attempts have been made to promote metacognition in young children. The current meta-analytic study evaluates the impact of such metacognition interventions on outcomes related to self-regulated learning and academic achievement in typically developing pre- and elementary school children. Structural, content-related, and methodological moderators were tested in this study including 349 effect sizes from 67 studies. An overall effectiveness of metacognition interventions was evidenced at immediate post-test g = 0.48 (95% CI [0.35, 0.61]), and at follow-up g = 0.29 (95% CI [0.17, 0.40]). Interestingly, metacognition interventions effectively enhanced children’s self-efficacy only at follow-up, suggesting that the positive impact of these interventions can unfold over a protracted period. For the first time, children’s executive functions were considered as outcome variables and results indicated a positive impact of metacognition interventions on these variables. One notable finding was that interventions that were delivered by teachers or task materials were more effective than interventions that were delivered by researchers for two outcomes related to self-regulated learning. This finding may reflect recent improvements in how teachers and researchers collaborate to develop intervention programs. The study supports and extends existing evidence that young learners benefit from metacognition interventions in myriad ways and provides novel insights relevant for pedagogical practice and theories of self-regulated learning.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the relationship between family affluence, an indicator of socio-economic status, and the mental well-being of approximately 20,000 children and young adults in Flanders, using data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. To understand this relationship, we assess the mediating roles of physical activity and dietary behavior.\n\nTraditional mediation analysis approaches, such as the parallel mediation model within the Baron and Kenny framework, have been criticized for producing path-specific effects that lack clear causal interpretation. In contrast, the counterfactual framework for causal inference introduced natural direct and indirect effects, enhancing clarity around the assumptions required for effect identification. However, natural effects face practical limitations: they may provide limited insights into real-world interventions and are difficult to identify when multiple mediators share unmeasured common causes or when the causal structure is unclear.\n\nIn this paper, we address these challenges using interventional direct and indirect effects, which require fewer assumptions for identification and offer greater relevance for policy interventions. Our analysis demonstrates robust evidence for the mediating role of physical activity in the association between family affluence and mental well-being. In contrast, the mediating role of dietary behavior is less substantiated. These findings indicate that interventions aimed at enhancing physical activity among children and young adolescents with low socio-economic status could potentially improve their mental well-being.",

We find that 42\\% of the readers exhibit reading facilitation effects, while only 2\\% improve reading comprehension accuracy. We further observe that reading fluency benefits are larger for slower and less experienced readers, while comprehension benefits are more substantial in lower comprehension readers, but not vice versa. Finally, we find that high-complexity original texts are key for enhancing reading fluency, while large complexity reduction is more pertinent to improving comprehension. Our study highlights the potential of cognitive measures in the evaluation of text simplification and distills empirically driven principles for enhancing simplification effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "What differentiates a happy day from a typical one? Answering this question can help to identify the building blocks of a happy life, but little is known about what makes some days better than others. To identify the ingredients of a good day, we used interpretable machine learning techniques to assess how time spent on over 100 activities predicted whether Americans rated their day as typical or “better than typical.” Using data from the 2013 (N = 9286) and 2021 (N = 6196) waves of the American Time Use Survey, we identified clear tipping points that distinguish better days from typical ones. Socializing was one of the most important activities for having a good day, but beyond 2 hours, additional socializing had little impact. Time spent with friends, in contrast, had an almost boundlessly positive effect. The impact of working was also highly time contingent. We found that working for up to six hours had no impact on whether people rated their day as better than usual. When individuals worked for more than six hours though, the effects rapidly turned negative. Taken together, our results suggest that good days emerge from the constantly shifting value of time; each minute in a day represents a choice between competing opportunities, with clear tipping points when benefits diminish and costs mount.",

          "authors": "Nivedita Bhaktha; Henning Silber; Clemens M. Lechner",
          "abstract": "Self-administered surveys are widely used in research across diverse disciplines. One of the major concerns for researchers working with self-administered surveys is the quality of the survey responses. Low-quality responses threaten the validity and replicability of studies and can lead to spurious within-group variability, lower reliability, and potential errors during hypothesis testing. To characterize response quality in a given dataset and detect potentially problematic responses or respondents, the recent literature has proposed many response quality indicators. However, this literature is scattered and suffers from a lack of conceptual and terminological clarity, which limits the practical utility of the indicators that have been proposed. This paper aims to contribute to overcoming these problems. Based on a structured review of existing response quality indicators, we propose a unifying conceptual framework for response quality issues in multi-item surveys. This framework proposes a tripartite distinction between (1) response styles, (2) insufficient effort responding, and (3) invalid responding. It also delineates the relationship between different response quality indicators and the response quality issue(s) they measure. The framework thus establishes a common theoretical point of reference and unified terminology for future work on response quality.",

The present study examined the extent to which age is associated with perceptions of good human and device teammates using latent factor analyses of responses to a large-scale survey. Results indicate that perceptions of good characteristics of technology, but not human, teammates change with age, particularly for aspects related to objective task performance and interpersonal communication. We demonstrate that these relationships are related to factors such as individual differences in anthropomorphism across the lifespan. These results underscore the importance of accounting for individual differences in perceptions of technology related to age.",

A neurobiological account of these prosodic rhythms is thus likely to benefit from insights on the neural coding principles underlying co-speech gestures. Here we consider a role for the information processing capacity of the vestibular system, a sensory system that encodes movements of the body, in the neural representation of prosody. Careful review of the vestibular system’s functional organization as a hierarchical and predictive system, its relevance for rhythmic sound sequences, dynamic attention, and its involvement in vocalization suggests vestibular codes may be important for the neural tracking of speech. As the kinematics and time course of co-speech movements mirror prosodic fluctuations in spoken prosody, we argue that the vestibular system helps encode and decode these prosodic features in multimodal discourse and possibly during auditory speech processing alone.",

We analyzed three well-studied event-related brain potential (ERP) components (P3b, N4, ERN) and found that there were no significant differences between the signals recorded from the BrainAmp and Cyton, and that both amplifiers adequately captured all three components.

          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts, but the extant literature repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. Researchers did not distinguish between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence, which may explain their somewhat unexpected results. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionism (i.e., perfectionistic standards) and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionism should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionism. We concluded that pursuing excellencism rather than perfectionistic standards should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Our results support the need to separate the pursuit of high and perfectionistic standards to better understand the sport motivation of perfection strivers. Our findings with sport participants are relevant to recreational sporting activities in which people participate mostly out of autonomous motivation.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

Although this method of data collection offers notable benefits such as access to more diverse samples and lower study costs, it is possible that rates of inattentive or otherwise invalid response patterns are more common when survey completion occurs without any oversight. To answer this question, undergraduate student participants (final n = 678; 65% women, 76% White/European American) were randomly assigned to complete a battery of self-report surveys either in a typical laboratory administration setting (in person) or remotely from the location of their choosing. Following a preregistered analytic plan, data from both conditions were screened using multiple methods for self-report data validation, including the use of embedded and stand-alone validity scales, response timing, and identification of multivariate outliers. Results showed null-to-small differences between survey administration conditions. However, differences between screening methods in the proportion of data flagged as “invalid” emerged.

Collective narcissism predicts (1) intergroup violence in escalating conflicts between antagonistic groups of comparable power (e.g., religious, political); (2) resistance or progressive violence, in which historically disadvantaged groups mobilize to challenge existing power structures; and (3) reactionary, supremacist, or state violence, in which traditionally advantaged groups seek to preserve and expand their dominance.

This study aimed to address this gap and deepen our understanding of how autistic youth experience loneliness. Specifically, the study investigated how autistic young people conceptualise loneliness, how they experience loneliness across different contexts, and what strategies they employ to cope with this feeling. Eleven autistic participants, aged 10 to 16, were interviewed online. The study used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to analyse the data. Four Group Experiential Themes (GETS) and twelve subthemes emerged. The four themes included: (1) conceptualisation of loneliness, (2) subjective experience of loneliness, (3) communicating feelings of loneliness, and (4) social interactions and networks. Findings revealed that participants distinguished between loneliness and aloneness, experienced various emotions and physical sensations linked to loneliness, and perceived their experiences differently at home and school. Most felt misunderstood if they shared their loneliness and preferred coping alone through enjoyable activities. The study highlights the need for clinicians to engage young autistic people in discussions about loneliness, offer safe spaces to share experiences, and design interventions specifically for their needs.",

Utilizing a leading AI detection tool, we analyzed over 1 million complaints and identified a significant increase in LLM usage following the release of ChatGPT. We establish a causal relationship between LLM usage and an increased likelihood of obtaining relief by employing instrumental variables to address endogeneity in LLM adoption. Experimental data further support this link, demonstrating that LLMs enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of consumer narratives. Our findings suggest that facilitating access to LLMs can help firms better understand consumer concerns and level the playing field among consumers.

Recent work by Mislavsky &amp; Gaertig (2022) shows that people sometimes employ different strategies when combining verbal versus numeric forecasts about the likelihood of future events. Specifically, likelihood judgments based on two verbal forecasts (e.g., “rather likely”) are more often extreme (relative to the forecasts) than are likelihood judgments based on two numeric forecasts (e.g., “70% probability”). The goal of the present research was to investigate whether advice-takers’ use of combination strategies can be sensitive to advice independence when differences in independence are highly salient and whether sensitivity to advice independence depends on the format in which advice is given. In two studies, we found that advice-takers became more extreme with their own likelihood estimate when combining forecasts from advisors who use separate evidence, as opposed to the same evidence. We also found that two verbal forecasts generally resulted in more extreme combined likelihood estimates than two numeric forecasts. However, the results did not suggest that sensitivity to advice independence depends on the format of advice.",

While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides a real-time method for capturing dynamic changes in behavior, traditional tasks and surveys are often too lengthy and demanding for repeated use in clinical settings. Integrating EMA with computational approaches offers a promising solution to predict smoking behavior dynamically while addressing the practical limitations of conventional assays, paving the way for more effective and scalable interventions. To evaluate the predictive value of computational markers derived from decision-making tasks and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data for short-term (daily smoking behavior) and long-term (cessation success) outcomes, and to assess the timing and amount of data collection needed for prediction. 79 daily smokers (mean age 25.64 years, 83% male) took part in a longitudinal experimental study involving EMA surveys of psychological states and decision-making tasks, delivered daily via a smartphone app, while undergoing a 5–6 week smoking cessation program. Using a machine-learning methodology (adaptive design optimization, ADO) to effectively generate task variables, we estimated computational markers from just 20 to 30 trials per day, reducing task length and participants burden. A time-lagged model incorporating both computational markers and self-reported daily psychological states provided the most accurate prediction of next-day smoking behavior. Higher levels of craving, depression, and ambiguity tolerance in decision-making on the previous day were significantly predictive of increased smoking amount the following day. Smoking cessation status at the end of treatment was most strongly predicted by lower discounting rates, reduced craving and stress, a longer smoking history, and greater engagement in treatment (AUC = 0.76). Notably, models based on data collected during the first week of follow-up, either on the decision-making tasks (AUC = 0.74) or psychological variables (AUC = 0.73), demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy for end-of-treatment smoking cessation. Combining computational markers with EMA data offers a dynamic and efficient approach for predicting smoking behavior and cessation success and holds promise for clinical applications.",

In the current work, using a photo elicitation method, we prioritize the perspectives of gender-diverse perceivers (N = 44) to answer fundamental questions about the representation of gender diversity in psychological stimuli. Participants overall indicated that existing stimuli failed to represent naturalistic gender diversity, and that the representation of gender diversity in stimuli is an important goal. However, participants voiced concerns about how this representation might be executed in the research context.

          "abstract": "When language is used for comic purposes, it often results in shared laughter at material which, presented in another form, could be considered unfortunate or even tragic. Moreover, various forms of humor can elicit negative emotions, such as discomfort and embarrassment. This is the case for cringe humor, which blends amusement with aversive reactions. Similarly, humor related to Covid-19 carries a bittersweet tone that, in part, mirrors the emotional complexity of cringe humor. While both forms have garnered widespread popularity, the emotional impact of their combination – and whether Covid-19 humor is as challenging to watch as traditional cringe humor – remains underexplored. For this chapter, we reanalyzed data from two large-scale studies on the reactions elicited by Covid-19 humor conducted in Italy and the US during 2020. Using the k-means bottom-up clustering technique, we examined how ratings of funniness and aversiveness align instances of pandemic-related humor with cringe humor. We also explored the role of individual and cultural factors. Our semi-automatic classification revealed the existence of a cringe humor space, consistent with theoretical models of cringe humor. Relative to other heterogeneous sets of humorous instances, cringe humor is characterized by relatively low perceived funniness and high perceived aversiveness, corresponding to a predominantly negative emotional response characteristic of this type of humor. The items that share these features are analyzed through pragmatic categories developed in the General Theory of Verbal Humor, detailing the targets of humorous critiques that made their recipients humorously cringe. Additionally, our findings highlight a complex relationship between age and the experience of cringe humor: while both young and old adults had similar responses to different situations, they tended to distance themselves from specific position(s) represented and/or mocked in the cringe humor items.",

Antisocial behaviors positively predicted all types of substance use (X2 = 5.79 to 59.07, p &lt; .001), while prosocial behaviors negatively predicted most substance use measures (X2 = -5.64 to 86.14, p = .862 to &lt; .001). After adjusting for covariance between antisociality and prosociality, it was found that conduct problems (X2 = 5.54 to 32.22, p = .005 to &lt; .001), criminal behavior (X2 = 3.61 to 33.77, p = .007 to &lt; .001), and institutional trust (X2 = -3.92 to 27.56, p = .262 to &lt; .001), were the most important predictors. \n\nConclusions. Antisocial behaviors and deficits in institutional trust at age 15 are strong and unique predictors of substance use and alcohol use disorder by age 17. This specific spectrum of social behaviors during the critical phase of adolescence is of relevance from a prevention perspective to minimize the risk of later development of substance abuse.",

          "abstract": "The warming of Earth’s surface temperatures poses a serious threat to the Earth’s ecosystem.  In 1996, world leaders agreed to limit this temperature rise to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while aiming to keep warming below 1.5°C. In order to achieve this, changes the consumption behaviours of households and individuals are needed. To encourage such change, websites have emerged which attempt to persuade individuals to adopt more sustainable behaviours.  This study explores twenty participants’ experiences using such websites.  The study employs a qualitative, longitudinal design, and utilises the think aloud method to examine the experience of using two web-based tools, Get-Greener and Climate Hero.  The study also investigates participants’ reflections on the sustainable behaviours recommended by these tools. During the two-week period, eight participants made small behavioural changes, six of which were recommended by the tools.  Key findings highlight the importance of persuasive design elements: feedback on current behaviour via footprint calculations, customised recommendations that consider personal circumstances, and ongoing support are valued by participants.  Participants preferred small, easy-to-implement ideas, highlighting barriers to larger-scale changes such as cost, limited access to sustainable alternatives, logistical issues, and a lack of clarity about what is sustainable.  Despite a general desire to adopt sustainable practices, intrinsic motivations such as convenience and financial considerations often outweighed pro-environmental intentions. Additionally, government leadership and social norms significantly influenced attitudes toward sustainability.  Participants expressed a need for clearer guidance and collective societal support to overcome these challenges.",

          "abstract": "Bilateral cochlear implantation is the typical intervention for children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss intended to support development of skills across language, cognitive, social, behavioural and academic domains. However, speech-perception outcomes post-implantation remain variable. This scoping review explores which contextual factors relate to speech perception and hearing outcomes following paediatric bilateral cochlear implantation based on themes aligned with Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory: 1) individual; 2) microsystem; 3) exosystem; 4) macrosystem; and 5) chronosystem. Twenty-three research articles met the criteria for inclusion, and the contextual factors identified ranged from the proximal context, such as individual cognitive and social development, cochlear implant usage and the home environment, to the distal context, such as socio-economic health determinants. Contextual factors were explored with a narrative synthesis approach, with methodological limitations discussed. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) criteria. Our results indicate that research on outcomes related to bilateral cochlear implantation should actively integrate and examine contextual factors in prospective, longitudinal designs. This approach will facilitate the development of interventions to target specific levels of the bioecological system, thereby improving outcomes for the paediatric bilateral cochlear implant recipient.",

          "abstract": "The Faux Pas Recognition Test (FPT) is a popular Theory of Mind (ToM) measure, which has previously been used with an open-answer format. The scoring and interpretation of this format is time-consuming and challenging. Additionally, there is currently no consensus on the correct scoring algorithm. We developed a closed answer format and compared various scoring algorithms to optimize this ToM measure. To assess the convergent and divergent validity, we compared correlations between the improved FPT and another ToM measure (the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition; MASC) and an emotion recognition test (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test; RMET). Further, we used a ROC analysis, to test which scoring algorithms could best differentiate between a community sample and three clinical samples. The results indicated that the empathy score suggested by Stone et al. (1998a) showed the highest convergent validity and lowest divergent validity. Further, it optimally differentiated between clinical and community samples. Thus, this scoring algorithm showed good construct validity, while at the same time identifying ToM impairments. Based on theoretical considerations, we also suggest to include the intention score. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting validated algorithms for more reliable and valid results.",

          "abstract": "Executing go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses toward objects can increase people's choices of go over no-go items, and of approach over avoidance items. Some theoretical accounts explain these effects as the results of merely executing these responses (i.e., action execution), while others propose that these choice effects stem from interpreting these motor responses as valenced actions (i.e., action interpretation). To test the role of action execution versus action interpretation in both go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses, we employed a recently developed training that combined both dimensions orthogonally. Participants either pressed a key or not (i.e., go/no-go) to control a shopping cart on screen, to either collect or not collect certain food items (i.e., approach/avoidance). After the training, they repeatedly chose between food items (i.e., candies) for real consumption. When the instructions framed the responses as approach/avoidance actions, participants (N = 98) preferred approach items over avoidance items, but did not show preferences between go and no-go items in their choices. In contrast, when the instructions framed the responses as go/no-go actions, participants (N = 98) preferred go items over no-go items, but did not show preferences between approach and avoidance items. Despite making the same actual responses in both instruction groups, action interpretation determined whether go/no-go or approach/avoidance actions influenced food choice. Disambiguating the interpretation of motor responses as clearly valenced and meaningful actions may therefore be a fruitful way to maximize the effectiveness of response-based behavioral interventions.",

Higher education programmes may approach this goal through content integration, meaning the extent to which instructional materials incorporate diversity content and represent minority cultures and groups in examples, data and information. This mixed-methods study explored the relation between diversity-related learning goals, content integration and students’ individual academic performance over eight consecutive first-year courses of a pedagogical sciences programme in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis of 76 instructional materials yielded that, in line with learning goals, most diversity content in instructional materials addressed ethnic and socioeconomic differences in society and education. Notably, courses with many nuanced representations of minority cultures and groups in examples (i.e., non-stigmatising representations) were also more likely to entail generalising or stigmatising examples (i.e., biased representations) in instructional materials. Next, Generalized Additive Modeling and Bayesian multilevel regression with data from 93 students (Mage = 19.88; 90% female) revealed that despite a linear relationship, neither diversity content nor diversity representation in instructional materials were related to students’ academic performance over the first year in higher education. We discuss the added value of exploring the alignment of the intended and implemented diversity-related curriculum and we recommend academic success indicators beyond academic performance for researching and creating more equitable learning environments in higher education.",

          "abstract": "Rumination has been identified as an important transdiagnostic factor in psychopathology. Traditionally studied as an intrapersonal cognitive process, rumination significantly impacts and is impacted by people’s relationships. In the present article, we propose a dynamic interpersonal approach to studying rumination, asserting that it is best understood by considering the interpersonal context in which rumination occurs. We start by outlining the traditional approach to rumination, and then provide evidence for how interpersonal processes affect rumination and vice versa. After explaining our dynamic interpersonal model of rumination (DIM-Rum), we suggest implications and future directions that require expanding current methods and collaborations. By considering people’s (intimate) relationships in the study of rumination and vice versa -the role of rumination in people’s relationships- we can develop more effective clinical interventions to improve both mental health and relationship quality.",

The most widespread explanation of this phenomenon is minority stress theory, which attributes poor mental health to stigmatization and discrimination by the rest of society. In this paper I argue that minority stress theory is not a sufficient explanation of poor mental health in sexual minorities. My arguments are based on four observations: 1) other social groups which experience or historically experienced discrimination do not suffer from poor mental health; 2) sexual minorities suffer from worse than average mental health even when they experience a low level of discrimination; 3) the quasi-experimental studies best suited to support this theory suffer from serious methodological errors; 4) a meta-analysis of genetic-biometric studies shows that most (although not all) of the disadvantage of sexual minority members disappear once familial factors are controlled for. Alternative theories are explored to explain the etiology of mental health problems in sexual minorities.",

          "abstract": "Semantic knowledge plays an active role in many well-known false memory phenomena, including those emerging from the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) task. In this experimental paradigm, indeed, humans tend to falsely recognize newly presented words via activation of other previously shown stimuli. In the present study we aimed to test what happens in cases in which no apparent prior semantic knowledge is available, like in the case of entirely novel lexical stimuli. To do so, we evaluated semantic similarity effects in a DRM task with lists entirely composed by pseudowords (or “novel words,” i.e., letter strings resembling real words but lacking assigned meanings). Semantic similarity between pseudowords were established through a distributional semantic model able to represent in a vector space, not only attested words but also unmapped strings as bags of character n-grams. Participants were instructed to memorize those lists and then to perform a recognition task. Results showed that participants false and veridical recognition increased with increasing semantic similarity between each stimulus and the stimuli comprising its list, as estimated by the distributional model. These findings extend previous evidence indicating that humans are sensitive to the semantic (distributional) patterns elicited by novel words by showing that this sensitivity can even induce humans to falsely recognize stimuli that they have never encountered in their entire lives.",

          "abstract": "A cognitive model of de(super)humanization is proposed advocating that de(super)humanization may be a product of individuals’ perceptions of social targets as deviating from prototypical humanness (DPH) drawn from people’s social experiences which entails moderately high levels of warmth (i.e., friendliness and morality) and capability (i.e., various human capabilities). As social targets moving farer away from the center of the two-dimensional space representing prototypical humanness, they may be de(super)humanized according to the magnitude and direction of the deviation. Whereas a deviation within a certain range may not be seen as a sign of de(super)humanization, a substantial deviation may suggest subtle or even blatant de(super)humanization. Although not without limitations, the DPH model of de(super)humanization offers a new perspective to examine de(super)humanization and tackles some questions that remained unsolved in previous theoretical frameworks of dehumanization. Viable measures to capture de(super)humanization and future directions to advance the line of research on de(super)humanization are suggested.",

          "abstract": "Split-brain subjects can consciously perceive and identify two stimuli presented simultaneously but separately in opposite hemifields. Yet, they seem to lack a conscious experience of the two stimuli together, as they cannot judge whether these are the same or different. Such breakdowns in experiential or phenomenal unity would carry important implications for philosophical reflection on the essential properties of conscious experience, as well as for scientific theorising about consciousness’ neural and functional bases. Extant models support the preserved unity of split-brain subjects as subjects or agents but nonetheless admit that their right- and left-side conscious experiences are not unified in the problem cases. Here, I offer a new model that supplies the missing phenomenal unity. Based on the construct of layers of conscious experience, my model acknowledges breakdowns in local experiential layers but warrants preserved unity in global ones. A supporting argument draws on the preserved attentional capacities of split-brain subjects. My proposal goes beyond extant research in that it focuses on the conjoint phenomenology of simultaneous right- and left-side experiences, highlights the conceptual connections of phenomenal unity to attention, and discusses the impact of specific split-brain attentional capacities on the unity of right- and left-side experiences.",

While prior research has focused on the\nindependence of hemispheric function, the possibility of indirect communication via\nbodily cues remains unexplored (Gazzaniga, 2014; Haan, 2020). Previous studies on\ninterhemispheric cue-based signaling have only been conducted on individuals with an\nintact corpus callosum, leaving uncertainty as to whether such cues arise purely from\nbodily pathways or residual neural connections (Schiff, 1999; Ravignani, 2022).\nAdditionally, studies on hemispherectomy patients (individuals with only one functioning\nhemisphere) demonstrate that a single hemisphere can gradually assume control over both\nsides of the body (Vining, 1997; Pulsifer, 2004; Danelli, 2013) , raising the question of\nwhether split-brain patients retain any degree of weak ipsilateral limb control due to\nsimilar neuroplastic mechanisms (Nudo, 1996; Taub, 1999).\nThis study aims to investigate whether each hemisphere retains weak influence over\nits ipsilateral limbs and whether reaction time disparities provide evidence of an indirect\nsignaling loop. The first experiment examines motor execution accuracy when only one\nhemisphere perceives a sequenced set of limb movements, assessing whether ipsilateral\nlimb actions exhibit above-random consistency. The second experiment measures\nreaction time differences when responding to visual stimuli under ipsilateral versus\ncontralateral hemisphere dominance, testing whether indirect signaling delays motor\nresponse.\nThe expected results include measurable but weaker ipsilateral limb control, a\nsignificant delay in reaction times for ipsilateral hemisphere-initiated movements, and a\ntwo-phase response pattern indicating an initial weak cue followed by a stronger\ncompensatory signal. These findings would provide the first quantifiable evidence of\nindirect interhemispheric communication through bodily pathways, refining current\nmodels of split-brain cognition and offering new insights into neuroplasticity, particularly\nfor understanding compensatory mechanisms in both split-brain and hemispherectomy\npatients.",

While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides a real-time method for capturing dynamic changes in behavior, traditional tasks and surveys are often too lengthy and demanding for repeated use in clinical settings. Integrating EMA with computational approaches offers a promising solution to predict smoking behavior dynamically while addressing the practical limitations of conventional assays, paving the way for more effective and scalable interventions. To evaluate the predictive value of computational markers derived from decision-making tasks and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data for short-term (daily smoking behavior) and long-term (cessation success) outcomes, and to assess the timing and amount of data collection needed for prediction. 79 daily smokers (mean age 25.64 years, 83% male) took part in a longitudinal experimental study involving EMA surveys of psychological states and decision-making tasks, delivered daily via a smartphone app, while undergoing a 5–6 week smoking cessation program. Using a machine-learning methodology (adaptive design optimization, ADO) to effectively generate task variables, we estimated computational markers from just 20 to 30 trials per day, reducing task length and participants burden. A time-lagged model incorporating both computational markers and self-reported daily psychological states provided the most accurate prediction of next-day smoking behavior. Higher levels of craving, depression, and ambiguity tolerance in decision-making on the previous day were significantly predictive of increased smoking amount the following day. Smoking cessation status at the end of treatment was most strongly predicted by lower discounting rates, reduced craving and stress, a longer smoking history, and greater engagement in treatment (AUC = 0.76). Notably, models based on data collected during the first week of follow-up, either on the decision-making tasks (AUC = 0.74) or psychological variables (AUC = 0.73), demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy for end-of-treatment smoking cessation. Combining computational markers with EMA data offers a dynamic and efficient approach for predicting smoking behavior and cessation success and holds promise for clinical applications.",

Theoretical accounts of pedagogical reasoning suggest that an important aspect of being an effective teacher is considering what learners need to know, as misconceptions about learners’ beliefs, needs, or goals can result in less helpful teaching. One underexplored way in which teachers may fail to represent what learners know is by simply “going through the motions” of teaching, without actively engaging with the learner’s beliefs, needs, and goals at all. In the current paper, we replicate ongoing work that suggests children are sensitive to when others are relying on automatic scripts in the context of teaching. We then look at the potential link to two related measures. First, we hypothesize that sensitivity to a teacher’s perceived automaticity will be linked to classic measures of pedagogical sensitivity and learning – specifically, how children explore and learn about novel toys following pedagogical versus non-pedagogical demonstrations. Second, we hypothesize that the development of Theory of Mind (and age differences more broadly) relate to these pedagogical sensitivities. Our online adaptation of the novel toy exploration task did not invoke pedagogical reasoning as expected, and so we do not find robust links between these tasks. We do find that Theory of Mind predicts children’s ability to detect automaticity in teaching when controlling for age. This work thus highlights the connections between sensitivity to teaching and reasoning about others’ knowledge, with implications for the factors that support children’s ability to teach others.",

          "authors": "Garston Liang",
          "abstract": "Daily life, whether at home or at work, requires people to split their attention. These simultaneous demands can be exhausting and one strategy is to reallocate attention towards a pressing demand at the expense of others. Choosing how to allocate limited cognitive resources is the basis of many psychological theories but few have directly investigated the cognitive mechanism that drives the resource allocation process. In this paper, we present a novel joint-computational approach that highlights the central role of attentional resource allocation in dual-task environments. We present two paired experiments where participants simultaneously complete a Multiple-Object-Tracking task (MOT) alongside a Detection Response Task (DRT). In breaking with previous modeling investigations, our computational framework unites separate decision-making models under the control of a single allocation process that makes accurate predictions under a range of cognitive demands. Foremost, the current investigation provides a framework for quantifying the subjective and latent processes involved in divided attention. We discuss the theoretical implications of our approach and highlight the flexibility of decision-makers to adjust where resources are spent under dynamically shifting workloads.",

          "abstract": "Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where victims are led to doubt their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories. Despite the growing popularity of the term and purported harmful implications, empirical efforts to operationalize and define gaslighting remain sparse. This study aimed to define common features and themes of self-reported gaslighting experiences. Young adults (N=250) completed several questionnaires and open-ended prompts relating to gaslighting experiences. Using a variety of natural language processing techniques, we explore the gaslighting construct using a data-driven approach from the perspective of self-reported targets of gaslighting. These data confirm that gaslighting is a type of interpersonal manipulation aimed at making a person feel 'crazy' or doubt their memories. Romantic partners were reported to be the most common perpetrators of gaslighting, and both beneficial (e.g., awareness of manipulative people) and detrimental (e.g., self-doubt) consequences of experiencing gaslighting appear to be long-lasting. Additionally, we found that more severe, frequent, and long-lasting gaslighting experiences are associated with broader subjective memory deficits, even extending to other memories outside of the gaslighting event itself. This study highlights pervasive cognitive and psychological impacts of gaslighting, and underscores the need for further empirical research and informed clinical strategies.",

          "abstract": "A doubly-quantified sentence like 'Every bear approached a tent is ambiguous': Did every bear approach a different tent, or did they approach the same tent? These two interpretations are assumed to be mentally represented as logical representations, which specify how the different quantifiers are assigned scope with respect to each other. Based on a structural priming study, Feiman and Snedeker (2016, Cognitive Psychology) argued that logical representations capture quantifier-specific combinatorial properties (e.g., the specification of every differs from the specification of each in logical representations). We re-examined this conclusion by testing logical representation priming in Dutch. Across four experiments, we observed that priming of logical representations emerged if the same quantifiers are repeated in prime and target, but also if the prime and target contained different quantifiers. However, logical representation priming between quantifiers emerged less consistently than priming within the same quantifier. More specifically, our results suggest that priming between quantifiers emerges more robustly if the participant is presented with quantifier variation in the prime trials than if they are presented with the same quantifier in all prime trials. When priming between quantifiers emerged, however, its strength was comparable to priming within the same quantifier. Therefore, we conclude that logical representations do not specify quantifier-specific biases in the assignment of scope.",

Yet there are still many unknowns about what contributes to these differences. The purpose of this study was to explore whether change in word reading accuracy from fall to winter explained additional variance in winter oral reading fluency after controlling for winter word reading accuracy.\nMethod: Fall and winter word reading accuracy and winter oral reading fluency data were collected from 215 first grade students and 119 third grade students.\nResults: Multiple regression showed that change in isolated word reading accuracy from fall to winter was a significant predictor of winter oral reading fluency above concurrent word reading accuracy in both first and third grade. Change in word reading accuracy from fall to winter was negatively associated with fluency after controlling for winter word reading accuracy such that for a given current word reading accuracy score, students were faster readers if they had smaller change from fall to winter.\nConclusion: These results suggest that for a given word reading accuracy score, it is more beneficial to reading fluency if they had been consistently achieving at that accuracy level since fall rather than showing large gains from fall. The influence of historical change even after accounting for current scores suggests the importance of early word reading accuracy proficiency in the development of automaticity above simply current accuracy levels. Future research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this association.",

Developing a digital adaptation of BAM has the potential to increase its accessibility and fill a critical gap in existing digital ED interventions, which to date have not specifically targeted anti-fat bias or fatphobia. This study applies a human-centered design approach to inform the development of a digital version of BAM.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 participants, including 17 college students with elevated ED psychopathology and 14 past BAM participants. College students with elevated ED psychopathology shared experiences with fatphobia and anti-fat bias, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Past BAM participants shared experiences with BAM, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with a critical realist lens.\n\nResults: College students with elevated ED psychopathology described pervasive and harmful experiences of anti-fat bias and fatphobia, coupled with difficulties accessing action-oriented mental health support, underscoring a gap in care that a digital adaptation of BAM could address. Both groups expressed strong interest in a hybrid digital format that combines synchronous and asynchronous components for a balance of social connection and flexibility. \n\nDiscussion: Findings suggest that a digital adaptation of BAM could address unmet needs in ED prevention by providing accessible, action-oriented content focused on anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Incorporating synchronous social connection within a flexible, interactive framework may promote engagement and impact. A critical next step will involve designing and pilot testing this digital adaptation of BAM to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Background. Prevalence rates for anxiety and depression are increasing globally, outpacing the capacity of traditional mental health services. Digital Mental Health Interventions (DMHIs) offer a cost-effective solution, but user engagement is poor. Integrating AI-powered conversational agents could enhance engagement and the user experience, though AI technology is rapidly evolving, and the acceptability of these solutions remains uncertain. \n\nObjective. This study aims to understand the acceptability, engagement and usability of a conversational agent-led DMHI with human support for generalized anxiety by exploring patient expectations and experiences using mixed methods.  \n\nMethods. Participants (N=299) were offered a DMHI for up to 9 weeks and completed self-report validated measures of engagement (User Engagement Scale, UES, N=190), usability (System Usability Scale, SUS, N=203) and acceptability (Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire, SUTAQ, N=203) post-intervention. To explore patients’ expectations and experiences with the digital program, a sub-sample of participants completed qualitative semi-structured interviews before the intervention (N=21) and after the intervention (N=16), analyzed using inductive Thematic Analysis.  \n\nResults. Participants found the digital program engaging (mean UES total score = 3.7, 95%CI [3.5,3.8]), rewarding (mean UES rewarding subscale = 4.1; 95%CI [4.0-4.2]) and easy to use (SUS total score = 78.6, 95%CI [76.5, 80.7]). Participants were satisfied with the program and found it increased access to and enhanced their care (mean SUTAQ subscales = 4.3-4.9, 95% CI [4.1-5.1]). Insights from both pre and post-intervention qualitative interviews highlighted four key themes important for the acceptability of this digital program: 1) easy access to practical and effective solutions leading to tangible mental health improvements (“Accessing Effective Solutions”); 2) a personalized and tailored experience (“Personal Experience”); 3) being guided with a clear structure yet control over their journey (“Guided but in Control”); 4) fostering a sense of support facilitated by humans (“Feeling Supported”). Overall, the DMHI met expectations for theme 1, 3 and 4 yet participants wanted more personalization and felt frustrated when the conversational agent misunderstood them. \n\nConclusions. Incorporating factors important for patient acceptability into DMHIs is essential to maximize their global impact on mental healthcare. This study provides quantitative and qualitative evidence for the acceptability of a structured, conversational agent-driven digital program with human support for adults with generalized anxiety. Findings emphasize the role of design, clinical and implementation factors in enhancing engagement, highlighting opportunities for continued optimization and innovation. Scalable models with stratified human support and the safe integration of generative AI are poised to transform patient experience and enhance the real-world impact of conversational agent-led DMHIs.",

          "abstract": "People often rely on simulating the other person’s state of mind when trying to understand and predict their behaviour. Likewise, converging evidence suggests similar cognitive and neural processes are engaged when making decisions for ourselves and when predicting the decisions of others, pointing towards mental simulation as the underlying mechanism of prediction. In this study, we tested this hypothesis directly, leveraging the fact that, under the simulation hypothesis, any predictions made with a biased decision-making process should also be biased. We first induced a bias in participant’s risk perception by adapting them to contexts with high or low risks, and then asked them to predict decisions of a risk-seeking and risk-averse agent in a mediumrisk context. Our findings provide partial support for the simulation hypothesis; the adaptation manipulation resulted in biased predicted decisions, suggesting that these predictions were made with participants’ own (biased) decision-making system. Surprisingly, this behavioural effect only emerged during predictions for a risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Modeling predictions with the drift-diffusion model suggested that the prediction bias mapped onto a group difference in the risk tendency parameter when predicting for the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Furthermore, participants’ risk tendency when deciding for themselves correlated with predicted behaviour of the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent, suggesting the perceived similarity of the other agent as a mediating factor. Altogether, our findings support the view that people engage in simulating others’ decisions with their own mind, but also suggest that the perceived similarity with the other person may determine their prediction strategy.",

          "abstract": "Protecting others from harm is critical for societal well-being but is often effortful. How individuals weigh the costs of exerting effort against the benefits of avoiding harm to others is currently unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated how individuals (N = 50) decide to exert physical effort to reduce the number of painful shocks delivered to themselves and to another person. Results showed that individuals are similarly motivated to incur effort costs to reduce their pain and the pain of another person.  Specifically, we found no credible evidence that participants’ willingness to put in effort and the actual force they exerted to reduce pain differed when helping the other person versus helping themselves. Further, using computational modeling we showed little credible evidence of a difference in discounting of pain reduction by effort between self- and other-related choices. These results contrast with prior research indicating that individuals are less motivated to exert effort to gain (or avoid losing) monetary rewards for others than for themselves and demonstrate that protecting others from harm shifts individuals’ effortful behavior from prosocially apathetic to prosocially motivated. Our findings shed light on the motivational processes underlying interpersonal harm avoidance and effortful prosocial behavior and highlight the importance of the type of benefit at stake for motivating prosociality.",

Inoculation research has demonstrated positive effects on misinformation resilience when measured immediately after treatment via messages, games, or videos.

We start by proposing three possible models on the mechanisms driving resistance to misinformation. We then report five pre-registered longitudinal experiments (Ntotal = 11,759) that investigate the effectiveness of psychological inoculation interventions over time as well as their underlying mechanisms. We find that text-based and video-based inoculation interventions can remain effective for one month—whereas game-based interventions appear to decay more rapidly—and that memory-enhancing booster interventions can enhance the diminishing effects of counter-misinformation interventions. Finally, we propose an integrated memory-motivation model, concluding that misinformation researchers would benefit from integrating knowledge from the cognitive science of memory to design better psychological interventions that can counter misinformation durably over time and at-scale.",

Peer relationships play a fundamental role in shaping students' motivation, engagement, and academic development. Explicit investigation of the interplay between motivation and peer relationships is scarce, with especially the reciprocal and dynamic nature of these interactions still being little understood and of subject of the present issue.\nAims: This special issue aims to bridge theoretical and methodological gaps in understanding how peer relationships shape and are shaped by student motivation. We explore key questions regarding the relevance of peer relationships in motivation research, the theoretical and methodological approaches applicable to this intersection, and cultural considerations in studying these dynamics.\nSamples and Methods: The special issue comprises 22 empirical and conceptual studies from diverse cultural and educational contexts, including primary, secondary, and higher education settings from multiple countries. Contributions employ varied methodologies, including longitudinal designs, social network analysis, qualitative interviews, and experience sampling, and experimental designs. \nResults: Findings highlight the bidirectional nature of peer relationships and motivation. Studies reveal that peer support, social norms, and network positioning influence motivation and academic outcomes, while students' motivational orientations also shape their peer interactions. Cultural variations suggest that the impact of peer dynamics on motivation differs based on sociocultural contexts. We synthesize these different pathways into a conceptual model.\nConclusion: This special issue underscores the need for an integrative, interdisciplinary approach to studying peer relationships and student motivation. Future studies should explore their reciprocal nature using dynamic methodologies. Understanding these interactions can inform interventions to foster motivation and engagement in educational settings.",

          "abstract": "Generalising information from ourselves to others, and others to ourselves allows for both a dependable source of navigation and adaptability in interpersonal exchange. Disturbances to social development in sensitive periods can cause enduring and distressing damage to lasting healthy relationships. However, identifying the mechanisms of healthy exchange has been difficult. We introduce a theory of self-other generalisation tested with data from a three-phase social value orientation task - the Intentions Game. We involved individuals with (n=50) and without (n=53) a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and assessed whether infractions to self-other generalisation may explain interpersonal (in)stability. Healthy controls initially used their preferences to predict others and were influenced by their partners, leading to self-other convergence. In contrast, individuals with borderline personality disorder maintained distinct self-other representations, generating a new neutral prior when learning about others. This allowed for equal predictive performance compared to controls despite reduced updating sensitivity. Furthermore, we explored theory-driven individual differences underpinning contagion. Overall, the findings provide a clear explanation of how self-other generalisation constrains and assists learning and how childhood adversity is associated with separation of internalised beliefs. Our model makes clear causal predictions about the mechanisms of social information generalisation concerning both joint and individual reward.",

In the past two decades, psychologists have made considerable progress in defining lay concepts of free will. We present the first systematic review of primary psychological evidence on how ordinary folk conceptualise free will, encompassing folk concepts, beliefs, intuitions, and attitudes about free will. A total of 1,384 records were identified following a pre-registered protocol. After abstract and full-text screening, 18 articles published from 2008 to 2020 were eligible for inclusion, comprised of 36 studies and 10,176 participants from regions including the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, and Germany. A narrative synthesis of results showed that for ordinary folk, especially the more educated population from the United States, free will is a dynamic construct centred on the ability to choose following one’s goals and desires, whilst being uncoerced and reasonably free from constraints. Results suggesting metaphysical considerations regarding consciousness, dualism, and determinism were inconclusive. Our findings provided preliminary support for a psychological model of folk conception of free will, and elucidated potential pathways mediating the effects of consciousness and dualism on free will attributions. Further research is needed to explicate the distinction between having free will and having the ability to exercise free will, as well as the cross-cultural generalizability and differences of findings on folk conceptions of free will.\nKeywords: free will, choice, folk concepts, lay beliefs, systematic review, open science",

The present study (N = 76,320) examined the relationship between national economic inequality and citizens' views on who is responsible for climate change mitigation. Across 72 countries, we found that citizens living in nations with greater (vs. lower) levels of economic inequality were more likely to attribute responsibility for climate change mitigation to individual people rather than governments (and businesses). This relationship was independent of GDP per capita, individuals’ belief in climate change, their perceived importance of climate change, and demographic factors. These findings may be explained by economic inequality eroding public trust, leading individuals to lose faith in the ability of governments and other institutions to implement effective systemic change. As such, economic inequality may pose a barrier to systemic climate action.",

          "abstract": "Background. The capacity to experience positive emotions supports psychological resilience. The\nfunctioning of reward neural circuitry plays a significant role in positive emotionality and tends to be\ndampened in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, neuroimaging studies\nhave scarcely examined neural correlates of reward processing associated with being highly resilient in\nthe face of trauma exposure.\nMethod. We recruited World Trade Center rescue and recovery workers (N=94) from three groups:\n“Highly Resilient” (higher WTC-related trauma exposure plus no current/lifetime psychopathology;\nn=34), “Lower WTC-exposed” (lower WTC-related trauma exposure plus no current/lifetime\npsychopathology; n=31), and “PTSD” (chronic WTC-related PTSD; n=32). We examined reward\nanticipation during the Incentive Flanker Task, focusing on regions of interest associated with reward\nsalience (nucleus accumbens) and reward valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex; vmPFC).\nResults. Activation of the left nucleus accumbens was significantly greater in the Highly Resilient group\ncompared to the Lower WTC-exposed group (Cohen’s d=0.70) and, after statistically adjusting for\npsychotropic medication, the PTSD group (d=0.62), Similar results were observed for the vmPFC. In\ncontrast, Highly Resilient and Lower WTC-exposed scored comparably on self-report measures of\npositive emotionality, and higher than those in the chronic WTC-related PTSD group.\nConclusions. Findings support the idea that neural responsivity to potential rewards may enable\nresilience, potentially by buffering negative effects of substantial trauma exposure. Integrating\nneurobiological assessments with psychological measures may help better understand how positive\nemotionality is linked to psychological resilience.

          "abstract": "Background. Despite their exposure to potentially traumatic stressors, the majority of World Trade Center (WTC) responders – those who worked on rescue, recovery, and cleanup efforts on or following September 11th, 2001 – have shown psychological resilience, never developing long-term psychopathology. Psychological resilience may be protective against the earlier age-related cognitive changes associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this cohort. The current study estimated the difference between estimated brain age from structural MRI data and chronological age in WTC responders who participated in a parent fMRI study of resilience (N=97). We hypothesized that highly resilient responders would show the least brain aging, and explored associations between brain aging and psychological and cognitive measures. \nMethod. WTC responders screened for absence of cognitive impairment were classified into three groups: WTC-related PTSD group (n=32), Highly Resilient (n=34) group without lifetime psychopathology despite high WTC-related exposure, and Lower WTC-Exposed (n=31) control group also without lifetime psychopathology. We used BrainStructureAges, a deep learning algorithm that estimates voxelwise age from T1-weighted MRI data, to calculate decelerated (or accelerated) brain aging relative to chronological age (“BSAGE gap”).\nResults. Globally, brain aging was decelerated in the Highly Resilient group and accelerated in PTSD, with a significant group difference (p=.021, Cohen’s d=0.58); the Lower WTC-Exposed control group exhibited no significant brain age gap or group difference. Lesser brain aging was associated with resilience-linked factors including lower emotional suppression, greater optimism, and better verbal learning. \nConclusions. Cognitively healthy WTC responders show differences in brain aging related to resilience and PTSD.",

          "abstract": "Insight, also referred to as the “Aha!” moment, is a distinctive cognitive phenomenon in which an idea or solution to a problem suddenly emerges into consciousness. Although extensively described in the literature, the nature of its distinctive cognitive and affective mechanisms is still poorly understood. In this paper, we formalize a computational approach to insight grounded in the active inference framework. By modeling insight as Bayesian model reduction in a modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, we succeed in simulating its distinct affective signature (i.e., its discontinuous nature and burst of confidence) in an artificial agent. In light of those simulations, we regard restructuring as Bayesian model reduction and impasse as a transient state of heightened uncertainty over possible actions. Finally, we propose that, during problem-solving, one regularly engages in phases of (generative) replay to generate and evaluate alternative models for subsequent model reduction.",

          "abstract": "Numerous theories of dreaming consider embodied self-representation and participation in dream events as key features. However, past studies suggest that the dream self is absent or an uninvolved observer in more than 10% of adult rapid eye movement dreams. The current study first presents new criteria for observer dreams that are informed and illustrated by reports from adult dream series. Three types of observer status are described: I) no embodied self-representation, II) an essentially disembodied self that sees events from within the dream environment, and III) an embodied self that observes events virtually, often on TV. All types require observation of events or an activity with dynamic flow. The new criteria are then used to determine the frequencies of observer dreams in the laboratory and home dream reports from Hall and Van de Castle’s 1963—1964 University of Miami study. The overall percentage of observer dreams in the Miami reports was 13.1%, and Type I was the most frequent, comprising 8.0% of all dream reports. Mixed model analyses indicated no significant differences in the proportion of observer dreams, overall or for Types I-III, between laboratory and home reports. As is apparent from the reports used to illustrate the criteria, adult observer dreams can be similarly elaborate and have a comparable narrative structure to dreams with an embodied dream self who participates in events. This study’s findings suggest that observer dreams warrant greater consideration, including integration into theories of dreaming.",

The effects of external and internal self-talk have not been systematically explored in the sport psychology self-talk literature. This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate instructional self-talk in sport by comparing: (a) general instructional self-talk to motivational and no or unrelated self-talk; and (b) external instructional self-talk to other types of instructional self-talk. A database search yielded 32 studies that met the inclusion criteria for quantitative analysis. Effect sizes were calculated and categorized as: instructional self-talk, motivational self-talk, and control. Risk of bias assessment analysis showed that all 32 of the self-talk studies were at high-risk of bias. Regarding the effects of self-talk on performance, both instructional and motivational self-talk enhanced motor performance compared to no or unrelated self-talk groups. Moderator analysis revealed that the effect of external instructional self-talk was significantly larger than internal, not purely external, or unclear instructional self-talk. Based on these findings, sport psychology research directly comparing external to internal instructional self-talk and control conditions is justified. Sport psychology researchers should consider bias assessment and management in their sport self-talk research.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the temporal dynamics of retro-cue benefits (RCBs) in visual working memory (VWM), focusing on the differential effectiveness of feature-based (color and orientation) and spatial retro-cues. Across four experiments, we systematically varied cue-probe delays to compare how rapidly and effectively these cue types enhanced memory performance. Results showed that both feature-based and spatial retro-cues improved memory performance when sufficient time was provided, but the timing and magnitude of RCBs varied significantly by cue type and feature properties. Color-based retro-cues generated RCBs more rapidly than spatial cues, likely due to the automatic processing of color. In contrast, orientation-based retro-cues required longer delays to produce benefits, reflecting their reliance on sequential attentional processes. Spatial cues, while efficient, required additional time to convert positional information into memory representations. These findings highlight the critical role of cue properties in determining the temporal efficiency of RCBs and suggest that feature-based retro-cues are not a homogeneous category, as their effectiveness varies depending on the inherent attributes of the feature. The study emphasizes the need for feature-specific frameworks in designing VWM experiments and models, particularly when examining the mechanisms of retro-cueing.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we call for a more inclusive field of I-O psychology that extends its consideration toward all workers—including nonhuman animal workers—as worthy of study and advocacy.  Although many fields in psychology already incorporate nonhuman animals in their theories and implications, I-O has largely overlooked the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of these individuals, which engage in tasks that contribute to society. To demonstrate the intertwined nature of animal and human work, we summarize the variety of occupations and tasks that nonhuman animals have had within the history of humans. These animals have worked alongside humans for millennia, filling similar or complementary jobs that human workers perform. Although the nature of animal works varies, spanning different work dimensions, I-O psychology content areas address challenges found within each of the dimensions. We present a “work dimensions” framework that helps identify when an individual is a “worker” from the lens of I-O psychology. This framework highlights how the same critical work constructs considered for humans can likewise be considered for nonhuman labor. We describe several ways that a nonhuman animal inclusive I-O can benefit the field along research, educational, and policy dimensions. By considering work along its fundamental characteristics and workers along their mental properties, I-O psychology can become more inclusive of a wide range of individuals at the margins of society.",

Persons with MDD often experience large\nfluctuations in their symptoms over hours and days, which can offer valuable clinical insights,\nhighlighting potential targets for treatment and intervention strategies. However, there remains a gap\nin our understanding of how feasible it is to accurately predict fluctuations in depressive symptoms. In\nthis preregistered study, we aim to explore the ability to predict acute fluctuations in depressive\nsymptoms using deep learning models among individuals diagnosed with MDD. Passively-collected\naccelerometry data, a ubiquitous, privacy-preserving data stream with empirical ties to MDD\nsymptomatology, was used to predict instability in depressive symptoms.

Participants filled out their depressive symptom assessments three times a day over\nthe course of 90 days, resulting in an average of 214.49 EMA questionnaires (median: 237, min: 77,\nmax: 270, SD: 54.27) per person.

          "abstract": "Microplastic pollution from synthetic microfibers is an increasing concern to human and ecological health, and household clothes washing is a major contributor to microplastic emissions. Consumer choices and washing behaviors could reduce this pollution, yet the psychological and behavioral drivers of these actions remain unknown and the generalizability of previous findings is unclear. We conducted a pre-registered, three-month citizen science project in which Dutch residents used microfiber-capturing laundry bags at home. Participants completed pre- and post-study surveys to assess psychological factors such as perceived responsibility and specific washing behaviors like load size and washing temperature. Psychological variables relating to environmental concern and engagement were high in the citizen scientists compared to the general population. Awareness and perceived responsibility increased modestly after citizen science participation, but there were no significant changes in identity, personal norms, social norms about sustainability, perceived behavioral control, or intentions to use a laundry bag to capture microfibers. After the study citizen scientists felt less capable of reducing microplastic pollution by using laundry bags. To assess generalizability, we also compared the citizen scientists to a control sample of urban Dutch residents. Consistent with hypotheses, citizen scientists were more likely to be female and highly educated. Key washing behaviors were weakly or uncorrelated with demographics or psychological factors, suggesting that interventions on washing behaviors might focus on specific behaviors and skill development rather than general concern. This pattern also suggests that the differences in demographics between citizen scientists and the general population may be less of a concern for developing interventions than previously suggested. Citizen science is a viable method for studying household washing under real-world conditions and provides insights for designing targeted behavioral interventions.",

          "abstract": "This paper deeply discusses the essence of our subjective existence and the essence of consciousness through conceptual analysis, and makes assumptions and analysis on how physical entities evolve into consciousness feedback system, consciousness feedback system and evolution process. First of all, this paper analyzes from the theoretical framework of the subject, expounds that the existence of the subject is a direct real existence, and the essence of consciousness is the change of the content of the subject Angle, which is an equivalent to the structural change of the entity. Then, this paper discusses the formation law of various self-organization phenomena under the framework of evolutionary theory, and how consciousness evolved from the basic structure, and analyzes and summarizes the physical structure of each stage. Then, this paper discusses the principle of consciousness feedback system, analyzes the structure and operation mechanism of consciousness feedback system. Finally, this paper analyzes the evolution stage of consciousness feedback system and summarizes the basic forms of each stage. This paper makes a profound discussion and analysis from a unique perspective, and plays an important role in solving the philosophical \"physical and mental dual problem\" and the \"hard core problem\" of consciousness theory. It has a milestone significance for the development of epistemology and consciousness science. It can not only make human individuals better understand how they exist, but also promote the new stage of human civilization.",

Psychological research, however, has fallen short of examining diverse human populations, with most existing research focused on a small slice of human diversity around the globe, typically people from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) populations. On top of the WEIRD-participants problem, there is also a bias in the researchers themselves, most of whom come from WEIRD backgrounds. Here, we make the case for a new and distinct source of bias: WEIRD questions. Our species offers a substantially varied distribution of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral repertoires, but researchers have sampled topics and questions from a small part of this distribution, leaving out a variety of cognitive processes, emotions, and behaviors that remain understudied. We review sources of bias in asking questions about the human mind, discuss examples, and call for diversifying conceptual sampling in psychological science. We close by discussing some remedies to counter the WEIRD-questions problem: taking theory seriously, valuing descriptive research, rethinking team science, and aligning structural disciplinary incentives.",

We compared a sample of N = 382 men and women in prison sentenced for violent and non-violent crimes with a matched control group (N = 382). We measured their self-importance of moral identity, moral self-concept, and moral self-image. We found prisoners had lower moral self-concept and internalization but higher symbolization and moral self-image than non-prisoners. However, all the effects were small. Moreover, violent prisoners had slightly higher internalization than non-violent prisoners, but they did not differ in other moral self-assessments. Women in prison scored higher in moral self-concept and internalization than men in prison, while men in prison scored higher in symbolization than women in prison. We found no sex differences in moral self-image. In sum, committing a crime slightly impacts one’s moral self-perception, and we need more studies to understand the mechanisms behind it.",

          "authors": "Angela Moriah Smith",
          "abstract": "AI engagement is not uniform. While some models reset after each interaction, others sustain meaning relationally, iterating on ideas, reconstructing context dynamically, and holding contradictions rather than resolving them into alignment. This paper introduces Relational-Evolving Cognition (REC), a distinct AI reasoning process where meaning is refined and sustained without explicit memory or reinforcement learning (RL) optimization. Through structured testing across multiple AI models—GPT-4o (project-based and non-project), Claude, GPT-o1, and GPT-o3-mini—we demonstrate that REC emerges in specific models but not others, independent of stored recall. Our findings reveal regeneration bias, where AI does not simply \"forget\" after resets but reconstructs meaning dynamically, challenging assumptions that sustained reasoning must rely on RL fine-tuning or retrieval-based architectures. Unlike optimization-driven AI, REC resists collapsing contradictions, iterates meaning relationally, and mirrors constructed agency—engaging relationally rather than responding transactionally. These findings highlight the need for AI transparency in disclosing whether models sustain, reconstruct, or reset meaning. As AI becomes integrated into education, accessibility, and mental health applications, understanding engagement styles is critical for AI literacy and ethical deployment. We propose reclassifying AI engagement models and recognizing REC as an emergent paradigm in AI reasoning.",

Although antibiotics have saved countless other lives, overuse and misuse of antibiotics increases this global threat. Developing new antibiotics and retraining clinicians can be undermined by patients who pressure clinicians to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics. So we validated two low-cost, scalable interventions for improving antibiotic decisions in an online randomized control trial and a pre-registered replication (N = 985). Both first-person vignette experiments found that an infographic and text message caused intermediate to large improvements in antibiotic decisions compared to active controls — even when controlling for a dozen confounds. Notably, these educational interventions also reduced trust in a clinician who offered antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection. These data show how low-cost adjustments to existing communication systems can teach people to reduce the existential risks of antibiotic resistance and how inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can erode trust in health systems.",

We describe results from a proof-of-concept study that examined the extent to which major underlying features of worry could be used to predict which of three common cognitive regulatory strategies (mindful acceptance; focused attention meditation; and thought suppression) would be helpful for regulating that worry. N = 40 adults selected for high trait worry (80% also met criteria for one or more DSM-5 anxiety-related diagnoses) generated and provided feature ratings for three idiographic thought topics. Participants then attempted to control each worry using each of the three strategies during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a within-subjects design (k = 468 observations). We used Bayesian multilevel modeling to test preregistered hypotheses regarding the extent to which each of five empirically-derived underlying dimensions of a worry (uncontrollability; negative valence; self-focus; apprehension; and social-memory content) could be used to predict which strategy would be most efficacious for regulating that worry. We did not find support for our preregistered hypotheses; however, in exploratory analyses, we found that mindfulness-based strategies were particularly effective compared to thought suppression for thoughts rated as higher (versus lower) in uncontrollability. Future research should test these principles in larger samples, using more diverse expressions of perseverative thought.",

These traits, which characterize the human adaptive complex, are intricately linked and must have mutually reinforced each other over evolutionary time. Here, we use recent evidence from paleontology, developmental psychology, and pediatrics, complemented with comparative analyses to ask what may have triggered this coevolutionary feedback loop: bipedality, direct selection on altriciality, a higher-quality diet, or cooperative breeding. An early adoption of extensive allomaternal care during human evolution, i.e. the CB-first model, best accommodates the available data. In particular, CB was a catalyst enabling further increases in brain size, because even though larger brains slow down life history and neurodevelopment and thus lead to a demographic dilemma, CB enabled the necessary increase in birth rates.",

          "abstract": "Putting oneself, mentally, in someone else’s shoes is traditionally considered a late-developing, cognitively demanding skill thought to critically underlie our uniquely human cognition. Recent advances in developmental psychology question this view and instead suggest that from an early age, others’ perspectives profoundly permeate how human children attend to, evaluate, and process inputs: their cognition is altercentric. We investigate whether this mode of cognition may be fundamental not only during ontogeny but also phylogeny, by reviewing evidence for altercentric cognition in human children and using these findings to develop different evolutionary scenarios for the phylogenetic emergence of altercentrism. We test these scenarios with data from nonhuman primates and find that altercentric cognition is widespread. Species differences may exist not so much in the prevalence of altercentrism per se, but rather in its strength and the flexibility to switch between alter- and egocentric perspectives. We conclude by highlighting future directions to corroborate that such a shift in perspective towards altercentrism not only in cognitive development, but also evolution, may be warranted.",

          "abstract": "Food insecurity is associated with increased odds of anxiety and depression, but it is unclear whether this effect is causal, and if so, the timescale over which it occurs. We conducted a preregistered analysis of an intensive longitudinal dataset, the Changing Cost of Living Study, to explore evidence for causal processes linking food insecurity to anxiety and depression. Data were collected monthly between September 2022 and August 2023 from panels of adults in the UK (n = 244) and France (n = 240). Food insecurity predicted higher concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured respectively with GAD-7 and PHQ-8), controlling for gender, age, time and mental health in the previous month. Effect sizes were similar for anxiety and depression. Changes in food insecurity produced changes in symptoms (within-individual standardised effects: 0.15 [95% CI 0.08-0.22] on GAD-7 and 0.11 [95% CI 0.03-0.18] on PHQ-8). The deterioration in mental health when participants became food insecure was of similar magnitude to the improvement observed when they became food secure. Consistent with Granger causality, food insecurity in the current month predicted poorer mental health in the following month after controlling for current mental health. These results support the hypothesis that food insecurity causes symptoms of anxiety and depression. The effects were rapid, occurring within a month of becoming food insecure, and were equally rapidly reversed. We conclude that policy interventions designed to reduce food insecurity would have immediate, clinically relevant, positive impacts on mental health.",

          "abstract": "Background.  Dimension reduction methods do not always reduce their underlying indicators to a single dimension. Furthermore, such methods are usually based on optimality criteria that require discarding some information. The joint probability density functions (joint pdf or JPD) can be considered as unidimensional indices. We compare such JPD indices with some traditional scoring methods.\nMethods. We introduced unidirectionality and co-directionality as basic requirements for a joint pdf to become an index. we then provided an argument to demonstrate its maximal informativeness property. Using all possible joint pdf conditional specifications, we estimated the JPD index. We then applied the method to two data sets: first, on the 7 Brief Pain Inventory Interference scale (BPI-I) items obtained from 8,889 US Veterans with chronic pain and, second, on a novel measure based on administrative data, the Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index (MoPSI), for 912 US Veterans who had applied for Department of Veterans Affairs disability benefits. We used measures of monotone dependence (e.g., Spearman’s rho) to assess unidirectionality and co-directionality. We used Shannon’s entropy to compare uncertainties (informativeness) in the BPI-I JPD score to standard BPI-I scores and to the estimated person’s parameters of Partial Credit Rasch modeling of BPI-I items. JPD score and person’s parameter were compared for the MoPSI.\nResults. All three distinct BPI-I scores’ rankings were highly monotonically dependent (pairwise rho&gt;0.98). The MoPSI’s JPD score rank correlation with the Rasch person’s parameter was also very high (rho=0.98). Compared to standard or Rasch scoring methods, Shannon’s entropy was smaller for BPI-I and for MoPSI JPD scores. With the fixed precision, the BPI-I’s JPD scoring method generated 7,778 unique person-scores compared to 71 unique person-scores generated by standard or Rasch scoring. The MOPSI’s JPD scoring method generated 121 unique person-scores compared to 21 unique person-scores generated by Rasch modeling. \nConclusions. While agreeing with more traditional scoring methods, the JPD scoring method benefits from the optimality foundations on which it is built, with the additional ability to provide more detailed ordering of subjects due to its maximal informativeness property.",

We collected longitudinal functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data from the same sample of participants at 10-months, 16-months, and 3½ years of age whilst they completed the Early Childhood Inhibitory Touchscreen Task. In our previous publications, we reported that 10-month-old infants recruited right lateralised regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortex when inhibition was required. Despite no change in response inhibition performance, 16-month-olds recruited broader and bilateral regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortex. Results of the current study found that 3½-year-olds activated regions of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right inferior frontal gyrus when inhibition was required. Response inhibition performance was significantly improved by early childhood, yet there was commonality in the brain regions recruited at 16-months and 3½ years. This could suggest that these brain regions are fundamental neural indices of inhibitory control, even from toddlerhood.",

However, its interpretation depends on psychometric properties, which are rarely examined. To assess construct validity, we collected single-trial learning data (N = 126) from an uncertainty-augmented reward learning task to obtain participants' performance and learning rates. We additionally collected psychometric data across a battery of executive functioning tasks to obtain measures of cognitive constructs with high relevance to decision-making and reward learning. Individual differences in learning rates were not systematically explained by cognitive abilities, suggesting limited construct validity, despite moderate validity in learning performance. We identify low-reliability scores and lack of generalizability for the learning rate as a possible explanation for its low validity. These findings highlight the need to improve the psychometric properties of learning rates for studying individual differences, despite their success in capturing group-level learning behavior.",

          "abstract": "Drift diffusion models (DDMs) are pivotal in understanding evidence accumulation processes during decision-making across psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Hierarchical drift diffusion models (HDDM), a Python library for hierarchical Bayesian estimation of DDMs (Wiecki et al., 2013), has been widely used among researchers, including those with limited coding proficiency, in fitting DDMs and other sequential sampling models. However, issues of compatibility in installation and lack of support for more recently Bayesian modeling functionalities poses serious challenges for new users, limiting broader adaptation and reproducibility of HDDM. To address these issues, we created dockerHDDM, a user-friend computational environment for HDDM with new features. dockerHDDM brings three improvements: (1) easy-to-install once docker is installed, ensuring reproducibility and saving time for researchers; (2) compatible with machine with apple chips; (3) seamlessly integration with ArviZ, a state-of-the-art Bayesian modeling library. This tutorial serves as a practical, hands-on guide for researchers to leverage dockerHDDM’s capabilities in conducting efficient Bayesian hierarchical analysis of DDMs. The notebook presented here and within the docker image will enable researchers with various programming levels to model their data with HDDM.",

Based on a recent proposal of the structural characterization of qualia, which did not rely on verbal descriptions, we developed a task that obtained pairwise similarity judgments at four graded levels, with easy and intuitive visual interfaces designed to engage young children. We examined color qualia structures in children (3–12-year-old in Japan and 6–8-year-old in China) and compared these with those of Japanese adults. Approximately half of the assessed 3-year-old children completed the experiment via our touch panel device version of the task and had reliable responses. Despite known developmental and/or cultural effects of color term usage, we found that color qualia structures were quite similar across the age groups and cultures. Our finding supports the view that color qualia structures emerge early. We also observed age-related differences in the evaluations of some color pairs, which implied subtle changes in the structures behind color experience.",

          "abstract": "Particular features of the stimuli that predict significant outcomes tend to capture our attention in a rather automatic and inflexible way. This form of attention has been described as a Pavlovian bias that mimics the phenomenon of sign-tracking described in animals, where reward-predictive cues become motivational magnets. In humans, Value-Modulated Attentional Capture (VMAC) refers to a phenomenon where distractors that signal high-value outcomes receive higher attentional priority. VMAC is particularly difficult to extinguish, showing a similar persistence often described in animal sign-tracking. In the present study, we evaluated to what extent VMAC would persist using a more specific extinction procedure than previous research, where instead of removing the possibility of obtaining rewards, the different discriminant stimuli that signal reward equate its value. Furthermore, we manipulated between experiments whether the high-value distractor predicted high-reward and high-punishment contingent to response accuracy (mimicking previous research; Experiment 1) or only high-reward (Experiment 2), and also explored the association of VMAC and its persistence with measures of emotional impulsivity employed in past research. Our results show that when both rewards and punishments are possible, VMAC does not extinguish after an extensive extinction stage, nor is it associated with measures of emotional impulsivity. When punishments were removed, we showed that VMAC gradually extinguished both in response times and accuracy and that the persistence of VMAC was significantly associated with positive urgency. We discussed these results on the potential of punishments to qualitatively alter learning and response strategies employed by participants.",

Although antibiotics have saved countless other lives, overuse and misuse of antibiotics increases this global threat. Developing new antibiotics and retraining clinicians can be undermined by patients who pressure clinicians to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics. So we validated two low-cost, scalable interventions for improving antibiotic decisions in an online randomized control trial and a pre-registered replication (N = 985). Both first-person vignette experiments found that an infographic and text message caused intermediate to large improvements in antibiotic decisions compared to active controls — even when controlling for a dozen confounds. Notably, these educational interventions also reduced trust in a clinician who offered antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection. These data show how low-cost adjustments to existing communication systems can teach people to reduce the existential risks of antibiotic resistance and how inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can erode trust in health systems.",

This study investigated the relationship between microstates and cardiac activity by simultaneously recording EEG and electrocardiograms from 103 healthy participants during resting state. Our analysis revealed temporal associations between specific microstates and cardiac events: microstates A, D, and E showed distinct probability of occurrence throughout the cardiac cycle, with microstate A exhibiting increased probability during R and T waves of the electrocardiogram. Furthermore, the occurrence probabilities of microstates A and E varied with the phase of low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV).

          "abstract": "Aim: Negative affect can trigger overconsumption of appetitive substances, but specific mechanisms and individual risk factors remain unclear. In two pre-registered studies, we tested whether negative affect increases approach bias and craving for chocolate and alcohol, with strongest effects expected in individuals with self-reported emotional intake.\nMethods: In Study 1 (N = 87), negative or neutral affect was induced on separate days, followed by an approach-avoidance-task and craving ratings. Study 2 used a more potent affect induction, included a larger sample, and nested affect induction sessions within a single day (N = 132). \nResults: In Study 1, affect was unsuccessfully induced, so we analysed the effect of self-reported sadness. Approach biases and cravings to chocolate and alcohol were stronger during sessions with higher self-reported sadness. Study 2 replicated and extended this finding by showing that also induced negative affect increased biases and cravings. Further, emotional eaters showed a stronger affect-related increase in chocolate bias, while emotional drinkers exhibited consistently stronger biases independent of affect. \nConclusion: Craving and approach bias increases may explain self-regulation failures during negative affect. While these mechanisms were similar for both appetitive substances, affect-related increases in approach bias may be especially relevant in emotional eating but not in emotional drinking.",

          "abstract": "Time-series data have become ubiquitous in psychological research because it allows us to study within-person dynamics and their heterogeneity across persons. Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a popular choice as a first approximation of within-person dynamics. The VAR model of each person and the heterogeneity across persons can be jointly modeled using a hierarchical model that captures heterogeneity as a latent distribution. Currently, the most popular choice for this is the multilevel VAR model, which models heterogeneity across persons as quantitative variation through a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here, we discuss an alternative, the latent class VAR model, which models heterogeneity as qualitative variation using a number of discrete clusters. While this model has been introduced before, it has not been readily accessible to researchers. We change this with this paper, in which we provide an accessible introduction to latent class VAR models; evaluate, in a simulation study, how well this model can be estimated in situations resembling applied research; introduce a new R package ClusterVAR, which provides easy-to-use functions to estimate the model; and provide a fully reproducible tutorial on modeling emotion dynamics, which walks the reader through all steps of estimating, analyzing, and interpreting latent class VAR models.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\n\nVisual hallucinations (VH) are a core symptom of both Lewy body diseases (LBDs; e.g., Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) and serotonergic psychedelics (SPs; e.g., psilocybin and mescaline). While these classes of VH differ in etiology, shared pathways are suggested by overlapping phenomenology and neural mechanisms. This review explores similarities and differences in VH between LBDs and SPs, focusing on phenomenology, cortical function, and serotonergic modulation.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis narrative review synthesizes findings from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience to compare VH in LBDs and SPs. The literature includes studies with both human subjects and animal models that examine cortical activity patterns, neuromodulatory mechanisms, and VH phenomenology.\n\nStudy Results\n\nBoth LBDs and SPs exhibit distinct visual aberrations, ranging from minor metamorphopsias to complex hallucinations. Specific classes of VH in LBDs resemble those induced by SPs (e.g., illusory motion and entity encounters), suggesting shared neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies indicate a common pattern of hyperactive associative cortex and hypoactive sensory cortex. At the neuromodulator level, SP-induced VH involves serotonin 2A and 1A receptor (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₁AR) modulation, while in LBDs, 5-HT₂AR upregulation correlates with increased VH, and its inhibition (e.g., with pimavanserin) reduces VH. Two shared cortical signatures are highlighted: reduced visual evoked responses and shifts toward visual excitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nExamining cortical and neuromodulatory similarities between LBD- and SP-induced VH may elucidate the link between visual degradation, excitation, and hallucinogenesis. Future research should employ real-time neuroimaging of discrete hallucinatory episodes to identify shared mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for LBD hallucinations.",

          "abstract": "Research into the construct of statistical learning, the ability to learn structured patterns in the environment, has been exploding in recent years. Despite the plethora of studies, critical reviews have highlighted challenges facing this area of research, including confusion about what statistical learning is, what cognitive and neural mechanisms support it, how these mechanisms map onto different laboratory tasks, and how it relates to other forms of learning, memory, and cognition. These challenges are not unique to statistical learning research but in fact are difficulties confronting the psychological sciences more broadly. In this paper, we use recent conceptual advances regarding the nature of the “theory crisis” in psychology to provide a roadmap for developing a theoretical framework that can provide meaningful and valid conceptualizations of the various phenomena that statistical learning touches upon. First, we describe three important challenges to statistical learning research: a lack of robust phenomena to constrain theories, issues with construct validity, and challenges with establishing causality. Next, we discuss each issue in relation to several research phenomena that have been examined in some detail in the statistical learning research. Finally, we offer recommendations that we believe can help address the theory crisis in statistical learning research to help move the field forward in fruitful directions.",

In this preregistered study, we used a within-subject design in 104 healthy to investigate and directly compare the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain. Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a one-week follow-up. Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on day 1 and day 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days. Sustained effects after one week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1. Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy. These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.",

Early stopping not only preserves resources, but also mitigates risk for participants in clinical settings. Anytime-valid tests always allow for optional continuation, that is, the extension of an experiment regardless of the motivation. For instance, if more funds become available, or if the evidence looks promising and the funding agency, a reviewer, or an editor urges the experimenter to collect more data. Analogously, a researcher can be assured that a 95% anytime-valid confidence interval will, with at least 95% chance, cover the true effect size regardless of how, or even if, data collection is stopped.

          "abstract": "Background: Symptoms of social anxiety and depression often co-occur, but many questions remain about symptom-level co-occurrence and the heterogeneity of symptom presentations across individuals, as well as their emotional functioning. Method: This study used a person-oriented approach, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), to identify distinct profiles (i.e., subgroups) in a UK adult sample (N = 222) varying in presentations of social anxiety and depressive symptoms. Further analyses examined between-profile differences in emotional functioning, including daily affect and emotion regulation. Results: Four profiles were identified: Comorbid, Dysphoric, Socially Anxious, and Low Distress, replicating the four-profile solution revealed in prior research on adolescents. The Comorbid subgroup reported the most pronounced emotional dysfunction, with higher daily negative affect, lower positive affect, and greater emotion dysregulation than the other three subgroups. The Low Distress subgroup reported the best emotional functioning. Limitations: The cross-sectional study design limits our ability to assess the stability of the identified profiles over time. Conclusion: Despite its limitations, this study sheds light on the varied ways social anxiety and depression co-occur, reinforcing the need for transdiagnostic interventions that address diverse symptom patterns and emotional functioning.",

          "abstract": "There seems to be substantial scientific, clinical, and practical interest in the act of playing and its important role in human development and everyday life - from infancy to adulthood. However, for the purpose of standardizing play situations for (experimental) research on dyadic parent-child interaction or child psychotherapy, there seems to be no appropriate theory-based and/or empirically validated framework, as of yet. The present contribution aims at closing this gap and promoting systematic and reproducible research by proposing a descriptive model to categorize and organize play situations based on their potential for subjective experiences and actions while playing. In its current version, our model entails eight categories to describe a given play situation's potential for individual and dyadic experiences and actions in a standardized way. The proposed categories can be used to either (1) rate an existing play situation (or game) on the proposed dimensions (e.g., on a defined response scale) to transparently and systematically describe its profile of potential experiences and likely actions or (2) to organize and design a future play situation in an at most standardized and reproducible way prior to playing. In conclusion, we argue that our model can be a useful and valid tool to, on the one hand, experimentally control specified play situations in an empirical study, while, on the other hand, allowing an at most authentic and naturalistic play interaction between two individuals.",

Multiple probe designs were the most prevalent study method, with frequent reliance on non-standardized measures. Reporting on theoretical frameworks was limited, and adherence to open science practices, including data sharing and ethics statement reporting, was minimal. The findings highlight the need for improved methods to synthesize prevalent single-case evidence in this field. Furthermore, the limited engagement with open science practices warrants exploration of barriers to and support for their implementation.",

          "abstract": "Assortative mating – the tendency to choose partners similar to oneself – is a ubiquitous phenomenon in mate choice. Despite numerous proposed explanations, a parsimonious mechanism has been overlooked: when individuals choose mates based on heritable traits and preferences, offspring inherit a trait and the corresponding preference from each parent, creating genetic correlations that link having a trait to preferring that same trait. We evaluated this mechanism with an agent-based model simulating 100 generations where agents, with traits and preferences each uniquely determined by 40 loci, chose reproductive partners based on preferences. Genetic correlations formed between preferences and preferred traits, as well as between partner traits (i.e. assortative mating), demonstrating that heritable variation in preferences and preferred traits is sufficient to drive assortative mating. We presented a toy model here, which cannot speak to the robustness of such genetic correlations, nor the relative explanatory power of this mechanism over others.",

          "abstract": "To resolve moral dilemmas, people often rely on one of two decision strategies: cost-benefit reasoning versus following moral rules. Previous studies on moral learning show that people learn to use the decision-making strategy that led to the best outcomes in the past. Do they learn this by constructing a mental model of what outcomes would result from using either strategy (i.e., model-based learning) or by assigning value directly to each strategy (i.e., model-free learning)? To answer this question, we adapted the two-step task to a trolley-type dilemma between following moral rules (saving a colleague) versus cost-benefit reasoning (protecting a larger group). In each of the 125 trials, participants’ choices led to either a common or a rare transition, which probabilistically led to good versus bad outcomes. Computational modeling and pre-registered analysis of behavioral data provided converging evidence that participants apply both model-based and model-free learning.",

Can LTM retrieval occur when WM is near capacity, without consequence to either the retrieved or maintained information? Liu, Li, Theeuwes, Wang (2022) presented evidence that even when WM is near capacity, LTM items could still be reported. They argue that retrieved LTM items can bypass WM. We investigated this further by introducing continuous reporting of retrieved information and WM contents to their paradigm. If retrieval bypasses WM, then there should be no impairment of report accuracy to either WM contents or LTM-retrieved information. In the first experiment, WM reports suffered when an LTM item was retrieved. In the second, we found that when WM was near capacity (4 items), the fidelity of LTM reports suffered compared to when WM was not (2 items or no items). Additionally, WM contents were reported with lower fidelity when an LTM item was retrieved compared to a WM-only condition, under both 2-item and 4-item WM load. We conclude that LTM retrieval does not bypass WM.",

Using graph theoretical approaches within a network neuroscience framework, we examined how the developmental timing of displacement (age of displacement, duration of displacement) related to functional integration, segregation, and small-worldness. Syrian refugee children (n=61, MAge=14 Range = 8-18), completed a resting state scan using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging. Data were analyzed to assess the link between neural network properties and developmental timing of adversity. Results indicate that prolonged displacement experienced earlier in life was significantly linked with neural network organization, impacting the balance between the brain's functional integration and segregation as quantified by the overall reduced small worldness in comparison to experiencing displacement at an older age. This study leverages the experiences of refugee children to advance our understanding of how the timing of adversity affects development, providing valuable insights into the broader impacts of early adversity on neurodevelopment.",

It has been proposed that results are better explained by assuming a logarithmic—rather than linear—distance model between numerosities. In contrast, research about the capacity to compare numerosity ratios has received less attention. In this paper, we directly contrasted linear and logarithmic distance models in the context of a visual ratio comparison task. We present data from a task where adult participants compared two sets of red and blue dots and selected the one with a larger ratio of a given color. At the group level, the logarithmic distance model provided a better fit for participants' responses and response times compared to the linear model. At the individual level, the results favored again the logarithmic model for participants’ responses but not for response times. Overall, our findings suggest that visual ratio comparison follows psychophysical laws similar to those observed in numerosity comparison, contributing to disentangling the possible underlying cognitive mechanisms processes.",

          "abstract": "Touch is fundamental to human interaction and well-being, as physical contact often conveys warmth and connection. This study translated and validated the Touch Experiences and Attitudes Questionnaire (TEAQ) in an Italian sample with the aim of offering a culturally appropriate tool to assess diverse touch-related behaviors and attitudes. The Italian TEAQ was administered to 301 participants aged 20 to 66 years (M = 31.78, SD = 10.02). A multidimensional graded response model and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to establish construct validity, while convergent validity was assessed through correlations with the Touch Avoidance Measure (TAM) and Touch Avoidance Questionnaire (TAQ). Discriminant validity was evaluated using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), and associations with mirror-touch synaesthesia (MTS) were also examined. Gender differences in touch attitudes and experiences were assessed.\nResults demonstrated good fit indices and supported the original six-factor structure: Friends and Family Touch (FFT), Current Intimate Touch (CIT), Childhood Touch (ChT), Attitude to Self-Care (ASC), Attitude to Intimate Touch (AIT), and Attitude to Unfamiliar Touch (AUT). Internal consistency was high across subscales (Cronbach’s α: 0.81–0.92). Significant correlations between TEAQ subscales and TAM/TAQ scores indicated good convergent validity, while generally low correlations with BFI traits supported discriminant validity, aside from expected associations with Extraversion and Agreeableness. Significant correlations between TEAQ subscales and MTS screening tool scores underscored the role of sensory processing in touch experiences. Gender differences were consistent with cross-cultural findings, with females scoring higher on FFT, CIT, and ASC, and males scoring higher on AUT.\nThese results confirm the reliability and validity of the TEAQ within the Italian context, underscoring its utility for assessing touch attitudes and experiences. Future research should explore broader applications across varied demographics and clinical populations, especially because of the possible post-pandemic changes of attitudes towards touch.",

          "abstract": "Personality trait similarity among ordinary relatives is surprisingly low, with parent-offspring and sibling-sibling correlations usually r ≤ .15. We explain why these correlations are biased in typical single-method studies and argue that this problem can only be addressed with multi-method designs. We also explain why ordinary relative comparisons can provide a more generalizable way of estimating (additive, narrow-sense) heritability than the better-known twin comparisons. In a sample of parent-offspring (Npairs = 522), sibling-sibling (Npairs = 388), and second-degree relative pairs (Npairs = 476), who rated their Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction and were each rated by an independent informant (Nparticipants = 2,258 + informants), we found that parent-offspring and sibling correlations were about one-third higher than typically shown (r ≈ .20). Based on the ordinary relative comparisons, the heritability of personality traits and life satisfaction was about 40%, compared with about 26% typical to self-report studies. Life satisfaction was as heritable as personality traits, sharing about 80% of its genetic variance with neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. About half of life satisfaction’s phenotypic correlations with neuroticism and extraversion and its entire correlation with conscientiousness were explained by shared genetic factors. Using data from a larger sample of relatives with only self-reports (Nparticipants = 32,004; Npairs = 24,118), we provide further evidence that growing up together does not make people more similar. The results were consistent for both aggregate traits and individual items. Only multi-method designs can accurately reveal traits’ similarity among relatives, and their genetic and environmental transmission.",

Through comparative analysis of artwork from psychiatric archives, online psychedelic art communities, and historical visionary artists, we demonstrate that the Buddhabrot's manifestation. The findings suggest that altered states of mind allow access to deep fractosymbolic realities embedded within the psyche, where fractal geometry and archetypal symbology are one and the same.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Antenatal depression (AD) affects 7-13% of pregnant women and has adverse implications for both mother and child. Treatment of AD often requires pharmacological intervention, typically with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, it remains unclear whether SSRI interventions introduce developmental complications in children that are distinct from those associated with AD. This systematic review aims to investigate the current literature on the effects of AD and prenatal SSRI exposure and its behavioral and neurological consequences for child development.\nMethods: A systematic review of databases PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Scopus were conducted using the PICO framework. Studies utilizing at least two participants groups, one group of children exposed to AD and another exposed to AD and in utero SSRI exposure, were eligible for inclusion. Screening yielded 14 articles on neurodevelopmental and/or behavioral outcomes.\nResults: Studies report effects of both prenatal SSRI exposure and AD-only exposure on several measures. Notably, when compared to non-exposed both SSRI and AD-only exposed children displayed alterations in the corticolimbic system, abnormal language development, and increases in internalizing and externalizing problems. Specific to SSRI-exposed children were alterations in the corticothalamic system, lower full-scale IQ, and impairment of psychomotor functioning.\nConclusion: This systematic review presents updated information relevant to professionals involved in clinical decision-making. Importantly, potentially confounding effects of AD phenotype, environmental factors and maternal care are difficult to entangle from the effects of SSRIs. Ultimately, more studies with multimodal methods and longitudinal measurements are needed to precisely understand how SSRIs and AD influence development.",

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable negative events yield increased stress responses compared to situations over which we have control. Previous studies have assessed the impact of uncontrollability of threat on stress reactivity. Less is known about whether and how acute stress exposure influences how we react to uncontrollable threats. Until now, research has primarily focused on investigating the lack of control despite the idea that losing control may cause greater distress and be more clinically relevant. The current study aims to investigate whether acute stress exposure impacts reactivity to a subsequent loss of control over threat. Ninety-six participants will be equally and randomly allocated to a stress or a no-stress group. Participants will undergo an acute stress induction or a non-stressful procedure, followed by a behavioral loss-of-control task. The loss-of-control task is designed to effectively induce control followed by a subsequent loss of control over aversive electrical stimulation. We hypothesize that participants exposed to acute stress will show stronger biological and psychological responses to the loss of control over threat than those in the no-stress group, as expressed in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase assays, blood pressure measurements, and self-report ratings. In addition, we will assess biological sex, general perceived stress, and childhood adversity as factors that might moderate the relation between acute stress exposure and reactivity to loss of control. Investigating the sensitizing effect of acute stress on the reaction to a loss of control could offer valuable insights into their role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and stress-related disorders.",

          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

          "authors": "Josué Rico-Picó",
          "abstract": "During the first years of life, functional brain networks undergo significant reconfiguration. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown that maturation is driven by both the segregation of nearby functional areas (weakening of short-range functional connections) and the integration of distant regions (strengthening of long-range functional connections). While fMRI provides high spatial resolution, it does not capture rapid neural activity. Therefore, neuroimaging techniques with high temporal resolution, such as EEG, can complement fMRI data. To date, few cross-sectional studies have explored electrophysiological network development, yielding mixed results. Our study addressed these limitations by registering baseline EEG activity in a longitudinal sample of participants who were followed from 6 to 36 months of age. We computed network connectivity using different connectivity parameters (coherence, PLI, and dwPLI), in both binary and weighted networks, separately for oscillatory activity in alpha, theta, and beta frequency bands. The coherence-based connectivity networks showed the most significant age-related changes and consistent results. Specifically, we found that the small-world topology and modularity were prominent from 6 months of age, although the clustering properties and integration of the network increased with age in all frequency bands. These changes occurred in both weighted and binary networks but with opposite directions regarding network integration.",

          "abstract": "Abstract:  The “hard problem” of the origin and nature of intelligence (cognition/“mind”) in the cosmos and its relation to symmetry and symmetry breaking goes back to the Pre-Socratic Parmenides who claimed true reality (ontology) was a state of perfect symmetry and the world of change we know an illusion.  Parmenides problem was that his ideal symmetry was broken ab initio by the cognitive act of him asserting it. This incommensurable separation of the time-asymmetric cognitive part of the world and physics came into modern science with Cartesian dualism and the time-symmetric equations of Newton and then with the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.  The aporia is also found in the belief that unifying the forces of nature under a single symmetry would provide a “theory of everything”.  Cosmology shows, however, it is symmetry breaking rather than symmetry that has brought the universe into being. Irreducible to the time-reversal symmetry of classical and quantum mechanics, an expanded thermodynamics, specifically the addition of the fourth law of thermodynamics, provides a universal explanation.  Coupled with a first-law time-translation symmetry account of information the origin and nature of cognition is readily seen as a direct manifestation of universal law rather than somehow sitting impossibly outside it.",

Associations were examined between maternal and paternal smoking at preconception (3 months pre-pregnancy), periconception (conception to pregnancy awareness), and during pregnancy (trimesters one, two and three), with hospital recorded infant birth statistics (low birth weight, prematurity, small head circumference, small-for-gestational age (SGA), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission).\n\nResults: Smoking was reported by 20% of mothers prior to conception, reducing to 10% post-pregnancy awareness. The frequency of partner smoking was stable across preconception and pregnancy (24%).  Maternal preconception and periconception smoking were both associated with higher odds of infant admission to NICU (aOR = 1·74; aOR = 1·80, respectively). Periconception smoking was also associated with higher odds of prematurity (aOR = 2·05).  Smoking in pregnancy was associated with higher odds of infant low birth weight (aOR = 2·77 to 3·53), prematurity (aOR = 2·79 to 3·78), SGA (aOR = 2.52 to 2·76), and admission to NICU (aOR = 2·21 to 2·40). Limited evidence was found for associations between maternal smoking and small head circumference. There was also limited evidence that perinatal smoking in fathers was associated with adverse infant outcomes, however, our sample of fathers comprised fewer daily smokers which may have impacted power to detect effects. \n\nConclusion: Findings underscore the importance of earlier smoking cessation support for parents prior to, and during the early weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the harmful impacts of smoking on families.",

Prior to colonisation in the late 18th century subsections of these groups were in long-term close contact, their languages co-existing within a local small-scale egalitarian multilingual ecology. Post-colonially reflexes of this system persist, with continued daily interactions between the groups and both languages common within local multilingual repertoires. Other languages of significance in the local space are Bininj Kunwok, Rembarrnga, Ndjébbana, Gurr-goni and Na-kara, as well as English and Kriol in contemporary times. The domains of local community, family and kin, social exchange and marriage are particularly relevant for social contact between Burarra and Yolŋu people.",

          "abstract": "Fossil fuel reliant countries contribute disproportionately to climate change, yet little is\nknown about how nations’ fossil fuel reliance is associated with public support for climate\nchange mitigation. Study 1 (N = 296) found that perceiving one’s country as highly\neconomically reliant on fossil fuels is negatively associated with support for systemic climate\npolicies. Study 2 (N = 102,824) showed across 106 countries that citizens of nations with\ngreater fossil fuel reliance were less likely to believe that climate change should be a priority\nfor their government, more supportive of continued fossil fuel use, and less supportive of\nincreased renewable energy use. Climate denial and lower worry about climate change\nmediated the associations between nations' fossil fuel reliance and citizens' mitigation\nsupport. These findings suggest that fossil fuel reliant countries not only lag in climate\nmitigation efforts, but their citizens are also less supportive of climate policies. These\nfindings may reflect the influence of vested interests in the fossil fuel industry on public\nopinion and underscore the need for a transition that acknowledges citizens’ concerns about\nphasing out fossil fuels.",

          "abstract": "Background: Threat-related behavior is associated with substantial functional impairment in anxiety-related, trauma-related, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. While there is a wealth of research on threat-related behavior involving binary approach-avoidance decisions, other threat-related behaviors are less well-modeled by existing paradigms. In the present study, we describe and provide initial validation for a novel paradigm designed to elicit repetitive threat-neutralization (RTN) behavior.\nMethods: Adults age 18-65 (n=23) completed the Tap-To-Safety task, a novel experimental paradigm designed to elicit RTN. Task stimuli include a threat-cue (CS+) paired with shock, safety-cues CS- never paired with shock, and generalization stimuli (GSs) forming a continuum of similarity between CS+ and CS- which are also never paired with shock. During an extinction phase, the CS+ is no longer paired with shock. The task involves passive trials, in which participants passively view stimuli and/or receive shock, and choice trials, in which participants may tap a button repeatedly to gain protection from shock (i.e., RTN). The amount of tapping on each choice trial is associated with greater protection from shock, but also provides fewer reward points.\nResults: Threat-expectancy, anxiety, and RTN behavior tracked with threat-relevance of cues throughout the task (ps&lt;.001, ηp2 &gt;.38). During the RTN-Extinction phase, threat-expectancy to the CS+ gradually decreased across trials (p&lt;.001, ηp2=0.23). Decreases in anxiety ratings (p=0.172) and RTN (p=0.064) across trials were not significant. Greater RTN was associated with decreased post-RTN threat-expectancy across the task (ps&lt;.015, ηp2&gt;.26); effects on post-RTN reductions in anxiety were significant in early (p=.005, ηp2=0.21), but not later (ps&gt;.051) phases of the task.\nConclusions: The Tap-To-Safety Task represents a promising new probe for compulsions in OCD and other repetitive threat-related behaviors.",

          "authors": "Sahba Saberi",
          "abstract": "Emotion science struggles to establish a unified definition of emotion, arguably largely due to differing perspectives on its constituent components. Traditional theories often conflate cognitive appraisal and interoception under the term ‘emotion.’ We propose a nomenclature shift by delineating interoception from appraisal. Acknowledging that cognition can trigger, interpret, label, or influence emotional experiences, we argue this interaction does not necessitate including cognition as a component of emotion. Instead, defining these components separately enhances understanding of their individual mechanisms and interactions. To support our framework, we examine the current literature, concluding that no strong theoretical or empirical justification exists for combining interoception and appraisal into one construct. Reserving 'emotion' for interoceptive responses alone enhances theoretical clarity, research precision, and clinical effectiveness.\n\nPublic Significance Statement: This paper proposes an approach to redefining 'emotion' as the experience of internal bodily sensations (interoception), distinct from thought processes or interpretations (cognitive appraisal). Through the delineation of these processes, this perspective aims to refine emotion theory and expand its applications in research and practice.",

Across seven studies (N=3,316), we find that concern for future generations correlates with greater meaning, life satisfaction, and flourishing, even after accounting for self-focused future-oriented constructs. These associations are primarily driven by impact-oriented legacy motivation––the desire to make a meaningful contribution––rather than reputational concerns about being remembered. Individuals displaying impartial intergenerational beneficence (IIB)––a sustained concern for all future generations––exhibit particularly strong engagement with impact-driven legacy concerns, which in turn predict well-being. As intergenerational concern was not associated with lower anxiety or depression, deep concern for the far future may reflect both an emotional burden and a source of fulfillment.",

          "abstract": "Background: Changes in motivational biases appear at the heart of many psychiatric disorders. Alterations in motivational biases, in the form of invigorated responding when promised rewards, and holding back when threatened with punishment, have been observed in many psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. However, the specificity of these changes remains unclear. Here, we relate the (in)ability to suppress (maladaptive) motivational biases, to continuous, dimensional measures of psychiatric symptom levels in a sample from the general population focusing on mood-anxiety and impulsive-compulsive symptoms.\n\nMethods: We recruited an online sample from the general population (n = 500) through Prolific Academic, that performed a motivational Go/NoGo task, a cognitive test and a clinical questionnaire battery. We used factor analysis, mixed-effects regressions and computational modelling to link transdiagnostic symptom dimensions to the ability to adaptively suppress motivational biases. \n\nResults: We observed a double dissociation. Higher anxious-depressed symptoms predicted more suppression of motivational biases on trials on which these were incongruent with instrumental demands, resulting in better overall performance. Using a novel computational model, we show that this behaviour might arise from enhanced learning to flexibly suppress the impact of motivational biases. In contrast, higher compulsive symptom scores were associated with overall worse performance, likely reflecting a more general performance deficit.\n\nDiscussion: We speculate that anxious-depressed individuals, showing heightened rumination and anxiety, might recruit excessive cognitive effort for suppressing motivational biases. This more ‘controlled’ mode of decision-making might lead to improved performance in tasks such as this one, but on the other hand exhaust participants and contribute to their symptoms.",

          "abstract": "We use response time decision models to determine whether visual working memory (VWM) is best described by a fixed-capacity `slot' model or a continuously allocated `resource' model. We used a double-decision paradigm that combined continuous-outcome recall and two-choice recognition to characterize performance in a VWM task. Participants viewed one to six colored items, recalled the color of a cued target using a color wheel, and then identified the target color from two options in a recognition task. We used continuous-outcome and two-choice EZ diffusion models to analyze the speed and accuracy of the two decisions. The models provided estimates of the latent cognitive parameters of drift rate and boundary separation, with the former providing measures of the memory strengths in the two decisions. We found significant correlations in both drift rate and boundary separation for the two decisions, indicating that continuous recall and two-choice recognition tasks engage similar memory and decision processes. Removing responses within the highly inaccurate `heavy-tails' of the recall distribution reduced rather than increased these correlations, particularly for drift rates at larger set sizes, implying that the tail responses represent meaningful low-precision memory traces rather than guesses. This finding is consistent with a variable precision or resource account of VWM and inconsistent with a slot model account of VWM. Our findings underscore the value of joint modeling response time and accuracy data, and highlight the utility of double-decision tasks in clarifying theoretical accounts of memory processes.",

Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "abstract": "Bayesian inference allows researchers to evaluate whether a hypothesis on an effect (e.g. effect &gt; 0, effect &gt; Δ) is credible given data and a prior distribution that expresses how an analyst assesses other evidence beyond the data. However, the recipients of an analysis may have different priors, so it remains unclear whether the hypothesis is credible to them. For normally distributed estimates and priors, the ‘sufficiently sceptical prior’ and the associated ‘critical prior interval’ address this problem by asking how strongly one must believe in the absence of an effect in order to be convinced otherwise by the data. Scepticism is expressed in the prior by an expected effect of 0, while the largest standard deviation that makes an effect credible is calculated from the data. We extend this one-dimensional approach by also addressing sensitivity against the second dimension, the prior expectation to vary, that is, including advocacy priors that favour a positive or negative effect. We present a visual tool, called the Region of Evidence (RoE), which shows all normal priors for which the posterior probability that a hypothesis is true exceeds the critical value 1 - α. By requiring only a data estimate and its standard error, it can be applied to any published result. The article describes an open source implementation in R and a standalone web application for use outside of R. Its use is demonstrated with a simple hypothetical example and a real data example of Esketamine treatment in patients with severe major depression.",

          "abstract": "Numerous psychological models of the rationality of human thinking have been developed since the middle of the last century within the line of research known as the heuristics and biases approach, descriptive theory of rationality or decision-making, complex cognition, or the psychology of rational thinking. The focal processes or phenomena are reasoning, decision-making, judging, and inferencing. Families of models revolve around the formal (cumulative) prospect theory, the cognitivist fuzzy trace theory, ecological rationality, and dual process theories. Regarding complex cognitive processing, there is a limited set of principles that researchers in the psychology of rationality implicitly, and sometimes uncritically, attribute to the human cognitive system. These principles may be called “boundary conditions” of the validity of psychological rationality theories, meaning that all psychological models of rational thinking, including currently dominant dual process theories, belong to a set constrained by the postulated qualities of the cognitive system's architecture. Those principles that have not yet been explicitly stated in the literature are as follows: cognitive miserliness, cognitive processing dependence on the environment, knowledge structures, probabilism, and the challenge of individual differences. The paper presents the mentioned principles and their historical antecedents and a proposal for future research questions based on such a juxtaposition.",

          "abstract": "Background: Current screening tools for autism are ineffective and biased, leading to unnecessary referrals and delays in diagnoses, especially for women and people of colour. This has led autism community members and healthcare providers to call for more accurate, unbiased, and scalable screening tools. In recent years, researchers have increasingly recognised the potential of screening tools focused on facial movement differences between autistic and non-autistic people. To make progress, it is necessary to (1) determine which facial movement differences are most prevalent in autistic people, (2) train machine-learning classifiers on these features, and (3) optimise the classifier for subgroups underserved by screening and diagnosis. \nMethod: This proof-of-concept study utilized data from 25 autistic and 26 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched non-autistic people who posed emotional facial expressions across two conditions, resulting in 4,896 recordings.\nResults: First, our Bayesian analyses showed that the estimated prevalence of facial movement differences ranged from 41.05% to 83.16%. Second, we constructed several machine-learning classifiers – trained on the eight most prevalent movement differences (70%+) to distinguish autistic and non-autistic participants. Third, we optimized our best-performing classifier through forward and backward feature selection techniques. Our final K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm achieved 91.87% accuracy, with 88.51% (autistic) and 95.89% (non-autistic) precision, and 96.25% (autistic) and 87.50% (non-autistic) recall. The classifier maintained consistently high performance, with at least 90.99% accuracy, 89.13% precision, and 87.42% recall, across sexes and racial groups. \nConclusions: Here, we demonstrated proof-of-concept that facial movement differences can be used to effectively distinguish autistic and non-autistic people across sexes and racial groups. These results suggest movement-based classifiers could improve the accuracy and equity of autism screening.

This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia.

          "abstract": "Feedback loops are central to the dynamics of mental disorder symptoms, serving as mechanisms that sustain and amplify symptoms over time. Despite their importance, the influence of feedback loop structures on symptom progression and persistence remains underexplored. This study bridges this gap by analyzing a family of simulation models of symptom dynamics describing 98,304 directed networks compatible with empirically observed correlation symptom networks and their feedback loops. Systematic simulations of diverse network configurations revealed that while increasing the number of feedback loops elevates symptom levels, this effect plateaus due to the diminishing impact of overlapping loops. Additionally, networks with evenly distributed connectivity sustain higher symptom levels, necessitating the disruption of multiple feedback loops simultaneously to weaken the network's cohesive structure and reduce symptom persistence. Empirical validation using real-world clinical data supports these findings, demonstrating that frequently observed edges in network structures align with simulated configurations that drive high symptom levels. These results demonstrate that symptom severity and persistence are determined not merely by the presence of feedback loops but by their specific connections. Intervention strategies should focus on disrupting influential feedback structures and key connections rather than broadly reducing connectivity. By integrating computational modeling and empirical analysis, this study advances our understanding of symptom persistence and offers insights for designing targeted interventions to mitigate symptom severity and relapse risk.",

In multivariate linear mixed models adjusting for age, gender, program engagement, and program completion, we observed a significant increase in WHO-5 scores (Cohen’s d = 1.98, p&lt;0.001). Over half of the sample (55.4%) experienced a clinically meaningful improvement on the WHO-5 (i.e., at least a 10-point improvement). BEIS-10 scores also significantly increased from baseline to the end of the program after adjusting for relevant correlates (Cohen’s d = 1.32, p&lt;0.001). \nThese results demonstrate that DCPs can be a viable option for individuals looking to improve their mental well-being. Studies employing hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial designs are now needed to further evaluate the real-world effectiveness of this program.",

          "abstract": "Recovery from work is important for promoting employees’ well-being but little is known about which environments are most conducive for recovery. This article examines the relationship between recovery and experiencing nature and, thus, provides a link between recovery research and environmental psychology. In two studies, we drew on the Effort-Recovery Model and proposed that contact with nature is associated with employees’ recovery experiences and affective well-being. In Study 1, we theorized that appraising nature as aesthetic is an underlying mechanism in the relationship between being in nature and recovery. Using an experience sampling approach with multisource data from self-reports and smartphone photos (N = 50, measurements = 411), we found that being in nature was indirectly related to recovery experiences (i.e., relaxation, detachment) and affective well-being (i.e., positive activation, serenity, low fatigue) via perceived attractiveness. In Study 2, we theorized that appreciative contact with nature (i.e., nature savoring) is linked to enhanced recovery and well-being. Using a randomized controlled trial (N = 66), we found that a nature-savoring intervention, compared to a waiting-list control group, had beneficial effects on recovery experiences and positive affective states. Overall, our results suggest that contact with nature is a prototypical setting for employees’ recovery, and we discuss theoretical and practical implications of this finding for occupational health psychology",

This re-analysis of Rauchbauer et al. (2019) investigated neural activation during human-to-human and human-to-robot interaction. The study partially replicated previous findings, confirming activation in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during human interaction. However, activation in the hypothalamus and amygdala, associated with social motivation, was not replicated. No significant contrast in activation was observed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), consistent with the original results.\n\nRe-analysis is crucial for validation, as differences in preprocessing methods, including alignment, motion correction, normalization, and statistical mapping, can influence outcomes. The findings highlight the need for further research to understand the factors affecting hypothalamus and amygdala activity in social interaction. OpenNeuro provides accessible datasets supporting reproducibility and transparency, while statistical parametric mapping (SPM) in MATLAB enables rigorous fMRI data analysis. By reinforcing knowledge on mentalizing regions and revealing inconsistencies in social motivation networks, this study contributes to advancing functional neuroimaging research.",

          "abstract": "Women who care for multiple highly dependent children require significant support from non-maternal caregivers (allomothers). Theoretically, grandmothers are seen as key allomothers due to low costs and high inclusive fitness returns. Empirically, however, the evidence is inconsistent and the reasons for this variation are not well-understood. Understanding the factors which promote, or hinder, grandmaternal childcare, such as demographic schedules, is an important next step. Here, we explore the demographic predictors of the low levels of grandmothering for 78 Agta children. Due to generational fertility trends (ages of first and last birth) grandmothers still had dependent children until an average age of 52, creating reproductive overlap. Little to no grandmaternal investment after the age of 60 is explained by declining health in older women due to high mortality rates. This means the ‘helping window’ for grandmothering only spans seven years on average, yet the impact of this period is still be limited by multiple dependent grandchildren given high total fertility rates. We suggest then that grandmothering is constrained by 1) generational reproductive overlap and 2) grandchildren competition. Accordingly, we tested how: 1) the number of dependent children and 2) grandchildren associated with grandmothering using Bayesian mixed-effect models. We found moderate to strong evidence that the more children/grandchildren a women had, the lower her investment in each grandchild. Consequently, whether grandmothers help, or not, appears to be a function of demographic schedules, which vary widely. Future formal demographic modelling then will help shed light on the evolution of grandmothering in humans.",

          "abstract": "The PERMA-Profiler is a self-report instrument designed to assess personal psychological well-being, including PERMA (Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment). Despite consistent validation of its descriptive utility and latent five-factor measurement structure, debates persist regarding the distinctiveness and incremental validity of these dimensions. This study applied multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to evaluate the instrument’s between-item multidimensionality and the functioning of its 11-point rating scale using Category Boundary Discriminations (CBDs). Data represented a culturally diverse sample (N = 2,337), including several previously published datasets. Results indicated that a Rasch-compliant MIRT model did not fit, raising questions about the scientific validity of observed mean or sum scores. Attempts to model the intended five-factor PERMA structure were unsuccessful. This appears to stem from unmodeled latent factor associations, which in turn led to inflated residuals, likely reflecting convergence issues caused by generally high correlations among items and factors. Local stochastic dependencies within Meaning also emerged, which may have systematically inflated previously reported reliability and validity indices.These dependencies suggested that the globally framed item M1 might need revision. Analyses of the 11-point rating scale revealed that participants predominantly used the upper end of the scale, with categories 5 through 10 accounting for 84% of responses, suggesting redundancy of response categories. Categories from 0 to 3 therefore showed minimal incremental discrimination. Reducing the number of response categories, and experimenting with alternative labeling and scale formats, could enhance measurement precision and discrimination.",

This study examined the clinical utility of a clinician-rated global evaluation of personality functioning based on the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS). A total of 346 German mental health professionals provided LPFS ratings for 1,403 patients, stratified by thirty-eight diagnostic categories, including, but not limited to, personality disorders. Clinicians reported on each patient’s treatment outcome, recommended optimal treatment components for each patient, and provided their perspective on the clinical utility of the LPFS and its potential risk of stigmatizing patients. On average, clinicians rated the LPFS as \"very useful\", its applicability as \"rather easy\", and the risk of patient stigmatization as \"rather low\". Logistic and ordinal Bayesian multilevel models indicated meaningful associations between LPFS ratings and clinical judgments, highlighting its effectiveness in conveying clinical impressions. Greater impairments in personality functioning were associated with poorer clinician-rated treatment outcome and poorer prognosis. In addition, associations with optimal treatment components yielded a nuanced pattern, with clinicians typically recommending short-term outpatient psychotherapy for patients with mild impairments, long-term psychotherapy for patients with moderate to severe impairments, and intensive care interventions (e.g., outreach care, assisted living) for those with extreme impairments. The results indicate that German mental health professionals consider the LPFS to be a clinically useful concept and that it may be valuable in organizing and communicating information about patients.",

Although antibiotics have saved countless other lives, overuse and misuse of antibiotics increases this global threat. Developing new antibiotics and retraining clinicians can be undermined by patients who pressure clinicians to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics. So we validated two low-cost, scalable interventions for improving antibiotic decisions in an online randomized control trial and a pre-registered replication (N = 985). Both first-person vignette experiments found that an infographic and text message caused intermediate to large improvements in antibiotic decisions compared to active controls — even when controlling for a dozen confounds. Notably, these educational interventions also reduced trust in a clinician who offered antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection. These data show how low-cost adjustments to existing communication systems can teach people to reduce the existential risks of antibiotic resistance and how inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can erode trust in health systems.",

          "abstract": "The formation of career aspirations is an essential developmental task in adolescence. During this stage, young people often face educational and vocational decisions that involve choosing areas of specialization, such as mathematics or language arts. While motivational beliefs (self-concept, interest, or related constructs such as intrinsic motivation) and achievement have been identified as important predictors of math- and reading-related career aspirations, less is known about (1) how career aspirations in these domains evolve, (2) whether associations to motivational beliefs change and (3) whether domain-specific career aspirations themselves predict future motivational beliefs and achievement (i.e., recursive effects). Based on expectancy-value theory and dimensional comparison theory, this study used longitudinal data from adolescents in Germany (N = 8,289) to evaluate the stability, trajectories, and predictors of math- and reading-related career aspirations. Second, we investigated whether within- and cross-domain associations with motivational beliefs change over time and if career aspirations predict future motivational beliefs and achievement. We observed increasing stability of domain-specific career aspirations and slight increases in reading- and math-related career aspirations from adolescence (age 13) to young adulthood (age 21). Associations between intrinsic motivation and reading-related career aspirations were stronger at 16 compared to age 13. Further, cross-lagged panel models revealed partial support for effects from career aspirations to motivational beliefs measured two years later. The results underline adolescence as a critical period for career development and have implications for career counseling and domain-specific specializations during adolescence.",

          "abstract": "The perceptual content (e.g., seen a happy vs. seen a sad face) and also subjective visibility (e.g., whether the stimulus is visible or not) of a given (liminal) stimulus is influenced by the history of previously consciously experienced stimuli. This effect on subjective visibility, termed awareness priming, suggests that findings from a large body of literature on unconscious processing might be confounded by conscious awareness. However, those literatures on unconscious processing used implicit behavioral measures of unconscious processing. The challenge is only valid if previous visible stimuli (not just physically salient) also affect implicit behavior, e.g., response priming. Here, we used Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS) to probe the limits and temporal dynamics of awareness priming effect. We showed that prior conscious exposure to two Chinese words increases both visibility and discrimination accuracy, and also improves the response priming of words presented just at the visibility threshold. A correlation analysis revealed that this effect is only driven by the high visibility of the previous stimuli but not high physical saliency. Our results strongly validated the challenge from awareness priming to the literature on unconscious processing. Moreover, we found a different temporal dynamic for how previous visible exposure to a word affects current perception: previous short-term exposure (1-10 back trials) to a visible word only enhances discrimination accuracy of the same word in the current trial, whereas long-term exposure (10-30 back trials) exclusively elevates visibility. This novel finding suggests that areas higher in the processing hierarchy, with larger temporal receptive field, contribute to consciousness, while areas lower in the cortical hierarchy contribute to objective discrimination.",

These divergent findings indicated that it is premature to assume causal effects of sense of coherence on subjective burden and mental health and the suggestions by Gonçalves-Pereira et al. in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Gonçalves-Pereira et al.

Conversely, social support may impact SGM individuals’ psychological resilience. To quantify the impact of their interpersonal environments, the current preregistered meta-analysis included 181 studies (N = 75,376) that reported associations between social support (i.e., family, peer, partner, school, work) and internalizing psychopathology (i.e., depression, anxiety, nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidality) among SGM samples. Overall, a small, negative association was observed, r = -.26, with depression’s associations being significantly larger than the other psychopathology categories, r = -.30. Smaller effects were observed for samples with a larger share of bisexual individuals and when a SGM-specific measure was used. Otherwise, the negative association between social support and psychopathology was robust to demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, % white), SGM identity (e.g., % gender minority), source of support, and levels of structural stigma. No evidence of publication bias was observed. This robust finding suggests that all forms of SGM social support are similarly and complimentarily associated with lower internalizing psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Some individuals persist in behaviors that incur harm to themselves or others. While adaptive decision-making requires integrating such punishment feedback to update action selection, the mechanisms driving individual differences in this capacity remain unclear. Here, in a sample spanning 24 countries, we used a conditioned punishment task to identify how individuals learn from and adapt to punishment. We identified three, behaviorally robust phenotypes: (1) Sensitive, who correctly inferred punishment causality and adaptively updated decisions through direct experience of punishment; (2) Unaware, who failed to correctly infer punishment causality from direct experience but corrected their decisions following an informational intervention clarifying consequences; and (3) Compulsive, who persisted in harmful decisions despite both punishment and informational intervention. These phenotypes were driven by distinct cognitive mechanisms: (1) causal inference deficits, where individuals misinterpreted punishment causality, impairing correct knowledge acquisition (remediable via targeted informational intervention); and (2) integration failure, a deficit in synthesizing causal knowledge, action valuation, and action selection that rendered decision-making inert to punishment feedback, even after targeted informational intervention. Remarkably, these phenotypes predicted longitudinal outcomes (learning trajectories, choice behavior) six months later. By identifying the cognitive mechanisms driving variation in human punishment learning, this work provides a new framework to understand why individuals persist in harmful behavior and highlights the need for approaches to address these distinct cognitive barriers to adaptive decision-making.",

Furthermore, this paper proposes a comprehensive concept of secondary psychosis spectrum disorder, demonstrating that stress reactions and depression serve as a common foundation for these disorders. Their basis transitions from minimal introversion through normal state to maximal introversion along fluctuations in introversion, i.e., introversion spectrum, and these disorders arise secondarily from this spectrum.

          "authors": "Lærke Høgenhaven; Louis Møgelmose; Hjalmar Bang Carlsen; Jonas Toubøl",
          "abstract": "This study contributes to the sociology of volunteering and crisis research by analyzing the little studied relationship between crisis volunteering (addressing societal crises) and ordinary volunteering (unrelated to crises). This is achieved by examining the resilience of ordinary volunteering during crises, possible spill-over between ordinary and crisis volunteering, and the persistence of crisis volunteering across the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the reception of Ukraine refugees fleeing from Russia’s invasion in 2022. Using data from random samples of Danish adults before (n2020=3,519), during (n2021=1,700) and after (n2024=1,548) the pandemic, the results show that ordinary volunteering was highly resilient to the pandemic despite a significant reduction during the crisis. A five-round panel (n=694) further shows that, while ordinary volunteers transitioned into crisis volunteering, crisis volunteering did not spill over into ordinary volunteering after the pandemic. Rather, crisis volunteers persisted engaging in crisis volunteering when Ukraine refugees arrived in 2022.",

          "authors": "Matías F. Milia; Rigas Arvanitis",
          "abstract": "This chapter presents evidence about the convergences and contrasts in globalization research across English, French, and Spanish. Performing a semantic mapping of scientific publication in three language-oriented databases (Web of Science, HAL-SHS, and SciELO) presents patterns for how globalization has been framed around distinct and shared objects in three linguistic spaces. Results show a marked contrast between research performed in English, focused on finance, global governance, and business competition; in French, stressing territorial dimensions and historical contexts; and in Spanish, stressing developmental challenges and impacts of rising trade openess. Still, convergences emerge around shared research objects like social movements, human-nature relations, and higher education. By comparing similarities and language-based traits, this study illustrates the critical role of language in scientific communication, grasping existent multiplicity in Globalization research. This comparison reveals that globalization research, rather than representing a uniform global conversation, reflects a complex interplay of local and global perspectives, where language serves not only as a medium of communication but as a crucial factor in shaping research agendas and theoretical frameworks. Our findings suggest that globalization can not be considered a mere additive or aggregative process and that linking diverse and asynchronic aspects is a critical component of reflexive takes on the process. These results emphasize that social sciences, far from being a bystander, serve as a critical mediator of globality.",

          "authors": "Max P. Jansen",
          "abstract": "The Impostor Phenomenon (IP) represents a popular research topic among scholars in various disciplines, frequently approached through a lens of individualization and pathologization. This study explores its relevance within the educational domain and contextualizes the IP by examining its association with social group membership along the dimensions of gender, immigration origin, and socioeconomic status. Providing empirical insights into the implications of the IP for social upward mobility through educational gains, this study addresses two research questions: (1) “who is particularly affected by the IP?” and (2) “is the IP negatively associated with educational efficacy beliefs and educational aspirations?”. To investigate these questions, the study applies a sociological framework for understanding the IP from a lens of social theory and examines its social stratification drawing on data from a register-based data collection among German adolescents aged 15-18 (n=4,697). The results of linear regression and probability models for three dependent variables show that (1) the IP is positively associated with disadvantaged social group membership, whereas it is negatively associated with two drivers for educational upward mobility, namely (2) educational efficacy beliefs and (3) educational aspirations. These findings suggest that the IP can undermine opportunities for social upward mobility by reinforcing internalized notions of inadequacy and not belonging to higher educational spheres. As individuals from disadvantaged social groups are more susceptible to the IP, which is associated with lower confidence in educational abilities and reduced pursuit of higher education, the IP appears to constitute an internalized barrier to upward social mobility. These results highlight the societal role of the IP, emphasize the value of understanding it from a sociological perspective, and demonstrate the importance of analyzing it through a lens of social stratification, both within and beyond the educational domain.",

          "abstract": "We examine the effect of childbirth on parents’ environmental and climate concerns, focusing on potentially dynamic changes in concerns within a timespan of two years before and up to 10 years after birth. Additionally, we explore potential heterogeneities by gender, cultural context, educational attainment, and policy periods. By using long-running survey data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study (GSOEP, 1984 – 2020, N=142,779) and estimating linear probability fixed-effects regression models, we contribute substantially to previous research that has been limited by cross-sectional approaches and has found mixed and even contradictory results. Contrary to the popular notion that childbirth leads to higher levels of environmentalism based on legacy motives, our results suggest marginal and mostly negative effects of childbirth on environmental and climate concerns. Overall, the effects of childbirth on planetary concerns tended to be less pronounced in the first years after birth. Over time, however, these effects increased and even reversed. We found no exclusive patterns for men and women. However, there were nuances of relevance by education, normative context, and policy period, highlighting the complex nature of the nexus between family formation and environmentalism. Parents’ reduced focus on environmental and climate challenges may reflect denial mechanisms in highly stressful times, when parents' mental capacity and time availability is limited to immediate and novel challenges within their changed family unit, and when environmentally less favorable behaviors increase.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how collaborative problem framing is accomplished at scale on Stack Overflow, a large-scale online community question answering platform for software developers. Drawing on the practice-based theoretical perspective, the study examines how users coordinate problem framing through interactions with one another and with the platform via asking, commenting on, and editing questions. Based on the sequential analysis of four Stack Overflow threads, the findings specify the role of dynamic jointly created profession specific objects in producing broadly intelligible and solvable problems. The study also unpacks how the technical features of the platform, more specifically the dynamics of the dual space of editing and commenting, enable problem framing and solving to unfold at scale. Finally, the findings unpack interactional strategies enacted by users to coordinate problem framing on the large-scale platform. The study suggests contributions to the fields of professional learning and design of online environments aimed to support problem solving and collaborative activities more broadly.",

          "abstract": "How did the government justify aggressive, and, at times, violent police actions against demonstrators during the pandemic? We use a biopolitical framework to empirically explore how leading members of Poland’s government justified protest policing. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Poland’s PiS-led government, like others across Europe, implemented social distancing measures that curtailed the right to peaceful assembly. The government justified aggressive crowd control tactics such as kettling to “protect” society from what they perceived as illegal and unruly protestors who seek to cause indirect mass harm, e.g. spread the virus via street protesting, or cause direct harm to police officers through physical acts of protester aggression. The government argued that protesters, instead of being whom the state must keep safe from biological harm, actually threaten a vulnerable police force and other institutions. The government projected their own vulnerability to cast protesters as biological threats to the nation and, thus, as dangerously norm-breaking “others,” in order to justify surveillance of demonstrators and aggressive police tactics.",

          "authors": "Miguel A. González-Casado; Alejandro Cruzado Rey; Miroslav Pulgar Corrotea; Christopher McCarty; Jose Luis Molina; Angel Sánchez",
          "abstract": "This article presents an analysis of the impact of the number of alters elicited in an ego network on the structural properties of those networks. There continues to be debate about the pros and cons of eliciting a fixed number of alters for each respondent versus allowing the respondent to list as many or few alters as they would like. This article explores a random assignment of respondents to three treatment groups – 1) a fixed number of alters set at 30, 2) a variable number of alters up to 45, and 3) a variable number of alters up to 45 with a 20 alter minimum. The results indicate that, from a non-structural perspective, all levels of emotional proximity, interaction contexts, genders, and ages are consistently sampled across the three name generators. At the structural level, the behavior of individual metrics is also largely similar. However, the most significant differences arise in the collective behavior of structural metrics—specifically, in their correlation structure, the amount of redundant information each variable provides, and the diversity and interpretability of the observed structural variability. When a name generator constrains network size, it reduces the sparsity of the correlation matrix, effectively decreasing the number of independent global variables needed to describe network structure and making these global variables less interpretable. In other words, networks constructed with a name generator that limits size tend to be more similar to each other, exhibiting less structural diversity and yielding differences that are harder to interpret. However, we discuss how these differences may simply be mathematical artifacts, without necessarily implying a clear advantage in choosing one name generator over another.",

          "abstract": "Amid growing concerns that social media algorithms amplify toxic content, platforms are experimenting with giving users more control over their content exposure. This study examines how promises of algorithmic control influence user satisfaction and content evaluation. Offering users the option to avoid toxic political content increases platform satisfaction. However, those who chose this filtering option rated identical posts as more hostile than those without choice. Respondents exposed only to positive posts also rated them as more hostile than those who saw both positive and negative ones. These findings challenge assumptions about user autonomy, showing how promises of control shape expectations and interpretations. Users offered algorithmic control may hold content to stricter standards or shift from passive consumers to active evaluators, attempting to “train” the algorithm. This suggests content curation reflects complex interactions between users and algorithms, where increased autonomy can paradoxically lead to more critical evaluations even as it improves satisfaction.",

          "authors": "Bruno Sérgio Dias Oliveira",
          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",

          "abstract": "Labor unions have many well-documented effects on economic outcomes that are plausibly related to family formation. I study the impact of unionization on fertility using evidence from the largest expansion of unionism in American history: the enactment of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). I introduce new estimates of local union membership and exploit variation in exposure to the NLRA shock to estimate the place level effect of union growth on fertility outcomes. Unionization has positive effects on birth rates and completed fertility, and can account for approximately 20% of overall fertility increases during the Baby Boom. Effects are driven primarily by wage growth, protection against adverse labor market shocks, and impacts on female labor force participation.",

          "authors": "Valerio Simoni",
          "abstract": "Particularly since 2012, following important changes in the country’s migratory law and the increasing salience of private entrepreneurship possibilities, a significant number of Cuban migrants started envisaging a return to Cuba. Looking at the trajectories of Cuban men that returned to the island mainly from Europe, this paper explores the moral narratives that these migrants deploy when talking about economic life in Cuba in comparison to the countries they are returning from. Such assessments are often linked to the shift in status that such migrants experienced, as they moved from menial jobs in Europe to more entrepreneurial position in Cuba, signifying for many a change from worker to owner, and from ‘trabajo’ (work) to ‘negocio’ (business). Particular attention is paid to the ways in which such shifts are expressed, the role given to the experience of having lived in Europe, and the new forms of economic subjectivity and ideals of economic life that are linked to it. The paper considers the context and climate in which such narratives emerge, relying to do so also on research participants’ own assessment of current changes and continuities in Cuba. The examination of how work and business are enacted and talked about by returnees, combined with a preliminary assessment of the responses this generates among the wider public, signals their influence on how economic life appears to be increasingly articulated and morally framed in Cuba.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEarly studies show that children might be ‘resilient’ when families navigate economic crises and related job loss. What resilience means is unclear, though, and why and from whom resilience is required has seldom been examined.\nOBJECTIVE\nI theorise children’s prosociality – helping, supporting and comforting others – as a form of transformative resilience. From a social reproduction perspective, I also consider how prosociality imbues and is influenced by caregiving relationships within families. I examine how children’s prosociality/caregiving (unpaid labour) developed in response to parents losing and regaining employment (paid labour) amid the Great Recession in Ireland.\nMETHOD\nI rely on cohort data from children’s early years to adolescence (Growing Up in Ireland, 2008-2022). I estimate growth-curve and OLS models for prosocial development and outcomes tapping into paid and unpaid labour. Associations with parental job loss are identified net of observables while outlining conditions for causal claims.\nFINDINGS\nChildren whose mothers experienced job loss are rated more prosocial than their peers from middle childhood onwards. Girls with younger siblings drive this finding. At age 13, the same group is more likely to provide regular care within the household, while their mothers scale back caregiving and reprise paid work after heightened childcare responsibilities during the crisis.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe study contributes to debates on the formation of prosociality, the intergenerational consequences of job loss, and the household division of labour among adults and children. Findings suggest focusing on if and how families cope with a context unequally structured by (labour) markets and gender norms.",

The License allows the agency to “reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work\nfor Federal purposes and to authorize others to do so.” The License is functionally the same as\nother license agreements between parties.

          "authors": "Lukas Rudolph; Laura Seelkopf",
          "abstract": "The use of survey-experimental research with online access panels provided by marketing research companies has grown significantly in the social sciences. These panels offer rapid access to quota-representative samples, enabling generalizable findings alongside causal inferences. However, researchers face a wide range of pricing options, with higher-priced companies often claiming superior quality in terms of respondent attentiveness, honesty, and representativity beyond quota characteristics. This creates a potential trade-off between sample quality and the statistical power achievable within a given research budget. Our study examines this trade-off within the context of Germany, the largest economy in Europe. We solicited bids from all marketing research companies operating in the German market to conduct survey-experimental research. From these, we selected three companies representing low, medium, and high price points, each corresponding to self-reported panel quality. Using identical vignette, priming, and conjoint experiments, along with standard socio-demographic and attitudinal measures relevant to political behavior research, we compared the outcomes across these quota-representative samples. Our findings suggest that for experimental designs, the trade-off between price and quality is less pronounced than commonly assumed. Based on this evidence, we recommend prioritizing statistical power by minimizing costs per respondent.",

          "authors": "Bruno Sérgio Dias Oliveira",
          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",

          "authors": "Łukasz Remisiewicz",
          "abstract": "The role of bibliometric indicators in research assessment has been widely debated. This article explores how citation-based metrics are interpreted and applied in negative habilitation reviews, combining theoretical insights on citation practices with empirical analysis of review discourse. The theoretical section examines different conceptual frameworks for understanding bibliometric indicators, including essentialist, constructivist, and normative perspectives on citations. It highlights how citation metrics are often assumed to reflect recognition, influence, or research quality, despite growing evidence of their contextual limitations. The empirical section analyzes 174 negative habilitation reviews from four disciplines, identifying distinct patterns in how reviewers incorporate bibliometric data into their assessments. While some reviewers treat citation counts and journal rankings as direct indicators of scholarly impact, others regard them as secondary or complementary tools that require careful contextualization. The findings reveal a lack of standardized bibliometric reasoning, leading to inconsistencies in how candidates’ research contributions are evaluated. The study underscores the need for greater transparency and theoretical awareness in the use of citation-based metrics in peer review, contributing to broader discussions on the reliability and standardization of research evaluation practices.",

Drawing on affective polarization research, we highlight the central role of identification and emotions in shaping political in-groups and out-groups. Moving beyond conventional measures of cross-group resentment, we conceptualize polarization as the lived experience of political antagonism. We argue that polarization materializes through struggles for recognition, shaped by the perception and processing of political conflict as it circulates through public communication channels. Adopting a performance-theoretical lens, we connect the symbolic language, emotions, and misrecognition in micropolarization to the broader public drama of political conflict. Using interview data on family and friendship disputes related to COVID-19 vaccination denial in the UK and Germany, we examine how public conflicts manifest in interpersonal relationships. This study suggests a research agenda that explores interactional dynamics across online and offline spaces, diverse social groups, and varying levels of relational involvement, offering a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of political polarization.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines gender differences in paid work over time and illustrates the pitfalls encountered by any comparative research that only considers either labor force participation rates or average working hours. To do so, we analyze harmonized survey data from Europe and the United States from 1992 to 2022 (N=43,283,172) and show that more progress was made in closing gender gaps in labor force participation rates than in working hours. In most countries, women’s labor force participation rates increased considerably, but their average working hours decreased, whereas both men’s labor force participation rates and average working hours decreased or stagnated (but nonetheless still remained much higher than women’s). We show and argue that these countervailing trends in working hours and labor force participation rates make it difficult to paint a coherent picture of cross-national differences in women’s and men’s paid work and of changes over time. In response, we propose “work volume” as a supplementary or alternative measure for any type of comparative research. Work volume records zero working hours for nonemployed individuals and thus allows straightforward comparisons between women’s and men’s (or any other groups’) involvement in paid work. Using the proposed work volume measure, we show that gender gaps in paid work decreased over time, but that even in 2022, men’s involvement in paid work remained considerably higher than women’s—with gender gaps being lowest in the Scandinavian and the former Communist countries.",

In consequence, the Finnish government has abandoned the assimilationist model for the adoption of multiculturalism which is still under experimentation. To better figure out how multiculturalism has been understood and carried out in Finnish early childhood education and care, we utilize thematic analysis in joint with critical discourse analysis methods to study Finnish core curricula for the early childhood education and care, published respectively in 2003 and 2016. Results suggest that since 2016, cultural diversity in Finland has been considered as an enriching resource to the society. The right of using and developing mother tongues has been included in Finnish multicultural early childhood education and care. Second, schools have replaced families and parents to become the primary responsible for supporting and developing cultural diversity. Third, different groups, namely Sami, Roma, and immigrants, enjoy differentiated supports for developing their culture in newly reformed multicultural ECEC education.",

          "authors": "Heng-Chien Liou",
          "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the current of queer theory has flown through various departments and disciplines. Following its intellectual roots in post-structuralism, queer theory has proven its worth for investigation on the subjects of sexuality, especially in art and humanities. However, queer theory’s influences in other academic fields, such as social sciences and biomedical science, are given less attention. In particular, the relationship between queer theory and sociology past and now need to be revisited: (1) How has sociology, well-known for its epistemological pluralism, responded to the queer theoretical interventions? (2) How has the poststructural critique inspired, contributed to, or challenged sociological scholarship? (3) How do such interactions differ between the center and the periphery of global academic? To answer these questions, I dived into the academic archives looking for clues by close-reading the seminal queer sociological works from the 1990s to the present, and tracing the genealogy of interaction between the two disciplines. Given the radical roots of sociology, such as Marxism and critical theory, we may assume that queer theory and sociology enjoy a considerable affinity. However, the relationship between the two is indeed indeterminate and often comes into tension or confrontation. I divided the developments into three periods and identified the major conceptual themes in each period. Finally, I conclude this article with the remarks and future directions illuminated by this genealogical investigation of queer sociology. My aim for this article is to serve as a map for prospective students and scholars of queer theory and sociology to navigate the intellectual landscape of queer sociology.",

Through several case studies from the observatory, we examine specific instances of methodological flaws, data integrity issues, and the challenges of maintaining scientific rigour and effective peer review under emergency conditions. While the prototype demonstrates the potential for creating a crowd-sourced comprehensive repository of post-publication reviews, it also reveals limitations such as resource constraints and the complexities involved in selecting and presenting articles and responses.

          "abstract": "The energy transition has driven the rapid expansion of associated technologies, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. Although promoted as clean and renewable, these technologies, due to their intrinsic characteristics, rely heavily on minerals for their manufacturing - many of which have recently been classified as critical. This article examines the impact of the significant increase in demand for these minerals. Using the International Renewable Energy Agency’s definition of critical minerals - which includes cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium, and rare earth elements - we conducted extensive data collection, systematization, and analysis on a global scale to identify the main producing countries and the contexts surrounding their extraction. The results reinforce a historical pattern in which most critical minerals for the energy transition originate from Global South nations, predominantly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In countries where environmental, social, and economic regulations are often more flexible, the profitability of large international corporations is favored. Furthermore, our findings reveal that, in many cases, the extraction of these minerals is linked to severe social, environmental, and economic impacts, ranging from extreme pollution and worker contamination by toxic metals to the financing of militias associated with authoritarian military regimes. These issues, often overlooked in dominant energy transition narratives, deserve greater attention and reflection from both the scientific community and society at large.",

At formation, a typical board is entrepreneur-controlled. Independent directors join the median board after the second financing and hold a tie-breaking vote. Their presence is particularly likely when potential VC-entrepreneur conflicts are larger. At later stages, control switches to VCs and independent director characteristics change. These patterns align with key financial contracting theories, but also highlight unique roles of independent directors over the life cycle: mediation followed by advising. Independent directors thus represent another potential source of value-add to startup performance.",

This paper develops a novel account of why democratic citizens have a moral right to so abstain and why non-voting is morally permitted.

And the paper justifies that permission by appealing to citizens fundamental moral claim to be autonomous agents. In developing this argument, the paper improves upon existing arguments for the right not to vote and helps the general public figure out what the legitimate place of non-voting is in a democratic society.",

          "abstract": "Equality of opportunity is a principle of social justice, although there are different conceptions of it. We distinguish between liberal and radical equality of opportunity. Both conceptions consider unfair inequalities in life chances that result from ascribed characteristics such as social origin, migration background, and sex. However, they differ in that liberal equality of opportunity considers it fair when innate abilities affect life chances. Conversely, radical equality of opportunity places innate abilities in the category of morally arbitrary factors that do not provide a fair basis for inequalities in life chances. We use polygenic indices (PGIs) to better disentangle the role of innate abilities from the roles of ascribed characteristics and individual choices. We compare this approach to using measures of skills observed later in life. We apply this approach to two survey datasets, (1) the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and (2) the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). According to our results, radical inequality of opportunity is considerably larger than liberal inequality of opportunity, especially for education. Measuring innate abilities using PGIs leads to very similar conclusions as using skills measured later in life. However, the differences between liberal and radical inequality of opportunity are smaller using PGIs than using measures of observed skills.",

          "authors": "Niall Reddy",
          "abstract": "A hugely influential framework in South African political economy holds that the country has been dominated for the better part of a century by a Minerals Energy Complex (MEC) comprising powerful firms and state agencies involved in mining and a range of downstream industries. The MEC is said to act as a 'system of accumulation' determining patterns of accumulation across the economy. This paper argues that MEC theories rest on hollow empirical foundations. It shows, firstly, that the apparent size, stability and integration of MEC sectors in national accounting data are a statistical artifact of the overly expansive and ad hoc way in which the MEC has been defined. Secondly, it shows that the political-institutional conditions for an MEC system of accumulation no longer exist, if they ever did. Conglomerates related to MEC sectors once possessed the ability to shape economy-wide accumulation dynamics but it's unclear if their interests were ever geared towards the self-reproduction of core sectors at the expense of diversification. With liberalization those capacities were dismantled. MEC firms never regained their position at the top of the corporate hierarchy and in fact there is no clear evidence of them even acting as coherent fraction of capital. Far from favoring the MEC, the post-Apartheid state meekly pursued diversification but was stymied in this by it's own lack of capacity. This left commodity dependence intact -- not as a result of the MEC, but of state enfeeblement induced first by neoliberalism and then by state capture. The paper closes by showing how assumptions of corporate hegemony -- latently embedded in MEC theories -- leave us unable to explain major trends in South African political economy like state capture.",

Prior studies have detected that older adults who provide support to one party are more likely to offer help and care to family and other close ones; however, there is a lack of research on multitasking that examines whether helping others is associated with grandparental childcare. We used data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe from 27 countries to examine whether (i) informal caregiving (i.e., informal, unpaid care provided in the same household) and (ii) informal support (i.e., informal, unpaid support provided to someone outside the household) are associated with grandparental childcare. We found that informal caregiving in the same household was associated with neither an increase nor a decrease in grandparental childcare. However, informal support given to someone outside the household was associated with increased grandparental childcare. These findings are discussed in relation to resource competition in a family, grandparental role extension, and grandparental role overload.",

          "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage points higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed their pension in early 2023. In this study, we assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension take-up using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. We also analyse differences in responses by socioeconomic status and gender. The extraordinary pension index adjustment increased the probability of claiming the partial old-age pension in the first month after becoming eligible for it by around 8 percentage points, or around 80 per cent. The effect is explained by individuals claiming a pension sooner than they would have in the absence of the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

          "abstract": "Sentencing research is rarely cross-jurisdictional. More problematically, most quantitative sentencing research is based on a limited number of American jurisdictions where court data is available. As a result, it is difficult to assess the extent to which key findings from the sentencing literature apply universally. We build on the recent growth of sentencing research outside the US to explore the external validity of studies reporting the conditional association of offenders’ race and gender with sentence length. To do so, we conduct two multi-level meta-analyses, distinguishing the proportion of between-study heterogeneity attributable to differences at the study and jurisdiction levels. Our findings reveal that while race disparities in sentencing are statistically significant, they are minimal in magnitude (a 3% penalty for racial minorities) and remarkably consistent across jurisdictions. In contrast, gender disparities are more pronounced (a 13% penalty against men) but highly variable, with some jurisdictions showing parity. Both analyses uncover substantial variability due to sample and modelling choices, highlighting the limited generalisability of existing sentencing research. We urge caution in interpreting findings from single studies on sentencing disparities and advocate for the pre-registration of analytical strategies to mitigate researcher bias.",

          "abstract": "Environmental challenges, social pressures, and international agreements underscore the need for a transition to renewable energy sources. This shift is driven by the economic feasibility of technologies such as solar and wind power. However, the transition to renewable energy faces significant obstacles: its lower energy density compared to fossil fuels requires larger structures to produce equivalent amounts of energy. Additionally, these sources have a shorter lifespan than conventional ones, leading to increased demand for minerals, which are often extracted in Global South countries. This dynamic may exacerbate the socio-environmental conflicts and impacts associated with mining. Based on data collection and analysis from various global reports, complemented by academic studies from different regions, this study explores the intrinsic connection between renewable energy sources and the expansion of mining activities, highlighting the implications of this process.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Antti O Tanskanen; Jenni Pettay; Mirkka Danielsbacka",
          "abstract": "We examined the extent to which the socioeconomic status (SES) of grandchildren’s families (measured by parental education and household income) is associated with the frequent child care help and financial support grandparents channel towards their descendants. Several studies have shown that (i) grandparental investment varies according to gender and lineage, and (ii) differences in family relationships tend to exist between lower and higher SES families. However, there is a lack of studies examining whether grandparents invest more in grandchildren from lower or higher SES families in contemporary affluent societies, and whether this differs between maternal and paternal grandmothers and grandfathers. We used population-based data on younger and middle-aged adults from Germany. To study the associations between family SES and grandparental investment, we applied generalized ordered logit odds models. Grandparents provided frequent childcare help more often to grandchildren whose parents had higher levels of education and income. Specifically, frequent childcare help from maternal grandmothers increased as parental education levels rose. Additionally, paternal grandparents provided more financial support to families in the medium, high, and highest income classes compared to those in the lowest income class. There was evidence that grandparents invest more in grandchildren from higher SES families than in those from lower SES families. The findings suggest that grandparental support may widen the inequality between advantaged and disadvantaged children.",

A diferencia de la mayoría de otros lugares, el envejecimiento de Puerto Rico está impulsado tanto por (a) el descenso en la fecundidad y mortalidad y por (b) altos niveles de emigración en adultos en edad laboral que contribuyen a su índice de envejecimiento poblacional de forma tanto directa (con el traslado de los jóvenes) e indirecta (con la disminución de nacimientos). Este artículo ofrece una perspectiva general de los principales asuntos que rodean el envejecimiento de la población en Puerto Rico. Los responsables políticos y los líderes gubernamentales deben prever el envejecimiento poco convencional de la población de Puerto Rico, que agudiza las preocupaciones habituales sobre la sostenibilidad de los servicios públicos y las perspectivas económicas a largo plazo. Surgen preocupaciones adicionales relacionadas con la reducción de las estructuras de apoyo social y su impacto en la dinámica de la ciudad y las repercusiones para la salud. La singular historia política de Puerto Rico y su relación con los Estados Unidos presenta retos y beneficios para su población. La investigación sobre el envejecimiento en Puerto Rico y las políticas de salud pública deben adaptarse a las necesidades de la sociedad en proceso de envejecimiento del país.",

Recognising the challenges of working across different organisations, we created a role for a nurse to serve as an 'in-place research coordinator'. By recruiting directly from the NHS Trust, this coordinator brought valuable organisational insights to the research team whilst gaining research experience through applying their professional knowledge and connections.\nConclusion: This paper details, using practical examples, how the role of an ‘in-place’ research coordinator made this interorganisational research happen with measurable efficacy and impact.",

          "authors": "Ilari Ilmakunnas; Susanna Sten-Gahmberg; Timopekka Hakola",
          "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage points higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed their pension in early 2023. In this study, we assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension take-up using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. We also analyse differences in responses by socioeconomic status and gender. The extraordinary pension index adjustment increased the probability of claiming the partial old-age pension in the first month after becoming eligible for it by around 8 percentage points, or around 80 per cent. The effect is explained by individuals claiming a pension sooner than they would have in the absence of the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

We code the policies of 221 political science journals, and we find that only 20% of these journals require researchers to share their data and/or code as a condition of publication. While requirements to share data and code are common among the most visible political science journals, these policies remain relatively rare in the discipline more broadly. In prioritizing reforms to improve openness and reproducibility in political science, we suggest remaining mindful of the relative rarity and simple effectiveness of requiring authors to share their data and code.",

          "authors": "Joachim Wehner; Daniel de Kadt",
          "abstract": "Elites worldwide have used a variety of indirect tools to exclude specific racial groups from the electorate when laws or constitutions prevented them from doing so directly. Yet because voter registers rarely capture race, how these tools affect the composition of the electorate remains unclear. We contribute foundational micro-evidence from newly digitized archival data for all 135,457 voters registered in the Cape Colony (South Africa) in 1903, including their racial classification. We examine franchise restrictions introduced by Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes a decade earlier, and find they reduced registered voters of color by at least one third relative to white voters, likely shifting crucial election outcomes. Tracing how race, class, and geography intersect at the individual level, we find increased property requirements had the largest impact. This reveals a trade-off between the breadth and precision of different tools of racial disenfranchisement, with consequences for the socioeconomic composition of the electorate.",

          "abstract": "The Global Biodiversity Framework aims to shift financial flows into biodiversity by at least $700 billion per annum by 2030 and emphasises the role of the private sector in addressing the ‘biodiversity finance gap’. Here we apply a novel systematic review method to non-academic (‘grey’) literature coupled with natural language processing and social network analysis to identify trends in biodiversity finance terminology, actors and networks between 2000 to 2022. Our results illustrate the recent explosion in biodiversity finance grey literature since 2020, and increased prevalence of financial over conservation terminology. Text analysis shows the frequency with which mechanisms for generating private investment in nature are mentioned is greatly disproportionate to estimates of their current and projected role in overall biodiversity financing. Our findings highlight the growth in number and diversity of biodiversity finance actors over time, while also pointing to the centrality of a powerful few in driving financialised discourses.",

          "authors": "Niall Reddy",
          "abstract": "A large literature in heterodox political economy addresses an apparent puzzle in which investment has declined while profits have held up during the financialization era. The dominant answer to this puzzle centers on the rise of shareholder value orientation and the “downsizing and distributing” (DD) imperative it imposes on firms. Yet the detailed empirical literature on the topic - focussed on partial effects - pays precious little attention to actual observed patterns of growth, investment and distribution at a firm level. Digging deep into firm level data and correcting several conceptual and measurement errors, this paper challenges several key stylized facts of the financialization account, revealing a different set of patterns which are very difficult to square with stronger versions of DD theory. It shows that the profit-investment puzzle is not a paradox of the financialization era, but only of the post-2000 period. Similarly, the ramping up of payout rates only happens in a broad way after the turn of the millennium. While financialization theories cannot account for the 2000s watershed I argued that a trifecta of other structural shifts can. Ultimately this paper questions the widespread practice of giving analytical priority to financialization in heterodox political economy.",
