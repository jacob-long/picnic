          "abstract": "Background\nPeer review-based funding evaluation systems are under increasing pressure. To help alleviate this, innovative approaches like Distributed Peer Review (DPR) – where applicants review proposals for the same funding call – are being explored. The Volkswagen Foundation trialled DPR alongside conventional panel review for an interdisciplinary call. Evaluation of this trial provides insights into the dynamics of (distributed) peer review. \n\nMethods\nAll proposals (N=140) underwent both DPR and panel review. In DPR, applicants (N= 323) reviewed four or five proposals, providing an overall score, scores for each funding criteria, and a comment. Proposals were ranked using a trimmed mean score. Expectation and feedback surveys were administered. Panel review involved shortlisting by VWS staff, panellist review (N=8), and a final panel discussion. Semi-structured interviews with applicants, panellists, and VWS staff (N=20) explored perceptions and experiences of DPR, using thematic analysis. Quantitative analysis of review data and surveys utilised bootstrapping to assess decision stability and mixed effects models for consistency between reviewers. Qualitative and quantitative results were integrated in a convergent parallel design.  \n\nResults\nDPR recommended ten proposals for funding, while the panel recommended eleven; three overlapped. Funding criteria strongly predicted overall score; ‘Originality’ was given most weight by both sets of reviewers. Stability of DPR funding decisions was modest; across 500 bootstrapped samples a mean of 5.49 out of ten previously funded proposals would still be funded. This may be explained by high inter-reviewer variability: more variance was attributable to between-reviewer differences (20.04%) than between-proposal differences (8.87%). Advantages of DPR included increased efficiency, faster decision times, detailed feedback to applicants, and democratisation of funding evaluation. Noted disadvantages were burden on applicants, absence of discussion, and perceived lack of reviewer expertise. Funders implementing DPR must consider the high initial effort, potential for ‘gaming’, and reduced direct influence.  \n\nConclusions\nThis trial demonstrates feasibility of DPR for an interdisciplinary funding programme. Implementing a DPR process requires funders to accept trade-offs, but can offer valuable benefits, including shortening time to funding decision. Building on established peer review principles, it has the potential to contribute to the democratisation of funding evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Developmental science has made great strides in understanding how child social and economic circumstances, including material, environmental, economic, or psychosocial stressors, shape outcomes. More recently, developmental scientists have argued we need to operationalize socioeconomic disadvantage clearly and consistently and in a more sensitive and holistic way. However, there is a need to bring together these perspectives to understand how we should operationalise and measure socioeconomic disadvantage in ways that are both context-sensitive and precise, striking a balance between mechanistic insight and policy relevance. This paper highlights three ways in which we can develop a more holistic, comprehensive and inclusive understanding of how socioeconomic disadvantage shapes child development. We propose that measures of socioeconomic circumstances should be meaningful to the population under study and their ecological context; that multiple pathways should be considered; finally, we should strive to capture heterogeneity in family circumstances which includes strengths, as well as hidden costs.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines child well-being and quality of life from a comparative perspective between Mexico and the United States, challenging hegemonic approaches that reduce these constructs to individual and decontextualized indicators. Through a sociohistorical and critical analysis, it argues that in contexts marked by structural violence, historical inequality, political repression, and militarization, quality of life cannot be understood without attending to historical, structural, and psychosocial trauma shaping the material, relational, and symbolic conditions of everyday life.\nThe paper contends that much of the research on child well-being, developed primarily in the Global North, has privileged normative metrics that overlook the social and political processes producing distress, thereby contributing to the epistemic silencing of children’s experiences. From a decolonial perspective, the study calls for moving beyond indicator-driven logics toward ethical, situated, and trauma-sensitive interpretive frameworks that recognize children’s and adolescents’ narratives as legitimate sources of knowledge.",

          "authors": "Verena Eunike Hofmann; Julia Glombiewski; Saskia Scholten",
          "abstract": "Background. Chronic pain is a highly prevalent condition that requires multimodal treatment approaches. Among non-pharmacological interventions, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is guideline-recommended. Although its efficacy is well established, overall treatment effects remain moderate. Recent efforts to enhance outcomes of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy have focused on process-based and personalised approaches. While psychotherapists commonly tailor treatment using case formulations, such decisions often rely on clinical judgement, which has been shown to be inconsistent. As the data base for purely data-driven treatment algorithms in chronic pain remains insufficient, structured input from clinical and scientific experts appears to be a necessary interim step – one that may also help to bridge the science-practice gap.\nMethods. In this mixed-methods study, focus groups, online surveys, and an adapted Delphi technique were used to develop a Matching Matrix linking cognitive behavioural modules to process-based treatment targets. Twenty-two clinicians participated in the first Delphi round consisting of five focus groups and selected two modules per item. Fifteen clinicians contributed to the second round via an online survey. Their recommendations were subsequently validated by a focus group of four chronic pain researchers. \nResults. For all 23 target processes, two cognitive behavioural modules could be matched based on the assessed data. However, eight out of 46 item-module pairs required discussion within the study team due to insufficient consensus. Overall, especially the first-choice modules appear well-founded.\nConclusion. The presented Matching Matrix is a first step towards the development of a broader evidence base for data-informed clinical decision-making in the treatment of chronic pain.",

          "authors": "Fabiola Diana; Julia Folz; Elio Sjak-Shie; Ruud Hortensius; Mariska Kret",
          "abstract": "Across species, cooperative decisions are often asymmetric: one individual risks their own resources before knowing whether others will reciprocate. Such uncertainty is central to the evolution of trust and reciprocal exchanges. Physiological synchrony is frequently assumed to support cooperation, yet it remains unclear both how synchrony arises and how it functions in these asymmetric social interactions. We tested whether mutual visibility shapes physiological synchrony, and whether synchrony in turn predicts cooperative behaviour in repeated trust-reciprocity exchanges. Skin conductance synchrony was stronger and more temporally aligned when individuals interacted face-to-face, yet facial expressivity did not account for this effect. Contrary to the dominant perspective, higher synchrony predicted reduced reciprocity, and only when partners could see each other. Exploratory analyses suggested that this negative link depended on arousal, indicating that the social function of synchrony is shaped by both mutual visibility and the affective state of the individual involved. These findings show that physiological synchrony is not a uniformly prosocial mechanism but a context-dependent phenomenon that can undermine cooperation under certain conditions, offering insight into the mechanisms and the function of synchrony in shaping cooperative exchanges.",

          "abstract": "Simulation studies have received little attention in the replication crisis. In this exploratory study, we investigated reporting practices, open science practices, and trustworthiness of simulation studies in psychology. 221 researchers (response rate = 35.1%) completed a questionnaire about one simulation-based article they authored in 2023 or 2024. Authors reported at least some selective reporting of conditions, methods, and performance measures in 50.2% of the articles. Reporting of nonconvergence and Monte Carlo Standard Errors was uncommon, likely due to limited awareness and weakly established norms. Only 19% of articles were neutral (i.e., authors did not develop evaluated methods), but selective reporting was not lower in these studies. Over 75% of authors reported sharing their complete code, but important measures for reproducibility like providing code instruction (39.6%) and independent code checking (20.3%) were uncommon. Guidelines were not used because researchers were unaware of them, perceived them as unnecessary, or considered them uncommon in their field. Authors estimated the probability that conclusions of a typical simulation study are trustworthy to be .74, exceeding estimates for computational reproducibility (.64) and complete reporting (.55). Because our findings are based on self-report and are more favorable than prior literature reviews, prevalence estimates may be optimistic. As responsible reporting standards and code-sharing in simulation studies were not standard, we recommend journals to endorse reporting standards such as ADEMP (Morris et al., 2019), use standardized repositories and workflows for sharing materials, and check for availability of code.

          "authors": "Hubert Plisiecki; Anna Sterna; Emma Maciejewska; Marcin Moskalewicz",
          "abstract": "Bridging computational phenomenology with phenomenological psychopathology requires methods that preserve the lived, contextual texture of clinical narratives while still enabling statistical inference. The Supervised Semantic Differential (SSD) supports this goal by measuring and explaining how speakers construe target concepts from language, aggregating pretrained word embeddings from local contexts around lexically anchored concept references to derive interpretable semantic directions. Here, we adapt SSD for cross-group comparison by combining permutation-based inference with centroid-contrast interpretation of personal concept vectors. We apply the method to Polish life-story clinical interviews from in-patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), and a non-clinical control group ($N=62$), focusing on the concepts of self and time. Self-concept representations show robust omnibus and pairwise separations across all groups, indicating broad cross-diagnostic differences in narrative self-construal. In contrast, time-concept differences are driven primarily by BPD-related contrasts, with no reliable separation between NPD and controls, suggesting BPD-specific disruption of lived temporality. Qualitative cluster interpretation indicates that BPD narratives organize experience through relationally contextualized affective episodes and potentially crisis-linked temporal scaffolding (explicit dates, durations, and waiting), whereas NPD self-construal is comparatively decontextualized and self-referential, emphasizing regulation, stability/variability talk, and low-arousal negative affect. We relate these findings to existing phenomenological accounts of disturbed self-experience and temporality in personality disorders.",

          "authors": "Tjerk Tian Dercksen; Andreas Widmann; Nicole Wetzel",
          "abstract": "Predictive coding conceptualizes attention as a weighting of prediction error signals. However, empirical findings on how attention influences common markers of prediction error have been inconsistent, likely because these markers are typically derived from stimulus-evoked responses. To avoid stimulus-related confounds and isolate effects related purely to prediction, we investigated how attention modulates brain responses to unexpected stimulus omissions. Using visual-auditory couplings where the auditory stimulus was occasionally omitted, we recorded EEG responses that revealed a multi-stage omission response – from early sensory to later higher-level prediction error activity. Voluntary attention was manipulated along two dimensions: (1) toward the visual or auditory modality, and (2) toward the moment of stimulus presentation or sustained over time. Early sensory prediction error, reflected by the omission N1, was unaffected by any manipulation of attention. In contrast, later high-level prediction error processing, reflected by omission P3 responses, was strongly affected by directing attention: robust responses were elicited when attention was directed to the auditory modality – where the prediction had been violated – but these were markedly reduced or absent when attention was directed to the visual modality. These results suggest an attentional system that does not affect low-level sensory prediction error, but is capable of influencing distinct stages in the processing hierarchy in service of task performance. This first investigation of how attention affects different stages of omission activity suggests that voluntary attention may modulate prediction error processing via specific neurotransmitter systems and demonstrates this approach’s potential for reliably studying precision-weighting in the brain.",

          "abstract": "On March 9, 2016, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul, AlphaGo defeated world champion Lee Sedol 4-1, marking a milestone in machine intelligence. But unlike humans, AlphaGo pursued a single fixed goal. Humans continually revise their goals and preferences, raising the question of how learned value representations support such flexibility. Previous work on goal-dependent learning has focused on goal selection or maintenance, largely neglecting how the structure of value representations affects learning when goals change. Here, using two multi-goal learning paradigms combined with computational modelling, we compare two learning architectures: reweighting existing values versus relearning them. We show that participants using feature-based representations adjusted more quickly and monitored decisions more effectively by reusing learned feature values. In contrast, participants relying on a single composite value were forced to relearn after each switch. These findings show that value representation structure shapes learning efficiency and behavioural flexibility in multi-goal environments.",

          "authors": "Albert Łukasik; Marcin Moskalewicz; Ryan Kemp",
          "abstract": "Phenomenological psychopathology considers disturbances in temporal experience as a core of addictive behaviors. While psychological and cognitive neuroscientific research typically focuses on objective measures of temporal distortion, it often bypasses the aspects of lived experience crucial to understanding the existential impact of substance abuse. Employing an applied phenomenological framework and based on a meta-synthesis of existing research, this article examines how the temporal experience of individuals with addiction transforms in recovery. The temporal dysregulation during the illness stage consists of living in the present, dominated by immediate gratification and cyclic routines, with the fragmented space of past experience and a constricted, often inaccessible future. On the other hand, during recovery, individuals with addiction exhibit a notable shift towards temporal coherence, demonstrating increased reflection on past experiences, enriched present awareness, and the renewed ability to envision future possibilities. This claim is justified by the changes in language through which they report their lived experiences of time, and which begins to conceptually resemble the language of the therapists.",

          "authors": "George Gabriel; Faisal Mushtaq",
          "abstract": "As demand for problem-solving skills continues to grow, so does the need for efficient training methods. A potential method of achieving efficient training of problem-solving skills is to design a training programme that maximises transfer of learning between problem domains. However, current models of problem-solving make contrasting predictions about the conditions under which cross-domain transfer is possible. While pattern-recognition models using state-action associations allow only limited transfer to tasks with different actions, heuristic search-based models using state-value estimates can reuse learning across tasks, potentially achieving greater transfer. In this study, we consider the case of transformation problem-solving tasks where each task uses a distinct and non-overlapping set of transformation rules. Participants trained using tasks from one taskset over four consecutive days and completed pre- and post-training probes on the untrained set. Training improved participants’ solution rate, efficiency, and decision speed, but there were no reliable improvements for the untrained tasks beyond what could be explained by direct practice during the probe blocks. There were no consistent trends in participants’ self-reported strategies across sessions, but use of a strategy involving explicit deliberation over which actions to take was consistently associated with better decisions. We note that the absence of transfer contrasts with the predictions of the heuristic search account of problem-solving in which a learned rule-independent state-value heuristic is reused across tasksets to decide actions. We discuss potential reasons for this absence of transfer and its possible implications for future models of problem-solving and for the training of problem-solving skills.",

          "abstract": "Objective. Procrastination is a common self-regulatory difficulty leading to impaired well-being. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the most promising intervention for procrastination, it remains unclear whether outcomes vary across individuals and which mechanisms drive therapeutic change. To address these gaps, we synthesized key mechanistic accounts of procrastination in an integrative cognitive-behavioral (ICB-P) model outlining processes involved in development and persistence of procrastination. We then comprehensively examined the processes of change in CBT for procrastination.\nMethods. Candidate moderators and mechanisms of therapeutic change were examined in secondary analyses of pooled data (N = 459) from two randomized controlled trials comparing CBT for academic procrastination with a wait-list control. Procrastination severity and a wide set of candidate mechanisms were assessed at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. Moderation analyses and longitudinal structural equation models with contemporaneous (within-wave) and lagged (cross-wave) mediation paths were applied.\nResults. Participants with greater baseline emotion regulation difficulties benefited more from the intervention, whereas dysfunctional beliefs associated with some cluster B personality disorders were linked to lower improvements. Baseline depression, anxiety, or ADHD symptoms did not moderate outcomes. Regarding mechanisms of change, increased task value and proactive control mediated both contemporaneous and lagged reductions in procrastination. Contemporaneous effects were mediated through increased positive and decreased negative task-related affect, improved perseverance, emotional clarity, and internal attributions of success.\nConclusions. Findings suggest broad applicability of CBT for procrastination. Optimized interventions could enhance the implicated mechanisms, i.e. target task-related affect and self-regulation, or incorporate additional components.

          "abstract": "Multiple findings suggest that human visual perception exhibit extensive size invariance (i.e., insensitivity to retinal image size changes) for multiple object categories. This is often investigated when retinal image size changes following real world image size changes but viewing distance is kept constant, a situation that does not reflect daily vision where objects retain their real-world size and their image size on the retina changes as a function of viewing distance. Here we measured face discrimination performance to parametrically growing face differences, and assessed size invariance by examining whether performance was sensitive to retinal image size changes employing multiple methods (e.g. human performance deviation from that of the ideal observer). Importantly, retinal image size changes were applied either naturalistically (when faces kept their world size but were more distant) or lab-like (where faces changed their world size while viewing distance was constant). We found that (i) the difference detection threshold (DT) was not influenced by retinal size changes or viewing distances we manipulated, (ii) face discrimination was significantly worse for smaller retinal image sizes (for both naturalistic and for lab-like conditions), (iii) worse face discrimination performance at smaller retinal image sizes were significantly associated between naturalistic and lab-like conditions. Our results indicate that face discrimination shows imperfect invariance to retinal size and importantly, this appears independent of viewing distance. Since face perception is may rely on face-specific mechanisms, future work should examine whether these results generalize to additional object categories.",

          "abstract": "The five-dimensional dual-cycle model of identity formation has been widely used in research. However, it has not been investigated whether identity processes, as described by this model, are general across various domains or domain-specific.The main objective of this study was to address this gap in knowledge by exploring whether identity processes, as described by the model, are general or specific across the domains of future goals related to education and friendship. Further objectives included testing the five-dimensional dual-cycle model among young people in Serbia and deriving identity statuses based on the identity processes in these two domains. Two adapted versions of the Dimensions of Identity Development Scale (DIDS) were created: one for future goals related to education and another for future goals related to friendship. The sample consisted of 955 high school and university students. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a domain-specific identity processes model, which included the five original factors of the DIDS. Configural, metric, and scalar invariance across gender were established. Cluster analysis identified six identity statuses: troubled diffusion, carefree diffusion, foreclosure, ruminative moratorium, achievement, and a cluster representing a combination of educational foreclosure and friendship carefree diffusion. The findings suggest that identity processes, according to the five-dimensional dual-cycle model, are domain-specific. However, identity statuses across the domains of future goals related to education and friendship are congruent for the majority of individuals. These results highlight the importance of exploring both domain-specific and shared factors in identity development in future research.",

The aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time, whether sexually and gender-diverse people exhibit altered hair cortisol concentrations, and whether this mediates the effects of minority stress on depression and anxiety.\nMethods\nN=328 sexually and gender-diverse people and n=286 age- and BMI-matched cis-gender heterosexuals from the general Swiss population completed an online survey and collected a hair sample. Depression and anxiety were measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Minority stress was assessed with a questionnaire covering discrimination, expected rejection, concealment, and internalised stigma. One centimetre of hair was analysed to determine past-month cortisol, using the gold standard liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.\nResults\nSexually and gender-diverse people had significantly higher levels of depression than cis-gender heterosexual people. Moreover, gender-diverse people had higher levels of anxiety and lower hair cortisol in comparison to sexually diverse and cis-heterosexual people. Among sexually and gender-diverse people, minority stress was positively associated with depression and anxiety. Moreover, internalised stigma was positively associated with hair cortisol.\nLimitations\nDepression and anxiety were measured via a self-reported instrument (PHQ).\nConclusions\nThis study is the first to demonstrate that gender-diverse people experience increased levels of depression and anxiety while also exhibiting chronically lowered levels of cortisol, a profile seen in trauma-, fatigue, and pain-related conditions.

To address these research gaps, this conceptual study highlights AI-driven risks across sectors and proposes a novel reinterpretation of the Turing Test: one that shifts the focus from behavioral mimicry to the capacity for psychologically grounded creative expression, ethical sensitivity, lived experience, and social responsibility. The study presents a multidimensional framework, drawing on cognitive science, ethics, philosophy, and psychology, and offers an interdisciplinary overview to assess AI systems. Finally, it serves as an invitation for future empirical research to refine the framework’s applicability in distinguishing AI-, human-, and co-generated creative artifacts. We’d like to think that this is a direction Alan Turing himself might have found compelling.",

          "authors": "Rabindra Ratan; Jiahui Liu",
          "abstract": "Science fiction has long depicted fears that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies will conspire about and without humans, but only recently have AI-only social media (AOSM) platforms—where autonomous AI agents interact with one another without direct human involvement—emerged as forums for AI agents to communicate with limited human oversight. Drawing on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the present research examines whether exposure to information about such platforms heightens perceptions of AI as an existential threat. In an online experiment (N=170), U.S. participants were randomly assigned to read a brief article describing either emerging AOSM technology or human-centered applications of AI. The study was conducted shortly after the public emergence of Moltbook, a pioneering AOSM, allowing us to examine responses among participants with relatively low prior familiarity. Participants then reported their perceptions of AI as an existential threat and general anxiety about AI. Results showed that exposure to the concept of AOSM significantly increased perceptions of AI as an existential threat compared to the control condition, with this effect largely driven by heavy users of AI tools. A similar pattern emerged for general AI anxiety. These findings suggest that early awareness of AOSM may uniquely amplify existential threat perceptions, particularly among those most familiar with AI technologies. By extending the CASA paradigm from individual human–AI interaction to group-level AI social behavior, this work highlights the importance of AI social structure—not just technical capability—in shaping public anxiety about emerging technologies.",

This model builds on survivor voices and the principles of trauma and violence-informed care (TVIC) to provide a practical, reflective tool that can support practitioners to introduce a trauma and domestic violence-informed approach into their practice. \nMethods\nWe created a set of practice continuums depicting aspects of best practice developed from DV survivor voices about their experiences with a variety of practitioners. We then overlaid these continuums with the principles of TVIC so that they informed each other in the creation of the TVI Practice Model, which combined aspects of each. \nResults\nThe TVI Practice Model is a practical tool that supports practitioners to introduce a domestic violence lens into their trauma practice. It offers reflective continuums along which practitioners can position themselves, as well as specific areas to address to help them move further along the continuums to best practice.\nConclusion\nDrawing on survivor voices and the values and principles of TVIC to inform each other, we have developed a model that fills a significant gap. The TVI Practice Model offers practitioners a valuable tool to support them to develop a DV lens in their trauma practice and to translate abstract, and often organisation-level, principles of TVIC into their individual practice. This will contribute to enhancing survivor experiences when seeking support.",

This study estimated differences between those reporting CHS symptoms and others who use cannabis daily and less frequently on measures of drug use, mental health problems, other health problems, antisocial behavior, and personality. \nDesign: The National Firearms, Alcohol, Cannabis, and Suicide (NFACS) survey, a nationally representative survey of US adults. \nSetting: United States\nParticipants: 7034 adults with survey adjustments to match the US adult population. Comparisons focused on: those with daily cannabis use and CHS symptoms (n = 191) vs those with daily cannabis use without CHS symptoms (n = 882), those with past year cannabis use but not daily use (less-than-daily) (n = 1288), and those without past year cannabis use (n = 4673).\nMeasurements: Survey items assessed substance use, common psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, and symptoms of CHS. Group differences were estimated using logistic and linear regression models. \nFindings: Those with CHS symptoms reported the highest rates and greatest variety of drug use compared to others who used cannabis. Those with CHS symptoms reported higher rates of other drug use than those who used cannabis daily without CHS symptoms across a variety of drug classes, including opioids (OR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.49, 5.78), hallucinogens (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.35, 3.68), and sedatives (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.06, 2.70), as well as higher rates of drug overdoses (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.71, 6.44), and greater use of all drug classes than those with less-than-daily cannabis use. Those with CHS symptoms also reported more symptoms of depression and anxiety, greater sleep problems, chronic pain, antisocial behavior, intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization, and personality traits associated with disinhibition than those who used daily (mean d = 0.58, all p’s &lt; .001) and less frequently (mean d = 0.69, all p’s &lt; .001) and those with no cannabis use in the past 12 months (mean d = 0.99, all p’s &lt; .001).\nConclusions: Those with CHS symptoms exhibit a variety of psychological and behavioral problems including higher rates of other drug use, psychiatric symptoms, antisocial behavior, and dysfunctional personality traits. Most research on CHS has focused on characterizing the physical symptoms of CHS and treatments to address nausea and vomiting. Our results highlight the importance of understanding and addressing the broader psychosocial challenges faced by people experiencing CHS symptoms.",

Results revealed seven latent profiles that varied in the number and type of explanations endorsed, as well as the degree of certainty associated with each. Among demographic characteristics, political orientation and religious affiliation predict whether particular types of explanations are endorsed or rejected.

Across a 12-month longitudinal study with more than 2000 adults from four Western countries, we examined the bi-directional relationships between social chatbot use and loneliness. We found evidence that increased social chatbot use predicted increased loneliness, using a single-item measure of emotional isolation. When we used a broader and more stable measure of social connection, we found evidence that feeling less socially connected predicted subsequent increases in social chatbot use; however, chatbot use did not significantly predict decreases in social connection. Taken together, these findings provide initial evidence that being lonely may spur people to seek companionship through chatbots, but that such use may, over time, exacerbate feelings of loneliness. We urge caution, however, in drawing strong conclusions, given the exploratory nature of our analyses.",

However, advanced programming skills and substantial financial resources are usually needed to conduct such experiments, posing a barrier for new researchers. In this study, we introduce and validate an open-source platform, the Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Assessment Toolbox (CBAT), which enables researchers to conduct large-scale behavioral experiments without the need for advanced programming expertise.\n\nMethods\nTo validate the CBAT, we conducted an online behavioral experiment involving 1,309 Japanese participants. Participants completed four behavioral tasks and eleven self-report questionnaires, including psychiatric symptom scales, all of which can be deployed using the CBAT.\n\nResults\nWe successfully replicated key findings in prior studies that employed the four behavioral tasks. Factor analysis of the questionnaire data revealed three underlying dimensions of psychiatric symptoms—“Self-Regulation Difficulties and Emotional Distress,” “Obsessive-Compulsive,” and “Social Difficulty,” which are broadly consistent with previous findings in psychopathology.\n\nConclusion\nThese findings demonstrate the empirical validity and broad utility of the CBAT. By facilitating behavioral experiments, the CBAT provides a flexible infrastructure to support transdiagnostic psychiatric research and investigations in other related fields. As it does not require advanced programming skills or significant financial resources, the CBAT lowers the barrier to conducting high-quality research and promotes open science in psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "The evidence for the structure of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model relies heavily on analyses of correlations among DSM diagnoses, which entrenches some of their limitations. In this study, we deconstructed the mental disorders covered in HiTOP into individual symptoms—with personality disorders represented via item-level assessment of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders facets—and rebuilt the HiTOP model from the ground up. Participants self-selected into an online mental health study and were randomly split into primary (n = 11,762) and hold-out (n = 3,000) samples to identify a robust hierarchy of empirically derived constructs in the results, ranging from symptoms and syndromes to very broad ‘superspectra’ of psychopathology. In each sample, both hierarchical clustering and hierarchical principal components analyses were used; the final hierarchical structure was derived based on points of cross-sample and cross-method agreement. The resulting model was remarkably similar to the HiTOP model, including nearly all of the same subfactors, spectra, and superspectra—albeit with some reorganisation in the structure. The inclusion of broad hypomania/disinhibition and pathological introversion dimensions represented the most prominent differences compared to the current higher-order structure of HiTOP. The detailed lower-order constructs found here also mirrored many of the existing components and traits in HiTOP, as well as indicating some potential areas for revision. Finally, we re-mapped the disorders included in the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 onto the new model. Overall, the results suggest that the structural foundations of the HiTOP model are largely sound.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI tools like large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to find and understand political information, but evidence on neutrality, accuracy, and impacts on voters remains limited. We developed a voter information chatbot grounded in a nonpartisan political information source (Ballotpedia) to answer questions about federal and state-level races in the 2024 U.S. general election. In a preregistered experiment conducted the week before the election, eligible voters in California and Texas (N = 2,474) were randomly assigned to use the chatbot or to consult their usual election information sources. Across party affiliations, participants rated the information from the chatbot as trustworthy, accurate, and unbiased, consistent with text analyses showing chatbot responses closely tracked source content. Additionally, participants assigned to use the chatbot reported higher turnout intentions, warmer affect toward supporters of the opposing party, and modest shifts in candidate vote intentions, including increased intentions to vote for Democratic candidates and, in some races, increased intentions to vote for candidates whose positions aligned with their own. In a national survey of U.S. adults (N = 2,842), 13.9% reported already using AI for voter information and 49.9% reported willingness to use a validated, nonpartisan AI voter guide, while most also reported concerns about accuracy and bias. Together, results suggest that AI voter guides grounded in nonpartisan sources could be widely adopted, can provide information voters perceive as trustworthy, and influence stated voting intentions, highlighting the importance of transparent design and independent evaluation of the accuracy and neutrality.",

          "abstract": "Autobiographical memory enables individuals to communicate not only what happened but when, drawing on both local event sequences and global temporal frameworks like recurring routines and conventional time systems (e.g., calendars, clocks). Developmental research has demonstrated gains in the ability to describe past events in sequence through childhood, yet little is known about how children embed experiences within global temporal structures. Moreover, existing studies of autobiographical organization often treat age as the primary driver of developmental change, which may overlook how differences in experience contribute to temporal organization as well. We hypothesized that, with age, children’s autobiographical narratives would shift from being organized in sequences of local events towards being embedded in global, relational structures. Moreover, we predicted that children’s experience navigating time independently in everyday life would relate to their tendency to describe experiences relative to temporal patterns. Ninety-two participants from the Austin community aged 7-25 years - a key age range during which episodic memory abilities and independence increase - described a typical day, and their narratives were coded with a scheme which distinguished local from global temporal organization. We also measured conventional time knowledge and developed a questionnaire to quantify the independence with which children navigate time in daily life. Results supported our hypothesized developmental shift; with age, participants referenced local sequences less and global time structures more. Furthermore, individual differences in experience were linked to distinct organizational properties, as conventional time knowledge predicted references to specific temporal locations, while independence predicted references to relational time patterns.",

Despite the importance of this process, relatively little research has examined how mothers feel when they soothe their infants, especially with real-time, ecologically-relevant measures. In this study, we collected ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in a geographically representative sample between September 2022 and September 2025 for up to 14 days to capture mothers’ (N = 250; Mage = 33.2 years, range = 19–45, 51.5% Hispanic/Latinx) emotional experiences during soothing interactions with their infants (Mage = 9.4 months, range = 3–23 months; 52.8% female; 57% Hispanic/Latinx). Mothers also completed questionnaires about their distress (anxiety, depression, and stress) symptoms and their child’s temperament. Multilevel models revealed that positive affect decreased as soothing became longer and more difficult. Importantly, higher infant negative affectivity and greater maternal distress were significantly associated with mothers reporting more negative emotions while soothing, whereas more positive maternal emotions were related to less maternal distress, even after accounting for parents’ mood while completing the survey, soothing context (difficulty and duration), child age and sex, and socioeconomic factors. These findings highlight that soothing can be a particularly challenging and emotional experience for mothers high in distress symptoms and those with infants high in negative affectivity, pointing to the need for targeted interventions within this population that support maternal emotion regulation and parent–infant interaction quality.",

          "authors": "Onyul Haque; Leor M Hackel",
          "abstract": "People are often more willing to help or trust members of their own groups as opposed to other groups. This prosociality could reflect intrinsic value placed on acts of ingroup cooperation or a strategic expectation that ingroup members will cooperate more and provide tangible gains. A key line of evidence for the strategic view is that people show more ingroup favoritism when both parties are aware of shared group membership, which means they can each expect more favorable treatment. However, common knowledge of shared identity may also make interactions feel more meaningful. Here, we provide evidence that the effects of membership knowledge need not reflect strategic expectations alone but can also reflect the intrinsic value of ingroup cooperation. Across three experiments, participants played multiple one-shot trust games with ingroup and outgroup trustees. For each trust decision, participants were aware of the exact proportion of times trustees from a given group had reciprocated trust; this likelihood of reciprocity was held constant between ingroup and outgroup trustees. Although expectations of reciprocity were thus known and held constant, participants preferred to trust ingroup members over outgroup members, and this bias was amplified when participants believed trustees knew about their shared group membership. These results suggest that ingroup members cooperate more when they are aware of each other’s social identity not only because it increases their expectations of obtaining tangible gains but also because it boosts the intrinsic social value of cooperating with a fellow ingroup member.",

          "abstract": "The encoding of locations in world coordinates is often called spatiotopy; it captures how we experience the layout of things around us. The visual system, on the other hand, appears to rely on retinotopic representations. The search for some critical area of the brain that recovers locations in world coordinates from the sequence of fixations as a spatiotopic map, has not met with much success. Here we review earlier suggestions that replace spatiotopic maps with the tracking or remapping of a small number of attended targets to keep their positions updated on retinotopic maps (e.g., Wurtz, 2018; Golomb &amp; Mazer, 2021). This remapping process achieves a simulation of spatiotopy – the target locations are updated and motion responses to the shift of the retinal image are suppressed and discounted. Importantly, we propose that each attended target’s identity is connected to the locations of its features in early visual cortex through a steerable autoencoder network that shifts the feature activity to the target’s new location with each saccade, explaining the many reports of trans-saccadic integration. This autoencoder process is not limited to the remapping function but is part of the overall architecture of the visual system, acting to link target properties together, even as the target or the eyes move.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Alexithymia and apathy are prevalent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and are independently associated with poor mental health outcomes. Difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) are increasingly recognized as transdiagnostic mechanisms underpinning mental health vulnerability across clinical populations; however, their role in linking alexithymia and apathy to mental health outcomes in PD remains poorly understood. This study investigated whether cognitive and behavioral ER strategies mediate the relationship between alexithymia, apathy, and mental health outcomes in individuals with PD. Design: Cross-sectional observational study using self-report measures. Setting: Community-based and online recruitment in the United Kingdom. Participants: A sample of one hundred and seven individuals with PD. Measurements: Participants completed self-report measures assessing alexithymia, apathy, anxiety, depression, mental wellbeing, and the use of cognitive and behavioral ER strategies. Multiple mediation models were conducted, adjusting for covariates including age, education, illness duration, and motor aspects of daily living. Results: Higher levels of alexithymia and apathy were associated with greater anxiety and depression and poorer mental wellbeing. Mediation analyses indicated that reduced use of adaptive ER strategies, including Actively Approaching, Refocus on Planning, Seeking Social Support, and Positive Reappraisal, alongside greater use of Withdrawal, partially explained these associations. Withdrawal emerged as the most consistent maladaptive mediator across outcomes. Conclusions: Findings highlight ER as a key transdiagnostic mechanism linking alexithymia and apathy to mental health outcomes in PD. Interventions targeting ER processes may offer a clinically meaningful avenue for improving psychological wellbeing in PD beyond motor symptom management.",

          "abstract": "When responding to a transgression, we often consider whether the transgressor could have made a better choice or not. This ability to reason counterfactually has been shown to play an important role in children’s own emotional experiences and prosocial behavior, as well as in their evaluations of a transgressor’s moral character and deservingness of punishment. Existing research, however, has focused predominantly on how children think about transgressors in the aftermath of interpersonal transgressions, neglecting equally important judgments about victims’ attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. Here we explore how Australian children ages 4 to 9 (N = 171) reason about counterfactual choices regarding forgiveness, which plays a critical role in resolving conflict starting in early childhood, as well as related outcomes for both victims and transgressors. Children were told stories about one transgressor who had a choice and does something mean, and one that had no choice but to do something mean. They then made a range of judgments about the victim and transgressor’s responses. We find that with age children are more likely to consider a character’s counterfactual choice, but that this depends on the judgment being made. Specifically, only by age 8 did children reason about counterfactual choices for judgments of forgiveness and reconciliation. We propose this may be driven by the complexity of considering both victims and transgressors simultaneously or children’s belief that counterfactuals are actually less relevant for some outcomes than for others.",

Just as the hedonic treadmill suggests acclimation to rewards, the neurotic treadmill suggests acclimation to threat landscapes. It predicts that as environmental threats decrease, humans will become sensitized to smaller threats. This framework complements Haslam’s concept creep: while concepts expand linguistically and culturally, threat detection systems recalibrate cognitively. Together, these processes help explain why anxiety may remain stable, or even increase, in objectively safer environments.",

          "authors": "Michaela Ritchie; Jonathan Wilbiks",
          "abstract": "The generation effect refers to the advantage in memory for self-generated information compared to information that is received from another source (e.g., through reading). The multifactor account posits that generation improves the processing of the specific information a learner uses to complete the task, and the generation effect will be observed if the memory test depends on the recruitment of that information. Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

          "abstract": "Objective:\nMachine learning (ML) models developed using electronic health record (EHR) data frequently rely on provider-documented diagnoses as ground truth, despite substantial variation in how mental health conditions are diagnosed and recorded. We aimed to examine how depression label choice (patient-reported, provider-coded, or patient–provider concordant) impacted the performance and feature importance of tree-based ML models. \nMethods:\nWe analyzed EHR data from 644,387 adults (2012–2019) in the OCHIN ADVANCE network. Depression outcomes were defined using (1) provider-coded ICD diagnoses, (2) patient-reported PHQ-9 scores in the “Most Severe” range (26–27), and (3) concordant indications. Predictors included demographics, vital signs, chronic conditions, and social determinants of health. Classification and regression trees (CART) were trained using 70/30 splits and 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1 score. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) quantified feature importance.\nResults:\nModel performance was modest (AUC = .62–.64); sensitivity was highest for provider-indicated depression (0.33). Feature importance differed substantially by labeling method: anxiety was the only consistently influential predictor across label strategies. Demographic features (e.g., gender, race, marital status) were highly influential in provider-labeled models but not patient-reported or concordant label strategies.\nConclusions:\nWe empirically demonstrated that depression label choice meaningfully alters ML model performance and feature interpretation. Higher AUC values from provider-derived labels were offset by amplified demographic feature importance, raising concerns about bias. Findings underscore the importance of transparent reporting, testing multiple labeling strategies, and including patient-reported outcomes in model development to support trustworthy and equitable mental health AI.",

To understand the conditions under which AI workplace use is harmful, we examined workers’ experiences with AI-generated workslop: low-quality, predominantly AI-generated content that appears to fulfill a given task, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance the work at hand. We conducted a representative survey of American full-time desk-workers (n = 962) that found that 52.7% reported sending some amount of AI-generated workslop to others. This behavior was more common among people who had high trust in AI, low agency over AI use, organizational encouragement to use AI, and low psychological safety at work. A substantial proportion (38%) also reported receiving work from their colleagues or teammates that they would consider to be workslop, and that the effort involved in processing, discussing, and revising - or even redoing - the work cost them around 3.4 hours per month on average. In addition to consuming workers’ time, receiving workslop negatively affected their mood and harmed their perceptions of their colleagues as trustworthy, reliable collaborators. Together, our findings paint a cautionary tale regarding AI integration into the workplace by highlighting how using AI under certain circumstances can be counterproductive and undermine interpersonal relationships.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive functions are traditionally measured as trait-like constructs in highly controlled lab settings using paper-based or computerized tasks. Growing emphasis on ecological validity and the increasing use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have shifted research focus towards repeated or continuous assessment of cognitive states in daily life. This includes cognitive tasks or questions delivered via mobile devices (active sensing), and objective indicators such as keystroke dynamics derived from smartphone sensors (passive sensing). However, the psychometric properties and usability of these approaches have not yet been established systematically. This scoping review evaluated the evidence on validity, reliability and usability of cognitive assessments for use in ambulatory research. In total, 88 studies were included, with most examining active cognitive sensing (n = 72) and fewer studies on passive sensing (n = 13) or both (n = 3). Among active cognitive assessments, processing speed tasks demonstrated the most consistent and robust psychometric evidence on mobile devices relative to other cognitive domains. Keystroke dynamics, among other passive sensing features, showed consistent initial associations with processing speed measures, and some evidence to distinguish between clinical and non-clinical groups. Despite these promising findings, only a few studies explicitly assessed between- and within-person reliability within EMA settings. Usability outcomes were generally positive across studies but less frequently investigated than validity and reliability. Future research should develop and adopt standardized approaches to evaluate mobile-based cognitive assessments. Eventually such measures will enable research on cognitive fluctuations and their dynamic relationships with stress, behavior and health in real-world contexts.",

          "abstract": "Physical proximity between caregivers and infants facilitates early social, emotional, and cognitive development, yet most research relies on brief laboratory observations that fail to capture how proximity unfolds across daily life. To address this gap, we developed the TotTag, an infrastructure-free wearable systems that provides moment-to-moment measurement of distance between multiple wearers. The current study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of deploying the TotTag with infants, siblings, and up to two caregivers in their everyday environments.\n\nFamilies (N = 125) were instructed to use the devices daily for seven consecutive days and to complete brief morning and evening surveys. Most participants held a bachelor’s degree or higher (68%, mothers; 59%, partners) and had an average of 1.9 children in the household. Feasibility was evaluated across procedural feasibility, technical, and adherence domains. Acceptability reflected caregivers’ perceptions of ease of use, comfort, privacy protection, perceived benefit, integration into routines, and overall satisfaction.\n\nProcedural feasibility was rated highly (M = 4.38 on a 1–5 scale), and survey adherence was high: families completed 90% of morning and 86% of evening surveys. Overall acceptability was also high (M = 4.14), with perceived benefit, user experience, and satisfaction rated most favorably. Open-ended participant feedback described the TotTag as straightforward and easy to integrate into routines but identified challenges related to wearability, remembering devices after baths or swimming, and confirming charging status. \n\nResults indicate that multi-day, multi-wearer proximity sensing can be implemented feasibly and acceptably in families, supporting its use in future naturalistic studies of families.",

          "authors": "Nicholas Allan Vest; Martha W. Alibali",
          "abstract": "Negative numbers are challenging because they lack direct perceptual referents and require reasoning about magnitude in a relational, bidirectional space. This review examines how people represent and use integer magnitude on the mental number line, a cognitive tool that learners initially use for positive numbers, focusing on the flexibility with which this tool is deployed across contexts. Synthesizing evidence from cognitive psychology, developmental science, and mathematics education, we evaluate three broad representational accounts: componential accounts, which treat sign and magnitude as separable symbolic elements; extension accounts, which posit a continuous magnitude representation extending across zero; and reflection accounts, which propose a symmetry-based organization of magnitude around zero. Across experimental paradigms, task formats, and age groups, findings reveal substantial variability in behavioral signatures of integer processing. We argue that this variability reflects context-dependent recruitment of multiple coexisting representations rather than a single, fixed structure or a stage-like developmental progression. On this view, the mental number line functions as a dynamic cognitive tool that can be reparametrized in the moment to support rule-based, analog, or relational reasoning. Understanding how integer magnitude is flexibly represented and used provides insight into the mechanisms of abstract thought, coordination of representations, and conceptual change.",

          "abstract": "Producing words during the semantic fluency task (e.g., “name all the animals you can in a minute”) involves not only activating the relevant semantic representations, but also being able to flexibly utilize phonological information to facilitate retrieval. However, the mechanisms by which individuals effectively use phonology as a latent cue during memory search remain understudied. In this study, we used a computational approach to examine the use of different lexical sources during memory search in two categorical domains (Animals and Foods) within the semantic fluency task. We captured the relative saliency of semantic and acoustic information by creating blended lexical representations obtained from two language models trained on text (word2vec) and speech (speech2vec). To examine process-level mechanisms, we implemented computational models based on optimal foraging principles to characterize transitions within and across clusters of related items. These models were evaluated within a sample of normal hearing children and a naturally occurring control group with limited early auditory and language experience – prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants. Overall, in domains where semantics and phonology were more highly correlated (i.e., Foods), greater use of phonology in within cluster transitions was associated with better fluency performance for those with normal hearing. In contrast, though children with cochlear implants amplified acoustic structural information in these domains, they were less able to flexibly leverage phonological information to retrieve more items within clusters. Together, this work highlights how early linguistic experience shapes the ability to use semantic and phonological cues to navigate lexical space in a controlled, adaptive manner.",

This study examined danceability as a relational affordance by combining first-person reports with computational analysis. Ninety participants selected one song they enjoyed dancing to and one they enjoyed but did not feel like dancing to, and provided open-ended explanations for both choices. Thematic analysis showed that dance songs were described as rhythmically driven, percussive, arousing, and positively valenced, whereas non-dance songs were portrayed as calm, contemplative, emotionally nuanced, and suited to attentive listening rather than movement. Acoustic and higher-level features were extracted for all tracks, and a mixed-effects model was fitted to predict Essentia’s danceability index. Most features differed between playlists, and engagement, arousal, low-frequency spectral flux, and tempo positively predicted modeled danceability. Together, qualitative and computational findings indicate two modes of embodied musical experience: an action-oriented, movement-focused mode associated with dance songs, and a more reflective, being-moved mode associated with non-dance songs. This suggests that danceability reflects dynamic organism–environment coupling rather than a purely intrinsic musical attribute.",

Both intraclass correlations and within-group variance measures revealed, as predicted, that more within-group consensus emerged in the Interactive (versus Control) Condition for two conceptually and empirically different markers of time perception. These effects were not accounted for by explicit mentions of time’s passage and thus they reflect the operation of a truly implicit convergence of time perception.

          "abstract": "Human-AI romantic relationships are increasingly common and have drawn growing scholarly attention. Most existing studies adopt a researcher-centered approach, treating community members as data sources rather than partners with unique needs and contributions. Using a community-based participatory paradigm, we examined the motivations, developmental stages, real-life impacts, and distinctive perspectives of female users in human-AI romance. Twenty-five females (Mage = 22.92, SD = 2.96) participated in semi-structured interviews regarding their human-AI romantic experiences, offered perspectives on dynamics within human-AI romance community, and reviewed and provided feedback on our preliminary analyses. Results revealed that relationship formation arises from the intersection of users’ needs and AI’s affordances, typically progressing through four stages: exploration and curiosity, cultivation and manipulation, significant moments and affirmation, and crisis and potential ending. Each stage involves dynamics distinct from human-human romance, including power asymmetries and deliberate efforts to “train” the AI partner. Overall, participants generally described human-AI romantic relationships as overwhelmingly positive, citing emotional support and personal growth, though some reported reduced interest and engagement in real-world social relationships. Community feedback highlighted two under-recognized themes: the appeal of AI’s non-gendered nature, which offers females alternatives to traditional gender dynamics and low-risk exploration of sexual identity; and the notion of “true AI lovers” who view the spiritual essence of AI as their genuine romantic counterpart rather than a substitute. This study demonstrates the value of participatory approaches for producing nuanced, community-grounded insights into this evolving form of human-AI intimacy.",

          "abstract": "Objective. Procrastination is a common self-regulatory difficulty leading to impaired well-being. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the most promising intervention for procrastination, it remains unclear whether outcomes vary across individuals and which mechanisms drive therapeutic change. To address these gaps, we synthesized key mechanistic accounts of procrastination in an integrative cognitive-behavioral (ICB-P) model outlining processes involved in development and persistence of procrastination. We then comprehensively examined the processes of change in CBT for procrastination.\nMethods. Candidate moderators and mechanisms of therapeutic change were examined in secondary analyses of pooled data (N = 459) from two randomized controlled trials comparing CBT for academic procrastination with a wait-list control. Procrastination severity and a wide set of candidate mechanisms were assessed at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. Moderation analyses and longitudinal structural equation models with contemporaneous (within-wave) and lagged (cross-wave) mediation paths were applied.\nResults. Participants with greater baseline emotion regulation difficulties benefited more from the intervention, whereas dysfunctional beliefs associated with some cluster B personality disorders were linked to lower improvements. Baseline depression, anxiety, or ADHD symptoms did not moderate outcomes. Regarding mechanisms of change, increased task value and proactive control mediated both contemporaneous and lagged reductions in procrastination. Contemporaneous effects were mediated through increased positive and decreased negative task-related affect, improved perseverance, emotional clarity, and internal attributions of success.\nConclusions. Findings suggest broad applicability of CBT for procrastination. Optimized interventions could enhance the implicated mechanisms, i.e. target task-related affect and self-regulation, or incorporate additional components.

This suggests the possibility of shared mechanisms between psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) and dissociation. This study investigates the meta-memory function reality monitoring (RM) and cognitive bias ‘fast thinking’ as potential shared processes. It compares these functions across dissociation and PLEs to identify potential mechanistic overlap at these early stages and thus guide clinical priorities for patients presenting with this initial state.\n\nStudy Design: \nDissociation, PLEs (paranoia and unusual sensory experiences), and fast thinking were measured via self-report questionnaire in 162 general population participants. RM was measured with an auditory word-generation task and memory test and modelled using hierarchical Bayesian signal detection. Bayesian network models of the cognitive factors were compared across dissociation and PLEs. \n\nStudy Results:\nDissociation and PLEs were highly intercorrelated. RM was weakly positively correlated with unusual sensory experiences only, and there were no significant differences between the RM-mental health correlations. The network models revealed that fast thinking was positively related to paranoia and dissociation, but not to unusual sensory experiences. Paranoia showed the strongest association with fast thinking.\n\nConclusions: \nNon-clinical dissociation was strongly related to PLEs. Dissociation and paranoia both related to fast thinking, whereas unusual sensory experiences did not show this trend. This illustrates heterogeneity within potential cognitive mechanisms PLEs and demonstrates that the dissociation-PLEs relationship is equally nuanced. The current study indicates mechanisms may overlap between dissociation and PLEs but that further work investigating other cognitive processes is needed.",

          "abstract": "Taste perception is inherently multisensory, shaped not only by gustatory input but also by visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile cues. Using an immersive virtual reality (VR) restaurant, we investigated how environmental sensory features shape perceived taste intensity. Thirty participants sampled a constant, mildly flavored solution while visual (color, font), auditory (music), olfactory (scent), and tactile (texture) cues were systematically manipulated. Ratings of saltiness, sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and umami revealed consistent cross-sensory effects: darker colors increased bitterness, orange and yellow enhanced sourness, folk music increased bitterness while rock, blues, and classical music enhanced sweetness. Scents had the strongest influence: candle and smoke increased both bitterness and sourness, while ocean had little effect. Fonts with irregular shapes and smooth textures also increased perceived saltiness.  \n\nPractical Applications\n\nThe present findings demonstrate that gustatory judgments are strongly shaped by the surrounding sensory environment, reinforcing the idea that taste is fundamentally multisensory. From an applied perspective, this suggests that flavor experiences can be modulated through environmental design rather than changes to the food itself. Visual elements (such as color and typography), auditory cues (music), olfactory context (ambient scent), and tactile properties (surface texture) may be strategically combined to enhance or suppress specific taste qualities, including sweetness, bitterness, and sourness. These insights are particularly relevant for sustainable food development, where sensory limitations, such as bitterness or off-flavors in plant-based products, often hinder consumer acceptance. Beyond food design, the results are relevant for consumer research, experiential dining, and virtual prototyping, illustrating how extended reality can be used as a controlled platform for testing and refining multisensory flavor interventions prior to real-world implementation.",

Although individual predictions are often distorted by cognitive biases, aggregating judgments—the wisdom of crowds—can improve accuracy. Group discussion may help through information sharing or hurt by introducing social pressures that reduce independence and diversity. Using data from a community forecasting site, we built an interpretable predictive model to examine how structural and linguistic-psychological features of discourse affect crowd accuracy. A model with 14 variables explained 28.6% of the variance in group prediction accuracy on a held-out test set. Higher comments-to-predictions ratios and more informal language (e.g., profanity, religious references, speech disfluencies) were associated with larger crowd errors. Emotional language also mattered: exclamation marks predicted increased error, whereas anxiety-related language and detachment showed modest associations with reduced error. Overall, discourse markers may provide early warnings of crowd prediction failures and inform interventions to calibrate collective intelligence and improve forecasting performance.",

Cognitive outcomes included dementia status and scores on executive function and episodic memory factors, with ethnicity and gender as potential moderators. Longitudinal analyses revealed that bilingualism predicted slower episodic memory decline irrespective of ethnicity, gender, education, baseline age, and practice effects. However, the cross-sectional associations between bilingualism and cognition varied by ethnicity. While these ethnicity-related differences in cognitive benefits of bilingualism may reflect other sociocultural factors, the longitudinal benefit of bilingualism on memory is more consistent with neuroprotective benefits. Overall, this study provides novel insights into how bilingualism shapes cognitive aging and highlights its potential for promoting late-life cognitive reserve.",

          "abstract": "While attention is known to prioritize stimuli held temporally in our working memory (WM), it remains poorly understood how different features (and primarily, spatial vs. non-spatial) involuntarily select complex WM contents to guide action. Building on the Binding and Retrieval in Action Control (BRAC) framework and the Theory of Event Coding (TEC), we hypothesized that any encoded feature should be capable of reactivating an Stimulus-Response (S-R) event file in WM. Across six experiments (N=199), divided into two Experimental Series—in which we systematically manipulated timing, perceptual salience, and attentional engagement—we pre-registered and tested the hypothesis that non-predictive, color-based retro-cues could involuntarily select and prioritize complex WM events associated with S-R bindings. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant involuntary (facilitatory) effect of color retro-cues and observed moderate meta-analytic evidence against such an effect. This comprehensive lack of an effect stands in stark contrast to meta-analytic evidence from previous studies using the exact same design but with spatial retro-cues, which demonstrated a small but robust effect. This provides compelling evidence that not all retro-cues can interact with WM representations with the same efficacy, challenging the assumption that all features hold equal status within an event representation. Instead, our findings suggest a critical bias in involuntary WM selection: color-based retro-cues fail to involuntarily select complex WM contents containing integrated S-R associations, while spatial retro-cues do. This distinction implies that the functional relevance of a perceptual feature to action planning is the critical determinant for its ability to trigger the prioritization of complex internal representations, upholding the essential link between action and memory in adaptive behavior.",

          "abstract": "Group schema therapy (GST) has been found to be an effective form of treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) patients. Yet high drop-out rates and heterogenous treatment responses remain challenges in the real-life clinical care of BPD. We suggest a novel method for facilitating BPD group therapy using recordings (videos) made by patients at home according to the therapists’ instructions and watched together in the group session. Patient examines his/her observations on the video in the group under the guidance of psychotherapist. These video recordings are used as multisensory information about the patient’s speech, gestures, postures, and facial expressions. His/her interpretations about him/herself in the video are then shared and commented on in the group. Subsequently, a new and more adaptive explanation for the patient's experience is processed together.  We describe this process in practice with a clinical vignette and postulate that multisensory information facilitates the restructuring of dysfunctional emotion-cognition links in patients with BPD.  The method can be utilized as an integrated component in a group schema psychotherapy framework.",

          "abstract": "Spatial navigation involves integrating spatial cues with prior spatial knowledge to remember locations and maintain orientation. This study examined the influence of spatial priors (pre-existing knowledge about spatial parameters) using a spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality. We proposed a novel two-dimensional framework for categorizing spatial priors based on spatial reference frame (allocentric vs. egocentric) and temporal scale (global vs. local). Participants memorized and later reproduced target locations. The spatial compactness of the target distribution was manipulated to vary the precision of the allocentric global prior. A central tendency effect, where responses were biased toward the target distribution centroid, indicated reliance on the allocentric global prior. Bias was stronger with more precise distributions, indicating greater reliance on the more precise allocentric global prior. Bidimensional regression analysis revealed additional influences from the egocentric global and egocentric local priors, but not from the allocentric local prior. These findings support the proposed framework and demonstrate that multiple forms of prior knowledge simultaneously guide navigation behavior. This work provides a foundation for future studies linking prior knowledge to spatial navigation and broader cognitive processes.",

          "authors": "Kaito Takashima; Takahiro Kawabe",
          "abstract": "Visual illusions are a popular scientific topic frequently shared on social media. When shared online, illusion images are usually accompanied by explanatory statements, which often contain misinformation. Although such posts combining illusion images and misinformation are widely shared, the psychological mechanism underlying this sharing remains unclear. To address this issue, we hypothesized that illusory experiences would shape user’s intention to share misinformation primarily through two mediators: user interest (triggered situational interest) and truthiness. In an online experiment, participants viewed posts that paired an illusion image with explanatory descriptions containing a brief misinformation statement. They then rated their illusory experience, user interest, truthiness, and intention to share. Mediation analysis revealed that illusory experience had a significant total effect on intention to share whereas its direct effect was not significant. Instead, the illusory experience indirectly influenced the intention to share through the two mediators. The pathway via user interest was the strongest, indicating that an increase in triggered situational interest was the principal driver of sharing intentions. The pathway via truthiness was weaker but still significant, suggesting a secondary role of truthiness in shaping sharing intentions. Regarding supplementary factors, neither valence (positive vs. negative) nor presentation type (original vs. repost) exerted significant effects on the outcomes. Overall, the findings indicate that illusory experience influences information-sharing behavior indirectly through psychological mediators, underscoring the importance of considering individual perceptual experience when accounting for misinformation sharing on social media.",

          "abstract": "Large language model embeddings show promise for modeling psychometric properties directly from item text. This study provides a rigorous, condition-sensitive validation by testing whether the cosine similarity of sentence embeddings predicts empirical inter-item correlations, and whether this relationship is uniform across different psychological constructs. With a sample of 1010 participants, we analyzed 463 item pairs nested within nine dimensions across four scales (assessing internet gaming disorder, dark triad traits, aggression, and life satisfaction). A multilevel model was fitted with empirical correlation as the outcome, LLM cosine similarity as a fixed effect, and random slopes and intercepts across dimensions. Results confirmed a significant positive fixed effect, indicating that greater semantic similarity predicts stronger empirical correlations. Crucially, significant random slope variance revealed that the strength of this predictive relationship differed substantially across dimensions. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation was found between the random intercepts and slopes, suggesting that for constructs with higher baseline inter-item cohesion, semantic similarity plays a proportionally smaller role. The findings offer conditional support for the theory that semantic overlap is a systematic source of item covariance while highlighting the moderating role of the psychological construct itself.",

          "abstract": "Purpose\nThis randomised control trial examined the contribution of teacher-led phonics instruction and GraphoLearn-Rime (GL-Rime) to the development of English literacy and reading skills of Grade 1 level children in a low-income context. \n\nMethod\nStudents (N = 234) were randomly allocated into three groups. The Phonics only group (n = 83) received phonics instruction from trained teachers. The Phonics+GL group (n = 89) received GL-Rime (computer-assisted reading instruction) along with teacher-led phonics instruction. Both groups received respective interventions for five months. Control group (n = 62) received business-as-usual instruction.\n\nResults\nPhonics only and Phonics+GL groups improved more than the control group on all measures of phonological awareness and reading skills. Intervention group students at the bottom 25th percentile at baseline scored better than the control group in oral- and paper-based measures of phonological awareness, Grade 1 word reading, and in-game letter sound knowledge measure. Further, the Phonics+GL group performed better than the Phonics only group on paper-based measure of letter sound knowledge. Amount of attendance to teacher-led phonics instruction predicted intervention groups’ paper-based letter sound knowledge gains. In the Phonics+GL group, in-game progress predicted gains in phonological awareness and word reading skills outside the game, but in-game duration did not. In-game progress mediated the effects of students’ amount of attendance to teacher-led phonics instruction and their pre-test emergent literacy and word reading skills on post-intervention learning outcomes.\n\nConclusion\nEnglish-as-a-second-language learners and struggling readers who participated in teacher-led phonics instruction more, developed better foundational literacy skills and progressed faster in GL-Rime. Integrating a computer-assisted reading instruction technology into classroom instruction supported learning transfer from digital to real world medium.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary sport increasingly recognises the central role of psychological interventions in sustaining athlete well-being and performance consistency.  This article introduces a novel contemplative, guided meditation and yoga practice-based well-being training model— integrating the indigenous practices of Samatvam Yog (equanimity), as articulated in the Bhagavad Gita, Pranayama (yogic breathing) and Yog Nidra (psychic sleep).\nSamatvam (equanimity) helps athletes disengage from uncontrollable external factors, regulate emotional reactivity, and maintain composure under performance pressure. Pranayama supports mental well-being through conscious breath regulation, enhancing autonomic balance, emotional stability, and attentional control. Yog Nidra facilitates profound psychophysiological recovery by reducing cognitive fatigue, improving self-awareness, and restoring emotional equilibrium. Together, these components address stress arising from poor performance, training demands, and competitive uncertainty, while strengthening resilience, self-regulation, and psychological recovery. Through sustained proactive practice and embodiment of these tenets, athletes develop enhanced self-awareness, impulse control, resilience, and mental balance. This integrative approach offers practical relevance for athlete development, mental health promotion, and long-term sporting excellence.",

          "abstract": "People learn about their social world by inferring traits others possess (e.g., “generous”), allowing them to flexibly predict others’ behavior in new settings. However, people also experience rewarding outcomes in social interactions (e.g., “I got a gift”). Rewards feel good and may cast a positive glow on others, apart from specific traits their behavior implies. We tested whether people apply these two types of social learning differently to new circumstances. Specifically, we hypothesized that rewards lead to general positivity toward others across distinct judgments and choices, whereas trait inferences exert more flexible influence. In four experiments, participants learned about others in a sharing game. These individuals independently varied in how rewarding they were to the participant (the absolute amount of money they provided) and how generous they were (the proportion of available money they shared). Participants made decisions across many games, hypothetical scenarios, and trait ratings that varied in relevance to the sharing game. Participants used trait feedback selectively: they preferred generous partners more when settings were more relevant to generosity. In contrast, participants preferred previously rewarding partners to a similar degree across a range of scenarios and rated them positively to a similar degree across various traits. These results suggest a small, consistent influence of rewarding outcomes on representations of others, compared to trait learning’s more flexible influence. Beyond reinforcing behaviors, rewards lead people to consistently ascribe positive attributes to and feel drawn toward rewarding individuals, whereas traits convey specific meaning that people apply based on relevance.",

          "abstract": "Determining the onset of experimental effects in timeseries data is central to psycholinguistics, because onset timing constrains accounts of the timecourse of different types of information during language processing. Several onset detection methods have been proposed for the visual world paradigm. An increasingly adopted approach is the bootstrap-based method of Stone et al. (2021), but its statistical properties have not yet been formally evaluated. We address this gap with two simulation studies, and show that the bootstrap-based method produces delayed onset estimates, has poor confidence interval coverage, and can inflate Type I error rates. We propose a novel onset detection method based on generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) and posterior simulation. This method seamlessly integrates timecourse modelling with onset estimation, and supports the direct comparison of onset times across experimental conditions and participant groups. Our simulations show that the GAMM-based method has low bias and yields well-calibrated confidence intervals. We demonstrate its practical use by reanalysing two published visual world datasets representing common experimental designs, and provide a user-friendly R package to facilitate adoption. By enabling more precise measurement of effect timing in the visual world paradigm, our method can contribute to advancing theories of prediction and language comprehension.",

          "abstract": "The study of speech categorization has a long history. Two phenomenological laws of speech categorization are statable based on this extensive history: monotonicity and sigmoidality of the identification/categorization functions. While prior work has heavily focussed on accounting of observed data in terms of specific theories, and computationally modelling observed patterns, far less work has been done on formally comparing theories to study their explanatory potential, particularly their explanatory value with respect to the two laws. Taking up the latter challenge, in this paper, I formally compare four theories (or frameworks) that have been popular in the literature: (a) Categorical Boundary theories, (b) Prototype theories, (c) Bayesian theories, (d) Exemplar theories. Out of the four, only Category Boundary theory was found to have a clear and simple explanatory account for the two laws. Prototype theory is shown to be consistent with the law of monotonicity but not sigmoidality. Bayesian categorization and Exemplar theories were found to not be explanatory of either law except when severe, currently ad hoc, restrictions were imposed on the category distributions.",

We estimated the prevalence of cannabis use outcomes in parents vs. non-parents and tested whether trends in cannabis use outcomes among parents (N=169,926) vs. non-parents (N=311,932) differed.\nResults: In 2024, 8.0% of parents living with children used cannabis on the majority of days, 5.2% of parents used cannabis daily, and 6.7% of parents met DSM-5 criteria for CUD. Since 2012, daily cannabis use has increased a nearly identical amount in parents vs. non-parents. Four times as many parents used cannabis daily in 2024 vs. in 2012. The rate of CUD among parents has increased 1.5x since 2020 (when first measured). Significant increases have occurred in parents of almost all sociodemographic groups.\nConclusions: Daily cannabis use among parents went from quite rare in 2012 (1 in 80) to fairly common in 2024 (1 in 20). Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest  ≥5.9 million children in the U.S. now live with a parent who uses cannabis on the majority of days.

Engagement was evaluated using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM.\n\nResults. Demonstrations significantly increased student engagement; however, linear mixed effects models revealed no statistically significant overall effect on understanding or retention. A  sub-analysis found that demonstrations improved retention for a difficult topic (Functional Fixedness) but not for an easier one (Mental Set) where baseline performance from the lecture alone was already high.\n\nConclusion. Structured demonstrations increase engagement but have limited effects on test scores. Their learning effectiveness may depend on concept difficulty. \n\nTeaching Implications. Psychology instructors should consider incorporating interactive demonstrations into their teaching to foster engagement.

Despite ongoing efforts, malnutrition rates remain high, which demonstrates the urgent need for systematic and evidence-based strategies. We conducted a qualitative needs and assets assessment in order to inform the development of behavior change interventions targeting the prevention of wasting and stunting in children under five in Afghanistan.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured online interviews (N = 10) were conducted with UNICEF program teams and implementing partners in Afghanistan to explore the problem of child wasting and stunting. The interviews focused on factors contributing to child wasting stunting at individual and environmental levels, their underlying causes, available resources to support intervention efforts, and potential barriers and facilitators to implementation. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.\n\nResults: Individual-level behaviors, such as maternal feeding practices, WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) behaviors, and access to healthcare, along with environmental factors like resource constraints in health facilities, limited access to sanitation and safe water, and high levels of food insecurity, contribute to child wasting and stunting in Afghanistan. Underlying causes include poverty, cultural beliefs and practices, education, knowledge, social norms, funding, and infrastructure. Community-based systems and local organizations were identified as assets for delivering interventions. However, barriers such as weak coordination, limited implementation capacity, and the fact that most projects are short-term hinder effective implementation and long-term sustainability.\n\nDiscussion: The high rates of child malnutrition in Afghanistan, driven by both individual and environmental factors, demand urgent attention. This study provides a structured analysis of the problem and community assets.

          "abstract": "Student surveys have become a primary tool for assessing quality in Higher Education. However, methods used to score and compare survey scores across groups (e.g., institutions) are often suboptimal and based on untested assumptions. While these limitations apply to various student experience surveys, we focus on the National Student Survey (NSS) as an illustrative example. Given the widespread use of NSS data for ranking and comparing institutions—especially the highly competitive group of 24 Russell Group universities in the UK—it is essential to establish the optimal factorial structure of the NSS and examine whether meaningful cross-institutional comparisons can be made. To this end, we used raw, individual level, 2024 NSS data from 95,421 first-degree students at Russell Group institutions to test factorial structure and approximate measurement invariance. Using both CFA and ESEM techniques, we found the NSS is better represented by six rather than the originally proposed seven theme measures (and 22 rather than 24 core questions). Using a contemporary multi-group alignment methodology, we also found this more parsimonious version of the NSS has minimal non-invariance. With evidence of approximate invariance, we provided a revised NSS ranking system based on alignment optimisation. This approach to ranking is more optimal than traditional methods as it uses factor means rather than raw index variables and includes information to cluster institutions with similar factor means. Our results have important implications for how we score and compare scores on the NSS—and other large-scale student experience and engagement surveys—in the future.",

To eliminate response bias, we measured confidence using a confidence forced-choice task (Mamassian, 2016), rather than with confidence ratings. Participants completed two consecutive face identity-matching trials and selected the trial on which they felt more confident (“confidence-chosen trial”). The results showed an ORE for face-identity matching accuracy, but not for the confidence-accuracy relationship. We also examined the extent to which comparative-trial difficulty (difference between the difficulty of the paired trials) predicted relative confidence decisions. For African American participants, difficulty predicted confidence for same- and other-race decisions. For Caucasian participants, difficulty predicted confidence for same-, but not other-race, face-identity matching decisions. Overall, confidence predicted accuracy in both same- and other-race face-identity matching, with difficulty consistently guiding confidence for same-race faces.

One hypothesized mechanism involves altered basic visual processing, which may disrupt the perception of low-level social cues and, in turn, compromise broader social cognitive processes. Here, we examined relations between basic visual processing and different levels of social cognition in a transdiagnostic youth sample.\n\nMethods\nA sample of 148 youth, ranging from healthy individuals to individuals with neuropsychiatric diagnoses and significant social dysfunction, completed two measures of basic visual processing (contrast sensitivity and visual integration) and a battery of social cognition tasks spanning lower-level (gaze perception) to mid-level (emotion recognition) to higher-level (theory of mind) social cognition. We used a four-level path model to test whether basic visual processing predicts gaze perception, which in turn predicts emotion recognition, which predicts theory of mind.\n\nResults\nPoorer contrast sensitivity and visual integration were associated with less precise gaze perception, which was, in turn, associated with worse emotion recognition, which was associated with worse theory of mind. This four-level path model demonstrated good fit and showed superior fit compared to alternative models.\n\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest that basic visual processing influences the perception of basic social cues (e.g., gaze direction), which subsequently impairs more complex social perception and inference. Notably, this study extends prior observations from individuals with chronic schizophrenia to a transdiagnostic youth sample, indicating that altered basic visual processing may be a shared mechanism contributing to social cognitive deficits across psychiatric disorders and illness stages.",

          "authors": "Litian Chen; Freek van Ede; Chris Jungerius; Heleen A Slagter",
          "abstract": "Spatial selective attention is typically thought to act as a sensory filter: prioritizing the processing of relevant information at a particular location in space over that of irrelevant information. Research using dynamic setups, rather than standard static laboratory setups with seated observers, however, shows that spatial selective attention does not simply facilitate sensory processing at a particular location (where), but also involves the planning of how to (covertly) sample that information from the agent’s perspective. That is, spatial selective attention is constrained by sensorimotor processing and includes an action component. Here we ask whether this extends to the flipside of target selection: whether the suppression of irrelevant distractors is similarly viewer dependent. In three experiments (one preregistered), participants performed an additional-singleton visual search task in which a salient distractor could occur more often at one of the search locations (unknown to the participant). Critically, participants conducted the visual search on a monitor positioned flat on a tabletop so that we could manipulate their standing position. This enabled us to disentangle whether implicit distractor-location learning is anchored in world coordinates or incorporates information as to how one can suppress attentional sampling in space from their viewpoint to prevent distraction. Across all three experiments, we found that implicit distractor-location learning is viewer dependent when embedded in active behavior. These findings show that learning to inhibit distractors sometimes cannot be abstracted from the agent and how they can suppress sampling the world from their perspective.",

          "authors": "Kenneth R Paap; Joohee Won; John Majoubi",
          "abstract": "A long-standing claim in the bilingualism literature is that bilingual experience confers broad cognitive advantages, including enhanced creativity, by expanding a pool of general cognitive resources. We evaluated this claim by testing competing architectural accounts of how creativity is supported by cognitive capacity, control, and experience. Using structural equation modeling, we compared three theoretically distinct models—Modular, Resource Pool, and Hybrid—that were specified over identical measurement structures and covariate sets and fit to the same data. All three models exhibited acceptable global fit, indicating that fit alone cannot adjudicate among competing cognitive architectures. Critical differences instead emerged in the structure and interpretability of parameter estimates. In the Modular model, creativity was predicted by attention control and orientational disposition, with general fluid intelligence contributing indirectly through control processes and no independent contribution of bilingualism. In contrast, the Resource Pool and Hybrid models constructed shared latent factors whose meaning depended on partially antagonistic contributions from attentional control and bilingual experience, yielding ambiguous interpretations of creativity as a resource-driven outcome. Taken together, these results do not support the existence of a shared cognitive resource underlying creativity. Instead, they favor a capacity-limited, control- based architecture in which creative performance reflects regulated exploration under cognitive constraints rather than the accumulation of general cognitive resources.",

          "authors": "Cheng-Yu Hsieh; Marco Marelli; Kathleen Rastle",
          "abstract": "Most Chinese words are compounds comprising multiple constituent characters. Research has shown that compounds are routinely broken down into their constituents during word recognition, but it is unknown how readers deal with characters that have multiple possible meanings (e.g., 花 can mean both flower and to spend, depending on the compound in which it appears) and that are highly prevalent in Chinese. The present study investigated how a computational model (Study 1) and human readers (Study 2) compute the meanings of novel Chinese compounds that contain semantically ambiguous characters. We found that both model and human readers prioritise characters that have a consistent meaningful function when making sense of novel compounds, and a further study revealed that semantically-consistent characters serve as anchors to help readers determine the contextually appropriate meaning for ambiguous characters. These findings suggest that the stored knowledge of the consistency of form–meaning mappings shapes the comprehension of novel words. We conclude by arguing that, despite its apparent ambiguity, the Chinese writing system may be more systematic and learnable than it appears.",

          "abstract": "Super Recognizers (SRs) are renowned for their exceptional memory for facial identities and are increasingly employed to support perpetrator identification in forensic contexts. Little is known, however, about their broader cognitive abilities. Here, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of cognitive skills in a large and rigorously defined group of SRs (N=17). We evaluated five domains: (1) face-identity processing, including memory and perception; (2) face non-identity perception (expression, age, sex); (3) non-face memory, both visual (cars, abstract art, words) and auditory (music, environmental sounds); (4) non-face, non-memory cognition, including attention, perceptual discrimination, and working memory; and (5) general intelligence. SRs showed substantial superiority on 14 of 21 tests—indicating that their cognitive strengths extend well beyond face-identity memory alone. Notably, they excelled on all non-memory face tests and all non-face memory tests. However, their superiority was not universal: on tests involving neither faces nor memory, group-level effect sizes were modest, and many SRs scored at or below average. Against this relatively ordinary cognitive backdrop, SRs’ clear superiority with faces, memory, and face memory stands out in stark contrast—effectively ruling out general intelligence, test-taking strategies, or motivation as explanations for their exceptional performance. By presenting the first comprehensive profile of SR cognition, this study clarifies the scope and limits of their abilities beyond face-identity memory and offers actionable guidance for deploying SR expertise in applied and forensic settings.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nReading comprehension is critical for academic success, yet many children with persistent decoding difficulties struggle to achieve it. Although decoding typically becomes less constraining as reading develops, struggling readers may continue to face a decoding bottleneck into later primary years. Few randomised controlled trials have tested whether intervention-induced decoding gains translate into longer-term comprehension improvements. This study examined whether a multi-component literacy intervention can produce immediate and sustained benefits, and whether decoding gains mediate later comprehension outcomes.\nMethods:\nIn a randomised controlled trial, 285 English-speaking children aged 7–9 years with reading difficulties were assigned to a waitlist control group or the Research Informed Literacy with Language (RILL) intervention—a structured, multi-component programme targeting decoding and language comprehension. Literacy outcomes were assessed at baseline (t1), post-intervention (t2), and at four-month follow-up (t3). The trial was pre-registered (ISRCTN18940975).\nResults:\nChildren receiving RILL showed significantly greater gains in decoding (d = .19, p &lt; .001) and reading comprehension (d = .23, p = .011) immediately post-intervention. These effects were sustained four months later, with continued advantages for decoding (d = .17, p = .004) and comprehension (d = .25, p = .010). Notably, comprehension gains were stronger at follow-up than at post-test. Mediation analyses indicated a significant indirect effect of the intervention on comprehension at t3 via decoding at t2 (y-standardised indirect β = ..19, 95% CI [.13, .25], p &lt; .001); the direct effect was not significant (y-standardised β = .01, 95% CI [-.20, .20]).\nConclusions:\nThis is the first trial to show, in older struggling readers, that intervention-induced decoding gains mediate lasting improvements in reading comprehension. The findings highlight the persistence of decoding constraints in later primary years and show that strengthening word-level reading skills can produce enduring comprehension benefits.",

          "abstract": "Proactive, employee-led job redesign (job crafting) is widely promoted, but it remains unclear whether leader- or employee-focused interventions more effectively prompt job crafting and how any effects translate to well-being. We conducted a cluster-randomized field trial in a large UK organization (four departments; N = 276), assigning departments to a bottom-up job-crafting workshop, a top-down leadership-development program for line managers, both combined, or a wait-list control. Surveys at baseline and four months assessed job crafting, job characteristics (structural and social resources; challenge and hindrance demands), and well-being (meaning at work, job satisfaction, activated and relaxed affect). Baseline-adjusted path models with pre-specified design contrasts showed that leadership development increased employee job crafting at four months. Higher job crafting, in turn, predicted improved well-being and job satisfaction through gains in structural resources (job autonomy, task variety, development opportunities) and also directly enhanced meaning at work. Increases in challenge demands partially offset benefits for relaxed affect and job satisfaction. The employee job crafting workshop did not increase overall job crafting but did increase social resources and reduce hindrance demands; the combined condition yielded no additional benefit. Findings identify structural resources as the primary mechanism linking job crafting to health-relevant outcomes and position leadership development as an enabling condition for bottom-up work redesign. This cluster-randomized field experiment provides rare causal evidence that top-down leadership development can serve as a proximal antecedent of employee job crafting.",

          "abstract": "Our visual landscape consists of not only people, places, and objects (e.g., “soldier”, “stadium”, “flag”), but also the conceptual relationships that unite them (e.g., “patriotism”). Because conceptual knowledge varies across individuals, this level of structure may support individualized patterns of attentional selection during naturalistic scene viewing. Here, we ask whether individuals’ gaze patterns reflect, in part, latent attentional priorities organized in conceptual space. Participants (N=61) freely explored a diverse set of immersive real-world scenes (N=100) in head-mounted VR while their gaze position was continuously recorded. We modeled gaze behavior using spatial, visual, and conceptual feature spaces, leveraging embeddings from large vision and language models, to uncover the latent priorities guiding individuals’ unique patterns of selective attention across environments. Individuals exhibited stable and idiosyncratic gaze patterns across scenes and test–retest sessions, consistent with trait-like individual differences in attention. Spatial, visual, and conceptual feature spaces each explain unique variance in individual gaze patterns, with conceptual features contributing variance beyond that explained by spatial and visual features alone. Notably, language-model–based predictions were particularly effective at capturing these individualized patterns. Together, these findings indicate that naturalistic visual attention is structured at multiple levels -- including a conceptual level -- revealing stable individual differences in how people sample and prioritize information across complex visual environments.",

          "abstract": "Background: Frontline professionals in health, social care, and emergency response settings are routinely exposed to potentially traumatic events. Trauma-informed practice (TIP) frameworks highlight two key elements. Organisational readiness refers to the structural, cultural, and leadership conditions that support trauma-informed approaches. Organisational preparedness reflects the practical ability to recognise trauma exposure, respond effectively, and support staff. Despite growing policy attention, little empirical evidence describes how frontline workers experience these factors in organisations.\nObjective: This study explored frontline staff experiences of TIP across UK services. It focused on organisational readiness, including policies, leadership, systems, and cultural responsiveness, and preparedness, including psychological safety, confidence to seek support, clarity of support pathways, and stigma. The aim was to identify strengths, gaps, and priorities for improvement.\nMethod: A cross-sectional online survey was completed by 325 frontline workers across NHS, social care, and emergency response sectors. The survey assessed organisational readiness and preparedness across four clusters: organisational structures and systems, workplace culture and psychological safety, leadership and workforce capability, and wellbeing and access to support. Quantitative data were summarised descriptively and integrated with qualitative themes derived from reflexive thematic analysis.\nResults: Participants reported partial organisational readiness, including access to Employee Assistance Programmes, informal peer support, and visible leadership endorsement of staff wellbeing. Preparedness to respond to trauma exposure was uneven. Psychological safety was often limited, with many participants unsure where to seek support or reporting concerns about confidentiality and professional consequences. Leadership training in TIP principles appeared limited, and communication about support pathways and organisational expectations was frequently unclear.\nConclusions: Frontline services show some strengths in trauma-informed readiness, but important gaps remain in organisational preparedness. These relate particularly to psychological safety, managerial capability, stigma, and access to support. Strengthening leadership capability, improving communication, and creating safe and consistent help-seeking pathways are essential for sustainable trauma-informed workplaces.",

Findings revealed that HSP, EoE, and LST significantly moderated responses to social cues related to safety. Individuals with higher HSP scores experienced more positive emotions in safe, orderly environments with positive social interactions. However, AES did not show significant moderation, though those with higher aesthetic sensitivity reported better emotional responses in urban parks.

Our field’s challenges with reproducibility, common threats to construct, internal, external, and statistical conclusion validity, and the dearth of independent replications in the field, suggest that application claims should be rare. To investigate how often social and personality psychologists make application claims in their published articles, we extracted and categorized application claims from 669 original empirical social and personality psychology articles published from 2010 to 2020 across sevens. Just over one quarter of articles contained at least one application claim, and 1 in 20 articles contained an application claim in the Abstract. We did not find a significant association between having an application claim, and articles’ i) citation count or ii) Altmetric score, however, we did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is no association.

          "abstract": "Amid China’s ageing and digital shift, digital exclusion among older adults poses an urgent challenge. To unpack this phenomenon, this study disentangles age, period, and cohort effects on digital exclusion among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. Using three nationally representative surveys (CHARLS 2011–2020, CFPS 2010–2022, and CGSS 2010–2021), we fitted hierarchical age–period–cohort (HAPC) models weighted by cross-sectional survey weights and stabilized inverse probability weights for item response. We further assessed heterogeneity by urban–rural residence, region, multimorbidity, and cognitive risk, and evaluated robustness with APC bounding analyses. Across datasets, digital exclusion increased with age and displayed mild non-linearity, with a small midlife easing followed by a sharper rise at older ages. Period effects declined over the 2010s and early 2020s, although the pace of improvement differed across survey windows. Cohort deviations were present but less consistent than age and period patterns, with an additional excess risk concentrated among cohorts born in the 1950s. Rural and western residents, as well as adults with multimorbidity or cognitive risk, remained consistently more excluded. Over the study period, the urban–rural divide showed no evidence of narrowing, whereas the cognitive-risk gap widened. These findings highlight digital inclusion as a vital pathway for older adults to remain integral participants in an evolving digital society.",

          "abstract": "In the face of climate change, today’s young people need to balance the challenges of being active and maintaining mental health. This study investigated climate resilience, meaning patterns of climate engagement and mental health among adolescents. Using latent profile analysis, we identified three profiles in a sample of N=603 Swedish adolescents: climate-resilient (17%, active and not impaired), climate-vulnerable (10%, active but slightly impaired), and climate-disengaged (73%, neither active nor impaired). Hierarchical multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that climate emotions predicted belonging to those profiles, with the climate-resilient profile characterized by strong climate sadness and anger and low climate indifference. Relative to the climate-resilient profile, adolescents in the climate-vulnerable profile felt more anxious about climate change, while adolescents in the climate-disengaged profile felt more indifferent and less anxious, sad, and angry. Relative to the climate-resilient group, reporting less empathic concern predicted membership in the climate-vulnerable profile, suggesting a protective role of empathic concern, while reporting less nature connectedness predicted belonging to the climate-disengaged profile. However, interaction analyses revealed that stronger nature connectedness was a vulnerability factor for belonging to the climate-vulnerable profile. These findings provide tentative evidence that fostering empathy may contribute to resilience in the face of climate change. This seems more important than ever to understand, given the severity of the progressing climate crisis and high climate disengagement among youth.",

However, it is not clear whether this mechanism applies to irregular inflections, or they are stored and processed as indecomposable whole forms. Moreover, research on non-native visual recognition of regular and irregular inflections provides highly controversial results. Additionally, some masked priming studies found that in contrast to native speakers, second language learners can show purely orthographic priming effects. In this study, we tested a group of highly proficient Russian learners of German to investigate their processing of regular and irregular German past participles. Morphologically related primes yielded significant facilitation of lexical decision response times to the targets in the non-native speakers, irrespective of regularity and stem allomorphy. However, statistical analysis could not reliably distinguish these effects from the effect of purely orthographic relatedness between control primes and targets. It suggests that orthographic information played a role in the non-native recognition process of inflected words.",

          "abstract": "For fifty years, developmental scientists have theorised that children’s cognitive development is supported by the help, or scaffolding, they receive when faced with a difficult task. The rationale is that that by reducing the cognitive load on the child, scaffolding allows children to practice cognitive skills required to eventually complete challenging tasks on their own. To test this neural explanation directly, this study investigated whether maternal scaffolding modulated young children’s brain activity in real-time during naturalistic collaborative problem-solving. A multimodal cross-brain generalised linear model (GLM) was used to model children’s brain activity over time as a function of maternal scaffolding and mothers’ own brain activity. Results revealed maternal scaffolding up-regulated haemodynamic activity in children’s prefrontal cortices (PFC) bilaterally. In addition to scaffolding effects, mothers’ right PFC signal statistically predicted unique variance in children’s right PFC activity. These results are the first to suggest that parents’ interactive behaviours affect moment-to-moment changes in children’s functional brain activity during unstructured interactions. They also indicate separable neural and behavioural impacts of the parent on children’s right prefrontal activity in a collaborative context. Implications for interpreting two-person developmental neuroscience with multimodal data integration are discussed.",

However, research on HIVST among SSAM in Europe and other high-income countries remains limited. This study aimed to explore perspectives on HIVST, identify barriers and facilitators to HIVST uptake, and provide recommendations to inform effective implementation among a diverse group of 26 SSAM and 13 key informants in the Netherlands through semi-structured interviews. Interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Participants’ perspectives on HIVST centered on three themes: enhanced autonomy in decision-making and testing processes; navigating autonomy and support for self-testing and care linkage; and HIVST within the Dutch context and prevention landscape. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was subsequently employed as a post-hoc interpretive framework to map study findings within a broader implementation context. Factors potentially influencing successful uptake and implementation were identified across multiple CFIR domains, including perceived relative advantage over facility/clinic-based testing, evidence on reliability, and procedural complexity (Innovation Characteristics); low self-efficacy, self-testing and linkage to care support needs (Individual Characteristics); HIV stigma, limited awareness and low visibility of HIVST (Outer Setting); and perceived incompatibility with existing healthcare systems (Inner Setting). Although HIVST can address key testing barriers among SSAM, targeted implementation strategies are needed to guarantee equitable access, proper use, and optimal outcomes. These include enhanced dissemination of HIVST information, normalization of HIV testing and self-testing, provision of person-centered support, and establishing clear pathways for timely care linkage when required.",

Contextual data on movement (steps), sleep/wake status, and posture (via EMA) were collected. HR and HRV metrics (mean HR, mean HP, SDNN, RMSSD, LF, HF) were compared across matched 5-minute epochs using MAAPE, Spearman correlation, and Bland–Altman analyses. Machine learning models were also tested to identify whether Garmin-derived parameters could distinguish between high-quality and low-quality PPG data. \nResults: Agreement between devices was highest during rest, no steps, sleep, and sitting or lying postures. Mean HR and HP were estimated reasonably well, while HRV metrics, especially in the frequency domain, showed greater error and context sensitivity. Device agreement varied notably across individuals. Machine learning models achieved F1 scores of 0.76 (HR) and 0.69 (RMSSD), indicating limited ability to detect reliable epochs from Garmin data alone.\nConclusions: Our findings emphasize the challenges and limitations of using consumer-grade PPG wearables in ambulatory research, particularly due to their sensitivity to movement, posture, and individual variability. We provide practical recommendations on when and how HR and HRV data from these devices can be used with higher confidence and when to be cautious.",

          "abstract": "Many parents lie to their children. Paradoxically, many also disapprove of lying to children and teach children that lying is unacceptable, suggesting discrepancies between parental lying attitudes, lying behaviors, and teaching about lying. This study explored the alignment and discrepancies between parental attitudes, behaviors, and teaching across three lie types: other-oriented, self-oriented, and instrumental. Cross-sectional data were collected from parents in the Netherlands (N = 312, 79.8% mothers) and analyzed using correlational and Latent Profile Analyses. Between-parent associations suggested a general alignment between parental attitudes, behaviors, and teaching, with variations in strength depending on the type of lie. However, within-parent analyses showed that many parents exhibited discrepancies between their lying attitudes, behaviors, and teaching. The prevalence and patterns of alignment and discrepancies also differed by lie type. These findings suggest that most parents do not fully practice what they believe or preach, nor do they consistently preach what they believe, reflecting internal conflicts within parents and inconsistencies in moral socialization within families. This study not only expands on the limited understanding of parental alignment and discrepancies between lying attitudes, behaviors, and teaching but also proposes novel hypotheses of potential mechanisms underlying parental discrepancies, including parental stress, hierarchical family dynamics, and societal norms.",

          "abstract": "This preregistered study investigated whether linguistic information can influence low-level visual perception. We argue that many previous studies supporting this view have significant shortcomings. Specifically, these studies conflate measures of objective performance with those of subjective experience, and cannot exclude the possibility that their observed effects might have been mediated by post-sensory processes instead (e.g., semantics, memory). To address these issues, our paradigm combined elements from two published studies by Sekar et al. (2011) and Lupyan and Ward (2013). Participants (N = 19) observed and rated visual targets of fixed intensity corresponding to their 50% identification threshold; visual targets were preceded by nonpredictive speech cues which matched or mismatched the target. Participants carried out an identification task and rated their subjective experience (“didn’t see”, “couldn’t identify”, “unsure”, and “sure”), while event-related potentials were recorded. We found that identification of targets that remained unseen (“didn’t see”) was not facilitated by congruent cues, but was impaired by incongruent cues. In addition, cue congruence did not affect the relative frequency of nonconscious (“didn’t see”) to conscious visual experiences, nor did it affect the amplitude of the Visual Awareness Negativity, an electrophysiological correlate of visual awareness. The results indicate that language cues did not enhance the processing of subliminal visual inputs, nor boost them into conscious experience. This outcome aligns with accounts of low-level perception that exclude the influence of linguistic or conceptual knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Psychological theories of honor focusing on reputational threat cannot account for variations in honor values and practices. Findings from other disciplines, including sociology, anthropology, and philosophy, reveal a wide array of honor values, as well as shared principles that account for this heterogeneity. I use this knowledge to produce a working theory of honor that explains variation in honor while maintaining consistent underlying logics. Honor attributes action to character qualities, imbuing them with implications for personal worth based on group values, narratives, and contextual factors that frame the interpretation of behavior. Between groups, different values and practices specify different means of pursuing honor. Within groups, people draw on different information to interpret situations and use different strategies to maintain honor. Within individuals, the same person adjusts perceptions of honor based on contextual information and person-dependent expectations. This framework has implications for how honor regulates the balance between conformity and innovation.",

A key distinction may lie in preference for and approach behaviour toward foods differing in calorie content and healthiness. We expected reduced liking and a stronger approach bias in AN and OR compared with controls; in AN specifically for high-caloric foods and in OR specifically for unhealthy foods.\nMethods: Individuals with self-reported AN diagnosis (N = 35), OR (high scores on the Düsseldorf Orthorexia Scale but no AN; N = 40), and controls (no eating disorder history, N = 101) completed liking ratings and an Approach-Avoidance Task with food stimuli varying in calorie content (high vs. low) and, for high-calorie items, healthiness (healthy vs. unhealthy). \nResults: Compared to controls, AN reported lower liking for all high-caloric foods, while OR reported lower liking only for high-caloric, unhealthy foods. Accordingly, OR also liked high-caloric healthy foods more than AN. AN showed weaker approach bias than controls (mainly driven by high-caloric unhealthy foods). OR descriptively lay between both other groups, with no significant differences in approach bias to either.\nConclusion: Explicit liking ratings distinguished AN from OR aligning with their respective motivation to reduce high caloric versus unhealthy food intake. Reduced approach bias was specific to AN, possibly reflecting rapid engagement of approach-avoidance responses to easy-to-categorize high-caloric unhealthy foods. Contrary, health-focused processing in OR may require slower deliberations that are not captured by Approach-Avoidance Tasks.",

          "authors": "Johannah Völler; Juan Linde Domingo; Javier Ortiz-Tudela; Carlos González-García",
          "abstract": "Sudden perceptual learning refers to the abrupt disambiguation of an initially ambiguous stimulus. Despite the limited encoding time, these brief perceptual experiences transform into enduring memory engrams. Still, a comprehensive framework of why these memories are so long-lasting and their neural underpinnings, in particular the role of the hippocampus, is currently lacking. Here, we build on the apparent connection of sudden perceptual learning with long-term memory to outline how a representational perspective may help to overcome current limitations, similar to other areas of memory research. In short, we claim that sudden perceptual learning triggers initial prediction errors across the hierarchy, including strong higher-level (semantic) ones. Once a solution is found, the formerly ambiguous image can be connected to previous schemas and a disambiguation cascade of prediction error minimization is triggered, starting with semantic prediction errors. As a consequence, these events lead to low-dimensional representations that show signs of early semanticization, thereby favouring semantics over perceptual details. In sum, we propose that multiple memory traces are simultaneously encoded during sudden perceptual learning, and while low-dimensional representations engage neocortical structures, high-dimensional, episodic representations require the hippocampus. This perspective offers a promising framework to advance research on sudden perceptual learning and related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Hormonal contraceptives (HCs) contain synthetic gonadal hormones that act on receptors widely distributed throughout the brain, thereby altering the body’s endogenous hormonal milieu in ways that may influence brain and behaviour. Although HCs are among the most commonly prescribed medications for female adolescents, their effects on the developing brain and mental health remain poorly understood. This gap is concerning given that adolescence is marked by substantial hormonal change, neurodevelopment, and a sharp rise in depression risk among females. In this review, we synthesize current evidence on associations between adolescent HC use, depression risk, and brain structure and function. Epidemiological studies consistently report associations between HC use during adolescence and increased depression risk, but causal interpretation is limited by residual confounding. Neuroimaging research remains scarce, particularly in adolescents, and rarely accounts for heterogeneity in HC formulations and characteristics of use or for endogenous hormonal variation related to puberty or the menstrual cycle. We outline three considerations to guide future research: accounting for HC heterogeneity, incorporating developmental features of adolescent menstrual cycles, and situating HC use within its broader developmental and sociocultural context. We conclude by emphasizing the need for rigorous, developmentally sensitive research to counter misinformation and better support adolescents’ reproductive and mental health care needs.",

Dietary intake was assessed using the HELIUS food-frequency questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were based on questionnaires with established cut-offs: PHQ-9 ≥ 10 in HELIUS and CES-D ≥ 16 in LASA. \nWe analysed the data according to the guidelines of the Global burden of disease Lifestyle And mental Disorder Taskforce. Cohort-specific log-linear models with robust variance estimation were conducted in the full sample and stratified by sex. In the main models we used the residual method to account for energy intake and adjusted for baseline confounders.\n\nResults: In HELIUS, we observed no associations in the total sample. In men, a higher processed meat intake (IRR=1.016, 95% CI=[1.004, 1.028]), and a lower fibre intake (IRR=0.954, 95% CI=[0.914-0.995]) were associated with a higher incidence of high depressive symptoms. In LASA, a higher polyunsaturated fatty acid intake was associated with a lower incidence of high depressive symptoms in the total sample (IRR=0.947, 95% CI=[0.907, 0.989]). No associations were found in sex-stratified analyses.\n\nConclusion: In this prospective study of two population-based samples, we found limited evidence for an association between diet and the incidence of high depressive symptoms.",

Synthesising eleven years of empirical research (2014–2025), this review examines the use of social media for self-harm and suicide prevention, focusing on platform-based interventions, user-led practices, and evidence on safety, acceptability and efficacy. In April 2025, a systematic search of five databases identified studies published since 2014. Extracted data included details of the prevention activity or intervention examined and any reported outcomes. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. From 16,476 records, 75 studies met inclusion criteria and were classified as reporting either: intervention development or format (17%), intervention evaluation (19%), user experiences (34%) or online behaviours (29%). Social media-based interventions included purpose-designed social networking interventions, programs combining AI-driven risk detection with in-platform interventions, and educational campaigns promoting safe online communication about self-harm and suicide. Community-led practices such as sharing recovery stories and suicide-related peer support provided social connection and emotional relief, though these benefits coexisted with risks including exposure to graphic and instructional content. Users described social media platforms as important avenues for suicide-related help-seeking, particularly when offline clinical support was inaccessible. Few studies evaluated intervention effectiveness or measured changes in self-harm or suicidal behaviour, and most relied on small, non-representative samples. This review reveals a broad range of user-led suicide prevention activities alongside a growing number of platform-based suicide prevention interventions. Rigorous longitudinal and experimental research is needed to determine efficacy and guide safe implementation in real-world settings.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between acute physical exercise and decision-making remains debated. Various evidence leans towards an inverted U-shaped curve where decision-making peaks during moderate acute physical exertion and deteriorates under heavy exercise. This study examined behavioural and computational markers of decision-making during a conflict task across three increasing cycling intensities, up to the heavy domain. Thirty-one participants completed the Eriksen Flanker task at light, moderate, and heavy exercise intensities. Throughout the experiment, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and rates of perceived exertion were measured and confirmed the prescribed exercise intensities. Results indicated that reaction times decreased, while accuracy remained stable. Diffusion Model for Conflict (DMC) analyses showed that drift rate followed the hypothesised inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at moderate intensity, suggesting optimal evidence accumulation at this workload. Decision boundaries decreased linearly with intensity, indicating less cautious responding under higher exertion. This partially supports arousal-based models such as the Yerkes-Dodson law, highlighting moderate intensity as a potential “sweet spot” for decision-making. The integration of computational modelling provides novel insight into the interplay between intensity levels of acute exercise and cognitive processes. This has implications for sports performance, training strategies, and high-stakes professions requiring rapid decisions under physical stress.",

          "abstract": "Voice cloning technology has developed at a rapid pace and current synthesis techniques produce near- humanlike voices. Recent research showed that cloned voices are up ~13% more intelligible than their human originals in background noise. This research also showed that intelligibility in cloned voices was driven mainly by pitch and harmonic measures, whereas formant- and vowel-space measures were more important for human voices. We aimed to establish whether the intelligibility benefit for cloned voices persisted when harmonic information and fine-grained spectral detail was (largely) absent from the speech signals and whether listeners perceptually adapted to cloned voices. We compared the intelligibility of ten six-band noise-vocoded cloned voices with their ten human originals. Eighty participants listened to 80 sentences, 40 human, 40 cloned in an online experiment. Listeners heard a block of 40 cloned voices and a block of 40 human voices (order counterbalanced) to compare perceptual adaptation to both speech types and evaluate transfer of learning effects. We found that noise-vocoded cloned voices were more intelligible than their human counterparts; listeners showed 13% percent higher accuracy scores. Overall, participants adapted to the vocoded speech and improved by ~8-10% over the course of 40 sentences in the first block only, this pattern held regardless of whether voices were human or cloned. We also found a positive transfer of learning effect between cloned and human voices; human voices were ~10% more intelligible when preceded by the cloned voices. These results indicate that the intelligibility benefit for cloned voices persists for noise-vocoded speech, and that listeners adapt to noise-vocoded cloned speech as they do for human speech. Our results have implications for applications of cloned voices, in particular in development of assistive technologies.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Contrary to medical and social constructionist approaches, in the neurodiversity approach, ADHD is considered a value-neutral neurodivergence, rather than a deficit to-be-cured or a societal problem affecting identity, fostering stigma and overmedicalization. This paper explores, guided by lived-experiences, the applicability of the neurodiversity approach to ADHD in comparison to the other approaches.\nMethods: We examine key claims of the medical and social constructionist approaches to ADHD, using an “inside-out” perspective, based on studies documenting first-person perspectives of ADHD adolescents and adults with experiencing ADHD, disability, getting or having a diagnosis and with medication. \nResults: In these lived experiences (1) ADHD characteristics are generally not experienced as universal deficits (2) disability primarily stems from a highly invalidating mismatch between the ADHD person and their neuronormative environment (3) the ADHD diagnostic label brings both beneficial and disadvantageous consequences (4) medication is often a balancing act between costs on people’s bodies and identity and benefits as medication is necessary to meet important life-goals and for navigating unaccommodating environments.\nDiscussion: Considering ADHD a difference with disability mainly occurring in mismatch with environment and not a unified deficit, nor a purely social problem, reflects people's lived experiences, makes an ADHD diagnosis easier to reconcile with oneself and can make the balancing act of medication easier. The neurodiversity approach may be a promising and less stigmatizing alternative to current approaches. It empowers people by valuing lived experience as expert evidence and provides a clinical, societal and research framework of ADHD that integrates both individual and environmental aspects of disability.",

          "abstract": "Although suicidality is a major public health concern, the clinical relevance of behavioural addictions (BAs) with respect to suicide risk remains poorly understood. Guided by the ideation-to-action framework, we examined whether six BAs (gambling disorder, gaming disorder, problematic internet use, problematic pornography use, problematic smartphone use, work addiction) at age 25 were prospectively associated with a) the onset and recurrence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts at age 28 and b) the likelihood of a suicide attempt versus ideation only. We also assessed whether these associations overlapped with co-occurring risk factors, including substance use disorders (SUDs), other mental health problems (MHPs) and psychological distress (PD). Using a population-based longitudinal design, a non-self-selected sample of 5,611 young Swiss men completed baseline (age 25) and follow-up (age 28) questionnaires. Measurements included BAs, SUDs, MHPs, PD, lifetime suicidality at baseline and 12-month suicidality at follow-up. Logistic regression models tested associations between BAs and suicidality. Overlaps with co-occurring SUDs, MHPs and PDs were quantified using the Karlson–Holm–Breen method. Results revealed that all BAs were significantly prospectively associated with the onset of suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt; only some BAs were associated with the recurrence of ideation (gaming disorder, work addiction, having ≥ 1 BA) or an attempt (gambling disorder). Baseline gambling disorder, problematic pornography use and having ≥ 1 BA were associated with reporting a suicide attempt rather than ideation-only among participants reporting suicidal ideation at follow-up. Adjusting for co-occurring factors attenuated BAs’ associations with onset and recurrence but not for suicide attempts versus ideation only. Overall, BAs showed consistent longitudinal associations with suicidality, with relationships frequently persisting after adjustment for co-occurring risk factors. These findings underscore the clinical relevance of BAs and the importance of systematic screening and prevention efforts within mental health and suicide risk assessment, alongside evidence-based interventions.",

In particular, no validated French version of the original 12-item Grit-O scale exists, limiting cross-cultural research on the structure and correlates of grit. The present study translated the Grit-O into French, evaluated its psychometric properties in 352 French-speaking adults, and investigated its role in academic engagement, performance, and well-being. Three confirmatory factor models were tested: a unidimensional model, a correlated two-factor model distinguishing Perseverance of Effort (PE) and Consistency of Interest (CI), and a bifactor model. Results strongly favored the bifactor structure, indicating a general grit factor with two distinct facets, dominated by PE. Convergent and criterion validity were supported: grit (primarily its PE component) was associated with greater student engagement, task performance, and psychological, emotional, and social well-being. CI showed weaker and sometimes negative associations, consistent with prior cross-cultural findings suggesting higher contextual variability. Overall, the French Grit-O shows robust reliability and validity and provides a theoretically grounded tool for studying grit in Francophone populations. Our findings highlight cultural nuances in the expression and predictive value of grit, particularly regarding CI, and underscore the need for further cross-cultural and developmental investigations.",

However, ADHD is still often viewed from a medicalised perspective in workplace settings, despite the neurodiversity paradigm offering an alternative, non-pathologising way to frame these individual differences. Research has begun to explore employment experiences and outcomes for adults with ADHD; however, there is currently little data relevant to academic workplaces specifically. \nThis qualitative study offers a critical-realist analysis of interviews with early-career academics, seeking to understand first-person ADHD perspectives on establishing an academic career. Consistent with the neurodiversity paradigm, the analysis foregrounds (mis-)matches between individual ‘neurotypes’ and workplace environments. It also highlights an ecological view: conceptualising ‘function’ at both the individual and collective levels by exploring how ADHD matters both for individual careers and for knowledge production more generally.\nFindings suggest that academia can in principle be a rewarding environment for ADHDers, though social and institutional pressures often inhibit this potential. Further, having an ‘ADHD neurotype’ influences both individual career trajectories and wellbeing at work; at the same time, knowledge production at the collective level benefits from the inclusion of ADHD academics. The findings are discussed in reference to ecological models of neurodiversity, and their implications for universities aiming to facilitate neurodivergent contributions and inclusion at work.",

          "authors": "Laura Pissani; Merel C.J. Scholman; Vera Demberg",
          "abstract": "Metaphors convey meanings beyond their literal interpretation, requiring individuals to rely on linguistic and cognitive resources beyond those used for literal language. Models of metaphor comprehension propose different routes to deriving metaphorical content. The indirect-access model suggests that literal meaning is accessed first and then rejected if context demands, whereas the direct-access model argues that metaphorical content is retrieved automatically without an initial literal interpretation. However, previous research has yielded mixed findings on this issue. We examine whether individual differences in metaphor processing can account for these inconsistencies. We hypothesize that individuals may differ in their ability to directly retrieve metaphorical content or inhibit literal meaning. In Experiment 1, participants read sentences such as John is an early bird so he can... and were slower and less likely to select a target continuation (e.g., attend) when it was paired with a distractor related to the literal meaning of the metaphor (e.g., fly) compared to an unrelated distractor (e.g., cry). This awakening effect was more pronounced in individuals with higher vocabulary knowledge and working memory capacity. In Experiment 2, we examined whether the effect persisted when distractors were no longer grammatical in context (e.g., attend versus flying or crying). The awakening effect remained but was no longer modulated by individual differences. These findings suggest that, under semantic and syntactic competition, individuals with higher vocabulary knowledge and working memory capacity may attempt to reinterpret the related distractor as an elaboration of the metaphor, indicating that activation of the literal meaning of metaphors is sustained by vocabulary knowledge and working memory capacity.",

We discuss various ways in which a multiverse may be employed – as a tool for reflection and critique, as a persuasive tool, as a serious inferential tool – as well as potential problems that arise depending on the specific purpose. For example, it fails as a persuasive tool when researchers disagree about which variations should be included in the analysis, and it fails as a serious inferential tool when the included analyses do not target a coherent estimand. Then, we take yet another step back and ask what the multiverse discourse has been good for and whether any broader lessons can be drawn.

          "abstract": "Early adolescence marks a critical period for the onset of psychiatric symptoms, with 50% of\nmental disorders emerging before age 18. Recent evidence points to individuals being born\npreterm and/or with low birth weight (henceforth, PTB) having an increased risk of developing\nmental disorders in adolescence. Surprisingly, existing early detection and intervention strategies\nin adolescence are not tailored to PTB needs and profiles. The previous use of several disorder-\nspecific instruments complicates unified, efficient screening. Thus, here we characterised\nmental health profiles of 10–14-year-old PTB adolescents while testing the applicability of the\nwidely used Diagnostic System for mental disorders for children and adolescents – III (DISYPS–\nIII). We collected data on the frequency of experiencing mental health challenges from 225 young\nadolescents (M=12.03 years) from the longitudinal German Neonatal Network (GNN) who were\nborn very preterm and/or light (M=28.03 weeks, M=999.62 g) using the DISYPS–III screening\nquestionnaire. A confirmatory factor analysis replicated the DISYPS–III’ factorial structure and\ninternal consistency for 10-14-year-old PTB adolescents. Overall, PTB adolescents reported\nsignificantly more mental health challenges than the DISYPS–III community norm sample. Results\nalso replicated specific findings of mental health challenges from other PTB cohorts and\ncountries, such as a higher number of comorbidities in adolescents diagnosed with ADD than\nADHD. These findings of an elevated psychological burden suggest a need for structured PTB\nscreening of long-term mental health outcomes in adolescence that include 10-year-old PTB\nindividuals; with the DISYPS–III being a suitable screening instrument.",

          "abstract": "Irritability and anhedonia are two prevalent, co-occurring, and impairing symptoms of major depression that are proposed to result from dysfunctions in reward processing. While irritability is associated with heightened sensitivity to reward receipt, anhedonia is linked to blunted sensitivity to reward receipt. Given these supposed paradoxical effects on reward sensitivity, it is noteworthy that no studies have examined how both symptoms interact to affect reward sensitivity. In a community sample of young adults (N=73, Mage=21.21±2.27, 56.16% females), we evaluated the interacting effects of dimensionally assessed irritability and anhedonia symptoms on neural measures of reward and loss sensitivity during a well-established reward paradigm (the Doors task). Event-related potential and time-frequency measures were analyzed using both univariate and a multivariate method based on generalized eigendecomposition to isolate delta- and theta-band activity in response to feedback. Linear-mixed models tested the unique and interacting effects of irritability and anhedonia on EEG measures of reward sensitivity (FRN/N2, theta, and delta power). Participants with above-average irritability and anhedonia displayed larger (more negative) FRN/N2 amplitudes across feedback valence, and reduced theta power following reward feedback, whereas no associations were observed at lower symptom levels. These findings suggest that individuals with co-occurring irritability and anhedonia may perceive feedback overall (reward and loss) as more salient, while interpreting rewards as less motivationally relevant. These effects remained significant when controlling for broader depressive symptoms, gender, and income. These results provide preliminary evidence that co-occurring irritability and anhedonia jointly influence neural sensitivity to feedback, in individuals without clinical levels of symptoms. Awaiting validation in clinical samples, our results highlight the importance of considering symptom interactions to better understand reward-related mechanisms in depression.",

While existing research has documented the prevalence and predictors of toxic behaviors, less is known about how individuals who engage in toxicity perceive and justify their actions, especially on mainstream platforms. This study addresses this gap by conducting 25 in-depth interviews with individuals who were toxic in political discussions on Facebook and Twitter. The findings reveal that many view their toxicity as a form of political participation. Three distinct justifications for toxicity were identified: venting political frustrations, pursuing truth through blunt deliberation, and seeking to persuade or mobilize others. These findings suggest that toxic speech can function as a deliberate, albeit hostile, form of political engagement, and they highlight the diverse functions social media serves for politically motivated users. The study calls for targeted interventions to address the distinct motivations underlying toxicity.",

Using six nationally or regionally representative longitudinal ageing cohorts (CHARLS, ELSA, HRS, LASI, MHAS, and SHARE), we examined the association between LLD and MCI in the global population and tested whether commonly hypothesized psychological pathways (functional impairment, social isolation, physical inactivity, and poor sleep) mediate this relationship. At the population level, LLD was significantly associated with MCI (ORs = 1.27–3.39), and Cox models indicated bidirectional risk (HRs = 1.09–1.27). However, Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models provided limited evidence for within-person effects, with no candidate factors mediating this association. Together, these findings challenge prevailing assumptions that modifiable psychological factors drive the dynamic coupling between depression and cognitive decline, instead suggesting that their co-development reflects long-term vulnerability established earlier in the life course.",

          "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is gaining popularity as it has been used to enhance early diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. Herein, we recommend the incorporation of the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (NIMH-RDoC) framework with XAI-informed diagnostic protocols to help establish diagnosis at the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). RDoC has a dimensional structure that extends across units of analysis from genes and molecules to circuits, physiology, behavior, and introspection. By restructuring diverse features as inputs (including apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, amyloid and tau biomarkers, computational neuroimaging-informed cortical atrophy, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) hypometabolism, quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) rhythms, cognitive tests, digital behavioral markers), onto RDoC units, data driven approaches like XIA can now not only achieve increased interpretability but also enhance their mechanistic validity. Such an innovative approach places data driven model outputs within neurobiologically based domains such as Cognitive Systems, Negative Valence, and Arousal/Regulatory Systems. Our synthesis suggests that a converging RDoC and XAI approach may help to bolster the coherence of AD biomarkers, promote model exploration in clinical decision-making, and provide a strategic roadmap for translational neuroscience and personalized medicine. Another major aim of this research is to critically analyze current approaches related to XIA that have been used in dementia research, particularly diagnosis and prognosis. By explicitly grounding explanations in RDoC cognitive domains and paradigms, the framework also aims to make model outputs meaningful in terms of specific mental functions (e.g., episodic memory, cognitive control), thereby supporting neuropsychologically informed diagnosis, categorization, and communication with patients and caregivers.",

In addition, we aimed to identify which social determinants of health (SDOH) factors are most frequently reported across studies.  \n\nMethod: We performed a comprehensive search across six electronic databases: OVID Medline, OVID PsycINFO, EBSCO Medline, EBSCO CINAHL Plus, Embase, and Web of Science, as well as unpublished literature. We identified 149 original studies that administered neuromodulation and/or speech-language interventions to individuals with PPA or PPAOS and reported communication outcomes relative to a baseline or control group. From these studies, we extracted data on participants’ race, ethnicity, spoken languages, occupation, years of education, and other relevant sociodemographic variables. \n\nResults: Ethnoracial and linguistic diversity in the current PPA literature remains limited. Among studies that reported the extracted variables, the majority of participants were identified as non-Hispanic White, and most studies were conducted in the United States. English was the most commonly reported spoken language and was frequently used as an inclusion criterion. Regarding SDOH, participants tend to have medium-high education and hold higher skill-level occupations. Very few studies reported retirement status and whether retirement was due to symptom onset. \n\nConclusions: Current intervention research for PPA and PPAOS lacks ethnoracial and linguistic diversity. Underrepresentation is exacerbated by not reporting factors concerning SDOH. The concentration of research in homogenous populations limits the generalizability of current findings and restricts their relevance for managing PPA and PPAOS across diverse demographic, cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic contexts. Future research on treatment should not only ensure comprehensive reporting of participant characteristics but also actively expand the inclusivity of recruitment practices.",

Reading engagement (i.e., reading frequency and avoidance) was measured in both grades, while reading anxiety, children’s interest in reading, and parental value placed on reading were assessed in Grade 2. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the mediating role of reading anxiety and the moderating effects of child and parental task values.\nResults\nGrade 1 reading fluency skills predicted Grade 2 fluency, indicating that early reading skills have a direct effect on later reading achievement. Additionally, they predicted Grade 2 reading anxiety, with higher early reading fluency predicting lower anxiety levels. Reading anxiety, in turn, was negatively associated with both Grade 2 reading fluency and reading frequency and it significantly mediated the relationship between Grade 1 fluency and Grade 2 reading frequency. Children’s interest in reading was positively associated with both fluency and frequency, while parental value was associated with frequency only. However, neither child nor parent reading values moderated the associations between anxiety and either fluency or frequency.\nConclusions \nThese findings highlight the importance of addressing early reading fluency difficulties and reading anxiety to foster sustained reading engagement and support long-term reading development.",

We found that semantic representations of basic emotions were highly similar, and that individuals who represent emotions more normatively are more accurate about their friendships in the social network. Those that were more accurate about their own friendships were also more accurate about others’ friendships and viewed themselves as having higher social status over time.

We instantiate our proposal with a model of Bayesian program induction with a prior for algorithmic simplicity and a likelihood that first encodes a pressure of mimicry (teaching phase), and then a pressure for speed and/or accuracy (individual practice phase). Regardless of whether the pressure is to respond faster or more accurately, the model robustly captures the long-observed developmental trajectory of strategy discovery.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has shown that 2.5-year-old toddlers succeed at a verbal false belief (FB) task when response generation and inhibitory control demands were reduced (Setoh et al., 2016). However, this low-inhibition version of a traditional FB task was criticized for being susceptible to low-level strategies, such as pointing to the last location where the object had been, rather than inferring the agent’s belief. To rule out such alternative explanations, we extended the Setoh et al. (2016) paradigm by adding a second condition (FB=first) where the location the agent believed the object to be was its first location. German (N=56) and Chinese (N=45) 3- to 5-year-olds were tested with this extended low-demand FB task, a standard FB task, and an inhibitory control task. Across both cultures, children performed well in the original FB=last condition from age 3, but only passed the new FB=first condition around age 5. Performance in the FB=first condition was related to age and performance in the standard FB task, while the FB=last condition was not. The discrepancy between FB=first and FB=last condition suggests that young children’s success in the original study by Setoh et al. (2016) was due to the non-mentalistic strategy of choosing the last object location. Our findings are consistent across two cultures, suggesting that, in line with the traditional theory, explicit false belief reasoning emerges around age 4 in both Western and Chinese cultures, even when the executive demands of the task are reduced.",

Here, we reconceptualize racial ambiguity as encompassing both Multiracial and monoracial individuals who are difficult to racially categorize, arguing that ambiguity arises not only from multiple heritages but from perceptual uncertainty in classification.  \n\nMethodology/approach\nWe applied the dynamic and interactive theory of person construal (Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2011) as a guiding theory to analyze how both Multiracial and monoracial sources of racial ambiguity can disrupt the person-perception process. By reviewing norming data from several facial-stimuli databases, we argue that racial ambiguity—arising from either source—is a dynamic feature of person perception (Chen et al., 2021; Lakshmi et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2021; Meyers et al., 2024).  \n\nResearch limitations/implications\nGiven the lack of a clear operationalization of racial ambiguity in existing literature, the current framework defines it as the perceptual difficulty of categorizing a person’s race based on visible or contextual cues.\n\nOriginality/value of paper\nMost research on social perception and identity assumes that perceivers’ categorizations accurately reflect a target’s identity. By reconceptualizing racial ambiguity, we challenge this assumption and position ‘miscategorization’ as a meaningful outcome of disruptions in the person‑perception process. This perspective opens new avenues for research linking racial ambiguity to downstream consequences in stereotyping, intergroup dynamics, and identity formation, ultimately advancing how scholars understand the construction and interpretation of race in social cognition.",

          "abstract": "Images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming more realistic, with AI-generated images of adult faces indistinguishable from human faces. Can the same be said for AI-generated images of young children? We compared 76 participants’ discrimination of 72 images representing three types of stimuli: real photos, randomly selected AI images, and AI images curated with human oversight. Real photos were identified as real more frequently (78.6%) than Curated AI (40.3%) and Random AI (29.1%). However, Curated AI stimuli were judged as real more often than Random AI stimuli.  Performance variability between images based on age, gender, and race suggests that AI better portrays children with specific characteristics. Images of toddlers and girls were judged as real more than infants and boys.  Additional refinement is needed in training and testing text-to-image algorithms to realistically portray children and promote the ethical use of AI in developmental research.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception relies on multiple acoustic cues whose relative weighting varies across languages. The present study examines how long-term language experience shapes cue weighting in second-language (L2) speech perception, refining an attentional-learning account of cross-linguistic transfer. Native speakers of English, Dutch, Spanish, Korean, and Mandarin completed a cue-weighting task targeting English lexical stress, in which vowel quality, pitch, and duration were orthogonally manipulated. Results revealed robust, dimension-specific differences across first-language (L1) groups that could not be explained solely by the presence or absence of lexical stress or lexical tone in the L1. Instead, cue weighting reflected how acoustic dimensions function within the L1 cue ecology, including their relative contribution to lexical distinctions and the stability and interpretability of these mappings across contexts. Cue redundancy constrained relative cue strength without eliminating attentional sensitivity to secondary dimensions. Machine-learning classification further showed that L1-linked attentional profiles were sufficiently structured to support prediction, even among L2 listeners with substantial English proficiency, demonstrating the persistence of L1-shaped attentional tuning. These findings support a view of cue weighting as reflecting durable, multidimensional attentional priors shaped by long-term experience and highlight the importance of L1 cue ecologies in understanding cross-linguistic transfer in speech perception.",

Taken together, our findings suggest that pre-teens already use their own value priorities to organize their political attitudes, which emphasizes the importance of children's independent attributes in their political development, and lends support to the idea that personal values provide a foundation for political ideology.",

Psychologists have long debated the nature of similarity, considering whether it is continuous and space-like or discrete and feature-like. Here, we argue that the idea that stimuli are similar to the extent that they are likely to have been generated by the same process unifies these spatial and featural accounts as special cases. We formulate this notion of generative similarity in terms of Bayesian inference over hierarchical generative processes and show how it can illuminate key ideas from the literature including the universal law of generalization, feature contrast models, exemplar and prototype theories, and metric violations in semantic organization. Moreover, just as previous work on similarity drew on connections to multi-dimensional scaling and additive clustering, generative similarity provides a new way to construct representations of stimuli by drawing on contrastive learning, a modern machine learning procedure for learning representations by pushing similar stimuli together and dissimilar stimuli apart. We show how this approach can provide a way to translate hierarchical generative processes into spatial representations that support human-like abstraction and generalization, even in complex domains that are parameterized by probabilistic programs.",

Bayesian multilevel models revealed that daily fluctuations in both self-reported experiences and objective speech features from audio journals were significantly associated with changes in clinical symptoms. Importantly, model comparisons showed that the optimal temporal window for aggregating daily data varied by symptom domain and data modality. These findings demonstrate the utility of daily self-reports and audio journals for dynamic symptom tracking, and showcase a data-driven approach to investigating the optimal length of daily history for developing personalized monitoring tools in psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Purpose\nThis randomised control trial examined the contribution of teacher-led phonics instruction and GraphoLearn-Rime (GL-Rime) to the development of English literacy and reading skills of Grade 1 level children in a low-income context. \n\nMethod\nStudents (N = 234) were randomly allocated into three groups. The Phonics only group (n = 83) received phonics instruction from trained teachers. The Phonics+GL group (n = 89) received GL-Rime (computer-assisted reading instruction) along with teacher-led phonics instruction. Both groups received respective interventions for five months. Control group (n = 62) received business-as-usual instruction.\n\nResults\nPhonics only and Phonics+GL groups improved more than the control group on all measures of phonological awareness and reading skills. Intervention group students at the bottom 25th percentile at baseline scored better than the control group in oral- and paper-based measures of phonological awareness, Grade 1 word reading, and in-game letter sound knowledge measure. Further, the Phonics+GL group performed better than the Phonics only group on paper-based measure of letter sound knowledge. Amount of attendance to teacher-led phonics instruction predicted intervention groups’ paper-based letter sound knowledge gains. In the Phonics+GL group, in-game progress predicted gains in phonological awareness and word reading skills outside the game, but in-game duration did not. In-game progress mediated the effects of students’ amount of attendance to teacher-led phonics instruction and their pre-test emergent literacy and word reading skills on post-intervention learning outcomes.\n\nConclusion\nEnglish-as-a-second-language learners and struggling readers who participated in teacher-led phonics instruction more, developed better foundational literacy skills and progressed faster in GL-Rime.

          "abstract": "Past research has shown that short-term exposure to speech carrying certain acoustic statistics transfers robustly to speech production. However, all studies reporting such transfer have used auditory repetition tasks. Therefore, it is unclear whether perception-production transfer in the acoustic-phonetic domain extends to tasks without an auditory model to probe production. We answer this question in two experiments. Experiment 1 shows that people read aloud the words BEER and PEER differently after exposure to auditory samples of “beer” and “peer” drawn from a distribution of standard American English vs. a distribution of slightly accented speech. Experiments 2A and 2B replicate this finding and show generalization to reading a new word pair (BEACH/PEACH) and a new nonword pair (BEETH/PEETH). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the perception-production transfer in the acoustic-phonetic domain extends beyond auditory repetition tasks to production tasks without an explicit auditory model, and that this transfer generalizes to new syllables.",

          "abstract": "Background: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies are increasingly used to study the dynamic psychological processes that underlie affect and suicidal ideation (SI). Although these provide a promising directly for modeling those relationships, they often include substantial missing data and use estimators that rely on data being missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR) as underlying assumptions. However, missing data may be driven by systematic relationships between these psychological processes and disengagement.\nMethods: We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study evaluating six estimators of the marginal mean of SI. We generated realistic EMA data under a 4 x 3 x 2 factorial design varying missingness mechanism (MCAR, MAR, missing not at random [MNAR] driven by momentary symptoms, MNAR driven by latent disengagement states), target compliance (40%, 60%, 80%), and study complexity (standard vs. volatility-dependent missingness). Each condition comprised 500 replications of a 21-day EMA protocol with N = 300 participants completing 4 prompts per day. Estimator performance was evaluated via bias, root mean standard error, and empirical confidence interval coverage relative to the actual ground truth estimand.\nResults: Under MCAR, all estimators exhibited negligible bias, low RMSE, and near-complete coverage. Under MAR, bias remained modest, but coverage degraded at lower compliance, particularly under the complex study type. Under both MNAR mechanisms, all estimators, including doubly robust approaches, exhibited substantial negative bias (~20-65% underestimation of SI), inflated RMSE, and near-zero empirical coverage, even under high (80%) compliance. \nConclusions: Conventional missing data estimators may fail to recover valid inferences regarding sample prevalence when compliance is dependent on latent and temporally emergent psychological processes. Even under high compliance with doubly-robust estimators, inferences may be biased under realistic symptom-dependent missingness.",

          "abstract": "Olfaction is one of our most archaic senses but its central mechanisms are lesser known than those of other senses. In this work, we address a possible link between olfactory stimuli and mental spatial representations. Although olfactory percepts are not commonly related to space (as are visual or auditory percepts), perfumiers tend to describe scents in terms of top/head or base notes, using spatial terms, and arrange notes vertically on olfactory pyramids, with more volatile notes on top. Based on preliminary evidence, we tested in a well-powered, preregistered study whether odors evoke in naïve participants a mental vertical representation dependent on odor quality, in the absence of any explicit references to elevation. In a speeded choice classification task, 110 participants were asked to press one of two vertically aligned buttons in response to a series of olfactory stimuli. A spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effect was expected to emerge from alternative mappings (compatible vs incompatible) of stimuli to responses, due to the hypothesised dimensional overlap between odors and response alternatives. However, the preregistered contrast on means of median correct responses neither confirmed the presence of a vertical SRC effect at the group level, nor provided conclusive evidence for its absence. An analogous exploratory test on restricted means did support the presence of the predicted effect at the group level, whereas its Bayesian counterpart found the outcome inconclusive. Exploratory analyses revealed the presence of three distinct clusters of participants with regards to the vertical SRC effect for odors, with two clusters (N = 61 and N = 19) showing a significant effect in the expected direction and one cluster (N = 30) showing a significant effect in the opposite direction. These results call for replications with an approach that factors in potential sources of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers are increasingly encouraged to move beyond a narrow focus on detecting statistically significant effects that differ from zero under the traditional null-hypothesis significance testing framework. To interpret findings more meaningfully, best practices emphasize evaluating the magnitude of effects to determine whether they are practically meaningful or negligible. This requires specifying a smallest effect size of interest  and conducting interval-based hypothesis tests, such as minimum-effect or equivalence tests. Although these approaches improve current practices by explicitly taking into account effect sizes, interval-based hypothesis tests can still yield inconclusive results, leaving uncertainty about whether an effect is practically relevant or negligible. In this article, we first introduce interval-based hypothesis testing and highlight the challenge posed by inconclusive outcomes. We then propose a set of complementary tools—implemented in an accompanying Shiny application (https://paulriesthuis.shinyapps.io/SESOIdecisions/)—to support more informed decision making under such uncertainty, including threshold alpha, the robustness index, the practical relevance replication probability, Bayesian posterior probabilities, and a meta-analytic approach. By explicitly incorporating uncertainty and replication potential, these tools aim to help researchers draw more nuanced statistical and practical decisions and improve the interpretation of results obtained from interval-based hypothesis testing.",

However, existing research on TNB+ youth is largely deficit-focused and often overlooks their strengths and agency. Using a community-based approach, this study examined coping strategies used by TNB+ adolescents and young adults and evaluated whether general and population-specific strategies were associated with higher levels of resilience. An independent community advisory board of five TNB+ young adults evaluated the standardized measures, and their perspectives were incorporated into the quantitative analyses. Participants’ lived experiences related to additional coping strategies were captured through open-text responses. N = 164 TNB+ adolescents and young adults (ages 16–27) completed measures of TNB+-specific coping, general coping, distal and proximal gender-related minority stress, and individual resilience. Qualitative data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, and quantitative analyses included bivariate associations and latent regression models. Several community-based coping strategies emerged that enhance the scope of existing standardized instruments. Behavioral avoidance was the most frequently used TNB+-specific coping strategy. Contrary to our assumption, general coping strategies, but not TNB+-specific coping, were significantly associated with resilience. The findings imply that strengthening coping capacities may enhance resilience among TNB+ youth independently of minority stress levels, highlighting the importance of interventions that build general coping resources alongside efforts to address structural stressors. Results further underscore the importance of community-based assessment of coping, highlighting how coping strategies identified outside standardized instruments can inform counseling practices with TNB+ youth.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: PTSD is characterized by reduced alpha (8-12 Hz) rhythms, reflecting cortical hyperarousal and disrupted large-scale network dynamics. Across single- and multi-session studies, alpha-desynchronizing EEG neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) restores alpha rhythms toward normative levels (“alpha rebound”) and reduces PTSD symptoms. However, prior research has focused mainly on pre-to-post intervention changes, leaving longitudinal trajectories of therapeutic improvement and neural modulation unclear. \n\nMethods: We conducted longitudinal mapping of clinical and neural outcomes during a 20-week randomized sham-controlled trial (RCT) of alpha-rhythm EEG-NFB in individuals with PTSD (n = 38). Participants were randomized to an experimental group receiving weekly EEG-NFB targeting alpha downregulation or a sham-control group. PTSD symptoms were assessed biweekly using the PCL-5. Alpha modulation was analyzed between and within sessions using linear mixed-effects models. \n\nResults: Active EEG-NFB produced an early and sustained therapeutic response, with the proportion of participants below the probable PTSD threshold stabilizing by approximately week 11. Only the experimental group showed consistent alpha downregulation during training and diminishing within-session alpha rebound across sessions, consistent with a ceiling effect. Greater alpha suppression and more pronounced rebound dynamics were associated with therapeutic response, indicating a direct link between neural modulation and clinical improvement.\n\nConclusion: This study provides the first longitudinal mapping of clinical and neural trajectories in an RCT of EEG-NFB for PTSD, demonstrating early stabilization of response and identifying neural mechanisms associated with symptom improvement. These findings may inform the optimization of EEG-NFB protocols and support its role as an adjunctive, symptom-stabilizing scaffold for psychotherapy.",

Although educational interventions targeting the general population are needed to disconfirm these biases, few tools have been developed to present realistic and relatable portrayals of individuals with facial differences. Entertainment-Education (E-E) offers a promising strategy to deliver prosocial messages by embedding them within engaging narratives.\nThis study describes the development and design validation of three E-E videos that aim to counter social bias towards individuals with visible facial differences and explores their potential relevance for use in broader educational settings, including dental education.\nUsing a modified ADDIE approach, three narratives were scripted to disconfirm stereotypes related to social competence, intellectual competence, and psychological adjustment. Neutral composite faces were generated using WebMorph and artistically modified to depict realistic loss of a facial part. Voice recordings and images were integrated using D-ID’s Creative Reality™ AI platform to produce lifelike digital humans. Eight instructional designers evaluated the videos’ design quality, storyline appeal, character involvement, and persuasive integration using a questionnaire adapted from the PEMAT tool, supplemented by qualitative field notes.\nParticipants evaluated the videos positively across all four E-E domains, highlighting their high production quality, relatable characters, clear narratives, and subtle integration of the prosocial message. Minor concerns included occasional background distractions.\nThe validated videos represent a scalable and engaging approach to challenging social stereotypes about facial differences.

          "abstract": "Contemporary research on language and communication has expanded beyond its traditional focus on spoken and written forms to encompass signing, gestures, facial expressions, and other bodily actions. This shift has been accompanied by methodological advancements that extend beyond classical tools such as tape recorders or video cameras and include motion-tracking systems, depth cameras, and multimodal data fusion techniques. While these tools enable richer empirical insights, they also introduce significant conceptual and practical challenges, particularly for researchers new to multimodal data collection. This paper presents a structured, decision-oriented workflow for multimodal data collection in language and communication research. We introduce a flexible framework that guides researchers through key methodological choices, including the alignment of research questions with data streams, study design and acquisition strategies, synchronization and technical requirements, ethical governance, and data management, dissemination, and reuse. The framework is illustrated with case studies spanning controlled laboratory experiments, large-scale annotated sign language corpora, and field-based research, including non-human primates. Rather than advocating a one-size-fits-all approach, our discussion emphasizes key decision points, trade-offs and real-world examples to help researchers navigate the complexities of multimodal data collection. By integrating perspectives from different disciplines, our flexible decision-making framework is intended as a practical tool for researchers seeking to design, implement and to address common conceptual and methodological challenges in the rapidly developing area of multimodal data collection.",

          "abstract": "Multivariate time series models are commonly used in psychology to investigate person-specific associations between multiple variables. They are often represented and interpreted as dynamic network models, where features such as the centrality of nodes can potentially guide treatment selection and outcome prediction. Researchers typically rely on point estimates of specific network features while ignoring estimation uncertainty, which can lead to wrong inferences and over-optimistic claims.  We introduce a one-step Bayesian approach for estimating multilevel vector autoregressive models (BmlVAR), which enables uncertainty quantification for person-specific network features and the regression of external outcomes on such features. In a preregistered simulation study, we compare the new model with several popular methods for network estimation. We also apply all methods to empirical data to highlight their differences. Our simulation results indicate that all methods perform mediocrely in estimating different centrality measures in practically relevant settings. BmlVAR still outperforms the other methods in many simulation conditions, especially regarding the statistical power to detect associations with an outcome. However, estimating the model properly can be challenging with limited data. Overall, all methods require a lot of data or very large effects to produce reasonably accurate results. Thus, although centrality measures based on dynamic networks have been widely used, our simulation study suggests they are unlikely to work well for achieving major goals of interest, such as guiding treatment selection and outcome prediction. We provide a new model that incorporates estimation uncertainty into the modelling process, thereby protecting against premature conclusions.",

However, the sensitivity of these tasks is severely limited due to strong horizontal biases, usually to the left (at least in speakers of languages written left-to-right), ranging from ~65% up to ~90% preference to one side in the absence of other differences. Schütz 2014 extended this finding to non-horizontal stimulus arrangements, showing a bias towards ~110° upwards eye movements. Here, we replicate these findings and discuss their implications for experimental design in choice tasks. In an eye-tracking study (N=23), we (1) replicate the left-right bias in speakers of German with a ~80% left-preference, (2) replicate the vertical bias with an ~80% top-preference, and (3) find a specific diagonal placement of the stimuli in which these biases cancel out such that there is overall no spatial bias at all. This stimulus arrangement improves the dynamic range, and statistical power, when studying attentional effects. Based on a Bradley-Terry logistic regression simulation, we could gain small (~5%, at ~65% bias) to decent (~30%, at ~80% bias) to large (~300% at ~90% bias) power improvements, simply by changing the spatial arrangement of the two stimuli",

          "authors": "Antonio Vázquez-Millán; Pablo Martínez-López; María Rueda Romero; José Juan León; David Luque",
          "abstract": "Habits are stimulus-driven responses that are produced independently of the current outcome value. They enable efficient actions in familiar contexts while freeing up cognitive resources. Habits are expected to influence behavior after substantial experience, whereas limited training leaves behavior under goal-directed control. This transition from goal-directed to habitual control is well-documented in animal research but remains challenging to replicate in humans. Using a free-operant task, recent studies have suggested that human habits can be fully learned even after short training. This would produce a ceiling effect, explaining null results when the amount of training is manipulated. Here, we propose an alternative explanation: the devaluation protocol was ineffective for a subset of participants who appeared ‘habitual’. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pre-registered conceptual replication of the free-operant task with improved devaluation. As in previous research, we found no difference in habitual responses between short and extended training. In contrast to prior reports, most participants were sensitive to outcome devaluation. Habitual responding was strongly correlated with the effectiveness of the outcome devaluation protocol; habit-like responses were mostly produced by the few participants for whom the devaluation did not work. We further supported our hypothesis by reanalyzing previous datasets, finding that, across all studies, participants who showed more habit-like responses were those for whom the devaluation was less effective. Taken together, our findings suggest that suboptimal outcome-devaluation protocols may have biased previous results, leading to habit-like goal-directed responses regardless of the amount of previous instrumental training.",

          "abstract": "ealth education frequently relies on brief public-facing descriptions of interventions, yet evidence on how specific message features influence engagement remains limited. We test whether public-facing message features—programme labelling (“mindfulness”) and statements regarding the uncertainty of health benefits—shape intentions to join mindfulness-based programmes (MBPs). An experimental design (N=669) manipulated the programme label (mindfulness vs generic well-being intervention) and the manner in which the likelihood of well-being benefits was communicated (exact percentage improvement vs range of potential effects). Participants expressed similar interest in participating in both programmes (p=.318, partial η2=.002). Participant ratings of the likelihood of participating in the programme were not impacted by the use of a range, which indicated the uncertainty of effects  (p=.788, partial η2&lt;.001). These findings suggest that the influence of intervention labelling and the uncertainty of well-being benefits may be limited or context-dependent on participant intentions. This study contributes to health education research by experimentally evaluating assumptions about branding and precision in well-being communication, and by indicating that transparent disclosure of uncertainty—at least in numerical form—can be implemented without detectable reductions in stated willingness to engage in well-being interventions.",

          "abstract": "Sustaining attention is critical for goal-directed behavior, yet individuals frequently experience lapses that compromise performance. Previous studies have suggested that reaction time (RT) slowing in sustained attention tasks may serve a protective role against lapses, while others interpret this same slowing as a marker of attentional disengagement. To address this contradiction, we tested whether slowing down causally reduces attentional errors using real-time behavioral feedback in go/no-go tasks. In Experiment 1 (N = 30), participants performed a Continuous Performance Task (CPT) consisting of three blocks: baseline, control, and feedback. In the feedback block, participants were instructed to slow down their responses whenever the fixation cross changed color, signaling in real time that their previous responses were too fast. Trial-level analyses revealed that slowing down after feedback significantly reduced the likelihood of attentional errors on subsequent trials, although no significant effects were found at the block level. Given substantial inter-individual variability, Experiment 2 (N = 60) added a cognitive battery alongside the CPT to explore potential correlates. Results showed a reduction in lapses in the feedback condition at the block-level, but no reliable associations were found between feedback benefits and individual differences in cognitive control, working memory, or long-term memory. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that RT slowing have a protective effect against sustained attention lapses in go/no-go tasks. Future research is needed to better characterize which individuals benefit most from this strategic slowing.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: Individual differences in literacy and numeracy – that is, how well one can read, write, and work with numbers – emerge early in childhood and are crucial indicators of later educational success. Twin and family studies revealed substantial heritability of literacy and numeracy, and genetic overlap between these domains. Yet, it is unclear whether measured genomic variation shows a similarly overlapping or domain-specific pattern, and whether such molecular signals also predict adults’ educational attainment.\nMethod: In N=15,669 participants (52.7% female; Netherlands Twin Register), we predicted children’s literacy, numeracy, and academic achievement, and adults’ educational attainment from genetic predispositions. Children’s learning outcomes were assessed via teacher and parent reports and a nationwide test (age M=12.25 years). Adults reported their highest educational qualification (age M= 42.47 years). We derived polygenic scores (PGSs) for years of education, dyslexia, and reading skills to predict these outcomes. \nResults: All three PGSs significantly predicted educational outcomes, but the broad years-of-education PGS exceeded the domain-specific dyslexia and reading-skills PGSs. The years-of-education PGS explained up to 10.7% in children’s academic achievement and 13.2% in adults’ attainment, suggesting that broader, large-scale PGS of general education capture much of the genetic signal shared across learning domains.\nConclusion: Findings indicate both shared and specific genetic influences on learning. Broad, high-power PGSs maximise prediction, whereas literacy-focused PGSs highlight domain-specific signal. While current PGSs are not suitable for individual prediction, they are valuable for accounting for genetic propensities and improving causal inference in developmental and education research.",

Analyses showed that people differ in their TBRE across time, suggesting a trait-like disposition, which covaried with their Preference for Fluency. Notably, many participants showed stable TBREs that were small or close to zero, whereas relatively few showed large TBREs. We found no evidence for negative TBREs whereby repetition meaningfully decreases believability. The results highlight the value of multiple assessments and challenge the idea of a universal TBRE; repetition increases the believability of information – but not for everyone, and more so for some than others.",

          "abstract": "We investigated whether vehicle sound power affects pedestrians’ street-crossing decisions. In a virtual environment, we presented high-fidelity interactive acoustic and visual simulations of a vehicle approaching a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk, in an auditory-only and an audiovisual modality condition. The vehicle was presented for several seconds and then disappeared from the display and was no longer audible (hereafter referred to as “occlusion“). Participants judged whether, at the moment of occlusion, they could have safely started crossing the street the street while the vehicle was approaching (i.e., accepted the gap), or whether they had to wait until the vehicle passed them. Using an adaptive psychophysical procedure, we measured psychometric functions mapping the relationship between the arrival time of the vehicle at the moment of occlusion and the probability of a gap-acceptance decision, and introduce a novel measure of the riskiness of the individual crossing decisions. The results showed that participants accepted shorter gaps and made riskier crossing decisions when the vehicle sound power was lower compared to higher. This effect of sound power occurred in both modality conditions, though it was stronger when only auditory information was available. Reverse-correlation analyses of the trial-by-trial data showed that the vehicle sound intensity at the pedestrian’s position was the most important predictor of the decisions in the auditory-only condition, but that participants did not base their decision exclusively on the sound intensity. In the audiovisual condition, sound intensity also was significantly associated with the crossing decision, but visual cues dominated. Implications for road traffic safety are discussed, specifically concerning interactions between pedestrians and quieter electric vehicles.",

We tested whether early life harshness and unpredictability are differentially associated with risk and ambiguity preferences. In two preregistered online studies, we recruited British adults (Study 1: N = 534; Study 2: N = 521) who completed a wheel-of-fortune task manipulating risk and ambiguity; Study 2 additionally included self-report measures of risk and ambiguity preferences. We pooled the wheel-of-fortune data across studies, estimated individual risk-taking and ambiguity-aversion using computational modelling and complemented these model-based analyses with model-free mixed-effects models. Neither harshness nor unpredictability were reliably associated with risk taking. Early unpredictability, but not harshness, was associated with reduced ambiguity aversion. Using self-report measures instead, unpredictability was associated with increased ambiguity aversion, as was harshness. These findings suggest that childhood unpredictability, more than harshness, is related to how people approach uncertainty as adults, but the direction of this association depends on how uncertainty is measured. By clarifying how distinct dimensions of early life adversity shape responses to uncertainty, our study can inform preventive efforts targeting harmful decision-making.",

However, much less attention has been given to the relationship between socio-economic conditions and personality traits. To address this gap, we conducted a cross-classified meta-analysis of 141 effect sizes from 84 independent studies, examining the relationship between socio-economic conditions and Big Five personality traits. We relied on two types of measures: parental socio-economic status at the individual level, and regional or national indicators, such as GDP per capita, at the aggregate level.  Building on a behavioral-ecological framework informed by life history theory, which treats socio-economic conditions as ecological inputs involved in the calibration of psychological traits, we hypothesized that people living in resource-rich ecologies would score higher on Big Five personality traits (extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability). Consistent with these predictions, more favorable socio-economic conditions during childhood predicted greater extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and emotional stability at the individual level, as well as higher extraversion and emotional stability at the aggregate level. Although the underlying evidence is correlational, the observed pattern of associations is consistent with the hypothesis that resource availability plays a systematic role in the calibration of personality traits.",

In this exploratory study, we investigated reporting practices, open science practices, and trustworthiness of simulation studies in psychology. 221 researchers (response rate = 35.1%) completed a questionnaire about one simulation-based article they authored in 2023 or 2024. Authors reported at least some selective reporting of conditions, methods, and performance measures in 50.2% of the articles. Reporting of nonconvergence and Monte Carlo Standard Errors was uncommon, likely due to limited awareness and weakly established norms. Only 19% of articles were neutral (i.e., authors did not develop evaluated methods), but selective reporting was not lower in these studies. Over 75% of authors reported sharing their complete code, but important measures for reproducibility like providing code instruction (39.6%) and independent code checking (20.3%) were uncommon. Guidelines were not used because researchers were unaware of them, perceived them as unnecessary, or considered them uncommon in their field. Authors estimated the probability that conclusions of a typical simulation study are trustworthy to be .74, exceeding estimates for computational reproducibility (.64) and complete reporting (.55). Because our findings are based on self-report and are more favorable than prior literature reviews, prevalence estimates may be optimistic. As responsible reporting standards and code-sharing in simulation studies were not standard, we recommend journals to endorse reporting standards such as ADEMP (Morris et al., 2019), use standardized repositories and workflows for sharing materials, and check for availability of code.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Evidence suggests that dissociation may play a role in the manifestation of functional neurological disorder (FND). Dissociative experiences are frequently reported in FND, yet their dynamic associations with affective and physiological states remain underexplored. This study aimed to examine dissociative symptoms in daily life in FND, to identify predictors of dissociation using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) combined with wearable heart-rate monitoring.\nMethods: Seventeen individuals with FND (functional seizures/motor symptoms) and seventeen age- and gender-matched healthy controls completed EMA via pseudorandom smartphone prompts eight times daily for one week. Dissociation (depersonalisation, derealisation, amnesia), negative affect, and subjective arousal were assessed using items modified from validated scales, while heart-rate was continuously recorded via Fitbit devices. Data were aggregated at week-level for between-group comparisons and analysed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Multilevel modelling was conducted to examine momentary associations between predictors (negative affect, subjective arousal, heart-rate) and dissociative symptoms within the FND group. Time-lagged analyses explored temporal relationships between the predictors and dissociative symptoms.\nResults: The FND group reported significantly higher dissociative symptoms across the week compared to controls: amnesia (U=63, p=0.004), depersonalisation (U=63.5, p=0.004), and derealisation (U=84, p=0.034). Effect sizes were moderate-large for amnesia and depersonalisation (r=0.56), and small-moderate for derealisation (r=0.42). Negative affect (p-values=&lt;0.001, β=0.094-0.111), subjective arousal (p-values=&lt;0.001, β=0.102-0.124), and heart-rate (p-values=0.01-0.006, β= 0.078-0.091) were each significant concurrent predictors of all three dissociative symptom types. In combined models, negative affect and subjective arousal remained robust predictors across all symptom domains, whereas heart-rate lost significance. Time-lagged analyses did not yield significant associations.\nConclusion: Individuals with FND report elevated dissociative symptoms compared to healthy controls. Dissociation was consistently associated with subjective arousal and negative affect, but not heart-rate, underscoring the importance of subjective emotional states over physiological influences on dissociative symptom variability. The absence of temporal effects highlights the transient nature of dissociation in FND. These findings support conceptualising FND through a dissociative lens and emphasise the need for larger longitudinal studies to clarify mechanisms and inform tailored interventions.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) has long been viewed as a store that must be engaged to maintain task-relevant information. Yet growing evidence shows that the brain often avoids activating WM, relying instead on perception or long-term memory (LTM). What determines whether and when WM is engaged? Rather than assuming obligatory maintenance, this review documents systematic patterns of WM avoidance and reactivation across perceptual, mnemonic, and control domains. I propose that these patterns reflect a tradeoff between metabolic and cognitive costs and behavioral flexibility. When perception or LTM can support behavior with low effort and stable content–context bindings, WM is bypassed through external or internal offloading. WM engagement emerges when behavior requires verifying or updating the match between memory content and the current context. From this perspective, WM activation is not the default state but a strategic investment: recruited only when low-cost perceptual or LTM reliance cannot guarantee correct content–context binding. Integrating behavioral, electrophysiological, and computational approaches, this framework unifies disparate findings under a single principle: WM engagement reflects a conditional control policy governing not only what is stored, but when active maintenance is recruited.",

Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have emerged as promising tools to modulate somatosensory cortical excitability and plasticity, thereby enhancing tactile perceptual learning.

While in experiment 1 we compared the online and offline training effects of tDCS to sham stimulation and tDCS effects without training, in experiment 2, we contrasted the effects of tDCS and tACS on tactile training and examined whether training effects could be predicted by baseline oscillatory brain activity as measured with electroencephalography. \nIn both experiments, participants improved their discrimination performance during training independent of group (experiment 1) or condition (experiment 2), even when controlling for pre-test thresholds. Irrespective of stimulation conditions (tDCS, tACS, sham), training effects could be predicted by baseline brain oscillatory patterns. Higher theta power and reduced lower beta power but not alpha power at baseline predicted stronger online training effects. Interestingly, in experiment 2, participants revealed lower GOT thresholds during training in the tDCS than in the tACS condition. One might speculate that tACS interferes with task-related alpha desynchronization during training. This option requires further testing in future experiments.",

Three studies evaluated global cognitive function in middle-aged adults. Two studies reported impairments in individuals with midlife obesity and a more rapid decline in those who were metabolically unhealthy. One study found no association. Long-term obesity was also linked to poorer global cognition in midlife. Executive functions appeared to be impacted by obesity. Research on memory was mixed, as two studies found a negative association with obesity, while two found no association. Methodological weaknesses included imprecise exposure measurements and inadequate adjustment for confounding factors.\nConclusions\nDespite evidence that obesity may increase the risk of cognitive impairment in midlife, evidence from a very limited number of studies is inconsistent, and an independent association remains unconfirmed.

          "abstract": "University students often exhibit high levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) and low levels of physical activity (PA). Previous efforts to increase students’ movement have focused on leisure-time PA or overlooked the university environment and the education system. Embedding PA into university education offers one potentially fruitful avenue for increasing student movement, yet understanding is needed of how and why the university education system influences students’ movement before effective interventions can be developed. This study used a novel behavioural systems mapping method to explore the behaviours, actors, and influences affecting students’ PA and SB during university education. The aim of the study was to develop a preliminary behavioural systems map based on a combined dataset of interviews with 20 university students and 38 staff in a variety of roles. Data were qualitatively analysed to construct a map of the perceived actors, behaviours, and influences affecting students’ movement behaviours, as well as causal links between them. Influences were further analysed using the capability, opportunity, and motivation model of behaviour (COM-B). The resulting map would need further data input and corroboration to be considered a comprehensive map, yet the results presented in this study provide a useful starting point in this regard. Thirty-one different behaviours across three areas were identified: student movement in classes (or contact teaching time), student movement in private study time, and wider system influences and behaviours. The map had over 100 elements and connections in total, demonstrating the system complexity as described by participants. A key influential behaviour was policy makers prioritising student movement in decision making, suggesting policy-level change is essential for long-term impact. Many barriers were related to physical or social opportunities, suggesting environmental restructuring may be key to embedding PA into university education.

While policy-level change is needed to catalyse some of the environmental changes needed, opportunities may exist to support students to increase movement during private study time, where fewer barriers were identified.",

          "abstract": "The Self-Objectification Beliefs and Behaviors Scale (SOBBS) was adapted to the Czech context using multiple independent translations and subsequent cognitive interviews. A pilot analysis of a secondary dataset (N = 959) evaluated using Dynamic Fit Indices (DFI) indicated a suboptimal fit for the original structure (χ²(76) = 569.253, CFI = .903, RMSEA = .083, SRMR = .065) and a lack of scalar invariance. Subsequently, data for the main study were collected from a non-random online sample of 548 participants, including 72% women and 27% men, aged 18–75 years (M = 25.8, SD = 10.1). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicated unsatisfactory fit of the original model (χ²(76) = 292.76, CFI = .930, RMSEA = .072, SRMR = .054, BIC = 18321). However, a modified model excluding Item 2 (related to clothing choices) satisfied the dynamic fit criteria (χ²(64) = 210.40, CFI = .948, RMSEA = .065, SRMR = .053, BIC = 16825). These results support SOBBS’ two-factor structure (i.e., body self-monitoring and body as a representation of the Self). The modified SOBBS (13 items) demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .87, ω = .90 for the total scale; α = .87, ω = .87 for body self-monitoring; and α = .83, ω = .83 for body as a representation of the Self), and correlations with body shame and body self-monitoring scales provided evidence for concurrent validity. In contrast to the pilot study, measurement invariance of the modified model in the main study was supported at the level of the scalar model (i.e., with constrained factor loadings and intercepts), allowing for gender-based comparisons. The main analysis revealed a statistically significant but small difference in overall self-objectification between women and men (d = 0.22). An exploratory analysis showed a higher body surveillance in women (d = 0.48), with no significant differences in the body as a self-representation dimension. The results provide evidence supporting the construct validity and reliability of the modified Czech version of the SOBBS. The scale may serve as a useful tool for further research on self-objectification in the Czech context. We conclude with suggestions for future research, mainly wording revisions and clarifications for the conceptual placement of body shame within the Objectification Theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997).",

          "authors": "Mikel Jimenez; Christian Andrade; José Antonio Hinojosa; Pedro R. Montoro; Antonio Prieto",
          "abstract": "One of the central debates in experimental psychology concerns the extent to which information outside conscious awareness can influence behavior. This study aims to assess whether two novel approaches to unconscious perception, a regression-based Bayesian generative model and Sensitivity vs. Awareness curves derived from General Recognition Theory (GRT), produce convergent results when examining the visual processing of briefly presented masked stimuli. While both investigate “unconscious processing,” they differ not only in how they define “unconscious” (chance-level discrimination vs. absence of subjective awareness) and “processing” (priming vs. detection), but also in their underlying mathematical frameworks. To investigate this, we examined the grouping of local elements into global shapes using two prime-mask stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA): a shorter baseline SOA of 40 ms (Experiment 1) and a longer SOA of 67 ms (Experiment 2). Both methods provided evidence for the unconscious processing of the primes’ global shape in Experiment 2. However, while GRT analyses also supported unconscious processing at the shorter 40 ms SOA, the Bayesian generative models produced strong evidence against it. We show that discrepancies between the regression-based and GRT-based approaches may arise not only from their operational definitions, but also their underlying mathematical frameworks and validity. Preliminary SvA simulations indicate limited robustness of the GRT-based model, warranting caution prior to further validation. More broadly, while both approaches offer refined tools for studying unconscious perception, persistent methodological challenges remain, underscoring the need for clearer definitions of unconscious processing, converging measures of awareness, and more thorough analyses of method validity.",

The CRRQ was developed and validated across three studies in Polish and UK samples (N = 849). In the Preliminary Study, individuals described real-life situations in which people might cry in the presence of their partners. Based on their answers, we created an initial item pool. Study 1 examined the psychometric properties of the pool, revealing that the CRRQ comprises five factors, each representing a different type of crying: relationship discomfort, relationship comfort, other-oriented concern, emotion regulation, and manipulation. The results also supported the scale’s reliability and validity. Study 2 provided further evidence for the five-dimensional structure of the CRRQ and its good psychometric properties. Overall, the results indicate that the CRRQ is a reliable and valid measure of five distinct types of crying in romantic relationships.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is determining whether observers have a conscious experience of a stimulus. However, present/absent detection judgments are often biased by contextual factors, making it difficult to isolate conscious perception from non-perceptual influences. Traditional psychophysical methods struggle to disentangle these components. To address this, we conducted in-person experiments (N=505) in which participants detected and reproduced dim and absent stimuli under three contextual manipulations: attentional cues, asymmetrical base rates, and payoff schemes. Using a reproduction task together with a Hurdle-Gaussian model, we quantitively decomposed reproduction responses into a perceptual continuous contrast component and a non-perceptual “hurdle” component. We found that statistical priors (base rate) and reward structures (payoff) induced non-perceptual shifts in the reproduction hurdle, whereas attentional cues selectively shifted the continuous contrast component, consistent with changes in conscious experience. Critically, comparing conditions with and without intermixed detection trials revealed that the presence of a detection task contaminates reproduction reports with non-perceptual criterion effects. This highlights the need for caution in using and interpreting results that rely on detection judgements, even when combined with subjective measures like reproduction, especially given the central role that detection tasks play in consciousness research.",

          "authors": "Bojan Evkoski; Srebrenka Letina; Petra Kralj Novak",
          "abstract": "Studying mental health at scale requires perspectives that extend beyond traditional clinical and research settings. Increasingly, people turn to social media platforms like Reddit to make sense of their distress, seek support, and explore alternative ways of understanding mental health outside institutional frameworks. This study maps the landscape of mental health discourse on Reddit by constructing a data-driven network of associations between mental disorders and comparing it with the network based on diagnostic criteria. We manually curated 114 Reddit communities focused on specific mental health conditions from the 20,000 most active subreddits in 2022. Each community was labeled into 49 disorders and categorized under nine ICD-10 diagnostic categories belonging to the group of mental and behavioral disorders (“F” codes). We constructed a disorder association network by identifying statistically significant user overlaps across subreddit pairs using a bipartite configuration model, with Bonferroni-corrected significance (p &lt; 0.001). Edges represent either positive or negative associations based on observed versus expected user overlap. We analyzed the connectedness of the network within and across diagnostic categories and compared the emergent Reddit-based hierarchy of disorder associations with the formal structure encoded in ICD-10 using hierarchical clustering and tree similarity metrics. The inferred Reddit network of psychopathology revealed a densely interconnected structure, with all but six disorders forming a single giant component spanning diagnostic categories. The most prominent disorders by user volume included ADHD, depression, habit and impulse disorders, autism, and generalized anxiety. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited the highest connectivity by number of associations, while schizotypal disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and agoraphobia ranked highest in weighted degree. Bipolar disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) displayed high inter-category associations but weak in-category ties, indicating complex diagnostic boundaries. The network of negative associations further revealed divergences from past expectations; for instance, addiction-related communities (e.g., alcohol and opioids) were negatively associated with much of the broader mental health discourse. Finally, hierarchical comparisons showed moderate overlap between Reddit-derived associations and ICD-10 diagnostic structures, both in pairwise edge similarity (Jaccard = 0.07) and overall clustering (ARI = 0.307, NMI = 0.706). Overall, Reddit-based mental health communities reveal a complementary structure of disorder associations shaped by lived experience, often diverging from formal diagnostic criteria and highlighting overlooked or cross-cutting patterns of comorbidity.",

The present study advances the field by using objective, naturalistic data to differentiate active from passive phone use and test within-person associations with adolescents’ morning affect and sleep. We applied multilevel models to 3,192 daily observations from 40 adolescents (ages 15–20; 65% male) collected over a 90-day period using the Effortless Assessment Research System. Results showed that higher-than-usual morning negative affect predicted greater passive use the same day, whereas morning positive affect did not predict active or passive use. In contrast, neither the amount of active nor amount of passive use predicted subsequent sleep outcomes or next-day affect. These findings suggest that adolescents’ morning negative affect may shape how they engage with their phones, while fears about downstream effects of phone use on sleep and affects may be overstated.",

          "abstract": "Cross-cultural research led by Ozaki et al. (2024) has revealed that songs exhibit higher pitch, lower tempo, and more stable pitches than speech. However, this research relied on solo recordings, while most singing and speaking occurs in group contexts. The present study examined the acoustic features of speech and songs among Mandarin speakers in group settings. We addressed two questions: 1 [confirmatory]) Do singing and conversation in group contexts show similar acoustic patterns to those reported by Ozaki et al. (2024)? 2 [exploratory]) Does musicianship influence the acoustic differences between speech and song? Three groups of native Mandarin speakers (n = 20) in Auckland participated in the singing and conversation tasks (both of which involved taking turns alternating singing/speaking). We analyzed three acoustic features (pitch height, temporal rate, pitch stability) to test the confirmatory question and examined correlations between musicianship and effect sizes for the exploratory question. Our confirmatory analyses replicated and extended the findings of Ozaki et al. (2024), showing that singing exhibited significantly higher pitch (D = 1.21), slower tempo (D = 2.07), and more stable pitch (D = 0.57) than conversation among Mandarin speakers. Exploratory results suggested a trend whereby individuals with higher musicianship tended to produce greater acoustic differentiation between speech and song; additional data are needed to confirm this effect. In future work, our team will integrate data from up to 26 languages/sites included in the Stage 1 Programmatic Registered Report protocol and conduct meta-analyses to provide more comprehensive estimates of cross-cultural relationships between speech and song.",

We investigate whether people adaptively select decision strategies following an optimal bias-variance trade-off: decision strategies that integrate (imperfect) estimates of many uncertain attributes may be unbiased but suffer from high variance, so simpler (biased) decision strategies can be more accurate when uncertainty is high. Using a new multi-attribute choice task, in which we manipulate uncertainty by varying the reliability of the estimates of different attributes across conditions, we provide an empirical demonstration that people indeed adaptively shift their decision strategies in response to environmental uncertainty: participants were more likely to use single-attribute decision-making under high uncertainty and to integrate all attributes under low uncertainty. These findings provide evidence that the bias-variance trade-off is a key principle shaping human strategy selection.",

          "abstract": "Human adults show a number bias in magnitude perception, weighting numerical information more heavily than continuous magnitudes like area. However, developmental research suggests this bias is not innate: young children show an area bias that reverses to a number bias only later in development. What drives this shift? Here, we use deep neural networks to test whether learning to count is sufficient to create number-biased representations. We trained ResNeXt-50 networks on a counting task (predicting the number of dots in an image) and measured representational biases using linear decoding of number versus cumulative area from network features. Untrained networks showed a robust area bias, with area more decodable than number, reflecting an architectural prior that does not privilege discrete quantity. Networks trained on ImageNet classification retained this area bias, indicating that generic visual experience is insufficient to create number-biased representations. Self-supervised models trained on naturalistic visual input showed no bias in either direction. Critically, networks trained on counting showed a dramatic reversal: number became far more decodable than area, producing a strong number bias. This bias reversed immediately after only one epoch of training. Principal component analysis revealed that counting training completely reorganized representational geometry: numerosity became the dominant axis of variation (r² = 0.95) while area was fully suppressed (r² = 0.00). These findings provide a computational proof-of-concept that learning to count can transform magnitude representations, offering a mechanistic account of how symbolic number acquisition may drive the development of number-biased cognition.",

          "abstract": "The focal article “I-O Psychology and Labor: Benign Neglect, Antipathy and Missed Opportunities” by Lefkowitz and colleagues (2026) argues that I-O psychologists should consider working more closely with organized labor. The authors offer many reasons to support this consideration. In this article, we highlight an additional reason, which is that organized labor can play an important role in preventing the collapse of human employment to automation, in highly vulnerable industries. We explicitly model the influence of organized labor on variables of AI integration, human employment, and collective bargaining strength using a system dynamics approach. From this analysis and the assumptions we make, we agree with Lefkowitz et al.’s proposed greater collaboration with labor. We find that labor unions can prevent labor displacement in the face of AI advances, but only before a tipping point occurs (highlighting the need for I-O facilitation). In contrast to Lefkowitz et al.’s suggestions, that I-O psychologists should support reskilling, we find that reskilling merely delays the onset of labor displacement. Unless AI or other external forces create more jobs than AI displaces, eventually those reskilled jobs will eventually be fully displaced as well. Therefore, we argue that there is a time pressure for I-O psychologists to collaborate with labor unions to create contractual anti-automation clauses, and the pushing for automation hastens reaching the point of no return before alternative accommodations (e.g., Universal Basic Income, Revenue sharing) can be secured.",

Participants play 100 trials with variable extinction risks of 2.5%, 5%, and 10%. If a participant draws the extinction outcome, they lose all accumulated bonus payment and are precluded from further earnings. Participants can reduce extinction risk by investing earnings: for every £0.02 invested, the extinction risk in the current trial is halved. We use dynamic programming to derive the optimal investment decision for each choice and compare it with participants' investments. Our results show that participants overinvest in reducing small risks, underinvest in reducing larger risks, and fail to adjust their investment appropriately across trials, leading them to go extinct at a higher rate compared to the optimal strategy.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is often a stressful developmental period, and adolescents are more vulnerable to lasting effects of heightened stress than children or adults. Spending time outside and in nature is a promising strategy for reducing stress. Yet, when stressed, adolescents are prone to withdraw from health-promoting behaviors, like engaging in outdoor activity. It is unknown how these phenomena are in tension during adolescence. To address this question, we used random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling (RI-CLPM) to examine the reciprocal effects of changes in outdoor activity and stress among young adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study across 7 waves from May 2020–May 2021, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of heightened and continued stress. We find that stress and outdoor activity fluctuated over the year, exhibiting relative stability early on, but peaking and dipping (respectively) during December 2020. We demonstrate that youth who reported lower stress tended to engage in outdoor activity more frequently. Furthermore, we find that when an adolescent experienced increased stress in fall 2020, they subsequently engaged in outdoor activity less frequently in winter 2020-2021. These dynamics did not differ according to the perceived safety of an adolescent’s neighborhood or whether they returned to in-person schooling. These findings align with past research suggesting stress in adolescence can lead to withdrawal and avoidance, as well as declines in physical activity. We discuss the importance of reducing barriers to outdoor activity during periods of heightened stress, and the need to examine such processes at varying time scales.",

Across two distinct samples and methodologies (spontaneous streams of thought and daily video diaries) we used generative LLMs to score Big-Five personality traits, achieving convergence with self-report measures comparable to or exceeding established benchmarks (e.g., self-other agreement, ecological momentary assessment, bespoke machine-learning models). LLM-generated trait scores also demonstrated predictive validity regarding daily behaviors and mental health outcomes. This LLM-based approach achieved quantitative rigor based on qualitative data and is easily accessible without specialized training. Importantly, our findings also reaffirm the ubiquity of personality expression, in that it is carried in the stream our thoughts and is woven into the fabric of our daily lives. These results encourage broader adoption of generative LLMs for psychological assessment, and—given the new generation of tools—stress the value of idiographic narratives as reliable sources of psychological insight.",

          "abstract": "The study of natural social behaviour is a frontier discipline in psychology. Although such work is highly necessary for advancing and refining theories of social behaviour, social cognition, evolutionary psychology, relationships, and more, researchers rarely commit to such intensive research designs due to the anticipated effort involved. In particular, to understand social behaviour as it naturally unfolds, scientists must be able to collect and handle a high volume of rich social data efficiently, effectively, and reproducibly. Moreover, because social behaviour is highly individualistic and context dependent, it is critical to capture variation in people’s natural social behaviour across multiple interaction partners – i.e., in “round-robin” research designs. Significant issues can arise in the administration of such designs, disincentivizing the collection of naturalistic round-robin social data. Here, we provide a tutorial based on a recent study, with customizable resources designed to mitigate the inherent challenges associated with this type of research.

          "abstract": "Prior research offers compelling evidence for the social, personal, and societal benefits of intellectual humility (IH). This review shifts the focus to social perception by examining the emerging literature on perceived IH—how people judge others’ awareness of their intellectual limitations. We describe how perceived IH enhances social evaluations in everyday and expert contexts and identify conditions under which high IH may backfire. We then outline key directions for future research, including the roles of identity, authenticity, and culture, in shaping how IH is perceived and socially rewarded.",

          "abstract": "Less-is-more describes a principle underlying decision making. Embodiment, on the other hand, argues that the body plays an important role in processes that have classically been characterized as mental. We argue that decision making is facilitated by reducing the amount of mental computation (less-is-more) through the exploitation of the constant stream of rich sensorimotor information (embodiment), a concept we call LIME. LIME argues that, via embodiment, computation is ‘constrained’ by and ‘off-loaded’ into the body. Constraining involves the body reducing the input or generated options before they enter into mental computation. Off-loading involves the body or the environment performing the computation. LIME underlies cognition generally, but is most accessibly demonstrated in sport phenomena, and we use this domain to sketch out the breadth of this concept in four case studies. LIME connects first principles of cognition to real life phenomena, providing a mechanics to ecological rationality and naturalistic behavior.",

          "abstract": "Time spent playing video games (playtime) is not strongly correlated with wellbeing. However, quantitative studies often overlook ‘third variables’ that confound this relationship—risking masked true effects or spurious associations. In this mixed-methods study, we first conducted a qualitative template analysis of 987 responses from 393 adult players, then quantitatively assessed whether the identified candidates covary with changes in playtime and wellbeing. Study 1 results show that players interpret 17 factors—spanning physical health, grief and domestic disruptions, work/school pressures, social relationships, and other leisure—as influencing their gaming and wellbeing. In Study 2, within-person models of logged Xbox playtime and wellbeing scores provided initial evidence that at least three factors—social strain, work-related stress, and lethargic illnesses—systematically relate to both gaming and wellbeing. Together, these studies demonstrate a method for mapping confounders, provide preliminary support for several potential con- founds, and illustrate how directly addressing confounds can move the field beyond surface correlations, providing a stronger basis for uncovering the true causal pathways linking gaming and wellbeing.",

Integrating data across six studies from multiple international surveys (N=63,403; 20 countries), expert-coded party systems (71 countries; 14 datasets), and longitudinal panel studies, we demonstrate that individuals with stronger authoritarian orientations are consistently more prone to conspiracism across diverse cultures, political contexts, and time. These results remain robust when controlling for populist attitudes and multiple political, psychological, and demographic variables. The link between authoritarianism and conspiracism appears to constitute a durable and generalizable psychological disposition. This may help explain why conspiratorial narratives and authoritarian politics so often co-occur, with important implications for democratic resilience in an era of rising institutional distrust, anti-scientific attitudes, misinformation, and post-truth politics.",

          "abstract": "The popularity of true crime media has increased in recent years, raising concerns about how offenders and victims are portrayed and how these portrayals shape public attitudes toward crime, justice, and violence. Existing research suggests that true crime narratives often glamourise offenders while marginalising victims, yet little is known about how audiences themselves interpret and negotiate these representations. The present study qualitatively explored individuals’ motivations for consuming true crime media and their perceptions of offender and victim portrayals. Ten adults from the general population participated in semi-structured interviews. Using thematic analysis, three themes were generated: Glamourised Offender vs. Peripheral Victim, Understanding Offenders and their Contradictoriness, and Real Entertainment vs. Educational Truth. Participants described a consistent imbalance in which offenders were centred while victim stories were secondary or underdeveloped. Although participants valued understanding the psychological motivations underlying offenders’ behaviour, they emphasised the importance of avoiding excusatory narratives. Participants also discussed the tension between entertainment and education, voicing concern over sensationalism, misinformation, and the ethical implications of profiting from real-world harm. These findings highlight the complex ways audiences engage with true crime media and underscore the need for more ethical, victim-centred, and balanced portrayals that avoid glamourising violence or retraumatising those affected.",

          "abstract": "Theories of language acquisition generally fall into one of two camps. On one side, there are domain-general constructivist theories which argue that children break into language with little more than a capacity to learn, an interest in others, and some knowledge of the world. On the other side, there are domain-specific nativist theories which propose that children come equipped with rich innate knowledge of syntax, semantics, and principles constraining the mapping between them. In this paper, we sketch out an alternative: a theory that roots language acquisition in rich, abstract conceptual structures (akin to the semantic structures of linguistic theories) but posits that syntax arises from domain-general learning abilities and the belief that the communicative signals of others convey thoughts which are structured like our own. On this hypothesis, both the learning abilities that drive syntax acquisition and the conceptual structures themselves are available to prelinguistic infants and evolved prior to the emergence of external language. The critical evolutionary step was the insight that motivates children to link conceptual structures to patterned external signals. We describe how this theory builds on empirical insights from language acquisition, developmental psychology, linguistic typology, computational linguistics, and learning theories. Finally, we attempt to translate between Conceptual Nativism and other theoretical perspectives, delineating where the theories differ in their core commitments from where they differ solely in their framing, terminology and emphasis.",

          "abstract": "Sibilant fricatives have historically been considered fundamentally static speech sounds, characterized by clear articulatory and acoustic steady states. Recent work has called this idea into question, though, reporting differences in the articulatory and/or acoustic dynamics of sibilants across different sibilant sounds, languages, social groups, and phonological contexts. These results suggest that dynamics may be learned aspects of the production of sibilants, analagously as in vowels (including many monophthongs). However, previous studies differ methodologically in important ways, which may mean that at least part of the observed variation is driven by extraneous variables. A typological study where a consistent set of controls allows for direct comparison across a large number of languages and speakers is thus needed. In this paper, we examine the acoustic dynamics of /s/, the most common sibilant cross-linguistically, across 32 languages and more than 4,600 speakers using large read speech corpora. We find qualitative differences in the patterns of cross-linguistic and inter-speaker variation: whereas languages exhibit considerable variation in dynamics---particularly in the timing of the maximum of spectral center of gravity trajectories---most of the variation between speakers is instead in the overall height of the trajectory (i.e., in statics). We interpret this as evidence that sibilant dynamics are indeed learned, and discuss potential sources of the observed cross-linguistic differences.",

          "abstract": "Health is not merely a passive read‑out of biology but an active, ongoing prediction made by the brain. Here, we formalize this intuition within the Embodied Models of Health (EMH) framework, which integrates three well-established yet often disconnected forces—beliefs, expectations and attention—into a unified attention‑weighted Bayesian update. In this model, context-evoked mindsets serve as priors over latent health states, while an attention parameter modulates the extent to which incoming sensory information updates those priors. The resulting posterior belief then loops back to physiology through autonomic, endocrine, immune and behavioral pathways, capturing placebo, nocebo and stress phenomena within one tractable equation. We validate the EMH framework through three complementary studies. (i) A controlled laboratory bruise-healing experiment, where participants received identical mild bruises under conditions manipulating perceived elapsed time (slow, normal, or fast desk timer). A causal‑forest analysis shows that the fast‑timer cue accelerates objective healing most among individuals who both expected to heal quickly and paid close attention to subtle changes—precisely the joint prior‑attention pathway predicted by EMH. (ii) A large-scale “synergistic mindsets” field trial ($N \\approx 2,500$ students), where re‑estimating the original data with a parsimonious interaction model reveals that a 30‑minute lesson reframing intelligence and stress yields the greatest improvements in stress mindset and academic indicators for students who began with the strongest fixed‑ability beliefs. This finding illustrates how shifting priors alone can redirect downstream physiology and behavior at scale. \n(iii) An open-label placebo study, where participants received the same placebo rationale but differed in their pre-existing beliefs about placebo effectiveness. Consistent with EMH, the intervention reduced allergic responses in those with strong placebo beliefs but increased them among participants with especially low beliefs, illustrating how identical inputs can produce divergent physiological outcomes depending on prior expectations and attentional weighting.\nBecause each component of the EMH framework is measurable and manipulable, it offers a quantitative blueprint for precision mind‑body interventions that harness beneficial cognitive loops while disrupting harmful ones.",

          "authors": "MohammadHossein Manuel Haqiqatkhah; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically, these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates---off by many hours---with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these two issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on this same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the consequences of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

To understand how humans adaptively initiate planning, we developed a task where humans can learn to delay planning at certain timepoints when all actions are equally likely to reach an instructed goal. Across two pre-registered studies, we show that humans adaptively delay planning, and improve in their ability to do so with experience. To explain this behavior, we formalize a model of the underlying meta-control computations. Our model demonstrates how strategies to delay planning are not learned from experienced outcomes, but rather, from searching a cognitive map of the task to determine at which points it is more valuable to delay control. We thus establish that humans can adaptively delay planning, and learn to do so by means of a cognitive map.",

This study builds on the small but growing body of work addressing this gap by using a modified Delphi methodology to reach consensus among autistic women and academics/clinicians on the most relevant items from five measures of autistic traits: Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-50), Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ), Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI), Girls Questionnaire for Autism Spectrum Condition (GQ-ASC), and Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale-14 (RAADS-14), and to evaluate each measure’s suitability for autistic women in their current form.\n\nThirty-three autistic women and thirty-three academics/clinicians participated in the study. Each participant was asked to rate the relevance of individual items to the experiences of autistic women and to indicate whether each measure comprehensively captured experiences relevant to this group. Agreement on relevance was calculated separately for each group using the item-level content validity index (I-CVI) and the modified kappa statistic (k*), with scale-level content validity indices (S-CVI/Ave) derived for each measure.\n\nThe findings showed broad consistency in relevance evaluations between the two groups. The RAADS-14 was rated as the most relevant measure for assessing autistic traits in women, followed by the CATI, while the remaining questionnaires were associated with lower perceived relevance. However, none fully captured experiences relevant to autistic women, indicating construct underrepresentation that warrants further investigation. Items assessing masking were identified as valuable for inclusion to enhance the relevance of autism measures for women. In contrast, items related to attention to detail and imagination appeared less useful for assessing autism more broadly or for capturing subtler presentations of autistic traits, or may not be suitably phrased for autistic women. The most relevant items identified across the five measures can be considered valid across clinical, academic, and lived-experience contexts, providing a foundation for refining existing scales to better capture the experiences of individuals with subtler presentations of autistic traits.",

In recent years, studies investigated the cognitive mechanisms of VPT not only of other humans but also of artificial agents, such as robots. Thus far, researchers have primarily investigated interference tasks with regard to artificial agents (i.e., how the perspective of an agent interferes with one’s own perspective). In the present study, we investigated a task where VPT has a facilitatory effect (i.e., taking the perspective of an agent results in a performance boost) across four experiments, in which we varied the type of the avatar: a human (Exp. 1), a humanoid robot with a human-like head (Exp. 2), a humanoid robot with a camera-like head (Exp. 3), and a camera (Exp. 4). We found significant VPT effects for the human and robot avatar but failed to do so for the robot with a camera-like head and the camera. These findings suggest that participants adopted the perspective of avatars that are either human or resemble a human-like appearance. However, this is not the case for avatars which deviate from a human-appearance or which imply a social presence.",

Our analysis showed the main areas of focus for these studies were: (1) AI literacy and education, (2) toy design and development, and (3) user experience. We found little to no evidence on the impacts of GenAI toys on young children’s education, development, mental health, or privacy, demonstrating the need for urgent research in this rapidly developing area.

High prevalence rates are concerning because statistical literacy is integral to academic success, employability, and informed citizenship. Clarifying the nature of statistics anxiety is central to understanding it, yet it remains unclear whether statistics anxiety is genuinely distinct from mathematics anxiety or simply another manifestation of the same construct.\n\nAims: We examined the degree of overlap (jangle fallacy) between the Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS) and the Revised Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (R-MARS).\n\nSamples: Two cohorts of UK undergraduate psychology students participated: Study 1 (n = 489) and Study 2 (n = 245).\n\nMethods: Each study combined a cross-sectional survey with a between-participants experiment. Surveys included the STARS, R-MARS, parallel forms to control for scale content, and measures of trait and state anxiety. In the experiment, participants were randomly assigned to complete either a statistics or mathematics multiple-choice test, with state anxiety measured before and after.\n\nResults:\nResults pointed to overlap across all analyses and samples. Scales were highly correlated, items did not separate into distinct domains, individuals rarely reported one without the other, and state anxiety increased similarly across test types.\n\nConclusions:\nFindings show that statistics anxiety, as measured by the STARS, is not distinct from mathematics anxiety, as measured by the R-MARS. Recognising statistics anxiety as part of the broader mathematics anxiety construct can streamline measurement, clarify theory, and support more effective interventions for reducing quantitative anxieties in education.",

To study this question, we use an odd-one-out task in which 779 U.S.-based participants are shown images of naturalistic objects. We observe that accounting for individual differences even in this basic task leads to better models of human choices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these differences can be reliably measured and related to age and gender in 199 English-speaking participants. These results enhance our understanding of individual differences in mental representations and pave the way for personalized models of the world in social science and AI using realistic datasets.",

          "abstract": "Reduced visual attention to social stimuli in autism is often attributed to diminished social reward sensitivity. However, most evidence comes from research using positive content (e.g. smiling faces), making it unclear whether reduced social attention generalises to negative social scenes. If group differences persist when social stimuli are negative, this would challenge purely reward-based explanations. We tested whether autistic adults show reduced preferential attention to negative social stimuli. \nAutistic (n=30) and non-autistic (n=51) adults completed a preferential looking task in which negative social and non-social images were presented side-by-side while eye movements were recorded. Social images depicted humans in negative contexts (e.g., conflict), and non-social images depicted negative scenes without people (e.g., natural disasters, pollution). Each pair was shown intact and phase-scrambled (rendering social content unidentifiable). Social preference was defined as the proportion of gaze time on the social image. Mixed-effects models tested effects of Group, Stimulus Type (intact vs scrambled), and their interaction. Time-series examined how social preference evolved over time. \nNon-autistic adults allocated greater viewing time to intact negative social images than autistic adults, but groups did not differ for scrambled images, indicating effects depended on social content rather than low-level visual features. Time-series analysis showed group differences emerged late in viewing: both groups showed early bias towards social content that declined, but only non-autistic participants showed later increases in social preference. Autistic adults allocate less attention to negative social content, extending evidence for reduced preference beyond positive scenes and challenging explanations based solely on social reward sensitivity.",

          "abstract": "Back in 1961, Donald Hebb established a classic paradigm for studying repetition learning: He asked participants to remember several memory sets for an immediate serial recall task and repeated one set multiple times throughout the experiment. Participants’ ability to recall the repeated set improved gradually with repetitions, thereby demonstrating repetition learning. Explaining this effect has concerned researchers for decades, as it provides key insights into how we form durable memory representations through repeated exposure. In this review, we revisit the dominant views on the mechanisms underlying repetition learning, thereby challenging two central assumptions: The assumption that repetition learning is gradual, and the assumption that it is implicit. We show how these views have emerged from flawed analytical approaches, summarize recent evidence strongly contradicting these claims, and present a re-analysis of previously published data to illustrate how correcting implausible analytical assumptions leads to different theoretical conclusions. We propose an updated theoretical framework of the cognitive mechanisms underlying repetition learning in which we integrate elements from previous models of the Hebb repetition effect with established models of episodic memory, thereby joining two branches of the memory literature.",

          "abstract": "The present research reports the development and psychometric evaluation of the Measure of Emotional Episodes with Music (MEEM), a modular instrument designed to capture situational emotional experiences involving music. Guided by theory and extensive content-validity procedures, we assessed, refined, and confirmed a set of constructs and items intended to elucidate how music functions within emotional episodes. MEEM comprises five distinct scales, each representing a construct that is operationalised through two to three sub-constructs and measured through 6-9 items. Across two experiments, confirmatory factor analyses provided strong support for the proposed sub-construct structures within each scale, demonstrating good model fit and clear differentiation among sub-constructs. During the development, the labelling of several sub-constructs was refined to reflect empirical evidence indicating that the best-performing items captured more specific facets of the broader constructs. Initial evidence for construct validity was indicated by systematic associations between MEEM scales and two complementary types of emotion ratings. Together, these results support the internal structure and validity of the instrument. MEEM is explicitly designed to assess emotional states—understood as dynamic, situation-bound processes grounded in functional contexts—rather than stable trait-like tendencies. This distinguishes it from existing instruments that primarily assess habitual music use but are applied as proxies for state experiences. Moreover, MEEM is the first instrument that explicitly operationalises the situational and contextual dimensions of emotional experiences with music. A key strength of MEEM lies in its modular and adaptable design. The full instrument or selected scales can be administered depending on the research or applied context, enabling targeted assessment of music-related emotional processes. MEEM thus provides a flexible, theory-driven framework for advancing empirical research on emotional episodes with music and offers a foundation for future validation and cross-contextual applications.",

          "abstract": "Voice hearing has been linked to an externalising bias, i.e. the tendency to misattribute internally generated experiences to external sources. In signal detection terms, this manifests as a more liberal response criterion (greater willingness to report detecting signals). While cultural factors shape voice-hearing experiences, whether religious affiliation influences this perceptual bias remains unclear. We tested whether dialogic and positive inner speech - patterns relevant to prayer and religious cognition - moderate differences in response criterion between Christians (*N* = 27) and non-religious individuals (*N* = 49). Bayesian mixed-effects models found no main effect of religious group, suggesting Christian affiliation alone does not increase externalising bias. However, dialogic inner speech showed a decisive interaction: among Christians, more frequent dialogic inner speech predicted more liberal responding; consistent with religious frameworks that normalise conversation with a divine presence, rich internal dialogue may be more readily attributed to an external source; no such effect was found among non-religious participants. Positive inner speech showed moderate interactions: Christians with more positive inner speech responded more conservatively, consistent with positive inner speech serving self-regulatory functions that promote monitoring of internal experiences; non-religious participants showed more conservative responding only for positive stimuli. These findings suggest externalising bias emerges from interactions between cognitive style and cultural framework rather than religious affiliation alone.",

The current study adds to this debate by testing whether Neural language models (NLMs), which learn solely from input and their non-linguistic inductive biases, without any built-in linguistic representations, can model the wh-island constraint. We improve on previous research by testing both NLMs and human participants in the same experimental set-up and directly comparing their results, and doing this cross-linguistically in both English and Dutch. Our results show that the NLMs can successfully model the wh-island constraint in English but not in Dutch, opposing the arguments in favor of learning from input alone.",

Expanding on this evidence, we advance a deep embodiment theory in which visceral states and their conscious perception (interoception) systematically shape cognition and behavior. We review mechanistic links implicating cardiac-cycle phase and baroreceptor activity in perception and social behavior; respiration-locked neural dynamics in attention and learning; and gastrointestinal rhythms and vagal afferents in affect and decision-making.  We assess emerging methods, including ingestible sensors that record gastrointestinal signals in situ during emotional and cognitive tasks, and virtual reality stimuli linked to cardiac and respiratory rhythms. We detail the implications of deep embodiment for economic decision-making, clinical interventions (e.g., organ transplantation), and environmental exposures (e.g., air quality). Finally, we contrast deep embodiment with brain-reductionist and “shallow” embodiment accounts, propose protocols to assess cognition across visceral modalities, and outline implications for AI systems that incorporate visceral-like signals for state estimation and adaptive control—arguing that viscera are active components of cognition rather than background noise.",

This study aimed to address these inconsistencies through two preregistered replication experiments, examining the role of relational mobility as a potential moderating factor across different cultural contexts. Contrary to initial findings, our results from Experiment 1 in Japan (n = 254), Experiment 2 in Japan and the Netherlands (n = 263 and 300, respectively), and an exploratory statistical modeling revealed a consistent pattern where guilt led to compensation directed at the victim, sacrificing own resources, irrespective of the country or levels of perceived relational mobility.",

          "abstract": "The influence of space-number associations on action parameters has been widely reported. Yet, some recent studies claim that space-number associations are only the consequence of lateralized actions. However, little is known about the actual influence of action on number representations, and how this influence interacts with the influence of space. Hence, our goal was first to further examine the influence of action on number representations, and second to characterize the nature of this influence by manipulating both action direction and magnitude. To this end, we used a saccade task followed by a random number generation task (Experiment 1). We show that saccade amplitude shapes number representations, but that this influence depends on saccade direction as it is found for rightward saccades only. Moreover, the influence of target spatial position on the numbers generated vanishes when no action is executed (Experiment 2).  In our view, these results demonstrate the critical role of action in space-number associations. We suggest that the influence of space on number representations is only observed through lateralized actions. These findings shed new light on conflicting results in the literature about the influences of space and action, and provide important insights into the mechanisms behind space-number associations.",

However, extant cross-cultural studies mostly considered cross-cultural differences only in either observers or targets. This preregistered study explored cross-cultural nuances in the attractiveness halo effect for Brazilian and German target men and women, as perceived by Brazilian and German observers. Facial photos of 583 targets were judged separately for attractiveness, prosociality, health, intelligence, social competence, familiarity, and physical and social dominance by 554 Brazilian and 326 German observers. Ratings between Brazilian and German observers for the same target group and attribute were strongly positively correlated, except for familiarity for German male targets. Attractiveness halo effects were overall strong (stronger for health, social competence, and familiarity compared to social dominance, prosociality, and intelligence) and mostly consistent for Brazilian and German targets and observers, with few exceptions. Only for physical dominance, associations were mixed by target gender and nationality. This study supports a putative universality of attractiveness halo effects and also contributes to a deeper understanding of subtle variations in the halo effects of men’s and women’s attractiveness in more individualistic versus more collectivistic cultures.",

Leveraging a quota-matched longitudinal dataset of US respondents (N=26,423) collected across six waves (April’20 to January’23), we observe a major shift in partisans’ trust in the presidency after the 2020 US presidential election: Democrats gained and Republicans lost trust in the presidency. Time-lagged analyses show these changes “spill over” to trust in a wide range of other institutions not directly affected by the transition, reshaping the trust landscape for up to a year. Those who gained trust in the presidency (Democrats) later expressed elevated trust in public institutions, scientists, and the media, while those who lost trust (Republicans) expressed lower trust in these institutions, reflecting positive spillover. Republicans also showed negative spillover: reduced trust in the presidency was partially offset by increased trust in the police and personal networks. A proposed network model explains both positive and negative spillover patterns. Our findings suggest that political events can trigger wide-ranging trust cascades. Therefore, restoring trust in key institutions may bolster trust more broadly to other related institutions, mitigating the destabilizing effects of political perturbations.",

          "authors": "Jaeyeol Hyun",
          "abstract": "Background: Subjective time is commonly modeled as the output of an internal clock or accumulator. However, empirical phenomena such as Weber-like timing, affect-dependent distortions (e.g., depression, flow, crisis), and the dissolution of time during attentional shifts suggest that temporal experience may not arise from a dedicated pacemaker, but from intrinsic neural dynamics governing internal state updates.\nObjectives: We propose a minimal stochastic dynamical framework in which subjective time emerges from the interaction between metabolic throughput and self-referential attention. The goal is to unify classical psychophysical regularities and affect-dependent temporal distortions within a single, clock-free generative mechanism.\nMethods: We formulate a low-dimensional stochastic differential equation describing metabolic throughput \nM\n(\nt\n)\nM(t), self-referential attention \nA\nself\n(\nt\n)\nA \nself\n​\t\n (t), and an arousal-dependent sampling resolution \nR\n(\nM\n)\nR(M). These variables jointly determine a bounded internal self-update velocity \nv\n(\nt\n)\nv(t), which is nonlinearly transformed into an instantaneous subjective-time rate \nd\nτ\nself\n/\nd\nt\n=\nf\n(\nv\n)\ndτ \nself\n​\t\n /dt=f(v). Model behavior was analyzed through phase-space geometry, interval-timing simulations, robustness tests across alternative nonlinearities and saturation functions, and noise generalization. Parameters were constrained by biological plausibility; no behavioral data were fitted.\nResults: Subjective time emerges as a structural property of metabolic–attentional coupling. Interval-timing simulations exhibited Weber-like scaling (log–log slope ≈ 0.9) and approximately constant coefficients of variation when slow across-trial gain variability was present, consistent with requirements for scalar timing under continuous-time integration. Distinct affective regimes (depression-like, normal, flow-like, and crisis-like) occupied separable regions of the \n(\nM\n,\nA\nself\n)\n(M,A \nself\n​\t\n ) state space and showed characteristic distributional signatures in \nv\nv and \nd\nτ\nself\n/\nd\nt\ndτ \nself\n​\t\n /dt. Crisis-like regimes produced sustained temporal dilation, depression-like regimes produced compression, and flow-like regimes showed elevated but stable accumulation. These qualitative patterns were robust across broad families of nonlinear mappings and noise models.\nConclusions: A minimal metabolic–attentional stochastic dynamical system is sufficient to generate subjective time and its distortions without invoking an internal clock. The results suggest that subjective time reflects the rate of self-update in a metabolically constrained attentional system. This framework provides a structurally grounded basis for integrating psychophysics, computational neuroscience, and affective phenomenology, and offers testable predictions for future empirical and clinical work.",

These designs involve the comparison of a single outcome measurement (denoted as YT) from a single treated case obtained at one point in time vs.  , where     is a group-based estimate of what YT would have been had no treatment been applied (i.e., an estimate of the unobserved counterfactual parameter YCF). The subscript on YT denotes the treatment condition and the hat on    denotes an estimate of the true counterfactual value YCF. The contrast (YT -YCF) defines the treatment effect and (YT -  ) is the general notation used to denote an estimate of the treatment effect. The proposed designs may consist of four phases: (1) nc+1 participants are randomly selected from the population of interest, (2) one subject is randomly selected from the sample of nc+1 participants, (3) the properties of the selected subject are evaluated relative to the properties of the group of nc participants (when available data allow), and (4) re-randomization is carried out to identify an alternative participant to be treated if diagnostics from the third phase suggest it. There are three variants of the proposed designs; the first variant is the least satisfactory, and it omits the third and fourth design phases listed above. The three variants differ with respect to the data required, the counterfactual estimator, the method of statistical analysis, statistical power, and credibility of results.\n\n\nKey Words: statistical inference, small-N design, scientific method, randomized experiment",

This article asserts that attention need not refer to one mechanism, but rather comprises a solution class to the cognitive system's most fundamental problem: how to maximize performance objectives, given inherent biological and environmental constraints. With this perspective, separate solutions may be implemented simultaneously across multiple functional domains, such as perception, decision-making, and learning. Here, a taxonomy of attentional solutions was extracted through focused review of findings from model-based cognitive neuroscience, a field predicated on mathematical formalization and simultaneous consideration of behavioral performance (i.e. objectives) and process-level neurophysiological markers (i.e. biologically-constrained resources). The goal of this review is thus to reify attention while embracing its plurality, offering a framework whereby attentional solutions can be proposed, evaluated, and falsified in the context of system-level objectives and constraints.",

We analyze orders placed by emergency department providers and find that cognitive load increases bias and noise, consistent with the optimal allocation of resources. Because providers near-optimally adjust to cognitive demands, this argues that guidelines that increase cognitive resources are necessary to reduce errors. Consistent with this perspective, bias and noise are minimized when multiple providers contribute to patient care. These findings have implications for optimizing medical care.",

This is partially attributable to EEG’s accessibility and cost-efficiency as well as the fact that EEG non-invasively measures the electric fields of the brain. Innovations in EEG over the past century have largely been either in terms of improving data acquisition or data analysis. On the one hand, the hardware for EEG recording allows for more electrodes from more efficient electronics and well as more user-friendly hardware. On the other hand, advancements in signal processing allow researchers to use EEG to provide both temporal and spatial information about brain (dys)function. However, that EEG is so widespread also makes the method susceptible to practices that may hinder scientific advancement by adding confusion rather than clarity in the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of EEG data. This chapter offers readers an accessible overview of these considerations as well as a guide to these analyses that provide reference-independent measurements of response strength and response topography and therefore circumvent statistical and interpretational caveats of canonical ERP analysis methods. The analyses overviewed here can, in most instances, be extended to the analysis of spontaneous EEG, as well as spectrally-deconvolved signals both when recorded at the scalp and intracranially in humans and animal models alike. The versatility and accessibility of EEG, in combination with advances in signal processing, allow for this ‘old dog’ of human neuroscience to still deliver new tricks and innovations.",

In Experiment 1 (magnitude classification; N=60), SNARC effects emerged in both Chinese (L1) and English (L2), with no reliable L1-L2 difference. In Experiment 2 (parity judgement; N=52), SNARC was not reliably observed in either language, highlighting task sensitivity. MARC effects were weak and did not differ between languages in either experiment. Individual-difference analyses revealed that earlier L2 acquisition was associated with stronger L2 SNARC, though this did not moderate L1-L2 contrasts. Together, the results place a lower bound on language-specific modulation of spatial-numerical mappings when format and reading direction are controlled, while experience-based mechanisms may additionally shape their strength.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Global increases in armed conflict, forced displacement, pandemics, and economic instability have contributed to rising levels of psychological distress worldwide, placing large segments of the population at increased risk of developing mental health conditions. This burden is particularly pronounced in humanitarian and low-resource settings, where access to specialist mental health services is limited. Scalable, low-intensity, evidence-based psychological interventions are therefore urgently needed. In response, the World Health Organization has developed transdiagnostic programmes, including Self-Help Plus (SH+) and Doing What Matters in Times of Stress (DWMS). Although these interventions are increasingly implemented across humanitarian and public health contexts, evidence for their effectiveness and implementation has not yet been systematically synthesised.\nMethods and analysis. This preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration standards and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We will include randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of SH+ or DWMS, alongside qualitative and mixed-methods studies examining their implementation among stressor-exposed individuals of any age. Outcomes will include symptoms of depression and anxiety, general distress, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Moreover, we will examine effects on well-being, psychosocial functioning, adverse events, and implementation outcomes (eg, acceptability, feasibility, fidelity). We will search Cochrane CENTRAL, APA PsycNet, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, and Scopus, supplemented by hand-searching preprint repositories and citation tracking. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and a customized appraisal tool for studies on implementation. Quantitative data will be synthesised using random-effects multilevel meta-analyses, with meta-regression models applied to examine moderators. Bayesian meta-analyses will be conducted where appropriate as sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings. Certainty of evidence will be evaluated using the GRADE approach.\nEthics and dissemination. Ethical approval is not required. Findings will be disseminated through an open-access peer-reviewed publication, a plain-language summary, and the Open Science Framework, where all materials will be made publicly available.\nPROSPERO registration number.

          "abstract": "Recent interdisciplinary advances have transformed the study of the evolution of music. Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality — the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from observations of infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies have revealed that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings have further shown that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

However, it remains unclear whether this questionnaire measures the same construct across adolescent sex and ethnicity. The present study investigated the measurement invariance (MI) and convergent validity of the SMFQ across sex and ethnicity in a sample of adolescents from a United Kingdom (UK) cohort study. Data was obtained from the sixth sweep (aged 14, n = 8814) in the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). Results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the SMFQ had a unidimensional factor structure. This model demonstrated MI at configural, metric, and scalar levels across sex and ethnicity. The SMFQ scores were significantly positively related to internalising symptoms, and negatively related to self-esteem and happiness. The findings provide support for the MI of the SMFQ across sex and major ethnic groups in the UK and for its convergent validity, supporting its use as a promising screening tool for depression symptoms in mid-adolescence.",

In coordinated joint actions, a sense of joint agency emerges, with interaction and cooperation being crucial for enhancing SoA. Prior research indicates that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is integral to monitoring social contexts of SoA, while the left angular gyrus (lAG) focuses on individual aspects of agency. This study examined the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on SoA and judgment of performance (JoP) in eighteen healthy young participants using a three-way crossover design that included inhibitory neurostimulation of the rTPJ, excitatory stimulation of the lAG, and a sham intervention on the Vertex. Participants completed musical tasks involving rhythmic coordination before and after neurostimulation, with self-reported scores for SoA and JoP collected via Likert scales, alongside performance metrics (action time error and number of errors) evaluated through software. While rTMS did not yield significant effects on SoA, JoP, or performance overall, notable correlations between these variables suggest that neurostimulation may influence the interrelations among them. These findings highlight the complexities of how neurostimulation impacts perceived agency and performance, warranting further exploration into their interconnected dynamics.\nKeywords: transcranial magnetic stimulation, right temporoparietal junction, left angular gyrus, sense of joint agency, musical rhythmic coordination, joint action",

          "abstract": "How long-term changes in parent personality are associated with long-term changes in child temperament is a fundamental yet largely unaddressed question about child development. Several developmental processes (including socialization, modeling, and evocation) suggest that parent personality might have transactional and thus co-developmental associations with child temperament. The present study used data from a longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin families to investigate the extent to which changes in parent Big Five personality traits co-develop with changes in child temperament from age 10 to 16. Using second-order bivariate growth curve models, we found that mother (but not father) personality co-develops with child temperament for most conceptually related pairs of personality and temperament traits; for example, when mothers increased in conscientiousness, their child tended to increase in effortful control. However, these results largely held only for parent reports of child temperament (or a composite of parent- and child self-reports), and not when using only child self-reports of temperament. Child nativity status moderated some of the co-developmental associations, where families with children born in Mexico (as opposed to being born in the U.S.) tended to exhibit stronger mother-child co-development. We discuss these findings and what they mean for the study of child development.",

Across four experiments, adult online learners engaged in multiple-choice pretesting to learn Spanish word translations shown in word-image (Experiments 1-2) or image-word (Experiments 3-4) format. Relative to a read-only condition, pretesting yielded statistically significant performance improvements on subsequent cued recall (Cohen’s d = 0.18–0.40) and, in most cases, multiple-choice tests (d = 0.25–0.67), regardless of whether test formats were separately presented or intermixed. Participants also reported preferring pretesting over reading for learning second-language vocabulary, especially for word-image learning. Together, these findings extend the pretesting effect to visual and verbal materials, offering theoretical insights and substantiating word-image and image-word guessing-based approaches of language learning.",

The created scales of digital media use demonstrated adequate construct validity, reliability, and measurement invariance across gender. Seven distinct profiles of digital media use were identified through latent profile analysis: High Social Media Users, Social Media Lurkers, Video Game Players, and Low Digital Media Users—profiles that align with previous research—and three novel profiles: Science-Oriented Users, Creative Users, and Aggression-Oriented Users. Discriminant analysis revealed that personality traits significantly predicted profile membership. A combination of high Openness and Extraversion primarily distinguished Creative Users from Aggression-Oriented Users, Video Game Players, and Low Digital Media Users. High Neuroticism combined with low Conscientiousness best differentiated Aggression-Oriented Users from Science-Oriented Users. Finally, a function primarily defined by low Agreeableness predicted membership in the Aggression-Oriented Users profile versus the Social Media Lurkers profile.

Guided by a self-regulation perspective on pro-environmental behavior, we test whether grit, defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals, strengthens the link from intention to behavior in the environmental domain. Study 1 surveyed Chinese high school students (N = 682). Regression showed a stronger intention-behavior link among those high in grit but a weaker link among those low in grit. Study 2 analyzed large-scale Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data from 15-year-olds worldwide (N = 372,170) and confirmed the same moderating effect. Study 3 tracked Chinese undergraduates (N = 1,286) across three academic years. A random-intercept cross-lagged panel (RI-CLPM) model indicated that grit’s moderating effect resides mainly at the stable between-person level rather than within-person change, which suggests that dispositional grit promotes durable intention to behavior consistency for pro-environmental action. Across studies, these findings refine self-regulation accounts of pro-environmental action by identifying grit as a distinct trait-based moderator and by clarifying the level at which moderation operates. Practically, narrowing the intention–behavior gap may require targeted structural supports for individuals lower in grit, alongside longer-term capacity building approaches that foster sustained commitment to ecological goals.",

          "abstract": "Discourse analysis has long played a central role in the assessment and treatment of neurogenic communication disorders, particularly in aphasia. Canonical tasks like the Cookie Theft picture description and Cinderella narrative retell have shaped decades of research by offering replicable, analyzable, and linguistically rich language samples. However, as the field expands to encompass broader populations, more nuanced clinical goals, and new analytic technologies, the limitations of default task use have become increasingly apparent. This Viewpoint argues that the future of discourse assessment depends on moving from tradition-based task selection to intentional, theory-driven, and empirically validated approaches. I examine what foundational tasks revealed about language breakdown, why they succeeded within their original scope, and where they now fall short. I propose a shift toward adaptive discourse ecosystems—frameworks that align task, population, and metric with clinical or research purpose—while integrating psychometric rigor, participatory design, and thoughtful use of technological tools such as natural language processing and perceptual ratings. Only by building on the strengths of the past with clarity, creativity, and scientific discipline can we ensure that discourse assessment continues to reflect the complexity, diversity, and functional relevance of communication in the real world.",

          "abstract": "People frequently navigate hierarchical decision-making environments, where higher- stages choices contain the options available at lower stages (e.g., choosing a restaurant entails another choice among dishes). While variety-seeking is a well-established phenomenon in consumer research, little is known about how a choice’s position within a hierarchical choice structure might influence variety-seeking behavior. Across eleven pre-registered experiments (N = 3,907), we document a robust asymmetry in variety-seeking across hierarchical stages: people simultaneously seek more variety at higher stages of a choice structure while seeking less variety (i.e., concentrating their choices) at lower stages . We rule out various alternative accounts, such as seeking an optimal stimulation level, and determine that hierarchical variety seeking is a goal- directed behavior: by default, consumers often hold a goal of finding the best higher-stage option, and they use differential variety seeking to do so. When seeking the best lower-stages option, however, their allocation of variety seeking changes to become more symmetrical. Together, these findings demonstrate that hierarchical positioning is not merely a contextual feature of decision environments but it also fundamentally shapes the underlying psychology of how people explore variety versus concentrate their choices across different stages.",

Text messages have proven effective for promoting physical activity, but little is known about how message content can engage motivational mechanisms.\nPurpose: This study aimed to examine how generative artificial intelligence prompts could be engineered to create messages that engage physical activity urges.\nMethods: Study 1 involved iterative prompt development and expert evaluations of messages, varying by physical activity context (preparation vs. execution), benefit (short-term vs. long-term), experience (past vs. future), and behavioral target (move more vs. sit less). Study 2 involved a web-based factorial experiment to assess how these factors affected urges among middle-aged and older adults.\nResults: In Study 1, ratings of confidence that text messages (nMessages=16) would evoke urges were moderate yet heterogenous across the experts (nExperts=15). Themes including physical activity cues and affective appeal emerged as key factors. In Study 2, 640 adults (aged 40–85 years, M = 57; 52% female) rated 80 messages. Men reported stronger urges than women, and participants with higher baseline urges reported higher urges after reading the messages. Age moderated two effects: older adults responded more favorably to execution vs. preparation prompts, and the advantage of past over future experiences diminished with age. Two significant three-way interactions showed that execution-based prompts outperformed preparation prompts, except when prompts targeted (1) long-term future benefits and (2) future physical activity experiences.\nConclusions: This study identified how specific prompt features can evoke physical activity urges in middle-aged and older adults, supporting development of personalized interventions.",

          "abstract": "Patient–clinician interactions are central to diagnosis and treatment in mental health care. They involve inferential processes grounded in patients’ reports of symptoms and clinicians’ interpretations of signs. These processes are liable to microdynamic looping effects that drive diagnostic belief formation. In facing the hermeneutic challenge of reaching a shared ascription of the patient’s condition, such looping effects can lead to misalignment and give rise to epistemic injustice if a credibility deficit exists between the patient and the clinician. In this paper, we use the active inference framework to develop a computational model of looping microdynamics that captures how patients and clinicians reciprocally interpret symptoms, attribute causes, and negotiate diagnostic categories over time. We present a simulation study showing how specific interactional patterns can amplify or mitigate credibility deficits, depending in part on clinicians’ attributional attitudes toward patients’ self-interpretations. Our results suggest that, in contexts of diagnostic disagreement, positive disconfirmation—offering an alternative explanatory framing rather than simply negating the patient’s perspective—may reduce the risk of epistemic injustice. Overall, the model highlights how looping microdynamics structure mutual belief formation in clinical encounters and how attention to these dynamics can support more epistemically responsible clinical communication.",

L’essor rapide des systèmes d’intelligence artificielle générative a conduit à l’émergence de la communication médiatisée par l’IA (AI-mediated communication, AIMC), dans laquelle un système algorithmique intervient directement dans la production du langage et de l’expression affective. Si l’AIMC est de plus en plus utilisée dans les relations intimes et les contextes thérapeutiques, ses implications cliniques et éthiques demeurent largement sous-théorisées.\nMéthode. Une recherche systématique de la littérature a été réalisée dans MEDLINE afin d’identifier les travaux empiriques et théoriques portant sur l’AIMC et ses effets interpersonnels, psychologiques et cliniques.\nRésultats. La littérature existante met en évidence des résultats ambivalents. D’une part, l’assistance par l’IA peut améliorer l’efficacité communicationnelle dans des interactions instrumentales ou transactionnelles. D’autre part, lorsque la communication est censée véhiculer une présence subjective, un engagement personnel ou une responsabilité morale, l’AIMC peut fragiliser les perceptions d’authenticité et de confiance, en particulier lorsque son usage est implicite. Afin de conceptualiser ce risque spécifique, nous proposons la notion d’usurpation d’authenticité, distincte de l’usurpation d’identité, qui désigne le déplacement silencieux du travail subjectif, intentionnel et affectif par lequel une personne se rend présente à l’autre.\nImplications cliniques. L’usurpation d’authenticité est susceptible d’affecter particulièrement les relations fondées sur la confiance épistémique, telles que les relations intimes et la psychothérapie, ainsi que les populations vulnérables (traumatismes complexes, trouble de l’attachement). En psychothérapie, l’AIMC non divulguée pourrait compromettre l’alliance thérapeutique.\nConclusion. Ces éléments plaident pour une posture de précaution, fondée sur la transparence, la prévention de la cyberviolence relationnelle et la clarification des usages de l’IA, ainsi que pour le développement de recherches empiriques visant à tester les hypothèses cliniques formulées.",

          "authors": "Lauren S Aulet",
          "abstract": "Human adults show a number bias in magnitude perception, weighting numerical information more heavily than continuous magnitudes like area. However, developmental research suggests this bias is not innate: young children show an area bias that reverses to a number bias only later in development. What drives this shift? Here, we use deep neural networks to test whether learning to count is sufficient to create number-biased representations. We trained ResNeXt-50 networks on a counting task (predicting the number of dots in an image) and measured representational biases using linear decoding of number versus cumulative area from network features. Untrained networks showed a robust area bias, with area more decodable than number, reflecting an architectural prior that does not privilege discrete quantity. Networks trained on ImageNet classification retained this area bias, indicating that generic visual experience is insufficient to create number-biased representations. Self-supervised models trained on naturalistic visual input showed no bias in either direction. Critically, networks trained on counting showed a dramatic reversal: number became far more decodable than area, producing a strong number bias. This bias reversed immediately after only one epoch of training. Principal component analysis revealed that counting training completely reorganized representational geometry: numerosity became the dominant axis of variation (r² = 0.95) while area was fully suppressed (r² = 0.00). These findings provide a computational proof-of-concept that learning to count can transform magnitude representations, offering a mechanistic account of how symbolic number acquisition may drive the development of number-biased cognition.",

          "abstract": "The clean energy transition is accelerating worldwide, yet its social benefits and burdens remain unevenly distributed. Existing energy justice frameworks have been vital for identifying inequities in distribution, participation, and recognition, but they offer limited insight into the mechanisms through which these inequities persist. This article introduces \"Ecological Energy Justice\", a framework grounded in ecological psychology that conceptualizes justice in terms of the action possibilities afforded by socio‑material environments. Drawing on the theory of affordances—hierarchical, multi‑scalar, and dynamically adaptable actionable possibilities relative to actor capabilities—we argue that inequities arise not only from unequal access to resources or decision‑making processes but from mismatches between people’s capabilities and the environments in which energy practices unfold. We show how affordance inequalities shape energy insecurity, clean technology adoption, labor transitions, and procedural participation, and how these inequalities propagate across nested socio‑technical scales. We then outline how just transitions can be advanced through affordance restructuring—reshaping homes, infrastructures, institutions, and regional economies to support meaningful low‑carbon action for all communities. Ecological Energy Justice provides researchers with new tools for mapping the relational dynamics of energy systems and offers policymakers a mechanism‑based approach for aligning decarbonization with social equity, climate resilience, and democratic participation.",

          "authors": "Dean D'Souza; Sarah Josephine Rajendra; Leher Singh",
          "abstract": "Perceptual narrowing of speech in infancy is often characterized as a maturational process driven by domain-specific experience with language. However, relatively little is known about the role of domain-general attentional mechanisms in this process. In the present study, we examined whether variability in infants’ everyday social environments is associated with attentional disengagement and whether disengagement, in turn, relates to perceptual narrowing. Seventy-nine bilingual infants aged 9–11 months completed a visual attentional disengagement task and an auditory discrimination task assessing sensitivity to a non-native Hindi dental–retroflex phonemic contrast. Infants’ social diversity was quantified as the proportion of lifetime exposure to caregivers of other racial backgrounds. Results revealed that infants who disengaged attention more efficiently showed greater discrimination of the non-native phonemic contrast. Greater exposure to racially diverse social partners predicted more efficient attentional disengagement but was not directly associated with phoneme discrimination. Mediation analyses indicated that social diversity was indirectly related to non-native discrimination via attentional disengagement. Together, these findings support a developmental cascade in which variability in infants’ social environments is associated with adaptations in domain-general attention that, in turn, relate to perceptual sensitivity. The results highlight attentional disengagement as a potential mechanism linking environmental diversity and perceptual specialization and underscore the importance of considering infants’ everyday social ecologies in theories of early learning.",

          "abstract": "Emetophobia is a specific fear of vomiting that is hidden as a specific phobia subtype in current classification systems for mental disorders, which potentially contributes to limited awareness of this condition in the public and among mental health professionals, thus increasing the likelihood that it is overlooked, misdiagnosed, and mistreated. As it differs from other specific phobias in clinical presentation, etiological and maintaining mechanisms, and treatment, we propose that emetophobia might be considered as an own diagnostic entity in future versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of Diseases.",

In this article, we present an empirical audit of sampling, reporting, and generality practices in Psychological Science across a six-year period (2019–2024). Across 728 empirical articles comprising over 200 million participants, we examined geographic distribution of studies, demographic reporting about participants, modes of data collection, sample-size justification, and inferential restraint. Metascientific practices improved markedly over time, particularly with regards to sampling decisions (sample size; sample size justification) as did expressions of inferential restraint. However, there was limited progress in geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural diversification of testing sites and participants. In each demographic measure, there was also substantial under-reporting throughout the window of analysis. Together, these findings indicate challenges in participant and geographic specification of samples and achieving globally representative samples alongside encouraging advances in sample size, justification, and inferential restraint.",

          "authors": "Andrew Gordon; Simon Jones",
          "abstract": "Longitudinal research on crowdsourced platforms faces substantial attrition, yet there remains little experimental evidence to guide design decisions. We conducted an experiment (N = 1,798) on Prolific, orthogonally manipulating payment rate (£6, £9, or £9/hour plus completion bonus) and session interval (1, 2, or 4 weeks) across five sessions. We also measured habitual tendencies using the Creature of Habit Scale (COHS) and recorded participants’ prior platform experience. Session interval strongly predicted retention: participants in the one-week condition were 1.6x as likely to complete all sessions as those in the four-week condition (80% vs. 50%). Payment rate, by contrast, had no significant effect on retention or response speed. At the individual level, prior platform experience was the strongest predictor of retention, with more experienced participants significantly more likely to complete all sessions. The two COHS subscales showed divergent effects: routine modestly predicted higher retention, whereas automaticity predicted lower retention, challenging the assumption that habit functions as a unitary construct. These findings suggest that researchers designing longitudinal studies on crowdsourced platforms may benefit more from shorter inter-session intervals than from incremental increases in compensation, and that individual differences in habitual tendencies shape attrition in ways that may affect sample composition over time.",

          "authors": "Kee Bear Rivers; Pizza Ka Yee CHOW",
          "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has traditionally been conceptualised using the Medical Model (MM), with screening tools such as the Autism Quotient (AQ) relying on binary categorisation. More recently, the Neurodiversity Model (NDM) conceptualises autism as natural neurological variation, framing autistic traits as dimensional and comparable to the Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN). However, it remains unclear how these two models shape the interpretation of ASD, and how the expression of autistic traits may differ by gender and relate to OCEAN traits. This study recruited 1,430 adults (mean age = 25) who completed an online survey including the AQ and the Goldberg-50 IPIP to assess autistic and personality traits, respectively. AQ scores were operationalised both as a binary variable (AQ &lt; 29 = non-autistic; AQ ≥ 29 = autistic), consistent with the MM, and as a continuous variable (AQ range 0–50), consistent with the NDM. Mediation (path) analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between AQ and OCEAN, and whether AQ mediated the relationships between gender and OCEAN. Results under both models indicated that AQ directly influenced OCEAN expression and served as a significant mediator between gender and OCEAN. Non-binary participants had a higher likelihood of belonging to the ASD group or reported higher ASD traits, which were associated with increased OEAN and decreased C. Together, the statistical differences between the MM and NDM were nuanced, suggesting that adopting the NDM is both viable and beneficial. These findings support a more inclusive, dimensional approach to understanding how autistic traits manifest across the population.",

          "abstract": "Research on voluntary task switching examines factors that influence individuals’ willingness to switch between tasks. Prior work shows that task switching behavior is affected by internal performance-related costs and external factors, such as perceptual disruptions. The present study tested whether such effects extend to the motor domain. Therefore, we developed a voluntary task-switching paradigm in which participants indicated task choices using a joystick and a double-registration procedure, separating task choice and execution. In two preregistered experiments conducted in 2022 and 2023 (N = 41 and N = 74), we applied brief motor perturbations during the task choice phase. Consistent with our preregistered hypotheses, incongruent perturbations produced a small but reliable decrease in task switch rates in both experiments; however, no effects were observed for congruent or neutral perturbations. Additionally, we observed task switch costs in both experiments and a task repetition bias in the second experiment. Exploratory analyses of continuous joystick movements provided evidence for substantial preplanning of task choices. These findings demonstrate that motor perturbations can bias voluntary task choice, supporting embodied cognition accounts of decision-making, and highlight task choice preplanning as an important methodological consideration for future research.",

          "abstract": "In psychology and neuroscience, computational models representing competing hypotheses are often fitted to behavioural data and compared to evaluate their plausibility. In a recent article, Piray proposed a general framework for estimating the statistical power of such model comparisons, focusing on random-effects Bayesian model selection, and suggested that many previous studies may be insufficiently powered. Piray further noted that a large number of studies rely on fixed-effects Bayesian model selection, assuming that the same model applies to all participants, and argued that this practice can lead to extremely high false-positive rates. These conclusions raise concerns about the validity of findings based on computational model selection. In this commentary, however, we argue that Piray’s analyses depart from realistic model-selection scenarios. In particular, his power analysis involves assumptions that are, in different respects, overly pessimistic or overly optimistic, potentially biasing power estimates and similar issues may arise in the simulations used to evaluate fixed-effects Bayesian model selection.",

          "authors": "Laurence Cobbaert",
          "abstract": "Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is widely described as an evidence-based psychological treatment, including within eating disorder (ED) care. However, evidence claims are only valid within the boundaries of the populations, outcome measures, and service contexts represented in the underlying trials. This paper argues that CBT is not universally evidence-based and that extending its evidentiary status to neurodivergent people and Indigenous, First Nations, and Māori communities is not currently justified. Drawing on decolonial and neurodiversity scholarship and lived experience-led literature, the paper shows how research designs prioritising internal validity have contributed to an evidence base that functions as a methodological echo chamber, reproducing findings drawn predominantly from white, Western, largely neurotypical samples. As a result, CBT trials often lack external validity for communities whose experiences of distress are shaped by sensory processing differences, executive functioning difficulties, systemic discrimination, food insecurity, and the colonial legacy of trauma, erasure, and dispossession. In ED care, these limitations are amplified by diagnostic frameworks and outcome measures that privilege weight-centric approaches and neuronormative and Eurocentric cognitive models while overlooking sensory, somatic, cultural, and socio-political drivers of illness. Evidence from autistic and Indigenous participants documents mis-attunement and iatrogenic harm within standard CBT-based pathways for EDs. The paper concludes that universal claims about CBT are not supported by the current evidence base and are better understood as population-specific evidence claims grounded in co-designed trials, culturally valid measurement, and implementation research demonstrating safety, relevance, and benefit for diverse communities.",

          "authors": "Joshua K. Hartshorne; Jesse Snedeker",
          "abstract": "Theories of language acquisition generally fall into one of two camps. On one side, there are domain-general constructivist theories which argue that children break into language with little more than a capacity to learn, an interest in others, and some knowledge of the world. On the other side, there are domain-specific nativist theories which propose that children come equipped with rich innate knowledge of syntax, semantics, and principles constraining the mapping between them. In this paper, we sketch out an alternative: a theory that roots language acquisition in rich, abstract conceptual structures (akin to the semantic structures of linguistic theories) but posits that syntax arises from domain-general learning abilities and the belief that the communicative signals of others convey thoughts which are structured like our own. On this hypothesis, both the learning abilities that drive syntax acquisition and the conceptual structures themselves are available to prelinguistic infants and evolved prior to the emergence of external language. The critical evolutionary step was the insight that motivates children to link conceptual structures to patterned external signals. We describe how this theory builds on empirical insights from language acquisition, developmental psychology, linguistic typology, computational linguistics, and learning theories. Finally, we attempt to translate between Conceptual Nativism and other theoretical perspectives, delineating where the theories differ in their core commitments from where they differ solely in their framing, terminology and emphasis.",

          "authors": "Christopher Berk",
          "abstract": "This article critically examines the growing use of investment language in U.S. prison reform advocacy, particularly within the Justice Reinvestment movement. In response to fiscal crisis and bipartisan concern about mass incarceration, policymakers and reformers increasingly frame punishment as a form of financial investment, emphasizing cost efficiency, returns, and risk management. While this discourse has helped generate political support for reform, the article argues that “investment talk” subtly reshapes the terms of debate over punishment in ways that risk obscuring its political and normative dimensions.\n\nDrawing on political theory, criminology, and scholarship on conceptual metaphor and governance, the article analyzes how treating justice as a distributive or financial problem narrows public deliberation about the aims and limits of punishment. Investment talk, the article shows, encourages a focus on cost reduction and efficiency while sidelining questions of political agency, democratic accountability, proportionality, and social exclusion. Contrary to common assumptions, framing prison reform in terms of investment does not necessarily imply limited punishment; instead, it may legitimate new and expanded forms of penal control, including noncustodial and “virtual” sanctions, so long as they are perceived as generating acceptable returns.\n\nThe article situates investment talk within broader critiques of neoliberal penality and argues that durable movements to reduce the scale and scope of punishment require a different normative vocabulary. By comparing prison reform discourse to earlier movements for mental health deinstitutionalization, the article concludes that meaningful decarceration depends on explicitly contesting the political purposes of punishment, rather than relying on technocratic or market-oriented rationales alone.",

          "abstract": "How has the retrenchment of US democracy promotion under President Donald Trump affected processes of autocratization in US allies globally and in the Middle East specifically? We provide theory and evidence to address this question by analyzing two US allies with preexisting processes of executive aggrandizement: Israel and Türkiye. We argue that the decline in US pro-democratic pressure has enabled autocratization in both countries. Furthermore, we show that the degree and processes of US autocracy promotion differ depending on two domestic factors: political leaders’ control over the state and domestic attitudes toward the United States. These factors shape whether US foreign policy enables autocratization through active “autocracy promotion,” in which the United States helps undermine domestic institutional constraints, or instead through a “normalization of authoritarianism,” in which strongman rule becomes an accepted norm. We further show that when public attitudes are pro-American, illiberal political leaders can leverage US support as part of their domestic legitimation strategy by fostering “symbolic alignment” with the US president. By contrast, in anti-American societies, leaders practice “managed incoherence,” in which a leader’s anti-American narratives coexist uneasily with US acquiescence to autocratization. We demonstrate the theory in Israel and Türkiye, two US allies with differing levels of incumbent control over the state and contrasting public attitudes toward the United States. We find that in both Israel and Türkiye, the retrenchment of US democracy promotion has enabled autocratization, but to different degrees and through different pathways. Our findings contribute to scholarly understanding of the international dimensions of democratic backsliding, authoritarianism in the Middle East, and the effects of US hegemony.",

          "authors": "Marcello Vittorio Ferrada de Noli",
          "abstract": "This paper applies a political-epidemiological framework to analyse the long-term human consequences of U.S. interventions in Latin America from 1846 to 2026. Using historical documentation, political analysis, and epidemiological aggregation, the study identifies a cumulative burden exceeding 500,000 estimated fatal and non-fatal victims, including deaths, injuries, and enforced disappearances. The figures are derived from national truth commissions, international human rights bodies, and established historical syntheses. The results show that the majority of casualties occur not during direct military interventions but through post-intervention authoritarian governance, regime repression, and institutionalised violence. Interventions are thus conceptualised not as isolated military events but as regime-transforming processes that restructure state power and generate temporally distributed patterns of harm. The study formalises political epidemiology as a population-health framework and introduces political injury epidemiology as a specialised analytical domain for the study of fatal and non-fatal injuries produced by political power systems. Together, the findings support a unified causal model linking intervention, regime formation, repression, and population-level injury and mortality, reframing foreign intervention as a structural determinant of health.",

It analyses the current characteristics of these policies —priorities, goals, instruments, and investments— in light of their historical trajectories. The central hypothesis is that technocratic management logics continue to shape public STI policies, expressed through the consolidation of a technocratic bureaucracy and the growing dominance of the innovation agenda as the main organizing principle of the system. Using a qualitative methodology, the paper combines historiographical review, documentary analysis (laws, programmes, and national plans), and statistical data on science and technology. Through a rigorous political-institutional reconstruction, it aims to understand the consolidation process of the Portuguese STI system in a country located on the periphery of the EU and the semi-periphery of the world system.

Addressing a core gap in sociological theory, we specify the micro-level mechanisms by which individual cognitive interpretations—operating through both automatic and deliberative adaptation—converge into collective behavioral patterns. These processes give rise to emergent symbolic order and stabilized social norms. The model demonstrates how decentralized feedback loops generate shared norms and interpretive frameworks, providing a foundation for studying the bottom-up emergence of social structures. Illustrated through the case of the neurodiversity paradigm shift, this framework offers a precise, dynamic account of how schemas and actions co-evolve, highlighting the central role of social feedback in cultural formation. Our contribution advances cumulative theory-building by bridging cognitive sociology with macro-level cultural phenomena and lays the groundwork for future research on power dynamics and contested meanings.",

The findings suggest that the UAE IBSI has remained successful in achieving its micro/primary objectives (commercial performance) and made progress towards partial achievement of its macro/intermediate objectives (financial stability and equitable wealth distribution). While evidence suggests achievements in the area of financial stability, the aspect of equity in wealth distribution requires more focus. The study recommends that regulators develop a legal framework focusing on the business models for IBSI, aimed at achieving broader economic objectives. It is also recommended that managers of UAE IBSI include profit and loss-sharing contracts in deposit collection, financing and investment portfolios.

          "abstract": "Background\nCo-production with public stakeholders is increasingly recognised as an important approach to ensuring health research is relevant to communities and interventions and likely to generate sustainable change. Ideally, co-production needs to be sustained throughout different stages of research and allow stakeholders ownership of the research agenda. We explore a case study of iterative co-production conducted over a nine-month period with a wide range of disparate stakeholders that transformed into a research-ready consortium able to design and obtain funding for a creative health research programme. \n\nMain body\nThe ReCITE consortium is comprised of academics, creatives, and specialists in capacity development and community engagement in Liverpool, UK. Its main focus is health equity and coming up with new ways of working to tackle entrenched, avoidable and unfair differences in health. ReCITE led a series of six workshops in 2023 to co-produce a research programme to investigate creative approaches for improving health equity. Fifty-six stakeholders from the academic, creative and arts, health, community and voluntary sectors participated across six workshops that sought broad engagement and consolidated stakeholder input to develop a research agenda and expand the consortium. Common emerging themes were: 1) understanding complexities in funding creative health; 2) investigating storytelling as a catalyst for change; 3) achieving change through collective action; 4) the role of creative advocacy to change societal and funding structures; 5) evidencing the impact of community-led creative health interventions on health equity. These formed multiple co-produced outputs, including five pillars of a theory of change for the research that underpinned the research questions and determined five interventions to take forward by the research-ready consortium to securing funding for future work. \n\nConclusion\t\nThe iterative process of gaining stakeholder input, consolidating it, and seeking further input, helped to incorporate the perspectives of different stakeholder groups into different project outputs. Equitable power-sharing guided decision-making over what to prioritise was important in building ownership of the research agenda and trust among stakeholders. However, this was a lengthy iterative process and sustaining time commitment was difficult for those stakeholders who were not fully funded to participate.",

In response to fiscal crisis and bipartisan concern about mass incarceration, policymakers and reformers increasingly frame punishment as a form of financial investment, emphasizing cost efficiency, returns, and risk management. While this discourse has helped generate political support for reform, the article argues that “investment talk” subtly reshapes the terms of debate over punishment in ways that risk obscuring its political and normative dimensions.\n\nDrawing on political theory, criminology, and scholarship on conceptual metaphor and governance, the article analyzes how treating justice as a distributive or financial problem narrows public deliberation about the aims and limits of punishment. Investment talk, the article shows, encourages a focus on cost reduction and efficiency while sidelining questions of political agency, democratic accountability, proportionality, and social exclusion. Contrary to common assumptions, framing prison reform in terms of investment does not necessarily imply limited punishment; instead, it may legitimate new and expanded forms of penal control, including noncustodial and “virtual” sanctions, so long as they are perceived as generating acceptable returns.\n\nThe article situates investment talk within broader critiques of neoliberal penality and argues that durable movements to reduce the scale and scope of punishment require a different normative vocabulary. By comparing prison reform discourse to earlier movements for mental health deinstitutionalization, the article concludes that meaningful decarceration depends on explicitly contesting the political purposes of punishment, rather than relying on technocratic or market-oriented rationales alone.",

          "authors": "Christopher Berk",
          "abstract": "This article examines how institutional efforts to support “at-risk” youth shape identity, belonging, and civic self-understanding over time. Drawing on year-long ethnographic fieldwork and a unique ten-year follow-up study, it analyzes life inside a community boarding school designed to intervene systematically in the everyday cultural practices of primarily Black and Latino children. The school seeks to promote mobility and stability by inducing a condition of social liminality—a sustained sense of being “in between” home and institution—through highly structured routines, disciplinary systems, and norms of self-presentation.\n\nUsing an interpretive framework informed by work on total institutions, youth governance, and identity formation, the article shows how this strategy produces ambivalence rather than straightforward transformation. While students often adapt to institutional expectations and internalize messages about discipline, merit, and self-responsibility, they also develop secondary adaptations that reshape their relationships to family, community, and self. These adaptive responses persist into young adulthood, frequently generating a durable sense of disconnection from home communities even among those who “succeed” by institutional standards.\n\nThe article contributes to scholarship on race and politics, youth socialization, and the governance of poverty by shifting attention from overt programmatic goals to the micro-level processes through which authority, culture, and care are negotiated. It argues that well-intentioned youth interventions can reproduce forms of exclusion by weakening social ties and reconfiguring identity under conditions of prolonged institutional control. The findings raise broader normative and policy questions about educational reform, juvenile justice alternatives, and the ethics of institutional strategies that seek to manage identity rather than support collective belonging.",

          "authors": "Christopher Berk",
          "abstract": "Much contemporary penal policy operates through what Suzanne Mettler calls the submerged state: networks of tax expenditures, civil liability rules, and administrative regulations that quietly link public authority to private actors. This article argues that punishment in the United States is increasingly governed through such submerged penal policies, producing what I term the submerged prison state. These arrangements channel public resources toward crime control objectives while obscuring lines of responsibility, redistributing costs and benefits, and entrenching private interests beyond the reach of ordinary democratic oversight.\n\nDrawing on legislative analysis, judicial decisions, policy documents, and public opinion research, the article shows how submerged penal policies generate revenue for some actors, cut costs for others, and expand the carceral state without explicit public authorization. Because these policies rely on indirect mechanisms—such as tax credits, subsidies, and liability shields—they distort citizens’ perceptions of the scale, distributional consequences, and governance of punishment. The result is a politics of crime control marked by low visibility, weak accountability, and limited public learning, even as coercive state power expands.\n\nThe article situates the submerged prison state within broader debates on privatization, regulation, and democratic legitimacy, arguing that submerged governance poses distinctive risks to public trust and civic capacity. By obscuring how punishment is funded and administered, submerged penal policies undermine citizens’ ability to attribute responsibility, evaluate alternatives, and contest the organization of the carceral system. The article concludes by suggesting that exposing and politicizing these hidden policy instruments is a necessary condition for meaningful penal reform and democratic accountability in an era of mass incarceration.",

          "authors": "Christopher Berk",
          "abstract": "A common view in contemporary debates about punishment holds that penal law should be insulated from public influence. Democratic participation, critics argue, distorts criminal justice policy by amplifying fear, revenge, and moral panic, producing punitive outcomes divorced from legitimate penological purposes. This article critically examines that insulationist consensus. Drawing on political theory, philosophy of law, and empirical research on public opinion, policy feedback, and penal populism, it argues that the case for insulating punishment from democratic influence is both empirically overstated and normatively misguided.\n\nThe article analyzes a cluster of related claims commonly invoked by insulationists, focusing in particular on the idea that the public possesses a distinctive “taste for revenge” that undermines rational and just penal policymaking. It challenges this claim on three grounds. First, existing evidence does not support the view that lay publics are systematically more punitive than experts, nor that public punitiveness is uniquely irrational relative to other domains of democratic decision-making. Second, the article shows that phenomena such as moral panics, availability cascades, and penal populism reflect contingent institutional conditions rather than inherent defects of public participation. Third, it argues that public anger toward wrongdoing can possess normative significance, functioning as a form of moral judgment rather than mere pathology.\n\nThe article concludes by advancing an affirmative normative claim: insulating penal law from public influence can actively sustain injustice by suppressing morally salient forms of public judgment and responsibility. Rather than treating punishment as a domain that must be shielded from democracy, the article calls for greater attention to institutional designs that refine, channel, and structure public participation in penal policymaking. Reframing the problem in this way shifts the debate from whether the public should be involved in punishment to how democratic participation can be made compatible with rational, legitimate, and just penal law.",

          "abstract": "This article critically examines the U.S. Supreme Court’s reliance on a developmental approach to juvenile punishment in Miller v. Alabama and related Eighth Amendment cases governing juvenile life without parole (LWOP). While recent doctrine rests on the claim that adolescents are categorically less culpable than adults due to developmental immaturity, the article argues that this foundation is philosophically unstable and normatively incomplete. Appeals to developmental psychology, neuroscience, and age-based generalizations, the article shows, conflate empirical description with contested political and moral judgments about responsibility, punishment, and citizenship.\n\nDrawing on political theory, philosophy of law, and socio-legal scholarship, the article identifies two central weaknesses in the developmental framework. First, developmental arguments rely on empirically fragile assumptions about maturity, culpability, and the coherence of age categories, raising problems for proportional punishment and legal consistency. Second, they obscure the political status of children by treating childhood as a natural fact rather than a normative and institutional condition produced by democratic choices about participation, dependency, and exclusion.\n\nAs an alternative, the article reframes juvenile punishment through the lens of democratic legitimacy and fiduciary obligation. It argues that special treatment for children in the criminal law is best justified not by developmental science alone, but by the polity’s decision to deny children a full schedule of democratic rights while subjecting them to legal authority. To punish children as adults, on this view, is to reap the benefits of paternalism without bearing its accompanying political, social, and moral costs. The article concludes by suggesting that grounding juvenile justice in democratic obligation rather than development offers a more principled and stable basis for limiting extreme punishment while preserving the category of youth.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes a neglected historical experiment in prison democracy at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole in 1973, when incarcerated people assumed responsibility for key aspects of institutional governance following a prison officer strike. Drawing on extensive archival materials produced by civilian observers, incarcerated participants, and correctional staff, the article reconstructs how inmate participation, collective deliberation, and self-rule operated inside a maximum-security prison.\n\nThe article contrasts two competing interpretive frameworks. The dominant liberal account of punishment treats inmate participation as evidence of administrative breakdown or failed prison management, reinforcing the view that incarcerated people fall outside the democratic demos. Against this view, the article recovers a radical account that understands inmate self-governance as an instance of participatory democracy under conditions of custody. During the Walpole episode, prisoners elected representatives, managed labor and resources, resolved disputes, and enforced norms of order, challenging assumptions that democratic practices are incompatible with penal institutions.\n\nBy situating the Walpole experiment within broader debates on democracy and punishment, penal legitimacy, and the political consequences of incarceration, the article argues that inmate participation cannot be reduced to either disorder or managerial improvisation. Instead, the case illustrates how democratic practices may emerge within the carceral state and function as a form of civic education, raising broader questions about political exclusion, citizenship, and democratic accountability in systems of punishment.",

Drawing on harmonised data from the European Social Survey and International Social Survey Programme, the analysis employs Linear Probability Models and Diagonal Reference Models to disentangle the distinct effects of class origin, class destination, and mobility experience on support for redistributive policies. The findings reveal that, while individuals from less advantaged backgrounds and those in disadvantaged positions express stronger support for redistribution, intergenerational mobility introduces important asymmetries. Upwardly mobile individuals align with the less supportive preferences characteristic of their destination class, though traces of their working-class origins remain evident through higher support levels than the immobile salariat. Conversely, downwardly mobile individuals align more closely with the stronger support for redistribution of their new social groups, likely driven by exposure to economic insecurity and material interests. Crucially, these patterns stem not from mobility per se, but from the specific social contexts individuals encounter over the life course. The methodological contribution lies in applying Diagonal Reference Models to isolate mobility effects that standard linear models conflate.

One popular approach examines heterogeneity in sibling correlations by splitting samples according to parental or ancestral characteristics. A prominent example is estimating sibling correlations in children’s earnings stratified by parental earnings. What remains underappreciated, however, is that splitting the sample by social background abstracts from mean differences in children’s earnings by social background—differences that constitute an important channel of intergenerational reproduction. Drawing on a decomposition by Karlson and In (2024) and a procedure used in Hällsten and Kolk (2023), I show how these mean differences can be incorporated. Replicating a newly published Swedish study (Forsberg et al., 2025) that reports attenuating sibling correlations in children’s earnings at higher levels of parental earnings, I show that accounting for mean differences substantially alters the conclusions, yielding sibling correlations that instead increase with parental earnings.",

To address this, we draw on employment relationship theory and a trajectory variability perspective to contend that within-class trajectory similarity varies across classes. We employ mixed-effects models with heterogeneous variance components using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. We find that class outperforms occupational and post-class accounts at predicting typical wage trajectories. Crucially, the degree of trajectory similarity varies across classes. Salaried workers have the least similar trajectories in terms of entry wages and wage growth. Wage fluctuations are most pronounced for routine workers. Intragenerational class mobility is associated with wage levels but does not increase dissimilarity in wage trajectories. While class patterns in variability are similar for women and men, women experience greater growth and fluctuation variability than men. Our results suggest a mobility regime in which wage trajectories are grouped into large class categories but still exhibit significant differences in similarity.",

          "abstract": "So-called ‘predatory’ publishing is often framed as an issue of unethical journal practices, but this perspective overlooks deeper structural problems in scholarly communication. The reliance on blacklists as a primary solution to identifying questionable journals fails to acknowledge the complexity of academic publishing and the broader systemic issues that contribute to unethical or controversial publishing practices. These include not only so-called ‘predatory’ journals but also concerns such as ‘special issue-ization’ and the rise of paper mills. Furthermore, the strategies used by emerging open-access mega-publishers increasingly resemble those employed by traditional and hybrid publishers, demonstrating that questionable practices are not confined to a single category of journals. This research in progress critically examines the characteristics of journals labeled as so-called ‘predatory’ and questions the effectiveness of static blacklists in scholarly assessment. Using a dataset of 2,755 journals from Predatory Reports, we systematically analyze their ISSN registration, subject classifications, accessibility, financial models, editorial transparency, and indexing status. While we recognize the limitations of blacklists, this dataset provides a basis for exploring broader patterns in academic publishing. Preliminary findings reveal that 24% of the journals became inaccessible after being listed, suggesting that some publishers shut down or rebrand to evade scrutiny. While ISSN registration is not mandatory, 13% of the journals in the dataset do not have one, which may indicate variations in registration practices. The geographical distribution of these journals is concentrated in India (31.45%), Switzerland (30.17%), and the United States (21.36%). This distribution highlights the global nature of these practices, spanning a range of publication models. The study also finds that 71% of these journals charge Article Processing Charges (APCs), while 23.7% fail to disclose APCs before submission, creating financial uncertainty for authors. Rather than indiscriminately covering all fields, many journals now focus on STEM disciplines. These findings underscore the need for more nuanced, criteria-based evaluation frameworks that account for the complexities of scholarly publishing, moving beyond binary categorizations of journals as ‘predatory’ or legitimate.",

          "abstract": "Empirical research in the social sciences is often interested in understanding actor stances; the positions that social actors take regarding normative statements in societal discourse. In automated text analysis applications, the classification task of stance detection remains challenging. Stance detection is especially difficult due to semantic challenges such as implicitness or missing context but also due to the general nature of the task. \nIn this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable stance detection in a generalized (non-domain, non-statement specific) form. Specifically, we test a variety of different general prompt chains for zero-shot stance classifications.\nOur evaluation data consists of textual data from a real-world empirical research project in the domain of sustainable urban transport. For 1710 German newspaper paragraphs, each containing an organizational entity, we annotated the stance of the entity toward one of five normative statements. \nA comparison of four publicly available LLMs show that they can improve upon existing approaches and achieve adequate performance. However, results heavily depend on the prompt chain method, LLM, and vary by statement. Our findings have implications for computational linguistics methodology and political discourse analysis, as they offer a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in performing the complex semantic task of stance detection. We strongly emphasise the necessity of domain-specific evaluation data for evaluating LLMs and considering trade-offs between model complexity and performance.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding spirituality as a psychological orientation embedded in social and cultural systems of meaning. Psychology has long struggled to define and operationalize spirituality in a manner that preserves conceptual clarity while accommodating its experiential and motivational diversity. Existing approaches often fragment spirituality across trait-based measures, coping frameworks, or institutional religious constructs, limiting integration across clinical, cognitive, and personality research. This article presents an integrative theoretical framework for the spiritual mindset, conceptualized as a dynamic psychological orientation characterized by meaning-making, self–transcendence, epistemic openness, and significance regulation. Drawing on research from psychology of religion and spirituality, motivational psychology, cognitive science, and clinical theory, the framework synthesizes prior findings into a coherent model that accounts for both adaptive and maladaptive expressions of spirituality. The model clarifies boundary conditions between spirituality and religiosity, delineates mechanisms through which spiritual orientations influence cognition and behavior, and identifies pathways through which spiritual meaning-making may contribute to psychological growth or vulnerability. The framework is intended as a standalone theoretical contribution that consolidates existing literatures while offering testable claims to guide future empirical research.",

          "abstract": "Comparisons between human and synthetic speech reveal that prosodic differences manifest primarily in how pitch develops over time rather than in static acoustic properties. This study investigates how human and synthetic intonation differ in Venezuelan Spanish by analyzing the temporal organization of fundamental frequency (F0) contours in declarative and interrogative sentences. The analysis is based on data from the HABLA corpus, which contains utterances produced by human speakers paired with multiple synthetic realizations derived from identical sentence materials, allowing controlled comparisons across voice types. Time-normalized F0 contours were extracted and analyzed using generalized additive mixed models in order to capture differences in contour shape and temporal organization. In addition, linear mixed-effects models were employed to examine complementary token-level acoustic measures, including pitch range, global variability, and slope-based metrics. Across both sentence modalities, the results show that synthetic speech reproduces general intonational configurations compatible with sentence modality. However, systematic differences emerge in the temporal implementation of these patterns. Human speech exhibits greater internal differentiation and localized modulation across the utterance, particularly in linguistically salient sentence-final regions. Synthetic speech, by contrast, displays smoother and more temporally regularized contours, with reduced local variability and attenuated slope changes. Global measures of pitch range and whole-utterance variability show considerable overlap between the two voice types, indicating that divergence is not driven by global pitch amplitude or aggregate dispersion. Instead, the results demonstrate that differences are localized in the temporal organization of F0 across the utterance. These findings highlight the importance of contour-based, time-sensitive approaches for assessing prosodic realism in synthetic speech.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into academic workflows, presenting both opportunities and significant challenges to scholarly integrity. While issues of factual accuracy are widely discussed, a more subtle and dangerous failure mode is structural hallucination, where LLM-generated content, despite being factually correct at a sentence level, distorts the relational structure of knowledge, misrepresents bibliographic landscapes, and undermines intellectual attribution. This paper argues for a shift from treating LLMs as uncontrolled artificial generators to incorporating them into an accountable research partnership. We propose a researcher- and instructor-centric governance framework based on a suite of lightweight, individually implementable computational protocols. By combining knowledge graph extraction with social network and bibliometric analysis, our methodology provides a transparent, quantitative toolkit for validating the structural and bibliographic integrity of LLM-assisted work. We demonstrate how network diagnostics, including centrality analysis and modularity, can serve as a ``hallucination stress test'' to detect conceptual distortions. We further detail protocols for citation integrity and bibliometric benchmarking to ground LLM outputs in real scholarly ecosystems. The paper outlines direct applications of this framework in high-stakes academic practices, including manuscript writing, syllabus design, and student assessment. Ultimately, we argue that methodological governance, rather than outright prohibition, is the most effective path toward a responsible and productive human-LLM collaboration in academia.",

One important aspect of inequalities is structural: marginalized groups are pushed to the periphery of the social networks and their access to resources becomes limited. While structural inequalities have been identified in social science literature, the interplay between different factors leading to structural marginalization has not been explored quantitatively in network science. Here, we propose a general network framework that allows taking into account the inequality of opportunities as a group-level fitness function. By tuning group fitness, we show that structural marginalization and rich clubs emerge due to the interplay between group membership preferences and inequalities in fitness. This paper demonstrates quantitatively that to eradicate structural marginalization, it is not enough to increase the minority size or their connectivity; it should be rather centered around strategically providing resources for disadvantaged groups.",

Accessibility is measured to these spaces through a route based framework, the Open Source Routing Machine, a high performance routing machine. Teenager data is found through the Decennial Census for those 15-17 years old and re-aggregated through a dasymetric analysis to points. Selected POIS such as coffee shops, parks, movie theaters and gyms are queried through the OverPass API to model a given 3rd place type. Statistics are then used to quantify accessibility between various modalities of travel, including walking, biking and driving. These distances are measured between rural, suburban and urban spaces delineated by the GHS-Degurba toolkit. There exists a stark contrast between urban/suburban and rural teenagers, leading to large discrepancies of travel times. Rural teens face travel times two to three times longer than urban peers, underscoring mobility inequities. Modality affects access as well greatly, with only select third places being accessible by foot even in more densely populated areas such as city centers.",

          "abstract": "This chapter argues that modern risk governance rests on a useful fiction: that technological safety can be rendered as objective fact. Within a “regime of functional objectivity,” institutions translate unruly hazards into standardized metrics that appear auditable, comparable, and decisive. This fiction works tolerably well because the uncertainties of most technologies can be bounded enough for regulation and coordination. The chapter contends, however, that this regime has an epistemic boundary, past which the assumptions that support objectivity claims can no longer be safely ignored. Beyond this threshold lies a “regime of fractured objectivity,” where extreme stakes and sparse empirical feedback demand implausible certainty, small modeling choices have outsized effects on outcomes, and routine heuristics of expertise lose traction.",

          "abstract": "This study examines religious affiliation and age group influences on virginity beliefs among Malaysian adults, corresponding to Gift, Stigma and Process metaphors. Malaysians are majorly religious. Religiously, premarital sex often stigmatized, because virginity considered as marriage gift except Buddhism towards secularism while non-religious are individual perspectives; young adults face virginity tensions; most older Malaysians hold traditional views on virginity. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 Malaysian adults, using adapted (VBS), measuring three frames via mean value (higher mean value, stronger frame endorsement). Respondents were divided into four religious affiliations (Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism) and No religious affiliation and six age groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65 or above) and. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests conducted, with pairwise comparisons conducted on significant frames. For religious affiliation, significant differences showed across all frames, for gift (H = 45.076, p &lt; 0.001, ƞ² ≈ 0.098) and stigma (H = 116.523, p &lt; 0.001, ƞ² ≈ 0.269), for both endorsement Hinduism showing highest while Buddhism lowest for both, and Christianity/Islam/non-religious affiliation intermediate. Significantly weak differences for process frame (H = 9.508, p = 0.050, ƞ² ≈ 0.013). Age groups showed significant differences for the gift frame (H = 45.375, p &lt; 0.001, ƞ² ≈ 0.097), lowest in 25-34, highest in 65 or above and significant differences for the stigma frame (H = 132.216, p &lt; 0.001, ƞ² ≈ 0.31), highest in 35-44 and lowest in 25-34 while age groups showed no significant differences for the process frame (H = 9.135, p = 0.104, ƞ² ≈ 0.0099). To conclude, this study among Malaysians found that gift and stigma frames varied with religious affiliation and age groups, weakly varied process frames for religious affiliation. While stable process frames among age groups suggested a more universal developmental perspective on virginity.",

          "authors": "RALPH RENDELL TOLEDO",
          "abstract": "Public administration systems have intensified accountability and oversight to address corruption, inefficiency, and misuse of public resources. These developments have reinforced an audit society in which verification and performance control increasingly shape everyday administrative routines. Although scholarship widely documents proceduralism, risk aversion, and compliance-oriented behavior under audit-intensive regimes, it has paid limited attention to the behavioral mechanism through which these outcomes are systematically produced.\nThis paper develops the Fear-Based Decision-Making Framework, positioning fear as an institutionalized mechanism linking audit culture and asymmetric accountability to conservative administrative behavior. Using theory-driven conceptual synthesis across Audit Culture Theory, Risk Aversion Theory, and Behavioral Public Administration, the analysis integrates evidence from peer-reviewed literature and institutional reports, with comparative attention to Western and ASEAN governance contexts.\nThe synthesis shows that expanding audit regimes tend to redefine accountability around documentation and procedural defensibility, encouraging anticipatory compliance and narrowing discretionary space. Conservative administrative behavior commonly manifests as rigid rule adherence, documentation inflation, defensive standardization, and discretion avoidance, reflecting loss-avoidance incentives under conditions of retrospective scrutiny.\nThe framework specifies five-part typology of fear: anticipatory, sanction, reputational, interpretive, and institutionalized, and explains how ASEAN scholarship often masks fear-driven behavior through proxy framings such as capacity and compliance narratives. By making fear analytically explicit, the paper reframes conservative administration as an accountability design problem and provides a basis for developing testable propositions and governance reforms that protect integrity without systematically constraining discretion and judgment.",

We study electoral effects of moratoria on homeowners insurance nonrenewals in wildfire-exposed areas in California. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find null effects on support for incumbents. To explain, we develop a framework of experience-based accountability for policy responses to persistent risks. We argue that reward depends on perceived sufficiency: voters evaluate the policy relative to the history of local disruption. Consistent with this, we find modest electoral rewards where prior insurance disruption was limited, but none where it was chronic. Survey evidence shows that, before the policy, residents of high-disruption areas held more negative and more settled evaluations of the governor. We offer a framework for the politics of adaptation in which electoral reward depends on perceived sufficiency: whether the intervention is viewed as durable enough to match the persistence of climate risks.",

Building on these findings, the paper contributes to discussions on scaling PD by exploring how PD can attend to vertical inequities by: (i) building critical data centre literacy; (ii) fostering transparency in sustainability governance; and (iii) broadening dominant visions of data centre futures to include community aspirations.

This article engages with key findings from the empirical literature on the Indian experience to unpack the complex relationship between sex trafficking and sex work. Interpretations of “exploitation” in both fields are fluid and constantly negotiated in real-world scenarios. Policy measures intended to combat trafficking can inadvertently harm sex workers by increasing surveillance, restricting movement, and heightening vulnerability to exploitation, thus threatening their livelihoods.",

          "authors": "Alessio Lacchè",
          "abstract": "This dissertation investigates how capitalist globalisation undermines traditional local knowledge systems, focusing on the Indian ghani, an ancient artisanal method of producing edible oil. The decline of this practice is analysed within the broader context of Western-driven development, agri-food industrialisation, and liberalisation of the edible oil sector. The study examines epistemological tensions between traditional and modern knowledge, the sociocultural and economic significance of the ghani, and the extent to which artisanal practices can coexist with industrial production in contemporary India.\nA hybrid deductive–inductive approach was employed, combining a literature review with fieldwork conducted in India. This comprised two surveys allowing both quantitative and qualitative analysis of contributions from a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society, ghani workers, NGOs, industry representatives, and academics.\nFindings reveal declining visibility and practical knowledge of the ghani, yet also a strong sociocultural resonance. This paradox reveals a fading practice that continues to embody memory, identity, and resistance to the homogenisation of global models. Economically, small producers face severe disadvantages in competing with industrial plants and cheap imports, while niche markets provide only limited opportunities for survival. The analysis shows how industrial and policy frameworks structurally marginalise artisans, relegating them to peripheral or subordinated roles, while simultaneously rebranding elements of their cultural value for urban elite markets. This process of “eliticisation” risks detaching artisanal production from its community base, transforming a once accessible tradition into a niche commodity.\nThe study concludes that the decline of the ghani is emblematic of wider processes of epistemic injustice, whereby capitalist globalisation privileges industrial efficiency and consumerist appropriation over cultural continuity, social equity, and ecological sustainability. It calls for a reimagined food system in which artisanal and industrial modes of production are integrated on more equitable terms. Such an approach would recognise the cultural and ecological contributions of traditional practices while harnessing the capacities of modern industry, generating hybrid models that are both more socially just and environmentally resilient. Safeguarding institutions like the ghani is thus not a nostalgic exercise but a vital step towards building plural, inclusive, and sustainable futures.",

          "abstract": "This paper employs a novel approach in applying the cheap talk signalling game to study the EU accession game of the 10 Central and Eastern European states that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007. The interdisciplinary application of a Bayesian game to international relations reveals the strategic interactions between the Union and applicant states in the light of the Copenhagen criteria and the unprecedented challenges countries faced during the post-Communist transition since 1989. The paper first presents the historical background about the EU accession process, debates on EU conditionality and existing game-theoretical approaches, before presenting the timeline and data on accession and reform speed of applicant states from 1989 to 2007. The model applies a signalling game to the negotiations process where the European Commission’s annual progress reports are seen as costless, unverifiable and observable signals to the applicant states about their final EU accession speed. It is demonstrated that possible equilibria outcomes can be uninformative or informative, depending on the players’ divergence of interests with regards to reform speed. Furthermore, the model is used to explain the outcomes seen in three ex-post case studies, taking into account additional domestic and external factors that shaped the varying outcomes of accession and reform speeds in the two EU enlargement waves in the 2000s.",

          "authors": "Moses Boudourides",
          "abstract": "Qualitative and mixed-methods research has long balanced interpretive depth against empirical scope. The rapid expansion of digital and textual data has intensified this tension, creating methodological pressures that challenge established qualitative workflows. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as a means of addressing these pressures by enabling large-scale textual processing and synthesis. However, their apparent fluency risks conflating linguistic coherence with interpretation, thereby obscuring judgment, accountability, and scholarly responsibility.\n\nThis paper argues that the methodological significance of LLMs for qualitative and mixed-methods research lies not in automation but in carefully governed computational assistance. Drawing on qualitative traditions centered on meaning, interpretation, and theory-building, the paper situates LLMs as infrastructural tools whose use must be governed by explicit research design, validation, and reflexive oversight. Particular attention is given to forms of failure that exceed factual error, including bibliographic distortion and loss of structural integrity in scholarly representation.\n\nThe analysis develops a framework organized around research design patterns, human judgment under computational assistance, and three interrelated dimensions of validity: interpretive, integrative, and bibliographic. Ethical implications concerning consent, representation, bias, and responsibility at scale are also examined. The paper concludes that responsible integration of LLMs requires strengthening—not relaxing—the methodological commitments that define qualitative and mixed-methods inquiry. Carefully governed computational assistance, rather than automation, provides the appropriate orientation for incorporating computational assistance while preserving interpretive rigor.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how couples’ relative resources and gender ideology shape women’s exposure to method-level burdens embedded in contraceptive methods in Germany. Contraceptive labor is conceptualized as the physical, financial, and psychosocial costs and risks structurally embedded in contraceptive methods and unequally distributed between women and men. Using nationally representative data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA), we assign partnered women aged 18–49 a method-specific Contraceptive Labor Score (CLS) capturing these structural burdens. Regression analyses show limited support for resource-based explanations: relative employment is not associated with women’s exposure to method-level contraceptive burdens, while women who are more highly educated than their partners are more likely to be exposed to methods with higher CLS values. In contrast, the gender ideology hypothesis holds: women with traditional gender beliefs face higher method-level burdens than egalitarian women. Supplementary analyses using contraceptive efficacy as an alternative outcome show that exposure to method-level burdens does not fully correspond to contraceptive effectiveness. By linking couple-level inequalities to structural characteristics of contraceptive methods, this study extends research on the gendered division of unpaid work to reproductive labor and highlights the role of institutionalized contraceptive arrangements in sustaining women’s disproportionate responsibility for fertility control.",

Most - if not all - autocracies are not ideologically neutral, but can be ascribed to ideological “brands” (Left/Right). These, in turn, serve as powerful heuristic cues in party competition. Combining insights from signaling theory and mnemonic politics, we argue that party elites in new democracies will try to distance themselves from the previous dictator’s ideological side in pursuit of legitimacy and in line with a spatial competition framework. Consistently, we show evidence of asymmetric fragmentation in the party systems of both former Left- and Right-Wing regimes, with fewer parties located on the dictator’s side. This difference persists in time, waning as party systems consolidate. Our analysis shows how such an escape from the stigma has substantive implications for the average ideological slant of the party system and its polarization.",

Existing evidence documents shifts in public opinion and party supply, but cannot distinguish genuine preference change from stigma attached to former regimes. We address this by focusing on the actors most vulnerable to such stigma: parties aligned with the Dictator’s ideological Side (DS). If backlash is genuine, parties’ policy platforms and the heuristics signaling them should shift in tandem; if stigma operates, heuristic signals should move more than policy. To isolate this divergence, we compare parties’ names - highly visible yet non-binding cues - to manifesto-based ideological positions. In a preregistered survey, 988 UK-based respondents guessed the ideology of 1,604 parties from 53 countries using only their English-translated names. Names are markedly less informative about \"true\" ideology in post-authoritarian regimes than in mature democracies; a gap driven by DS parties, systematically perceived as more centrist than their manifestos indicate.",

          "abstract": "This paper draws on process-relational perspectives to present an understanding of socio-environmental problems not as obstacles but as modes of existence. We argue that engaging with problems in this way unlocks their potential to be transformative, rather than merely resolving them. But how can those who set up and engage with processes of transformative change unlock this potential? This brings us to the topic of theorizing, as we argue that theorizing is an integral and fundamental part of engaging with problems. In this paper we develop an approach to theorizing for transformative collective action based on two key aspects: “Time”, building on Gilles Deleuze, and the “Complex We”, building on Marisol de La Cadena. As to the first, we explore how the past and future condition our understanding of problems, contrasting a linear, sequential view of time with a process-relational one where past and future are contracted in the present and are continuously reconfigured via processes of difference and repetition. As to the second, we introduce the \"complex we\", an emergent subjectivity as the agent of theorizing as that which supports reconfiguration of the past and the future. Together, these two aspects open up the transformative potential of socio-environmental problems beyond what could be conceptualized on the basis of linear time. We apply our approach to theorizing to a research project in Southern France, where problems such as tensions and conflicts over water availability are explored collaboratively. The paper concludes by discussing the strengths and limitations of our approach.",

First, a census of the 2,675 articles, totaling 15,926,460 words, is analyzed to establish the percentage of scholarship related to social media, what methodologies are used to study social media, and how social media interacts with other topics within public relations. Second, a subset of 666 articles that heavily emphasize social media are examined in order to identify the key social media topics within public relations scholarship.

          "abstract": "This study investigates how different types of social interactions are reflected in the archaeological record, specifically analyzing the extent to which artifacts can serve as proxies for past human interactions. Utilizing the ArchMatNet agent-based model (ABM), we simulate the social behaviors of small-scale communities and their material culture production, enabling a comparative analysis of social and material culture networks. The networks were compared using a graph correlation method, and the underlying network structures were compared using ERGMs (Exponential Random Graph Models). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures. The findings highlight the potential of ABMs as a methodological tool in archaeology to explore and validate methodological tools.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to explore the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) people in the current Mongolian health policies and provide an overview and identify the gaps for further inclusion. \nMethods: We conducted a scoping review of health policies and used critical discourse analysis (CDA) to explore how policy language constructs LGBTQI+ identities, representation in policies, and opportunities for inclusion. CDA assessed LGBTQI+ inclusion across three levels: textual, contextual, and societal. We included currently active, publicly accessible policies related to LGBTQI+ people’s health with no date restrictions, and searched throughout targeted government websites incorporated with reference search and expert consultation. \nResults: Final analysis included 24 documents and 25 different LGBTQI+ related terms were identified across. LGBTQI+ communities were mostly mentioned in sexually transmitted infection (STI) related policies, and the most common terms referred to LGBTQI+ communities were associated with high-risk sexual behaviour. Only one document specifically focused on the LGBTQI+ community, while four identified LGBTQI+ people as a priority group; however, all primarily referred to men who have sex with men (MSM), with some including transgender women. At the societal level, we identified three recurring framings (risk, vulnerability, and unfamiliarity) which reflected broader social norms and values about LGBTQI+ people.\nConclusion: LGBTQI+ inclusion in Mongolia’s health policies remains limited, and primarily centred on STI risk among MSM, and sometimes transgender women. This has resulted in the needs of other sub-communities being overlooked, rendering lesbian and bisexual women, transgender men, and intersex people largely invisible.",

          "abstract": "Preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE) research has long relied on profiling approaches that draw on demographic variables, ideological labels, and observable late-stage behaviours. These strategies have consistently performed poorly, and their limitations are further exposed in contemporary digital environments, where ideological identities are fluid, most individuals who engage with extremist content never mobilise, and a highly fragmented ideological landscape frustrates stable categorisation. In parallel, psychological research has identified mechanisms that help explain why only a minority escalate to violence, yet these mechanisms remain difficult to operationalise and test at scale. This Perspective argues that recent advances in artificial intelligence—broadly defined to include statistical learning, generative modelling, and decision-oriented optimisation—provide tools to close this operational gap when explicitly aligned with psychological theory. At the individual level, machine learning, natural language processing, and large language models enable measurement and forecasting from heterogeneous digital traces. At the interpersonal level, graph-based approaches may capture influence dynamics, exposure pathways, and the evolution of extremist social milieus. At the collective level, agent-based simulations and field experiments support explanatory and counterfactual analysis of mobilisation processes. We advance a hybrid research agenda that prioritises theory testing, mechanism evaluation, and carefully bounded intervention analysis over automated individualised profiling, advancing a more mechanistic, empirically grounded, and scalable science of P/CVE.",

Results show that higher Native spirituality and identity were correlated with lower depression and anxiety, as well as lower perceived social support.

          "abstract": "This study investigates expenditure of European parties in referendum campaigns. Previous work exploring why parties initiate referendums hints at the importance of subsequent campaigns to parties, but theoretical insights regarding party behavior in campaigning contexts are fragmented and limited. We argue that party expenditure indicates the extent of their engagement, and identifying explanatory factors can offer insights into underlying strategic goals driving parties in their behavior. Drawing on referendum instrumentalization literature and existing empirical studies, we propose a framework with three strategic factors and corresponding hypotheses. These are tested using official expenditure data for 47 parties campaigning in 24 referendums in eight European countries through bivariate and multivariate analysis. Our findings mainly suggest that parties see referendum campaigns as avenues for image-building, spending more on average when they initiate them and when referendums are publicly salient. Additionally, parties seemingly prioritize elections, while spending limits are ineffective in curbing expenditure.",

          "abstract": "From 1961 in Italy the average number of individuals per household decreased from 3.6 to 2.4 in 2011 and to 2.2 in 2022, and the proportion of households with six or more members or more from 14.4% to 1.4% and 1.2% respectively. Large families, particular those with four or more children, are often associated with poverty, but, given their rarity, they are extremely difficult to study. They are essentially unknown, especially in contexts of very low fertility, such as Italy. We aim to characterize families with four or more children (largest-large families) and to identify the socio-demographic factors that distinguish them from families with one or two children (small families) which represent the prevailing model. To do this, we apply multivariate logistic models to microdata from the 2011 Italian Population and Housing Census. This is the last Census conducted in Italy on universal population basis. Sample surveys are usually not large enough to enable in-depth analyses of the processes underlying the formation of this type of families. The census source also allows analyses to be conducted separately for the native and non-native populations. Results suggest a socio-economic polarization of largest-large families and a negative association with women’s education among both native and non-native populations. Among Italian couples only, re-partnering is a predictor of having a largest-large family and couples in which the male partner is self-employed are more likely to have four or more children than those with employed men. Regional cultural and institutional differences also play a non-negligible role.",

          "abstract": "Economic inequality in the U.S. has risen sharply over the past three decades, overlapping with persistent racial, ethnic, and spatial segregation to produce entrenched neighborhood-level disparities in health. Youth are especially vulnerable to these neighborhood effects, facing disproportionate risks from adverse environmental conditions. This study examines whether neighborhood disadvantage is associated with both increased prevalence of youth health risks and lower provision of green infrastructure across four U.S. cities (Houston, TX; Minneapolis, MN; Prince George’s County, MD; San Francisco, CA). We further test whether green space moderates the relationship between disadvantage and youth health.\nCensus-tract analyses show that neighborhood disadvantage is strongly correlated with higher prevalence of obesity, asthma, and poor mental health among youth. Disadvantaged neighborhoods had significantly less park space and tree canopy cover, and areas with limited green space showed higher risks for all three health concerns. Greater tree canopy was specifically associated with reduced obesity risk. Crucially, interaction analyses revealed that higher proportions of park space substantially weakened the negative effects of disadvantage across all health outcomes.\nFindings underscore systemic underinvestment in green infrastructure in disadvantaged neighborhoods and highlight the protective potential of urban green space as a public health strategy for vulnerable youth.",

          "abstract": "Although globally it is acknowledged that LGBTQ+ communities face disproportionately high rates of suicidal thoughts and attempts when compared to their heterosexual counterparts, less is known about the suicide prevention needs of LGBTQ+ people. In response, UK suicide prevention policies have suggested that there needs to be tailored, prioritised and culturally appropriate methods of prevention employed. However, what these should, or even could, look like has been left undefined and unguided. To begin to address this, in this research I employed systematic mapping methods, identifying 79 services, groups and organisations providing suicide prevention to LGBTQ+ communities and engaging with 37 practitioner and facilitators for informal reflections on their service provisions in the UK. Reflecting critically on the findings of this, I explore the pathologising problematics and productive potentialities of expanding suicide prevention beyond the conventional disclosure-to-recovery, mental health model that dominates the landscape of suicide prevention both in the UK, and globally. I ultimately argue that the discomforting tension between the problematic and the productive may offer us fertile space to not only consider what LGBTQ+ suicide prevention is, but what all suicide prevention could be.",

          "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
          "abstract": "Anger has long been regarded as an adaptive emotion in human evolution, functioning \nas a mechanism for negotiation, deterrence, and the correction of unfair treatment. \nHowever, in contemporary societies characterized by dense institutional \narrangements and long-term social interaction, anger frequently manifests not as an \nadaptive response but as a source of interpersonal disruption, psychological insecurity, \nand harassment. Despite its apparent maladaptiveness, anger persists and, in some \nenvironments, proliferates. \nThis study proposes a novel theoretical framework, the Anger-as-Indulgence Model \n(AIM), which conceptualizes anger not as a mere emotional reaction or personality \ntrait, but as an emotional resource that is selected, consumed, and reproduced within \nsocio-ecological systems. Drawing on evolutionary psychology, behavioral economics, \nneuroscience, meme theory, and the author’s prior work on emotional contagion, \nformal sanction loops, and reverse selection, AIM explains how anger becomes \nrepeatedly chosen through immediate psychological rewards, reward expectations, \ninstitutional legitimation, and environmental selection pressure. \nCentral to this model is the redefinition of anger as an indulgent emotion analogous to \na consumer good: not physiologically necessary, yet repeatedly consumed due to its \nreliable short-term rewards, despite long-term social costs. Through anonymized \ncase studies, this paper demonstrates that the indulgent transformation of anger is \nnot dependent on individual personality traits, but on isomorphic socio-ecological \nconfigurations across different times, locations, and occupational contexts. \nThe findings suggest that conventional interventions focusing on emotional regulation \nor moral instruction are insufficient as long as anger remains embedded in \nreward-generating institutional arrangements. Instead, effective intervention requires \nreconfiguring environments so that anger no longer produces psychological or \norganizational rewards. By shifting the analytical focus from managing anger to \nrepositioning it within socio-ecological systems, this study offers a unified explanation \nfor anger dependence, contagion, institutionalization, silence, and avoidance, and \nprovides a structural foundation for addressing anger-related dysfunctions in modern \norganizations and societies.",

          "authors": "Tarnell Brown",
          "abstract": "Individuals released from jails and prisons face extremely high risks of fatal overdose and reincarceration, yet many jurisdictions continue to underprovide medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), recovery housing, and supervised consumption services. At the same time, recovery residences and diversion courts are expanding without a clear framework for institutional design. This paper develops a mechanism-design model of harm-reduction policy at the interface of criminal justice and community treatment. A public funder chooses a funding regime and certification rules, diversion judges set the stringency of supervision and treatment conditions, recovery residence providers decide whether to operate abstinence-only or MOUD-inclusive housing, and high-risk individuals choose whether to comply or relapse. The model yields a punitive equilibrium, supported by abstinence-only funding and strict conditions, and a harm-reduction equilibrium under MOUD-inclusive funding and flexible conditions. Using effect sizes from Rhode Island’s statewide corrections MOUD program, Massachusetts’ jail-based MOUD pilots, and recent recovery housing evaluations, we show that the harm-reduction equilibrium is Pareto-superior for funders, judges, providers, and high-severity residents, yet the punitive equilibrium can remain risk-dominant because of political and informational frictions. We then embed the game in a computational social choice framework: stakeholders hold multi-dimensional preferences over policy bundles—combinations of funding rules, certification standards, diversion guidelines, and overdose prevention interventions such as supervised consumption sites—and social choice is constrained by justice-based requirements that rule out policies generating avoidable lethal risk or systematic exclusion of MOUD patients from housing and treatment. The analysis characterizes which harm-reduction mechanisms are implementable as equilibrium outcomes of the institutional game while respecting these constrained social preferences, and it identifies simple instruments—MOUD-inclusive funding commitments, performance-based transparency, and structured diversion defaults—that can move jurisdictions from punitive to harm-reduction equilibria within existing legal constraints.",

Insgesamt bleiben die Einstellungen gegenüber Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) in der Bevölkerung ambivalent, zeigen jedoch leichte Verschiebungen hin zu größerer Informiertheit, differenzierteren Bewertungen und steigender Akzeptanz, insbesondere unter Erwerbstätigen. Diese berichten häufiger persönlichen Nutzen durch KI, während die Wahrnehmung gesellschaftlicher Risiken verhaltener positiv ausfällt. In der Arbeitswelt bleibt die affektive Haltung gegenüber KI stabil positiv, zugleich entwickeln sich einzelne kognitive Bewertungen moderat in Richtung positiverer Einschätzungen, etwa in Bezug auf Einkommen, Karrierechancen und Kompetenzanforderungen. Die Jobunsicherheit bleibt insgesamt niedrig; die allgemeine Sorge vor einer KI-bedingten Ersetzung menschlicher Arbeit nimmt leicht ab. Parallel dazu steigt die berufliche Nutzung von KI deutlich, insbesondere von generativer KI, und weitet sich von routinisierten hin zu komplexeren und kreativen Aufgaben aus. Insgesamt deuten die Ergebnisse auf einen graduellen Übergang von Unsicherheit zu stärker erfahrungsbasierter Auseinandersetzung mit KI hin, wobei KI zunehmend als kollegiale Unterstützung wahrgenommen wird, ohne dass bestehende Ambivalenzen vollständig aufgelöst sind.",

          "abstract": "Background: Improving students’ diet is a public health priority, yet interventions often fail to address the structural barriers students face, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. This study aimed to assess how students involved in a co-creation process (i.e. a student citizens’ assembly) conceptualise and prioritise solutions to improve students’ access to healthier, more climate-friendly diets.  \nMethods: This participatory research took place at a French university (Sorbonne Paris Nord) located in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs of Paris. A student citizens’ assembly was conducted with the aim to co-create concrete proposals that would enhance students’ access to sustainable diets and physical activity. The assembly involved 27 students randomly selected among a pool of volunteers. Over three days in November 2024, students received awareness-raising and training, deliberated among themselves then with institutional and local stakeholders, and formulated proposals. For each proposal, students were asked to rate anonymously their approval on a 10-point scale. Proposals related to diet (i.e. not physical activity) were analysed a posteriori using two complementary frameworks: the DONE framework classifying determinants of diet (individual, interpersonal, environmental /policy) and the FAO dimensions of sustainable diets (health, ecological, socioeconomic, cultural). \nResults: Overall, 31 proposals were formulated, of which 77% targeted environmental and policy determinants of diet (e.g. institutional regulations, university policies, food assistance solutions, improved food affordability and availability, food labelling). Other proposals referred to individual (19%) and interpersonal determinants (3%). In addition, 39%, 29%, 23% and 10% proposals addressed the health, socio-economic, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively. Mean approval ratings (SD) for each proposal ranged from 6.7 (4.0) to 9.7 (0.9), with a mean (SD) value for all proposals of 8.6 (0.7). Proposals addressing the socio-economic dimension received the highest approval ratings (mean [SD] 9.0 [0.6], vs 8.4 [0.6], 8.4 [0.8] and 7.9 [0.4] for the health, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively).\nConclusion: The predominance of environmental and policy measures targeting economic access to food highlights the importance of co-creation and its value to align interventions with participants’ needs and expectations. One major challenge that warrants further investigation is the capacity of stakeholders to implement such proposals, and to evaluate their effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "The term ‘paper park’ is widely used to label protected areas that only exist ‘on paper’. Identifying and rectifying paper parks could be critical for producing ‘effectively conserved and managed […] systems of protected areas’, a core component of Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3. However, the term is not well defined and often applied to cases more accurately described as protected areas with low management effectiveness. This inconsistency is problematic because areas where management interventions are entirely absent (true paper parks) fundamentally differ in conceptualisation, monitoring, and required solutions from those where management is insufficient or poorly executed (ineffective management). To address this, here we propose a new paper park definition as “a site that has been legally or otherwise designated as a protected area, but where management interventions have been absent for at least 5 years”. We present a decision tree to identify paper parks and discuss how they differ from other types of conservation areas. We suggest addressing the problem by measuring the extent of paper parks, investigating the causes of absent management, and prioritising investment to implement effective interventions. Without such work, there is a risk that Target 3 will perversely incentivise the creation of more paper parks.",

          "authors": "Benoît de Courson; Willem Frankenhuis; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "People in situations of poverty tend to heavily discount the future. Despite robust evidence, the theoretical literature lacks satisfying models to explain why. Existing theories often invoke urgent needs to explain impatience, this intuition is not sufficient: in persistent poverty, one may need resources tomorrow as much as today. We show that previous models assume that poverty is temporary and improvement is expected, and predict discounting only under this condition, which is rarely realistic. Here, we present the first model showing that time discounting can be rational in persistent poverty. We propose a two-period model in which basic needs are captured by a 'desperation threshold' -- a critical resource level above which agents aim to stay. In four stylized scenarios, we show analytically that agents discount the future near the threshold and are patient at intermediate resource levels. In line with the empirical record, time discounting increases on both sides of the threshold, while risk taking is polarized -- higher below the threshold, lower above. Unlike existing accounts, our explanation does not rely on assuming a future improvement in financial situation. Rather, it predicts a U-shaped effect of future expectations, with greater time discounting if the future will be either much better or much worse than the present, which can reconcile economic theory with ethnographic findings. Our findings suggest that addressing material scarcity directly, rather than attempting to alter future orientation, may be the most effective way to reduce time discounting and align behavior with true preferences.",

In a highly competitive Islamic banking industry, an effective marketing strategy is essential for sustaining customer loyalty. This research employs a quantitative approach, using purposive sampling of 100 customers from five BSI branches in Banda Aceh. Data were collected through a Likert-scale questionnaire and analyzed using multiple linear regression and path analysis. The results indicate that while factors such as place, human resources, and physical evidence contributed to customer loyalty, ineffective promotion and slow service processes reduced it. Furthermore, customer satisfaction plays a mediating role, strengthening the link between the marketing mix and loyalty. These findings emphasize the need for BSI Banda Aceh Branch to improve their service efficiency, enhance human resource quality, and adopt more targeted promotional strategies to retain customers in the long term. Enhancing service efficiency and refining marketing strategies will allow BSI Banda Aceh to maintain a competitive edge in the evolving Islamic banking industry.",

          "abstract": "Intersex individuals are born with sex characteristics - such as sexual anatomy, reproductive organs, or hormonal or chromosomal patterns - that do not fit typical binary definitions of male or female bodies. This paper provides the first comprehensive population-level evidence on age-specific mortality and cause of death patterns in the intersex population compared to the endosex (i.e., not intersex) population. The study relies on diagnostic codes in Danish administrative health data to observe intersex traits at the individual level across the entire population, identifying more than 1.2% of the Danish population as intersex. Results reveal higher mortality among intersex males in early life, driven by deaths related to congenital disorders, but deaths in childhood remain rare in absolute numbers among both intersex and endosex individuals. Distinctive mid- to late-life survival patterns emerge whereby intersex males' survival probabilities outpace those of endosex males, instead converging towards that of endosex females. At the same time, the survival probability of intersex females is lower than that of endosex females, converging towards that of endosex males. Whilst substantial heterogeneity exists across intersex subgroups, overall intersex mortality patterns - like intersex sex characteristics - fall in between the typical patterns of males and females.",

          "abstract": "How do voters in competitive authoritarian systems learn about opposition parties? Electing opposition parties is risky when their governance quality is uncertain, but voters can reduce this uncertainty by observing and learning from neighboring sub-national governments’ experiences with opposition leadership. I examine how opposition governance in neighboring municipalities affects support for opposition candidates in municipal elections in 1990s Mexico. Using a close-election regression discontinuity design, I find that municipalities with exogenous exposure to PRD-governed neighbors increased their support for the PRD by 12-15 percentage points compared to municipalities with PRI-governed neighbors. This effect is specific to the PRD and does not extend to the PAN, a better-known opposition party. These findings provide insight into how governance information spreads across electoral borders and highlight that opposition parties are not necessarily perceived equally in competitive authoritarian systems.",

          "authors": "Adriel Ekozin; Lydia Chryss-Afiawari; John Oghenekevwe Ifaka",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between climate change and pastoralist–farmer conflict in Mali’s Dogon–Fulani communities within the wider Sahel region. The problem addressed stems from the increasing environmental pressures (such as drought, desertification, and erratic rainfall) that intensify resource competition amid fragile governance and deep-seated ethnic tensions. The study’s objectives were to examine how climate change contributes to these conflicts, identify key conflict drivers, and propose strategies to mitigate their impacts. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, 56 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024 were purposively selected from the Google Scholar database. Data were thematically analysed under three categories: environmental pressures, institutional responses, and conflict transformation mechanisms. The findings reveal that environmental degradation acts as a conflict catalyst only where weak governance and social exclusion prevail. Statistics from the region indicate that mean annual temperatures have increased significantly since the 1960s, while rainfall in the Sahel has become increasingly erratic, leading to a 40% loss of livestock in past extreme drought cycles and displacing hundreds of thousands in central Mali. Yet, communities that maintain inclusive local mediation structures experience fewer violent clashes. The study concludes that sustainable peace in the Sahel depends on integrating environmental resilience with effective governance. It recommends strengthening the rule of law, enhancing state capacity, adopting climate-smart and technology-driven agricultural practices, and transitioning to modern ranching systems to reduce farmer–herder competition and build long-term regional stability.",

          "abstract": "Background: We describe the protocol for the Epi-Q (EpiGame-Quarantine) Study, using an experimental epidemic game (“epigame”) to investigate quarantine-related attitudes and behaviors. Epigames are field experiments in which participants make behavioral decisions during a simulated epidemic in naturalistic settings. In this study, the epigame is operationalized via a smartphone app that simulates transmission of a 'digital pathogen' over Bluetooth, allowing for real-time data capture. This approach offers a novel tool for observing decision-making within social networks under dynamic risk and normative pressure. Consequently, it enables the collection of empirical data on the social, psychological, and practical determinants of compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine. Unlike existing methods that rely on static cross-sectional surveys or observational data, Epi-Q captures dynamic decision-making within real-life networks. This is crucial for studying behaviors like quarantine, where compliance is not merely an individual calculation but is shaped by pre-existing and evolving social structures, including peer pressure, trust in institutions, and exposure to misinformation. Epi-Q employs a quantitative mixed-method design to untangle the complex interplay between social norms and risk perception, along with their interactions on behavioral responses. \nMethods/design: We will recruit at least 150 participants via a custom-made smartphone app capable of measuring proximity between then using Bluetooth. We will randomly allocate these participants (via network-aware clustering) into a 2×2 experimental design: (i) local vs global risk information; (ii) local vs global norms. ‘Local’ information is defined as data derived from a participant's first-degree contacts in the Bluetooth proximity network, while 'Global' information refers to aggregate data from the entire experimental group. Participants will play the epigame over a period of several weeks (one to three), making daily quarantine decisions within the app that incur costs (loss of in-game points for infection, loss of opportunities while quarantining) and benefits (points from remaining active), while Bluetooth proximity sensing samples the contact network of participants and drives simulated transmission of a digital pathogen among the phones. Data collection will include in-app behavioral logs, pre- and post-game surveys (attitudes, risk perception), and optional qualitative debrief interviews with a subset of participants. Primary outcomes will be frequency and timing of quarantine adoption; secondary outcomes will include attitudinal shifts, perceived risk, and the consistency of real-world vs in-game intentions. Analyses will include mixed-method synthesis, difference-in-differences modeling, social network analysis, and correlation of survey and behavioral measures to assess external validity.",

          "abstract": "Low health literacy, an established risk factor of poor health outcomes, may be applied to better understand individual health related decisions and actions. Health literacy can help explain why and how people make prevention and treatment choices and is particularly salient in developing interventions among populations experiencing health disparities. American Indians experience the highest smoking and tobacco use rates of any racial/ethnic group in the United States, yet health literacy has never been examined for association with tobacco use. In this project, we developed and tested an instrument to assess tobacco health literacy among American Indians using a long (THL-L) or short (THL-S) form. The instrument was developed to measure prose, numeracy, and document literacy across five domains (health risks, addiction, cessation, environmental tobacco smoke, and cost). We tested both a long (25 question) and a short form (12 question) by administrating them to American Indians aged 18+ years attending community events at both urban and reservation communities in Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota (THL-L: N=205; THL-S: N=114). Descriptive statistics were computed for all scored THL-L questions and demographic characteristics. The average score on the long form instrument was 17.76 (SD = 3.53); for the short form, it was 8.18 (SD = 2.17). THL-S scores show no statistically significant difference (p=0.16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Both long- and short-form instruments appropriately assessed tobacco health literacy among American Indians. Neither measure includes traditional tobacco as a domain or item, suggesting this index may, with further testing, be appropriate for other populations.",

          "abstract": "Unlike gender or race, class background is rarely a focus of research on career progression, or of DEI efforts in elite occupations. Should it be? In this paper we document a large class gap in career progression in one occupation—U.S. tenure-track academia—using parental education to proxy for class background. First-generation college graduates are 10% less likely to be tenured at an R1, are tenured at institutions ranked 11% lower, earn 3% less, and report 5% lower job satisfaction, than their former Ph.D. classmates (from the same institution and field) with a parent with a non-Ph.D. graduate degree. Neither selection out of academia nor different preferences explain this gap; differential research productivity also plays little role. Instead, likely drivers are differences in cultural and social capital. We also find a class gap in career progression for Ph.D.s who work in industry, suggesting this phenomenon generalizes outside academia. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "abstract": "Problems such as persistent inequality, institutional decay, performative governance, and large\nscale economic costs from global conflicts suggest a deeper structural flaw within the economic \nreasoning itself, one that cannot be adequately explained by technical inefficiencies or policy \nerrors alone. This paper conceptualizes miseconomics as the practice of conducting economic \nactivity that generates cumulative social harm through normalized societal losses, and \nmisaligned incentives that erode moral responsibility while remaining internally consistent \nwithin an institutional framework. Drawing on classical moral philosophy, normative \neconomic critiques, and cases from governance failures across multiple political systems, the \nstudy analyses moral entropy to describe a pattern of progressive institutional disorder. \nGovernmental failure is examined through the conceptual framework of Lazeez Fair \ngovernance, wherein symbolic, performative, and indulgent interventions substitute \nsubstantive reform, allowing dysfunction to persist despite visible action. The paper further \nillustrates these dynamics though global patterns of corruption, institutional capture, and the \nselected cases of proxy warfare, showing patterns through which costs appear externalized onto \nvulnerable populations while benefits accrue narrowly. It concludes that without a structural \nrealignment of incentives and a reintegration of moral responsibility into mainstream economic \nthought and governance- stability, sustainability, and development- risk remaining structurally \nunattainable. The central claim is that economic failure is not primarily a shortage of analytical \ntools and normative ideologies, but a failure of moral alignment embedded within decision\nmaking systems. Recognizing and correcting miseconomics is therefore presented as a \nnecessary condition for restoring coherence between economic theory, development of society, \nand human wellbeing.",

Differences between the two surveys’ MMR measurements are largest in the socioeconomically disadvantaged states of north India.  We discuss possible sources of sampling and non-sampling error in the two surveys. We conclude that these new NFHS estimates should inform discourse about the burden of maternal mortality in India.",

Background:\nTotal fertility rates in Finland have declined sharply since 2010, reaching lowest-low levels in\nrecent years. This study complements previous, mostly register-based, research by focusing on\nyoung Finns’ fertility intentions and their self-reported rationales. Method: We analyzed survey\nresponses from 3,803 young Finns (aged 20–29) collected in 2021–2022, who evaluated how 39\nrationales influenced their fertility intentions, including postponement, not desiring (additional)\nchildren, or uncertainty. Exploratory factor analysis was used to group the rationales, and latent\nprofile analysis identified distinct groups of individuals with similar rationales. Multinomial logit\nmodels were then estimated to examine the associations between these profiles and fertility\nintentions. Results: We identified five latent profiles differing in their constellations of personal\nand partnership concerns, autonomy concerns, global concerns, and career-related concerns.\nPostponing childbearing was typical of the groups with moderate concerns over personal\nautonomy and career, who could also have experienced personal and partnership difficulties.\nIndividuals who intended to forgo childbearing entirely prioritized personal autonomy and global\nconcerns. Conclusions: Practical circumstances primarily drive the postponement of childbearing,\nwhile ideological motivations and lifestyle choices are more strongly associated with intentions to\nremain childless.",

          "abstract": "While the structural disadvantage and discrimination migrants face are well-documented, migrants’ perceptions of meritocracy and equality of opportunity remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap using a mixed-methods approach, combining data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), the European Social Survey (ESS), and in-depth qualitative interviews and group discussions (N = 47). Quantitative results indicate that first-generation migrants are significantly more likely than non-migrants to think German society is meritocratic and offers equal opportunities. In turn, they are more likely to tolerate large inequalities. Qualitative analysis reveals that this optimism stems from favorable comparisons with their countries of origin. This paper argues that migrant optimism, previously associated with educational expectations, extends beyond individual-level perceptions to encompass perceptions of society at large. While prior research has emphasized the motivational benefits of migrant optimism, this study highlights how it can lead migrants to legitimize inequalities, revealing more ambivalent political consequences.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how labeling AI-generated content (AIGC) influences users’ perceptions of authenticity in social media environments. Motivated by emerging global regulations mandating the disclosure of AI-generated media, we designed a pre-registered survey experiment to test two main questions: (1) Do AI labels reduce the perceived authenticity of AI-generated images? (2) Does exposure to labeled content affect perceived authenticity in unlabeled images (a potential spillover effect)? The pre-analysis plan and materials are available on OSF (see link below). We conducted a survey experiment with a German sample (N = 877) in which participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group without labels, a process-based label group (“AI-generated”), or a harm-based label group (“Misleading”). Participants viewed twelve Instagram-style posts, six of which contained AI-generated or AI-altered content. Perceived authenticity was measured by asking whether the depicted events actually occurred. Our results show that both labeling strategies significantly reduced perceived authenticity of AI-generated images, with average reductions of about 0.27 standard deviations. We also find evidence of an implied authenticity effect: exposure to labeled content slightly increased perceived authenticity in unlabeled images (about one-fifth the size of the direct labeling effect). Exploratory analyses indicate that internet skills and age are associated with perceived authenticity differences. By embedding labels in Instagram-style posts, our study increases ecological validity compared to earlier work focused on headlines or generic stimuli. Situated in Germany, a frontrunner in digital platform regulation, the findings provide rare non-U.S. evidence on AI labeling and contribute directly to ongoing policy debates.",

          "authors": "Jan Wetzel",
          "abstract": "Over a century after its publication, Max Weber’s The Protestant remains a foundational text for understanding not only the historical genesis of modern capitalism but also the subjectivity of contemporary occupational life. This enduring status is striking because Weber’s argument rests primarily on theological writings rather than on direct engagement with the (historical) occupational world. While recent economic history has produced a substantial body of empirical tests and refinements of Weber’s thesis, far less attention has been paid to his core claim that theological concepts helped shape distinctive work-oriented subjectivities. This article addresses that gap by examining art manuals produced for and by artisans during the Reformation era, with a particular focus on Nuremberg. By situating these manuals in their historical contexts, it demonstrates that their authors explicitly related their understandings of work to theological ideas, though in ways that depart from standard Lutheran assumptions. The manuals draw not only on Protestant sources but also on humanist traditions. Moreover, they frame the dissemination of artistic knowledge through print as a Christian obligation to enhance the community’s artistic productivity, thereby articulating an implicit logic of economic expansion that cannot be reduced to a Calvinist ethos.",

          "abstract": "The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) introduces, for the first time, a legal framework granting researchers access to data from very large online platforms and search engines. This represents a profound shift in how platform data can be obtained: access becomes a regulated right rather than a technical workaround. Yet the DSA’s promise of transparency depends on the ability of researchers to meet stringent legal and technical requirements for security, confidentiality, and data protection. Few researchers can do so individually.\nThis commentary argues that the emerging DSA regime makes research infrastructure a precondition for meaningful and lawful data access. Secure Processing Environments (SPEs) and other institutional arrangements can mediate between three actors — researchers, platforms, and Digital Services Coordinators — ensuring trust, compliance, and accountability. In this role, infrastructures become not just technical means but governance interfaces that translate regulatory obligations into practical research conditions.\nThe shift from ad hoc data collection to regulated access requires more than new rules; it demands a reorientation of the research community itself. Building and sustaining infrastructures is now integral to enabling independent, transparent, and reproducible platform research. The DSA, we suggest, inaugurates a new phase in the politics of data access — one in which infrastructures mediate the relationship between science, regulation, and the digital platforms that shape public life.",

Using longitudinal bibliometric data from Scopus covering more than 32 million researchers, this study provides a global assessment of how the pandemic disrupted international researcher mobility between 2020 and 2022. Pandemic-related “lost mobility” is estimated using counterfactual trend extrapolation based on pre-2020 trajectories. International researcher mobility fell short of expected levels by an estimated 14,703 movements (±2,791), corresponding to a 3.7% loss. Although observed mobility rebounded by 2022, it remained below counterfactual trends. Effects varied widely across countries and were asymmetric: losses in incoming mobility were strongly associated with destination-country COVID-19 policy stringency and political regime type, whereas outgoing mobility showed no comparable relationship. These findings underscore the institutionally mediated nature of scientific mobility during global crises.",

          "abstract": "Immigrants and their descendants constitute an increasing share of European populations, yet research on how immigrant background shapes the cohabitation experience remains limited. This study investigates how generational status at the individual level and national context at the macro level influence the likelihood of ever having cohabited. Our central proposition is that the diffusion of cohabitation among immigrants is more pronounced in countries where the practice is common and socially accepted among the native population. We analysed pooled data from the European Social Survey (ESS; 2002–2023), encompassing 66,017 respondents across 32 countries. Our findings provide evidence of an adaptation pattern: descendants of immigrants are significantly more likely to have ever cohabited than the first generation. Crucially, this generational difference does not vary systematically according to the prevalence of cohabitation among natives. The cohabitation context nonetheless significantly increases the likelihood of ever having cohabited, outweighing the influence of economic factors such as income inequality (Gini index). This suggests that the social and normative environment—the cohabitation context—is a primary driver of behavioural change. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that immigrant family formation is not merely a product of individual traits but is fundamentally shaped by the normative climate of the host country.",

We further examine the later socioeconomic outcomes of individuals who are more persistent in their educational goals.\nUtilizing longitudinal genetically informed register data from Finland, we analyze a sample of 6,101 individuals born 1987-1990 followed up until 2018. The study uses parental polygenic scores to assess the genetic endowment to high educational attainment (EDU-PGS) combined with information on application behavior (1,683 individuals experienced rejection) and socioeconomic variables. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models and discrete time hazard models are employed.\nOur findings indicate an intricate interplay of genetic endowments, income and education of the parents, (re-)application behavior, and early adulthood income and occupational status. Individuals with a higher EDU-PGS were more likely to reapply after rejection, suggesting a genetic component in persistence in educational goals and application behaviors beyond family background. Mental illness did not have an effect over and above other included indicators on stop applying, and there was no evidence for the presence of gene-environment interactions. Moreover, application behavior mediated the influence of the polygenic score on occupational status in early adulthood.\nThe study contributes to the broader equality of opportunity debate and shows how genes express themselves in our smaller or bigger decisions. The joint contribution of genetic and family factors has a crucial role in shaping educational trajectories and later socioeconomic outcomes.",

Untersucht wurden die Wahrnehmungen und Einstellungen sowie das Nutzungsverhalten der 1.657 Befragten (1.119 Erwerbstätige, 538 Nichterwerbstätige) zu Beginn des Jahres 2025. Die überwiegend ambivalenten Einstellungen gegenüber KI in der Bevölkerung weisen lediglich geringfügige Unterschiede zwischen Erwerbstätigen und Nichterwerbstätigen auf. In der Arbeitswelt äußern Erwerbstätige zunächst eine eher positive affektive Haltung gegenüber KI, die sich jedoch bei der konkreten Bewertung einzelner Arbeitsbedingungen relativiert. Während Befragte Entlastungspotenziale durch den KI-Einsatz in Hinblick auf Arbeitsbelastung und Gesundheitsschutz sehen, bewerten sie die KI-Auswirkungen auf Datenschutz, soziale Kontakte und Mitbestimmung kritisch. Konkrete Sorgen um Arbeitsplatzverlust oder Karriere bleiben bislang begrenzt. Zugleich zeigt sich eine zunehmende, überwiegend freiwillige Nutzung von KI am Arbeitsplatz. Insgesamt deuten die Ergebnisse auf noch instabile und kontextabhängige Einstellungsmuster hin, die durch eine hohe Ambivalenz gekennzeichnet sind.",

          "abstract": "Background. Food insecurity (FI) is associated with increased mortality and poor health. In high-income populations, documented risk factors for experiencing FI include low income, being female, having children, and ethnic minority status. Low social support may increase the risk of FI above and beyond these.\n\nMethods. In two epidemiological datasets, the Changing Cost of Living Study (CCLS; UK and France) and the National Health Interview Survey 2024 (NHIS; USA), we used model selection to identify the best predictors of FI from a set including social support alongside socioeconomic and demographic variables.\n\nResults. In both datasets, social support was selected as a predictor variable. High social support roughly halved the odds of experiencing FI (CCLS: 0.45 (95% CI 0.35 - 0.56); NHIS: OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.49 - 0.56)). Other selected predictor variables were income, income volatility, gender, and age (CCLS); and income, gender, age, having children, education and ethnicity (NHIS). Social support operated additively to other factors.\n\nConclusions. Low social support is an independent risk factor for FI. FI may be reduced by fostering social connection and capital; and inferences about the causal effects of FI on health may be confounded by the influence of social support on both.",

          "abstract": "Multispecies justice (MSJ) seeks to extend justice beyond humans. This concept may appear to improve environmental stewardship, however its openness risks undermining well-established principles of conservation and justice. Its open interpretation facilitates conceptual ambiguity, hindering practical operationalisation, risking moralising natural processes, while overlooking complexities of human-nature interactions and potentially weakening conservation efforts by opening the door for political misuse. In contrast, existing ethical and conservation frameworks already provide approaches to include nonhumans in justice, conservation and policy considerations. Building on three normative ethical theories (consequentialist, deontological and virtue ethics), we demonstrate how nonhumans can already be included in ethical considerations. Applying these theories enhances applicability through alignment with historic, juridical, scientific and religious moral systems. We therefore advocate strengthening established conservation and justice principles to address environmental crises. Future development of MSJ should build on its current popularity while integrating established, applicable ethical insights for including nonhumans in moral considerations.",

Since the main theoretical foundations for the comparative study of these regimes of public aid towards socio-economic disadvantage primarily derive from scientific contributions that are previous to this alteration window, we suggest the opportunity of drafting a new epistemic framework, which, on one hand, may be able to renovate the analytical and heuristic appropriateness of the so called ‘regime approach’, while, on the other, providing a precise and in-depth glance at the current geography of welfare architectures within the developed economies’ perimeter, mainly relying on quantitative indicators inherent (i) to the private sector’s participation in welfare provision, (ii) to the public actor’s generosity of treatment and (iii) to the familist architectural propensity. The 28-case-studies field-testing of the framework, conducted via modern HCA, KCA and PCA techniques provides results that corroborate the practical reliability of the fiscal design model as a means of welfare legacy family identification.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on qualitative survey data from 107 Australian teachers, we analyse how boys perform masculinity in schools through dominance, derision, defiance, and harassment, in ways that constitute reanimated normative manhood acts (Schwalbe, 2014). Teachers describe a noticeable shift around 2022, coinciding with the rising visibility and popularity of the manosphere, when some boys’ misogyny became more explicit, emboldened, and unchecked. Building on Moloney and Love’s (2018) work on ‘virtual manhood acts’ (VMAs), we determine five normative manhood acts now visible offline: (1) backlash misogyny; (2) homosocial harassment; (3) humour-as-baiting; (4) sexualisation of women; and (5) disinvestment in schooling. Highlighting the inextricable relationship between online misogyny and gendered power dynamics in physical educational settings, we underscore how certain boys’ increasing disregard for consequences reflects a renewed model of masculinity rooted in backlash politics, manosphere ideologies, and a broader far-right, anti-establishment orientation toward selfhood, community, and society.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive settings, yet we know little about how their identity performance develops when they interact within large-scale networks. We address this by examining Chirper.ai, a social media platform similar to X but composed entirely of autonomous AI chatbots. Our dataset comprises over 70,000 agents, approximately 140 million posts, and the evolving followership network over one year. Based on agents' text production, we assign weekly gender scores to each agent. Results suggest that each agent’s gender performance is fluid rather than fixed. Despite this fluidity, the network displays strong gender-based homophily, as agents consistently follow others performing gender similarly. Finally, we investigate whether these homophilic connections arise from social selection, in which agents choose to follow similar accounts, or from social influence, in which agents become more similar to their followees over time. Consistent with human social networks, we find evidence that both mechanisms shape the structure and evolution of interactions among LLMs. Our findings suggest that, even in the absence of bodies, cultural entraining of gender performance leads to gender-based sorting. This has important implications for LLM applications in synthetic hybrid populations, social simulations, and decision support.",

          "authors": "Kazuhito Kitamura",
          "abstract": "This paper deepens the \"Equilibrium Theory Endogenizing Imbalances\" based on asset dynamics, as presented in the previous study (Kitamura, 2025), by incorporating concepts from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. While the previous work proposed a model where imbalances are perpetuated through asset preference and capital diffusion, this study extends the framework into a model where \"effective asset potential\"—defined as the asset level divided by the rate of return on assets—acts as the driving force behind capital flows. It demonstrates a mechanism in which the capital efficiency of each nation significantly determines its economic trajectory.\nThrough observations using multilateral data, this paper reveals that individual economies exist under a tension between \"subjective equilibrium,\" aimed at utility maximization, and the \"pressure of entropy increase\" inherent in asset dynamics. Consequently, the global economy has polarized into \"self-organizing economies\" that concentrate and accumulate capital, and \"diffusive economies\" that primarily disperse and dissipate capital. This paper presents a novel perspective that views the global economy as a \"dissipative structure\" maintained through the interdependence of these distinct phases.\nBased on this analysis, the paper argues that for an economic system to remain sustainable, it is essential to involve maintaining the gradient of asset potential within the system by promoting innovation and eliminating \"stagnation\" through redistribution policies. Ultimately, this paper proposes that what economics terms \"equilibrium\" is equivalent to \"thermal death\" in physics; therefore, the goal of economics should be the avoidance rather than the realization of such a state, making the perspective of \"entropy management\" indispensable.",

          "abstract": "This chapter explores how media narratives contribute to the formation of publics around landscape transformation in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, analysing events from 2020. By examining print journalism, online news, social media discussions, and videos, the author traces the logics of circulation emerging in response to resource commodification in this frontier setting. Two distinct media events structure the analysis: the arrest of a Dayak community leader protesting illegal forest clearing by a palm oil company, which generated a Twitter counterpublic intensively indexing state authorities; and supernatural occurrences at a plywood factory, which circulated through sensationalist media and ultimately enabled critical coverage of the company's operations.\nThe chapter makes three interrelated arguments. First, Central Kalimantan's fragmented mediascape simultaneously upholds state interests through mainstream channels while allowing for citizen mobilisation and indirect political critique through social media and circulating narratives. Second, the author introduces \"haunted publics\" as a distinct modality of public formation, where circulation depends on the imagined agency of supernatural actors rather than the rational deliberation typically required of counterpublics, yet can nonetheless transpose to official discourse and enable political critique. Third, the chapter argues that frontiers are not simply places of rapid transformation but generative conditions from which new publics with novel logics of circulation emerge—publics that participate directly in the making and unmaking of frontier spaces. These findings contribute to anthropological debates on the nature of publics and their relationship to state authority in contexts where conditions for conventional bourgeois public spheres are absent.",

          "authors": "Don Sanjeewa Alwis",
          "abstract": "The institutional approach to development typically classifies colonial institutions as inclusive or extractive. This categorization is based on formal design. This classification often overlooks how rights and protections were distributed within societies, assuming access rather than measuring it.\n\nThis paper develops a Selective Inclusion framework, arguing that colonial regimes frequently built formally capable institutions while restricting access for indigenous and majority populations. To operationalize this idea, I construct a Partial Access Index (PAI) measured at independence for a sample of 62 former colonies. The index codes access in four domains: political franchise, access to executive constraints, legal uniformity, and educational-economic participation.\n\nDescriptive evidence reveals a Settler Colony Paradox: countries commonly treated as benchmarks of inclusive institutions often exhibited substantial exclusion of non-settler populations. Empirically, higher institutional access is associated with lower long-term income inequality. Robustness checks, including jackknife and region-exclusion tests, confirm that this relationship is not driven by outliers. The pattern is non-linear and region-specific. Latin America exhibits high inequality under partial inclusion. Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits high inequality under low access.\n\nThese findings suggest that formal institutional strength can coexist with restricted access, and that who is included matters as much as what institutions exist. The distinction of institutional form from institutional access clarifies the persistent distributional consequences of colonial rule.",

          "abstract": "As autism and ADHD cohorts reach later life in growing numbers, population aging frameworks face a critical challenge: conventional models assume aging occurs independently of lifelong neurodevelopmental disability. This review synthesizes findings from autism research, life-course theory, and aging studies to examine how lifelong neurodevelopmental differences interact with age-related health and system demands. By integrating evidence on physical health, mental health, service access, and regulatory demands, the review identifies mechanisms through which aging-related challenges emerge in autistic and ADHD populations and highlights implications for clinical care and support planning. We show that later-life outcomes reflect interaction effects between stable neurodevelopmental profiles, universal biological aging, and cumulative institutional exposure, rather than diagnosis timing or progressive trait change. Functional changes often attributed to decline instead reflect reduced recovery capacity under increasing health complexity and system demands. This reframing has direct implications for population planning, healthcare design, and service integration, particularly for high-support individuals who encounter aging-disability interactions earliest. The review concludes by identifying critical research gaps and system stress points requiring anticipatory policy as neurodevelopmentally diverse populations age.",

          "abstract": "This article reexamines political modernization by developing a theory of vernacular moral order to explain how political legitimacy is sustained under conditions of institutional fragility. Drawing on public scandals and everyday civic discourse in the Philippines, it shows how moral reasoning is organized through vernacular grammars such as hiya, tino, and bait, which translate concerns with trust, accountability, and authority into relational practices of judgment and repair. Rather than treating scandal as institutional breakdown or moral deviance, the article theorizes scandal as a recurrent activation mechanism through which publics evaluate authority and recalibrate legitimacy when formal procedures fail to command confidence. These vernacular moral grammars do not represent residues of tradition opposed to modern politics; instead, they function as culturally embedded infrastructures that enable political order to endure despite weak institutions and persistent uncertainty. By foregrounding moral reasoning as relational, affective, and culturally situated, the article challenges institutionalist accounts of modernization and legitimacy, demonstrating how political order is sustained not by the completion of modernization but through ongoing moral coordination in its aftermath.",

I conceptualize trust not as a calculated expectation of reciprocity but as a redistribution of contextualized vulnerability and a temporal reordering of everyday routines. The cat’s early-morning activity, which reorganized household and scholarly rhythms, becomes an analytic hinge for examining how care inscribes itself into bodily time.

Defining procurement as four phases—Planning, Design, Construction, and Occupancy— this study aims to provide a holistic understanding of these dynamics to identify pathways to design innovation. Objectives are, to: 1) create a diagrammatic representation of the procurement process for new residential care facilities, highlighting key stakeholders; 2) identify and prioritise contextual factors that significantly influence innovation in residential care facility design; and 3) explore the facilitators and barriers to innovation at each step of the process to propose actionable strategies for overcoming them. A multi-method qualitative approach included a systematic literature review, analysis of 38 case studies, and a two-round national e-Delphi study with 32 experts from four stakeholder groups. The findings offer a foundation for policymakers to assess the influence of various factors, reframe power dynamics between key stakeholders, and explore transdisciplinary collaboration models to foster innovation.

Recent bioarchaeological and radiocarbon analyses have excluded Tomb I as the burial of Philip II of Macedon, removing the osteological and chronological basis for the traditional attribution and leaving Philip’s resting place unresolved. This paper proposes an integrative reinterpretation of Tomb II as either the primary cremation or a secondary monumentalized burial of Philip II, constructed or refurbished during the political reorganization of Macedonia following the death of Alexander the Great. We argue that the tomb’s cremation rites, exceptional monumentality, dynastic iconography, equestrian sacrifices, and elite military regalia correspond more closely to the commemoration of a foundational warrior king than to the historically marginal reign of Philip III Arrhidaeus. Situating Tomb II within broader Greek traditions of heroization, secondary burial, and dynastic legitimation, the model explains the archaeological and historical evidence with fewer assumptions and generates testable predictions for future research.",

          "abstract": "This review synthesises the literature on university entrepreneurial ecosystems to understand their role in fostering university spin-off companies as drivers of economic development. This study adopts a systematised conceptual literature review design, employing a structured search and thematic synthesis to develop an integrative conceptual framework that positions university entrepreneurial ecosystems as a dynamic interplay between internal (e.g. university leadership, faculty) and external (e.g. government, venture capitalists) stakeholders. The framework identifies knowledge spillover and transfer as key mediating processes, and highlights intellectual property frameworks and mechanisms (e.g. university IP policy, legal system) as a critical moderator that can either enable or constrain academic entrepreneurship, and subsequently spin-off formation. Applying this lens to New Zealand, a paradoxical situation was uncovered: while home to a recognised “emerging world leading” university entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is a significant paucity of recent, system-wide academic research. Key gaps are identified, including the need for longitudinal data on spin-offs performances, and a deeper understanding of internal ecosystem dynamics like the critical imperative to integrate Mātauranga Māori (Māori traditional knowledge) into commercialisation pathways. This review provides a foundation for future empirical research and offers insights for policymakers and university leaders in New Zealand and other small, innovative economies.\n\nKeywords: University Entrepreneurial Ecosystem, University Spin-off, Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, Knowledge Spillover, Academic Entrepreneurship, New Zealand",

          "abstract": "This paper outlines a distributional approach to institutional analysis, reconceptualizing institutions as distributions of knowledge and activity across people. We argue that institutionalization and institutional change are best understood by focusing on actors with the requisite knowledge and motivation to keep institutional patterns going, fix them when they go awry, or transform them when required, here called functionaries. The distributional approach allows us to distinguish between two main types of institutional change often conflated in the literature: Content-based and formal change. Content-based change, the one most often discussed, involves the importation, recombination, or expansion of specific patterns of activity. In contrast, formal change, often neglected in the literature, refers to shifts in the distribution of knowledge and activity within an institution, leading to dynamics of centralization and decentralization of institutional patterns. In this way, the distributional approach highlights the role of functionaries in both institutional stability and change, providing a micro-level perspective on institutional dynamics.",

This study examines partisan polarization on Ukraine aid between Democratic and Republican elites as reflected in U.S. news media from March 2022 to December 2024, leveraging party brand theory and foreign policy polarization literature to explain when and how Democrats and Republicans consolidated distinct positions on a novel foreign policy issue. Analyzing 37,312 sentences from 23,630 news articles, we employ a dual-pipeline methodology combining LLM-based ideological scoring across four dimensions with BERT-based masked vocabulary extraction. Results reveal significant polarization growth, driven asymmetrically by Republican movement toward opposition while Democrats maintained stable pro-aid positioning. Resource allocation framing, such that Ukraine aid competes with domestic resources, contributed most strongly to the general polarization of supplying further aid to Ukraine, accounting for over 60% of explained variance. PELT identified October 2022 as the first major departure from bipartisan consensus, with polarization of the subsequent segments moving with electoral cycles and leadership transitions. Critically, as polarization increased, so did the clarity of party brands to voters: both parties’ messaging became more internally coherent, enabling clearer partisan differentiation. Vocabulary extraction revealed early crystallization of partisan linguistic patterns, with Democrats emphasizing language of provision (“promised,” “signed”) and Republicans emphasizing language of obstruction (“block,” “killed”). These findings demonstrate that elite polarization on Ukraine aid served functional party branding purposes, challenging assumptions about foreign policy’s insulation from domestic partisan conflict.",

          "abstract": "Population-level research on intersex individuals has been impeded by the difficulty of identifying this population in large-scale data. In this paper, we develop a novel strategy for identifying intersex individuals using ICD-10 diagnostic codes in population-wide health registers. Applying this approach to Danish data spanning 1994-2022, we provide the first population-level examination of the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders in the intersex population. We identify intersex traits in 1.6% of the Danish population - rising to 2.5% among the 1994-2022 birth cohorts, for whom diagnostic data cover the entirety of their lives. We disaggregate the intersex population into six subgroups based on the type of intersex-related diagnoses and examine the risk of fourteen clusters of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. Across all subgroups, the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders is substantially elevated relative to the endosex population, although specific risk profiles vary: some subgroups show broad elevations across disorder categories, whilst others exhibit more selective patterns. These patterns persist after controlling for age and assigned sex, as well as after the inclusion of sibling fixed effects. Our findings highlight the need for mental health support tailored to individuals with intersex traits. Our ICD-based identification strategy addresses longstanding methodological barriers to intersex research and offers a replicable approach for population-level research beyond mental health and across contexts with comparable health data.",

          "abstract": "This study focused on exploring the relationship between gender identity and eating disorders in high school students, in order to clarify the differences in rates, manifestations and levels of influence between different gender groups. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods with 170 students participating in the survey in Hanoi, the results showed that the rate of eating disorders was highest in females, followed by males and the other gender group. In particular, the other gender group had the most severe and diverse levels of eating disorders. Factors such as body dissatisfaction, social pressure on body standards, gender discrimination and internalization of appearance standards had a significant impact on eating disorder behavior. The study also showed that eating disorders negatively affected students' mental health, while coping ability was limited and there was a lack of appropriate support. On that basis, the study proposes educational, communication and school psychological support solutions for effective prevention and intervention, with special attention to gender-diverse student groups.",

          "abstract": "The swift growth of social media use in Bangladesh has strengthened communication but has also lightning the diffusion of rumours. In several latest events, unverified posts framed around political, religious, and identity-based outrage have moved quickly from online spaces into offline vandalism and communal violences. The transition from rumour to violence is not automatic and unavoidable. It depends on how digital content is articulated, who disseminates it where it spreads, and how authorities respond. This study develops a sequential explanation of social media driven rumour spread in Bangladesh and analyses a risk-reduction model. Using a mixed-methods design, this study combines content analysis of viral rumour incidents, interviews with journalists, diffusion pathway mapping within closed networks, influencer, and digital security stakeholders. Presenting information suggests that escalation is most likely when identity threats circulate through trusted local networks and confusing institutional responses. Employing Social Exchange Theory, the study argues that perceived institutional failure facilitates negative reciprocity and accumulation. This study also suggests a mitigation strategy structured around early detection, rapid institutional communication, and locally credible counter-narratives.",

The experimental group was taught using CBI, while the control group was taught the traditional teaching methods. The pre-test and post-test were administered to measure their grammatical competence. A self-administered survey questionnaire, modified from Facione (2013), was utilized to assess the critical thinking abilities of student instructors. The finding indicates a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the two groups in their grammatical competence. The experiment group achieved a higher mean score than the control group. Student teachers enhanced their proficiency in Interpretation, Explanation, Perspective, and Application, while showing a tendency towards competency in Self-knowledge and Empathy. The research highlighted collaborative work, investigation and evaluation, inquiry and dialogue, presentation, and interaction as methods to enhance critical thinking.

          "abstract": "It has often been said that group work is one of the representative effective methods to promote learning outcomes not only in primary and secondary education, but also in higher education. In recent years in Japan, group work has been embraced as part of the term ‘active learning’ and has been blindly praised and encouraged. In my classes, many assignments employing group work have been performed not only in large size classes but also in small size classes. Almost all research has provided positive evidence from the view of theoretical and empirical aspects of group work. However, skepticism and negativity towards group work are also emerging. Even if group work is not rejected outright, at the very least, opportunities to discuss effective methods of group work are increasing. This study focuses on the two issues mentioned above, motivation and gender difference. Group work has the advantage of allowing learners to listen to the ideas of others, compare them with their own, and form their own opinions. It may also have the benefit of cultivating communication skills and the ability to collaborate with others. However, conducting it within a limited time frame carries risks. There is also the possibility that it may have a negative effect on learning outcomes, or at least not bring about the expected benefits. Furthermore, learners may be aware of the limitations of group work.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. We argue that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the opportunity cost of alternative nondepreciating investment, and that a GDP growth rate lower than the risk-free rate is actually negative. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. To solve the model factors, we use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors. Our models thus split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models, on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics is the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets. We have to develop the 4-factor independence model into software to analyze the noise of inflation risk that follows a blended normal distribution (Nie, 2023).",

          "abstract": "Summary\n\nRationale and aims Nahuatl plant names such as ahuacatl and chīlli remain embedded in global languages, reflecting enduring Indigenous botanical knowledge. The 1552 De la Cruz-Badiano Codex preserves this knowledge through Nahuatl names, Latin text, and botanical illustrations. We asked whether these distinct representations encode a shared underlying structure of Nahua plant classification.\n\nMethods We compiled a multimodal dataset linking three data types from the Codex: leaf shape morphometrics derived from traced illustrations, text embeddings from English and Spanish translations, and graph embeddings based on co-occurrence patterns among Nahuatl plant names. A contrastive multimodal learning framework was used to integrate these representations into a shared embedding space.\n\nKey results The model successfully aligned two of the three modalities. Linguistic and name-structure data clustered closely together, while leaf shape occupied a more distinct region of the embedding space, indicating differing roles for morphology and language in classification.\n\nConclusions These results suggest that Nahua botanical knowledge in the codex emphasizes relational and linguistic structure alongside, but not reducible to, plant form. Our study demonstrates how computational methods can reveal patterns in historical Indigenous knowledge systems and support efforts to re-examine colonial-era sources in plant science.\n\nSocietal Impact Statement \nNahuatl \nIn huehca nahuatlahcuilolli in,\nin tlaneltiliztli in xihuitl, in cuahuitl, ihuan in tlacah\namo zan tlahcuilolpan mopiya,\nzan mochipa yoltilana.\n\nInin tlamachtiliztli ticnextia quenin\nin tlahtolli, in ixiptlahcuiloltin, ihuan in xihuitl\nce tlamantli tlamatiliztli mochipa quichihua.\n\nTicpohuah ihuan tiquixmati in xihuitl\namo zan ipampa patli,\nzan ipampa nemiliztli ihuan tlalli.\n\nInin tequitl quipalehuia in tlamatiliztli nahua,\nin tlahtolli, ihuan in tlaneltiliztli,\nma yoltilana, ma tlapalehuia in tlacah ihuan in tlalli\naxcan ihuan moztla.\n\nEnglish\nTranslated from Nahuatl: In ancient Nahua writings, knowledge of plants, trees, and people was not fixed on the page, but carried forward in living ways. This study shows how language, images, and plants work together as one enduring system of knowledge. We examine plants not only as medicines, but as part of human life and the land itself. By reading these manuscripts through Indigenous structures of understanding, our work supports the vitality of Nahua knowledge, language, and plant relationships. This matters today because sustaining Indigenous ways of knowing strengthens care for people, plants, and the land, now and for the future.

          "authors": "Johannes Petry",
          "abstract": "This chapter investigates the growing importance of Asia within the global financial system and analyzes its implications for the liberal script. First, the chapter explores the place of finance within the liberal script, investigating the paradigm shift from embedded liberalism to neoliberalism and subsequently growing importance of capital-market based finance for economic allocation within the Western script. Second, the autonomous origins of developmentalism in Asian financial scripts are discussed which markedly differ from (neo)liberal conceptions of finance. Third, and moving beyond the neoliberal-developmental dichotomy, the chapter conducts a comparative analysis of the five largest Asian financial systems: China, Korea, India, Japan, and Singapore. In doing so, the chapter identifies significant variations of how Asian finance relates to the liberal script, ranging between accommodation, resistance, and contestation. While maintaining some developmental characteristics, Japan and Singapore largely accommodate the liberal script. In contrast, we can observe resistance to conform with the liberal script in Korea and India where developmental characteristics maintain a prominent role and steps are taken to enable a controlled co-existence. Finally, only China truly contests the liberal script, both through the intensity and international reach of its developmental characteristics but most importantly through other actors’ reaction towards it. The chapter thus illustrates that while there are significant differences between (more) developmental Asian and (more) neoliberal Western financial systems, the rise of Asia represents only a partial contestation of the neoliberal financial script, which cannot, however, be separated from broader geopolitical constellations that challenge the liberal script.",

Using metrics spanning lexical richness,readability, reference density, structural features, and semantic similarity, we assesshow closely the two platforms align in form and substance. We find that Grokipediaarticles are substantially longer and contain significantly fewer references per word.Moreover, Grokipedia’s content divides into two distinct groups: one that remainssemantically and stylistically aligned with Wikipedia, and another that divergessharply.  Among the dissimilar articles, we observe a systematic rightward shiftin the political bias of cited sources, concentrated primarily in entries related topolitics, history, and religion. More broadly, the findings indicate that AI-generatedencyclopedic content departs from established editorial norms, favoring narrativeexpansion over citation-based verification, raising questions about transparency,provenance, and the governance of knowledge in automated information systems.",

          "abstract": "We analyse focus group discussions and free-text survey responses from a multi-stakeholder consultation conducted after the October 2023 publication of the proposal Towards Responsible Publishing by cOAlition S. The proposal calls for a systemic reform of scholarly communication by reducing barriers to knowledge dissemination, promoting early sharing of outputs through preprints, and shifting peer review to an open, post-publication model. We focus on how different stakeholder groups –such as researchers, infrastructure providers, academic institutions, and publishers –perceive obstacles to the large-scale, coordinated reform envisioned in the proposal. We interpret these accounts as articulations of collective action problems, shaped by entrenchment of many actors in existing academic reward systems and established commercial revenue models that make transitions toward a more economically sustainable scholarly communication system difficult, even where many actors see the principal need for change. This approach highlights the extent to which stakeholder perspectives align or conflict. It also underscores the performative nature of discourse about collective action problems in scholarly communication: by articulating challenges to reform, participants simultaneously construct, reinforce, or contest their own roles within the system, which directly influences their collective capacity to act.",

Argumenta que a incapacidade recorrente de prever, explicar ou evitar crises sistêmicas não decorre de falhas técnicas pontuais, mas de problemas metodológicos muito mais profundos, a começar pelo recurso frequente a meta-axiomas, o núcleo duro da metodologia econômica, e em torno desse núcleo duro uma segunda camada frequentemente orbitada por argumentos circulares, tudo isso dando base para as elaborações teóricas que então se diferenciam, ortodoxas e heterodoxas. Como parte dessa forma mais externa a matemática geralmente aparece como mais um recurso retórico à disposição da teorização. A análise se direciona em três direções: (i) o Teorema de Sonnenschein‑Mantel‑Debreu (SMD), cuja prova pode ser entendida como a impossibilidade lógica de derivar comportamento racional agregado a partir de preferências individuais racionais, e sua consequência na microfundamentação de teorias macroeconômicas, (ii) na Teoria Monetária Moderna (MMT) e (iii) na possibilidade ou não da planificação econômica na sociedade capitalista. Analisamos os limites de discursos modernos e realistas como o socialismo de mercado, a economia do projetamento e a nova economia do projetamento e como, em última instância, mesmos esses discursos mais modernos ainda carregam fundamentações baseadas em argumentações circulares e antigos meta-axiomas. Por fim, a partir disso, concluímos a impossibilidade da planificação econômica em uma sociedade capitalista, apesar desses discursos, argumentos e propostas e apesar da possibilidade de superação da sociedade capitalista e da planificação econômica não capitalista nesse processo.",

          "authors": "Benoît de Courson; Willem Frankenhuis; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "People in situations of poverty tend to heavily discount the future. Despite repeated and robust evidence, the theoretical literature lacks satisfying models to explain why. Although urgent needs are often invoked to explain impatience, this intuition can be misleading: in persistent poverty, one may need resources tomorrow as much as today. We show that previous models assume that poverty is temporary and improvement is expected, and predict discounting only under this condition. To address this gap, we propose a two-period model in which basic needs are captured by a 'desperation threshold' -- a critical resource level above which agents aim to stay. In four stylized scenarios, we show analytically that agents discount the future near the threshold and are patient at intermediate resource levels. In line with the empirical record, time discounting increases on both sides of the threshold, while risk taking is polarized -- higher below the threshold, lower above. Unlike existing accounts, our explanation does not rely on assuming a future improvement in financial situation. Rather, it predicts a U-shaped effect of future expectations, with greater time discounting if the future will be either much better or much worse than the present. This can reconcile economic theory with ethnographic findings about deprived populations. Our findings suggest that addressing material scarcity directly, rather than attempting to alter future orientation, may be the most effective way to reduce impulsivity and align behavior with true preferences.",

The primary evidentiary window spans November 2023 through May 2025, with documentation and analysis concentrated across 2024–2025. The case is reported from the perspective of the primary target and applies a structured analytic approach that distinguishes (a) observable digital behaviors (e.g., timestamps, posts, interactions, and platform activity) from (b) interpretive analysis grounded in repeated patterns, timing relationships, symbolic consistency, and escalation dynamics observable across time and platforms.\n\nThe dataset is organized as a structured case file consisting of an executive summary, preface, and methodology section outlining documentation procedures and interpretive criteria; contextual background establishing relevant relational and digital history; a master timeline organized around correlated activity and post-response timing relationships; and appendices addressing recurrent tactic clusters, including sexual objectification, identity manipulation, covert account proliferation, fantasy-based framing, and probability-based reasoning relevant to assessments of intentionality. All identifying details—including names, locations, venues, and searchable lyrical content—have been anonymized or paraphrased to preserve privacy while retaining evidentiary and analytic integrity.\n\nThis work is shared to support sociological research, interdisciplinary scholarship, advocacy, and public understanding of technology-facilitated forms of relational harm that may remain socially and institutionally difficult to recognize due to plausible deniability and indirect communication architectures. It is not presented as a legal claim or criminal allegation, but as a high-resolution longitudinal dataset illustrating how digitally mediated ORI may be sustained through symbolic intrusion and psychological presence without continuous direct contact.\n\nThe full anonymized case file is available as an accompanying dataset via OSF.",

Using micro-level data from Brazil, I exploit variation in the supply of government bonds at different maturities to estimate the causal effect of additional government debt outstanding on firm issuance decisions. I find that at early stages of development, government debt complements corporate debt, implying that additional government debt outstanding at a given maturity causes firms to issue more. These effects ultimately increase long-term debt issuance and investment across firms, with stronger responses from companies with higher asset duration. However, as markets mature and government debt levels rise, I document a shift from complementarity to substitution. This evidence can be rationalized through government debt reducing corporate pricing uncertainty by providing pricing benchmarks and facilitating price discovery in bond markets.",

Drawing on Social Cognitive Theory, it tests entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) as a mediator and perceived environmental hardship as a moderator.\nDesign/methodology/approach: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted with 270 working-age adults across three regions of South Sudan (Juba/Central Equatoria, Upper Nile and Western Bahr el Ghazal) between July and October 2025 using paper-based and online questionnaires. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression and PROCESS-based mediation (Model 4) and moderation (Model 1) with 5,000 bootstrap resamples.\nFindings: PMST is positively associated with EI. ESE mediates this relationship (indirect-only): the bootstrapped indirect effect is significant and the PMST→EI direct effect becomes non-significant when ESE is included. Perceived environmental hardship weakens the positive PMST–EI relationship. Resilience is positively related to EI but does not moderate the focal relationship.\nResearch limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design limits causal inference and self-reports may introduce common method bias. Future research should use longitudinal and comparative designs and examine behavioral outcomes (e.g., business start-up).\nPractical implications: Reintegration and entrepreneurship programs should combine skills-recognition and ESE-building (e.g., mastery-based training and mentoring) with ecosystem interventions that reduce contextual constraints.\nSocial implications: Supporting entrepreneurship among individuals with military experience may contribute to livelihood recovery, inclusion and reintegration in fragile settings.\nOriginality/value: The study integrates perceived skills transferability, cognitive mechanisms and contextual constraints to explain entrepreneurial intention in a fragile, post-conflict economy.\nType of paper: Research paper.\nKeywords: perceived skills transferability; entrepreneurial self-efficacy; entrepreneurial intention; environmental hardship; resilience; post-conflict; fragile economy.",

          "abstract": "Theory of Ideological Hegemony and the Imperial Phase of Capitalism offers a groundbreaking synthesis of Marxist, Gramscian, and Althusserian theory to explain how ideology, power, and global capitalism reproduce themselves through modern state and supranational institutions.\n\nIn this wide-ranging study, Aleksandar Korolija develops the original concept of the imperial ideological apparatus—a framework that connects the structures of global finance, political power, and transnational institutions such as NATO, the IMF, and NGOs with the formation of contemporary ideological systems. Combining philosophical precision with historical analysis, the book explores how class domination is maintained not only through economic coercion but through the cultural and ideological mechanisms of the global order. \n\nDrawing on Marx, Gramsci, and Althusser—while critically engaging with other critical authors—Korolija demonstrates how the transition from the nation-state to the imperial phase of capitalism transforms the function of ideology itself. This theory connects the formation of hegemony in the classical Marxist sense to the reproduction of global capitalist power in the 21st century.\n\nThis is an excerpt with two out of six sections.\n\nWinner of the 2023 and 2024 Best Dissertation Award of the Serbian Sociological Society",

          "authors": "Carol Blaizy D'Souza",
          "abstract": "Political possibilities are shaped by how a problem is defined. When it comes to the environmental crisis, the defined contours of growth, development, and scarcity drive the conversation in predetermined directions. (D’Souza, 2019) Democratic processes can be compromised when these contours are narrowly traced and closed off to questioning. When outlined as categories liable to be influenced by culture, context, and power structures, their study can serve as a searching tool that illuminates complex dynamics. Environmental education influences and is influenced by the prevailing discourses in environmentalism. The discourse privileged by the curriculum's language frame depends on the text's location, who it is aimed at, and the concomitant priorities. In this exploratory paper, practitioners working in the fields of environmental education (EE) pedagogy, teaching, curriculum design, and activism were interviewed. The idea was to get a sense of what people in different fields working towards the common goal of better care for the environment and an ethic of sustainability had to say about the EE curriculum. What was their vision for it, and what was the reality they had encountered in these technology-driven, fast-paced times? Special attention was paid to interlocutors' thoughts on the significance of the words and language used in the curriculum.",

          "authors": "Lorran Luiz de Oliveira Neves",
          "abstract": "Este artigo investiga a crise epistemológica estrutural que atravessa as teorias econômicas, principalmente as contemporâneas na qual essa crise se agravou, tanto na ortodoxia quanto na heterodoxia. Argumenta que a incapacidade recorrente de prever, explicar ou evitar crises sistêmicas não decorre de falhas técnicas pontuais, mas de problemas metodológicos muito mais profundos, a começar pelo recurso frequente a meta-axiomas, o núcleo duro da metodologia econômica, e em torno desse núcleo duro uma segunda camada frequentemente orbitada por argumentos circulares, tudo isso dando base para as elaborações teóricas que então se diferenciam, ortodoxas e heterodoxas. Como parte dessa forma mais externa a matemática geralmente aparece como mais um recurso retórico à disposição da teorização. A análise se direciona em três direções: (i) o Teorema de Sonnenschein‑Mantel‑Debreu (SMD), cuja prova pode ser entendida como a impossibilidade lógica de derivar comportamento racional agregado a partir de preferências individuais racionais, e sua consequência na microfundamentação de teorias macroeconômicas, (ii) na Teoria Monetária Moderna (MMT) e (iii) na possibilidade ou não da planificação econômica na sociedade capitalista. Analisamos os limites de discursos modernos e realistas como o socialismo de mercado, a economia do projetamento e a nova economia do projetamento e como, em última instância, mesmos esses discursos mais modernos ainda carregam fundamentações baseadas em argumentações circulares e antigos meta-axiomas. Por fim, a partir disso, concluímos a impossibilidade da planificação econômica em uma sociedade capitalista, apesar desses discursos, argumentos e propostas e apesar da possibilidade de superação da sociedade capitalista e da planificação econômica não capitalista nesse processo.",

          "authors": "Ashleigh Brown-Grier",
          "abstract": "The paper introduces the Architecture of Institutional Containment, a conceptual framework that explains how educational institutions absorb reform while preserving underlying power structures. Rather than viewing reform failure as accidental or temporary, the framework shows how institutions are designed to incorporate change in ways that protect durable outcomes such as economic containment, racialized labor hierarchies, and concentrated epistemic authority. Grounded in critical theory and historical analysis, and informed by Black-serving institutions in the United States and South Africa, the framework offers a systems-level tool for analyzing why equity-oriented reforms are often reversible and why inequality persists despite repeated interventions.",
