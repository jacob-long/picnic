          "title": "Theory Borrowing as a Process",
          "authors": "Jakob Henke",
          "abstract": "Communication science has a history of borrowing theories from other disciplines. Yet, this practice is often criticized. In this essay, I challenge this notion by suggesting we view it as an iterative process. In doing so, borrowing can contribute to building more robust theories. Using examples of theories that have been borrowed by communication researchers, I illustrate several challenges that are associated with theory borrowing, such as adapting a theory out of scope, neglecting assumptions, not considering alternatives, and non-replicable empirical foundations. Viewing theory borrowing as a process means continuously engaging with a theory’s parent literature and potentially contributing to it. Ultimately, I advocate for a reflective and collaborative approach to theory borrowing that fosters rigorous interdisciplinary engagement, strengthens communication theory, and extends the discipline’s impact across the social sciences.",

          "authors": "Keren Tenenboim-Weinblatt; Tali Aharoni; Christian Baden",
          "abstract": "This article examines the journalistic production of mediated political projections, defined as media narratives about uncertain futures in the political arena, such as anticipated outcomes and implications of elections. Despite the significance of prospective coverage in political journalism and its impact on political decision-making, there is limited understanding of journalists’ perceptions and textual expressions of political forecasting across various discursive forms, media types, and cultures. Drawing on interviews with Israeli journalists and a computational text analysis of election coverage in France, Israel, and the U.S., this study explores how journalists perceive, negotiate, and textually navigate political forecasting in their work. The findings reveal journalists’ deep ambivalence toward political forecasting and the resulting textual practices. We show how journalists attribute their engagement in forecasting to external pressures, while their reluctance stems from the inherent risks and challenges associated with political forecasting and its conflict with their journalistic identity. Journalists navigate this tension by incorporating projections into conventional factual reporting or using non-committal language. Except in data journalism, assessing the likelihood of political scenarios is uncommon. Although these patterns are observed across countries and media types, prospective coverage is more prevalent in interventionist and accommodative journalistic cultures, with the rhetoric of facticity and certitude more common in broadcast news. We argue that journalists’ reluctance to fully engage with the uncertainty of political futures limits their ability to effectively contribute to public decision-making processes in societies' navigation toward the future.",

          "authors": "Tony Alves; Christopher Erdmann; Emily Esten; Martin Klein; Bianca Kramer; Maria Levchenko; Daisy Nip; Michael Parkin; Iratxe Puebla",
          "abstract": "Several preprint review communities have emerged in the life sciences in recent years. They have adopted different approaches to create and share preprint review information. New preprint review initiatives need to understand the benefits and challenges of the current technical solutions to store and transfer review metadata. This requires a clear overview of the various workflows that exist in this space. This publication maps out the preprint review metadata transfer ecosystem within the life sciences. Here we describe six illustrative workflows, as well as protocols, schemas and frameworks used for preprint review metadata transfer. For each workflow we highlight benefits and challenges faced by the preprint review services. Finally, we offer a summary of factors to consider when selecting a metadata workflow. This includes technical needs, costs, maintenance and sustainability, discoverability, and linking between preprints and reviews. We recommend that new preprint review groups adopt one of the existing workflows and encourage them to participate in community efforts to evolve and improve current standards. We believe this will support interoperability and bolster the development of new tools for preprint review.",

          "authors": "Allyson Alblas; Luke D. Smillie; Timothy Francis Bainbridge",
          "abstract": "Over the past 40 years, the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) of personality has inspired a proliferation of self-report scales, potentially creating ‘jingle-jangle’ fallacies and a fragmented empirical literature. The Big Five personality taxonomy may offer a useful organising framework for these scales, as it seems plausible that many could be represented as narrow facets of the broader Big Five domains. Across two studies, we explored (Study 1, N = 408) then attempted to confirm (Study 2, N = 423) whether and where a collection of &gt;25 RST scales might be located within the space of the Big Five. Both studies revealed that more than 70% of these RST scales were more strongly related to the Big Five domains than more than 10% (i.e., 3/30) of Big Five facets, suggesting that they too could plausibly be regarded as Big Five facets. Moreover, several RST scales were highly correlated (r &gt; .80) with individual Big Five facets, indicating potential redundancy. These results suggest that the Big Five can indeed provide a useful organising framework for most RST scales, which may help researchers grappling with construct proliferation and jingle-jangle fallacies within the RST literature.",

          "authors": "Aaron Chuey; Rondeline Michelle Williams; Catherine Qing; Michael C. Frank; Hyowon Gweon",
          "abstract": "Having an abstract understanding of communication means being able to reason not just about its success but also its failure: when and why it fails, what happens as a consequence, and how to fix it. Auditory noise in particular can radically alter the fidelity of verbal communication, yet little is known about how language users reason about its role in communication and when such reasoning emerges in development. The current work investigates the development of children’s reasoning about auditory noise. As observers of others' communication, we found that a sample of US children as young as age three understood that auditory noise impedes others’ hearing, though the ability to reason about its effect on others’ knowledge and behaviors may not develop until slightly later. As communicators, a separate sample of four-year-olds tailored how they themselves communicated by using more gestures when their partner couldn't hear. Taken together, these results suggest that even young children may possess an abstract understanding of communication that is integrated with their ability to reason about others’ perception and knowledge. Such an understanding enables children to reason about how noise disrupts communication and how to communicate effectively in the presence of noise.",

          "authors": "Constance Bainbridge; Gregory A. Bryant; Rick Dale",
          "abstract": "Intrapersonal communication is a classification of phenomena such as self-talk and imagined interactions in which communicative messages are contained within a single individual and internal systems comprise both sender and receiver roles. The construct has met criticism historically with objections rooted in the notion that intrapersonal communication is simply a form of social cognition. But not all self-communicative behaviors have clear or empirically defined social cognitive connections, and the concept of intrapersonal communication deserves revisiting through meaningful interdisciplinary study using varied methods and theoretical frameworks. We explore relevant work supporting our contention that intrapersonal communication constitutes a valuable classification, including related historical research, functional and developmental approaches, and important methodological issues. We then conclude that the research problems relevant to intrapersonal communication have implications for researchers across diverse fields, and could shed light on a variety of important topics such as philosophy of mind, consciousness, and the nature of communication.",

          "title": "A Comparison of Scalable Routine Clinical Materials and Observer Ratings to Assess CBT Fidelity",
          "authors": "Amber Calloway; Torrey A. Creed; Shannon Wiltsey Stirman; Nicole Gumport",
          "abstract": "Decades of research have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) for a wide variety of psychiatric diagnoses, resulting in the inclusion of CBT as a first-line evidence-based practice (EBP) in treatment guidelines for mood and anxiety disorders. However, some research suggests that many providers do not implement EBPs as intended. Ongoing quality monitoring is needed to support EBP implementation and sustainability, but “gold standard” fidelity monitoring (e.g. observer ratings) is time-consuming, requires extensive training, and may feel intrusive to providers and clients.  In the current study, we aimed to develop a scalable method of assessing CBT fidelity that leverages information generated in routine clinical care (e.g. session worksheets and clinician checklists). Ratings of adherence based on worksheets were not correlated with ratings of adherence based on observer ratings. However, ratings of competence based on worksheets were significantly correlated with observer ratings of competence. Ratings of adherence based on clinician checklist ratings were also significantly correlated with observer-rated adherence. Results did not indicate a strong relationship between adherence or competence measured by worksheet ratings or observer and symptom change. However, adherence as measured by clinician checklists were associated with subsequent depression symptom change. Findings have a strong potential to impact fidelity monitoring strategies for a variety of CBTs. Given the limited resources and time to do full audio review in routine care settings, findings suggest that using routine materials generated in session to assess therapist competence may be a feasible alternative to the “gold standard” audio review.",

          "authors": "Peder Mortvedt Isager; Jack Fitzgerald",
          "abstract": "Researchers may want to know whether an observed statistical relationship is either meaningfully negative, meaningfully positive, or small enough to be considered practically equivalent to zero. Such a question can not be addressed with standard null hypothesis significance testing, nor with standard equivalence testing. Three-sided testing (TST) is a procedure to address such questions, by simultaneously testing whether\nan estimated relationship is significantly below, within, or above predetermined smallest effect sizes of interest. TST is a natural extension of the standard two one-sided test for equivalence (TOST). TST offers a more comprehensive decision framework than TOST with no penalty to error rates or statistical power. In this paper, we give a non-technical introduction to TST, provide commands for conducting TST in both R\nand Jamovi, and provide a Shiny app for easy implementation. Whenever a meaningful smallest effect size of interest can be specified, TST should be combined with null hypothesis significance testing as the default frequentist testing procedure.",

          "abstract": "Personality psychology has long focused on between-person differences, often neglecting the dynamic, idiographic nature of personality as it unfolds over time. This study introduces idiographic momentary profiles—person-specific clusters of personality states—estimated using Gaussian finite mixture modeling. Drawing on experience sampling data from two independent undergraduate samples (N = 245; 15,833 total surveys), we demonstrate that individuals exhibit unique, multivariate personality state patterns that vary across time and situations. Findings reveal that (a) most individuals express multiple distinct profiles, (b) profile heterogeneity reflects both level and pattern differences, and (c) contemporaneous situational characteristics (i.e., DIAMONDS taxonomy) predict momentary profile expression. These results challenge static trait and typological approaches by highlighting the complexity and contextuality of personality dynamics. Our findings underscore the value of idiographic methods in advancing personality theory and measurement, offering a foundation for capturing the full scope of personality variability in daily life.\nKeywords: idiographic, personality dynamics, momentary profiles, situation characteristics",

          "abstract": "Background. Sexual dysfunctions and well-being are critical areas of mental health that remain under-addressed in traditional psychotherapeutic settings. From a patient’s view, reasons include feelings of discomfort and fear of stigma. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) may offer a way to reach this population and provide necessary support. Thus far, few studies investigated IMIs for sexual dysfunctions, mostly targeting specific disorders, like erectile dysfunction or vaginismus. This study aimed to identify the key requirements for developing an IMI for a broader range of sexual dysfunctions and sexual well-being from the perspective of potential users. \nMethod. To gather insights into user needs and preferences, we conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with adult participants in Germany that reported to have sexual problems. Interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Categories were established deductively-inductively from transcribed interview records based on a rigorous coding method.\nResults. Key findings revealed that expert knowledge and destigmatization are crucial components for a potential IMI for sexual dysfunctions and well-being. Preferred content topics included communication, dealing with sexualized violence, and sexual preferences. The design should prioritize clarity, customizability, and neutrality. While most participants were open to using a potential IMI with their partners and preferred on-demand professional support, the study also highlighted the importance of avoiding insensitivity and inappropriate content related to sexual abuse. \nConclusions. This study underlines the importance of developing an IMI targeting sexual problems that is inclusive, responsive to diverse user needs, and adaptable to various psychotherapeutic contexts.",

          "abstract": "Humans can mentally create and elaborately describe events, detailing not just the who, what, and where, but also the connections and intricacies of these elements. Propositional density, the number of propositions expressed relative to total words, can be leveraged to assess how elaborately the elements of memories are described. The present study used propositional density to investigate how age relates to the elaborateness of orally shared autobiographical event memories. This preregistered study included 114 young adults (mean age = 24.1) and 171 cognitively normal older adults (mean age = 68.3). Propositional density scores were calculated using Computerized Propositional Idea Density Rater (CPIDR). In addition to conducting a young versus older adult comparison, we separated older adults into “younger-old” and “older-old” groups and compared propositional density scores for these groups and the young adult group. Propositional density was higher in young adults than older adults, Cohen’s f = 0.13, p = .029, which was driven by propositional density being significantly higher in young adults than older-old adults, Cohen’s f = 0.15, p = .027. No other significant group differences were found. In a sample of older adults, propositional density scores on past- and future-oriented tasks were significantly correlated, ρ = .43, p &lt; .001. In advanced older age, many individuals may display lower propositional density in spoken autobiographical event memories, possibly reflecting that the elements of memories are less elaborately described in this population.",

          "abstract": "Category learning is the ability to link items to a shared label based on their common features. Despite being important for individuals of all ages, there is little research on how older age affects category learning and generalization. Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

          "authors": "Victor Rosi; Emma Soopramanien; Carolyn McGettigan",
          "abstract": "Modern speech technologies enable the artificial replication, or cloning, of the human voice. In the present study, we investigated whether listeners’ perception and social evaluation of state-of-the-art voice clones depend on whether the clone being heard is a replica of the self, a friend, or a total stranger. We recorded and cloned the voices of familiar pairs of adult participants. Forty-seven of these experimental participants (and 47 unfamiliar controls) rated the Trustworthiness, Attractiveness, Competence, and Dominance of cloned and recorded samples of their own voice and their friend’s voice. We observed that while familiar listeners found clones to sound less (or similarly) trustworthy, attractive, and competent than recordings, unfamiliar listeners showed an opposing profile in which clones tended to be rated higher than recordings. Within this, familiar listeners tended to prefer their friend’s voice to their own, although perceived similarity of both self- and friend-voice clones to the original speaker identity predicted higher ratings on all trait scales. Overall, we find that familiar listeners’ impressions are sensitive to the perceived accuracy and authenticity of cloning for voices they know well, while unfamiliar listeners tend to prefer the synthetic versions of those same voice identities. The latter observation may relate to the tendency of generative voice synthesis models to homogenise speaking accents and styles, such that they more closely approximate (preferred) norms.",

          "abstract": "Social exclusion or rejection is a universal stressor, and strong responses to rejection have been related to various mental health issues. Previous studies have shown that peer rejection and rejection reactivity are associated with concurrent activity in the insula, striatum, cingulate, parietal and prefrontal cortex. To date however, studies have only looked at peer rejection in relation to the state of the brain during rejection, not more stable brain characteristics. Identifying which brain areas are different among those that respond more to rejection could help us understand more of the biological underpinnings of those more sensitive to rejection and ultimately alleviate associated mental health issues. \nHere we studied how brain structure and resting state functional connectivity are related to rejection reactivity outside of the scanner, in a population-based sample of 1,814 9-to-12-year-olds. Observed emotional facial expressions and self-reported feelings during social exclusion were measured using the Cyberball paradigm, which took place outside of the MRI scanner. We assessed structural brain morphology using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging, and functional connectivity using resting-state functional imaging. \n \tStronger resting-state functional connectivity between the dorsal striatum, visual, and sensori-motor networks, and between the cingulo-operculum and dorsal attention network was positively related to negative emotional facial expressions during peer rejection. No associations were detected between functional connectivity and self-reported rejection reactivity, nor between gray or white matter (micro-)structure and observed or reported rejection reactivity. \nThe dorsal striatum is related to automated behavior and the resting state functional connectivity between these and the other networks may indicate why some children are more expressive in their reaction to social exclusion. Moreover, the cingulo-operculum network overlaps with the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, areas related to pain processing. These findings are in line with earlier studies showing a neural substrate for feeling ‘hurt’ when socially excluded, and indicate specific resting-state functional connectivity related to increased risk of feeling hurt.",

Therefore, the present study examines (1) whether individuals with and without a history of NSSI differ in anger levels in their natural setting and (2) whether heightened self- or other-directed anger predicts NSSI cognitions (i.e., thoughts and self-efficacy to resist NSSI) and behavior in daily life. Using ecological momentary assessment in 60 emerging adults (ages 18–22) with and without past-year NSSI, participants completed eight daily surveys over 12 days, yielding 4,587 assessments (median compliance=83.3%; IQR=71.9–91.7). Emerging adults with past-year NSSI reported higher anger at self and others than peers without NSSI. Among those who self-injured, higher-than-usual anger at self, but not at others, predicted greater NSSI thought intensity and lower self-efficacy to resist NSSI 90 minutes later. Anger at self also predicted NSSI behavior, but this association became non-significant when controlling for NSSI thoughts. These findings highlight differences in the object of anger between individuals with and without past-year NSSI and underscore the clinical importance of interventions focused on improving emotion regulation and reducing self-directed anger to decrease NSSI thoughts and prevent self-injury.",

          "abstract": "People often intend to embrace a healthy lifestyle but struggle to adopt or maintain these habits. Conflict and facilitation between health goals and other life goals (horizontal interrelations) or personal values (vertical interrelations) can impact the initiation and maintenance of health behaviors. Optimal measures of such goal interrelations are crucial to ensure the efficacy of health behavior interventions. However, existing methods heavily rely on self-reports, making them susceptible to biases. In this study, we introduce the PEP-Goal, the first implicit measure of health goal conflict and facilitation based on the Propositional Evaluation Paradigm (PEP). Our findings revealed notable dissociations between the PEP-Goal and the standard self-report approach (Personal Project Analysis). While our study offers initial support for the predictive validity of PEP-Goal, further refinements are warranted. Specifically, implicit PEP-Goal scores indicating horizontal conflict and facilitation between physical activity (PA) goals and other life goals positively correlated with actual PA behavior, as quantified by activity trackers over a one-week period. Conversely, implicit vertical scores did not exhibit significant predictive value. Although further improvements are necessary, this study provides preliminary evidence for the predictive validity at the horizontal level and practical applicability of PEP-Goal as an implicit measure of goal interrelations.",

          "authors": "Anne E Urai",
          "abstract": "Studies of perceptual decision-making typically present the same stimulus repeatedly over the course of an experimental session but ignore the order of these observations, assuming unrealistic stability of decision strategies over trials. However, even so-called ‘stable’, ‘steady-state’ or ‘expert’ decision-making behavior features significant trial-to-trial variability that is richly structured in time. Structured trial-to-trial variability of different forms can be uncovered using latent variable models such as Hidden Markov Models and Autoregressive models, revealing how unobservable internal states change over time. Capturing such temporal structure can avoid confounds in cognitive models, provide insights into inter- and intra-individual variability, and bridge the gap between neural and cognitive mechanisms of variability in perceptual decision-making.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate profiles of math emotions and performance, and their stability when students transition from Grade 4 to 5 (n = 345). Furthermore, differences in school burnout levels associated with profile membership were investigated. A latent profile analysis was conducted to identify subgroups of students with different patterns of math anxiety, enjoyment, boredom and performance (i.e., arithmetic fluency and number processing), followed by latent transition analysis to examine profiles’ stability. We identified four profiles of math emotions and performance: Positive (positive with mixed performance, i.e., high in arithmetic fluency, average in number processing) [t1 and t2: 27.0%]; Anxious (mildly anxious and weaker-performing) [t1: 32.8%; t2: 32.5%]; Neutral (neutral and high-performing) [t1: 25.2%; t2: 25.8%]; and Negative (negative with mixed performance, i.e., weaker in arithmetic fluency, average in number processing) [t1: 15.1%; t2: 14.8%]. The profiles demonstrated high stability of remaining in the same group, with the Anxious profile indicating the highest stability (96.8%) and the Negative profile, the lowest (79.0%). Furthermore, we observed that the profiles characterised by higher performance, higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions exhibited lower burnout levels than other profiles. In line with previous research, these findings suggest that students demonstrate individual differences in math emotions, performance and school burnout already in primary school, and that studying these heterogeneous patterns is crucial for providing personalised educational support in math teaching and learning.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The therapeutic alliance is one of the most stable predictors of symptom burden over the course of therapy. So far, this effect has only been examined on the basis of sessions. Continuous-time models (CTM) allow this relationship to be modeled as a continuous process in which the actual time interval between measurements is considered. The aim of the present study was to compare the fit of discrete-time models (DTM) of the alliance-symptom relationship with CTM using different time variables (sessions vs. actual time interval). Method: Data from 1413 patients at a university psychotherapy outpatient clinic were analyzed. The alliance and symptom burden were assessed each session with the Bernese Session Report and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-Short Form, respectively. Different DTM and CTM were estimated using the R-package ctsem and compared in their fit via the Akaike information criterion. Results: CTMs with session as the time unit fitted the data best. Significant negative within-person effects of alliance and symptom burden were found. These effects showed a significant positive correlation, implying that individuals with a stronger effect of the alliance on symptom severity also showed a stronger effect of symptom severity on the alliance. Conclusions: When modeling the relationship of symptom severity and alliance it seems to be of more importance to capture the fact that a session occurred than to capture the exact time intervals between sessions. Future studies should examine this finding for other psychotherapeutic factors. Interpersonal factors might explain the positive association of the reciprocal alliance-symptom effects.",

          "abstract": "Conversation topics may vary in abstractness. This might impact the effort required by speakers to reach a common ground and, ultimately, an interactive alignment. In fact, people typically feel less confident with abstract concepts and single-words rating studies suggest abstract concepts are more associated with social interactions than concrete concepts—hence suggesting increasing levels of abstractness enhance inner and mutual monitoring processes. However, experimental studies addressing conversational dynamics afforded by abstract concepts are still sparse. In three preregistered experiments we ask whether abstract sentences are associated with specific constructs in dialogue, i.e., higher uncertainty, more curiosity and willingness to continue a conversation, and more questions related to causal and agency aspects. We do so by asking participants to evaluate the plausibility of linguistic exchanges referring to concrete and abstract concepts. Results support theories proposing that abstract concepts involve more inner monitoring and social dynamics compared to concrete concepts and suggest that reaching alignment in dialogue is more effortful with abstract than with concrete concepts.",

The participants were teachers (n = 350), middle school students (n = 357) and high school students (n = 375) from Uruguay, who completed subjective well-being scales (SWLS and PANAS) and an open-ended question, processed through automated text analysis. Factor, reliability and correlation analyses suggest the validity of both scales; cluster analysis suggests the existence of four affective profiles similar to Norlander et al.'s (2002) model: self-fulfilling, self-destructive, high-affective and low-affective. Although the educational institution is predominantly associated with unpleasant experiences (such as stress, tiredness, sadness and anxiety), it is also associated with joy and happiness; differences were identified depending on the affective profile: for example, associations with interest, motivation and curiosity are distinctive of the self-fulfilling profile, while disappointment, displeasure and loneliness are distinctive of the self-destructive profile. The results suggest that the conjunction of scales and text analysis allows for insights into well-being in educational contexts.",

          "abstract": "Lee and Chung explore how ChatGPT augments human creativity in brainstorming. In a series of experiments, they randomized participants to complete a range of creative challenges, either with or without the help of ChatGPT. These challenges included tasks such as coming up with gift ideas, designing toys from various everyday objects, and repurposing household items. Each participant submitted one idea, which external evaluators rated on multiple creativity dimensions, including innovativeness and usefulness. Across tasks, instructing participants to use ChatGPT enhanced the average creativity of ideas, outperforming web searches and unaided human intuition, with creativity measured as the average of aggregated scores of originality (original, innovative, creative) and appropriateness (practical, effective, useful). These results strengthen the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in idea generation, contributing to a rapidly growing literature. However, as we further demonstrate analytically, reliance on ChatGPT for idea generation comes with a significant tradeoff: while enhancing individual ideas' creativity, it reduces the diversity of ideas in a pool of ideas—a critical element for effective brainstorming.",

          "abstract": "In this chapter, we will summarize recent empirical results highlighting how different groups of people solve pure coordination games. Such games are traditionally studied in behavioural economics, where two people need to coordinate without communicating with each other. Our results suggest that coordination choices vary across groups of people, and that people can adapt flexibly to these differences in order to coordinate between groups. We propose that pure coordination games are a useful empirical platform for studying aspects of mindshaping. Drawing on existing psychological literature on alignment during interactions, we suggest that experience of successful interaction leads people to develop aligned intuitions about what is relevant and appropriate that support coordination when interaction and communication is not possible. Consistent with arguments made in the literature on mindshaping we believe that such alignment is more important for coordination than mindreading inferences about mental states, and indeed that mindreading is instead a form of coordination behaviour that is dependent upon intuitive alignment.",

          "abstract": "A prospective partner’s sexual history provides important information that can be used to minimise mating-related risks. Such information includes the number of past sexual partners, which has an inverse relationship with positive suitor evaluation. However, sexual encounters with new partners vary in frequency over time, providing an additional dimension of context not previously considered. Across three studies (N = 5,331) with 15 samples, we demonstrate that the impact of past partner number on a suitor’s desirability varies as a function of distribution over time. Using graphical representations of a suitor’s sexual history, we found that past partner number effects were smaller when the frequency of new sexual encounters decreased over time. This moderation effect was stronger, and often curvilinear, when past partner numbers were higher. We replicated these findings in 11 countries from five world regions. Sex differences were minimal and inconsistent pointing to a lack of a sexual double standards. Sociosexuality (openness to casual sex) was a consistent moderator and tended to mute the sexual history effects. These findings suggest that people not only attend to a potential mate’s quantity of sexual partners, but also the context surrounding these encounters such as pattern and timing. Together, the findings raise the possibility of an evolved mechanism for managing mating risks present in both sexes and across populations and adds nuance to a contentious topic of public interest.",

Quantitative language analysis provides a window to emotional experiences, rarely used in Spanish-speaking contexts. This study develops and cross-culturally validates an annotated dictionary of explicit emotional vocabulary, a tool for analyzing affective variables from texts and open-ended responses. A systematic protocol and expert judgment were used to select and annotate 1,041 lexical families (3,051 lemmas and 18,934 words), and pre-recorded hypotheses about the validity of the instrument were tested. Participants, adolescents from Uruguay (n = 1,208, 59% female, age M = 14.4) and Spain (n = 596, 41% female, age M = 15.7), completed Subjective Well-Being (SWB) scales and wrote about their emotional experiences in an open-ended response. The dictionary showed convergence with other instruments and acceptable inter-rater reliability. When applied to open-ended responses, it captured a substantial proportion of the words written by participants and showed significant correlations with SWB in both the Uruguayan and Spanish samples. These results suggest that quantitative analysis of open-ended responses allows the exploration of well-being, and that this freely available instrument is a valid resource for doing so, serving as a complement to quantitative and qualitative approaches for research or intervention purposes.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The introduction of artificial lighting and the 24-hour society provoked a form of circadian misalignment called social jetlag: the misalignment between the biological clock and the social clock. The literature has mainly focused on the association between social jetlag and negative mental health in students, while knowledge on the association with wellbeing in adults is limited.\nMethods: The total sample included 20.143 Dutch participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). The Munich Chronotype Questionnaire was used to compute sleep-corrected social jetlag. Subjective happiness, Satisfaction with life, and Quality of life were used to create a wellbeing factor score. Linear regression models were applied to assess the association between social jetlag and wellbeing, and the interaction effects of age and day of the week. Additionally, a within-family analysis was performed to correct for the effect of the family environment.                                                                                                  \nResults: We found a weak but significant negative correlation between social jetlag and the wellbeing scales (r = -0.05). The effect of social jetlag on the wellbeing factor score was marginal (β = -0.05, R2 = 0.22%, p &lt; 0.001, N = 7456) and did not depend on age or day of the week. The within-family design showed that the association was not confounded by effects shared within family such as rearing effects and heritable confounders. \nDiscussion: The negative association between social jetlag and wellbeing is marginal, and does not depend on age or day of the week. The association does not seem to be confounded by the effects shared by family members. Our results indicate that social jetlag should not be a primary concern for wellbeing. Future studies should focus on using objective measures for social jetlag and use longitudinal data to disentangle short term and long term results.",

          "abstract": "Knowing what someone else knows is important in shared environments. However, the knowledge of others is not immediately perceptible. Luckily, an agent’s behavior within a task leaves clues for an observer to estimate their expertise. A task expert will make the best decisions to reach their goal, while a novice will make decisions seemingly at random. An expert observer should be able to evaluate the decisions of an agent by comparing the agent’s decision to the ideal one. On the other hand, a novice observer does not know the ideal decision and, thus, cannot compare the agent’s decision to it.\nWe test the hypothesis that with increasing expertise, people can more accurately assess the expertise of others. The results of the two studies we present are consistent with this hypothesis. The first experimental study showed the expected interaction of agent and judge expertise in a task with limited external validity. In the second study, the results of the first study were replicated in a more generally applicable task. We discuss possible moderators of this effect, such as conflicting expertise cues and additional metacognitive information communicated by the agent. Moreover, we outline the consequences of expertise imbalance for identifying imposters in expert fields.",

Using two structured tasks and one free-play task, we measured joint attention episodes in interactions of 12- to 15-month-old Swiss infants with one of their caregivers during the pandemic. In one experimental condition, the caregivers wore a facial mask; in the other, they did not. The results show no significant differences in infants’ joint attention between the two conditions. Infants may have interacted with their caregivers wearing facial masks enough previously not to be influenced by masks; alternatively, even with a partially covered face, a person provides enough information via eyes and other body parts that help infants to guide their attention.",

          "abstract": "Background and aims: Social media vaping awareness campaigns can potentially decrease youth vaping prevalence. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers capabilities for rapidly producing campaign materials at scale, however, there is limited research on youth perceptions of AI-generated materials combining images and text.\nMethods: We conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study in Queensland, Australia. Phase 1 involved two focus groups (n=10 total; mean age: 16.3) to evaluate AI-generated materials created using a basic approach of zero-shot prompting (ZSP; AI performs tasks without examples), single-prompt usage (outputs used without refinement) and automatic text-image integration. Phase 2 involved semi-structured interviews (n=9, mean age: 23) to evaluate new materials developed using a refined approach based on Phase 1 feedback, including, few-shot prompting (FSP; AI performs task with examples), multi-prompt usage (outputs used after refinement), and manual text-image integration. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.\nResults: Analysis of phase 1 focus groups identified several technical limitations in materials developed using the basic approach, including poor alignment between images and text, awkward language, artificial imagery, and outdated images of vaping devices. When these technical limitations were addressed through the refined approach in Phase 2, thematic analysis of interview data revealed that participants focused on broader aspects of effective messaging. Six key characteristics emerged: (1) capture attention through visual appeal, (2) focus on immediate consequences, (3) make messages relevant to youth, (4) include clear calls to action, (5) avoid ambiguous and fear-mongering statements, and (6) tailor messages to diverse youth. \nConclusions: AI can generate individual text and image components for health promotion campaigns, but automated AI multimedia material development is unlikely to succeed. Effective implementation will require co-designing with young people to guide material refinement and design integration, alongside FSP approaches to ensure that materials resonate with diverse youth.",

          "abstract": "Human perception is often characterised by efficient combination of sensory signals (cues). In recent studies, people could also improve precision via newly learned cues, with applications to enhance perception in healthy and clinical groups.  However, it is unclear whether new cues can enhance manual object interactions. To study how new cues are used for object weight perception, people compared weights of containers. With haptic information plus the familiar visual cue of volume, participants showed precision improvements indicating cue combination. By contrast, a group of participants briefly trained with a novel visual cue to weight (line orientation) did not show improvements expected from combination.  We then asked whether prolonged training (12 hours) with the novel cue would promote combination, testing for significant precision gains individually in six participants. Half of participants showed combination benefits, but these were not clearly related to training, as some combined cues before training. Using an illusion analogous to the size-weight illusion, we also asked whether the novel cue would become an automatic predictor of weight: two participants were susceptible to the illusion. We conclude that weight perception is susceptible to some enhancement, but subject to training effects and individual differences that are not yet understood.",

          "abstract": "Affective empathy, the ability to share and understand others’ emotional states, is a fundamental aspect of social cognition. Recent evidence suggests that interoceptive inference, the brain’s prediction and processing of internal bodily signals, plays a key role in affective empathy. Building on the active inference framework, we propose that emotional contagion arises from shared interoceptive priors between individuals, shaped by physiological synchrony during social interaction. We hypothesize that precision-weighted interoceptive prediction errors update shared priors, enabling the dynamic alignment of affective states and flexible switching between defensive and affiliative modes of co-regulation. We discuss the putative neurobiological implementation of this model, focusing on the insula, amygdala, and brainstem nuclei involved in interoception and allostatic control. This theoretical account bridges neurobiology and phenomenology through computational modeling, generating precise hypotheses for future research on the mechanisms of emotional contagion",

          "abstract": "Background: Abnormalities in emotion dynamics and processes, such as emotional inflexibility and dominance of negative emotions, are characteristic of depression. The extent to which these abnormalities persist following depressive episodes, and represent a vulnerability factor for recurrent depressive episodes, remains unknown. The current study investigated emotion dynamics and their predictive validity in a sample of individuals with remitted depression (rMDD) and healthy controls (HC). \nMethods: Adults (HC: n=50; rMDD: n=48) completed a three-week ecological momentary assessment protocol, in which they responded to two items probing positive emotions and three items probing negative emotions six times daily. Contemporaneous and temporal networks were constructed using multilevel vector autoregressive models. Density was calculated as a measure of emotional inflexibility and In- and Out-Expected Influence were calculated as measures of centrality. Linear regression models were used to examine if density predicted clinical outcomes at the 6-month follow-up assessment. \nResults: Individuals with rMDD had significantly denser temporal emotional networks than HC participants. Groups also showed differential patterns of the most influential nodes in temporal and contemporaneous networks. Greater temporal density and contemporaneous density was significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, assessed through both clinician-rated and self-report measures. \nConclusions: Abnormalities in emotion dynamics persist following remission from depression and can be used to predict future depressive symptoms, suggesting these may represent a vulnerability factor for depression. Future research should study if interventions based on emotion networks targeting maladaptive emotional processes are able to prevent future depression.",

          "abstract": "In the UK, most autistic pupils are educated in mainstream schools. However, evidence shows that autistic pupils are more likely to experience lower quality of school life, and an academic attainment gap exists between autistic pupils and their peers. To reduce current educational inequalities for autistic pupils, it is critical to take a holistic approach and understand potential barriers and facilitators to their school success. Amplifying the autistic voice and utilising insights from autistic pupils currently attending mainstream secondary schools alongside their parents, is fundamentally important. This mixed-method, multi-informant study utilised accessible approaches (accessible interviewing, pot-sorting task, parent questionnaire) to explore the views of autistic adolescents (n=14; 12-17 years) and parents. Reflexive Thematic Analysis identified core themes around facilitators and barriers to school success. The young people and parents highlighted core roles of relationships with others, the school environment, individual experiences, and (lack of) understanding. At a time when the UK is experiencing a school and attendance crisis, when school resources are limited, and when so many young people express that they are not happy at school, these insights provide potential areas for the prioritisation of evidence-informed actions, with the ultimate goal of improving school success for autistic pupils.",

Over the years, mediation analysis has become one of the most widely used statistical techniques in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. Yet the most popular techniques for mediation analysis rely strongly on normality assumptions and are therefore susceptible to the influence of outliers or nonnormal distributions. We review common mediation models and discuss various approaches for estimation and inference, including their implementation in software packages. Moreover, we present robust alternatives, thereby clarifying different notions of robustness. Finally, we consider a setting where the mediation model holds in a latent space but where measurement issues create deviations from normality assumptions in the observed variable space, which is a setting not commonly considered in the literature on robust mediation analysis, and we obtain preliminary results via a simulation study.",

Individual differences in sensitivity are linked to psychological, physiological, and genetic factors and can be measured using the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) scale. Over three decades, the conceptualization of sensitivity has shifted from a unidimensional to a multidimensional trait, necessitating a revision of the original scale. This study introduces and validates the revised HSP scale (HSP-R) using a UK and USA sample of 1,000 adults. Exploratory factor analysis on a calibration subsample (n = 600) yielded a 6-factor, 18-item structure, which was confirmed in a validation subsample (n = 400). The HSP-R measures six dimensions of sensitivity: Sensitivity to Details, Depth of Processing, Social Sensitivity, Sensitivity to Positive Experiences, Emotional Reactivity, and Overstimulation. It demonstrates robust psychometric properties, aligns with theoretical frameworks, and provides incremental validity beyond the Big Five traits.",

          "abstract": "Efficiency principles are increasingly called upon to study features of human language and communication. Zipf’s law of abbreviation is widely seen as a classic instance of a linguistic pattern brought about by language users’ search for efficient communication. The “law”—a recurrent correlation between the frequency of words and their brevity—is a near-universal principle of communication, having been found in all of the hundreds of human languages where it has been tested, and a few non-human communication systems as well. The standard explanation for the law of abbreviation derives it from pressures for efficiency: speakers minimize their cumulative effort by using shorter words for frequent occurrences. This explanation, we argue here, fails to explain why long words exist at all. It also fails to explain why the law of abbreviation, despite being robust, is systematically weakened by many short and rare words. We propose an alternative account of the law of abbreviation, based on a simple cultural evolutionary model. Our model does not require any pressure for efficiency. Instead, it derives the law of abbreviation from a general pressure for brevity applying to all words regardless of their frequency. This model makes two accurate predictions that the standard model misses: the correlation between frequency and brevity is consistently weak, and it is characterized by heteroskedasticity, with many short and rare words. We argue on this basis that efficiency considerations are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the law.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation modelling has been shown to uncover new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision making from behavioural data. By jointly modelling reaction time and accuracy data, such decision models estimate latent variables that represent distinct computaitonal processes, such as stimulus encoding, response caution and the quality of information processing. In this study we use an evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA), to shed new light into the mechanisms that underlie learning based on linguistic and action-based training. The LBA model is applied to behavioural data from a previously published training study where participants learn to name, tie or name and tie a set of knots. Our results show that training is multifaceted and associated with an increase in stimulus-encoding time, a reduction in response caution, as well as an increase in the speed of information accumulation. Furthermore, the results showed that there was an added benefit to the rate of evidence accumulation when naming and tying experience were combined. This latter finding suggests that performance benefits from multi-modal training may be instantiated in computational processes that are associated with the quantity and quality of information accumulation during decision making. Overall, in applying this computational approach to accuracy and reaction time data, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that govern experience-dependent plasticity.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

What social and psychological factors are associated with the selection of communication channels in everyday life? Here we report on findings from an intensive longitudinal field study of undergraduate students (N = 1,423 participants; ecological momentary assessments = 27,644) that examined: (1) the role of interaction partners in the selection of communication channels and (2) the associations between channel selection and perceptions of empathy during meaningful social interactions. Our findings indicated a preference for media-rich channels, such as face-to-face and video communication, particularly when engaging with weak social ties, compared to strong social ties. In addition, the use of media-rich channels was linked to greater momentary perceptions of empathy. Specifically, face-to-face interactions (compared to computer-mediated), as well as video calls and phone calls (compared to direct messaging) were associated with greater perceptions of empathy. These findings support and extend Media Multiplexity Theory, Media Richness Theory, and Media Synchronicity Theory by examining them in the context of interpersonal communication. The findings also show that channel selection is associated with empathy perceptions, which has implications for how people navigate social connections in an increasingly digital environment.",

          "abstract": "The attentional probe paradigm involves presenting participants with different messages simultaneously through two distinct information channels within the same modality. By measuring reaction times to modality-specific probes that can appear in either channel, this paradigm enables the assessment of attention allocation between these channels. Since the 1980s this paradigm has become prominent for investigating attentional biases in the processing of emotional information. The best-known version of it, the dot-probe technique introduced by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata (1986), uses the visual modality. What is less well-known is that I had previously introduced the attentional probe paradigm in 1981 in the auditory modality in a modified dichotic listening experiment with pure tones as auditory probes. Using this tone-probe technique this study investigated the contrasting ways in which repressors and sensitisers (Byrne,1961) handle threatening information. Criticisms from a contemporary perspective notwithstanding of the rather limited initial study, it was concluded that sensitisers displayed an attentional bias favouring the processing of threatening stimuli, whereas repressors appeared to avoid the optimal processing of such stimuli.  This paper presents a historical reconstruction of how I developed the attentional probe paradigm, how I first applied it in the auditory modality, and how it was subsequently used in the visual modality. It also introduces a multimodal version to be used in further research and offers a critique of extant research relying exclusively on decontextualized stimuli.",

          "abstract": "In visual search, observers often miss rare targets. This low prevalence effect (LPE) is resistant to many cognitive interventions. However, a recent study showed that having participants identify the item that was most similar to the target (similarity search) eliminated the LPE. As real-world searches often require binary decisions (e.g., is there a threat in this bag?) we tested whether the benefits of similarity search generalize to binary decisions and to more naturalistic stimuli. Participants searched for T shapes amongst near T-distractors and the prevalence of True-T’s was manipulated. In the similarity search only condition, participants clicked on the “most T-like object”. In the similarity search &amp; binary decision condition, participants additionally reported whether the chosen item was a true T (yes/no). We found that in some circumstances, similarity search can be used to attenuate the LPE. However, there was an LPE for the binary decision task. Participants were less likely to classify the target as a true-T during low prevalence compared to high. We replicated this result in an additional experiment using more naturalistic stimuli. Participants watched clips of road videos and clicked on the “most hazardous location” in the video, followed by a binary decision (“would you need to respond to that hazard? yes/no”). Though participants located the hazards regardless of prevalence, there was an LPE for the binary decision task. Together, these results indicate potential limitations in applying similarity search outside the laboratory; the LPE is still seen in these searches if a binary decision is involved.",

To investigate this issue, we used a previously published national sample of U.S. adults aged 20 to 94 (N = 886). We used self-reported zip code data coupled with the US Census data to reconstruct community-level indicators of social cohesion (i.e., neighborhood disorder, neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability). We found that reduced community-level social cohesion was associated with increased risk for financial exploitation. In addition, our exploratory analyses indicated that community-level indicators of social cohesion also moderated the association between subjective cognitive decline and risk of financial exploitation. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of subjective cognitive decline residing in areas with low residential instability appeared to have lower risk of financial exploitation. These results highlight how community-level factors contribute to risk for financial exploitation, which may provide a foundation for future work aimed at improving prevention strategies and public policy.",

          "abstract": "Military personnel are often required to make perceptual decisions based on noisy and uncertain information. Over the last decade, work from experiments using simple stimuli in visual psychophysical paradigms has provided evidence that in the visual periphery, observers are often prone to false alarms and variable confidence judgments in detection tasks. To better understand whether these characteristics extend to more naturalistic paradigms, our research group has developed visual detection experiments in virtual reality, where on each trial, observers are required to first fixate on specific objects, and then make judgments about whether a target (i.e., a green soldier in uniform) is present, and rate confidence in this decision. Inevitably, extending the study of peripheral vision to virtual reality involves trade-offs, with tension between the degree of experimental control that is employed and the ecological validity of the task. In this piece, we focus on the challenges that emerged and the lessons we have learned in pursuit of designs that strike a balance between these factors. In our first experiment, we required participants to ride in an automatically-controlled vehicle, fixate on each red stop sign, and determine whether targets were present in the periphery while looking at the stop sign. Results indicated that observers (1) did not successfully fulfill fixation requirements in the task in all trials, and (2) requiring targets to appear and disappear based on whether a fixation requirement was met resulted in flickering that served as an unintentional, salient cue. In our second experiment, we allowed participants to navigate the vehicle themselves, while again requiring the same fixation requirement and perceptual judgments at each intersection. Initial tests of this design found that variability in how participants navigated in the vehicles sometimes resulted in stopping at locations that did not allow for viewing the stop sign and soldier at the same moment. Finally, in our third experiment, we manipulated the presence of the targets on each trial, and expanded our confidence questions to include both target-present and target-absent trials. Results revealed that confidence was similar in both target-present and target-absent conditions. Based on these preliminary findings, we outline design-related recommendations for studies of the periphery, and explain the tradeoffs that extend across several military-relevant tasks, including both target detection and visual search.

          "abstract": "In typing proficiency tests, like those used in job recruitment or research studies, individuals are evaluated based on their speed and accuracy. However, the difficulty of the typed text — its ‘typability’ — can impact typing performance, introducing variability that is unrelated to skill. To ensure valid comparisons across individuals, time, and conditions, it is crucial to control for this variation in text difficulty. To address this issue, we develop the Typability Index, a model that predicts the relative typing speed of text. Building on earlier attempts to quantify typing difficulty from the 1940s, we create a more advanced typability model using the 136M Keystrokes dataset (Dhakal et al., 2018) where over 168,000 participants each typed 15 sentences from a pool of 1,525 items. Through random forest regression, we identify 10 key predictors from 33 candidate variables, including the proportion of lowercase letters, word frequency, and finger movement mechanics. Trained on 80% of the dataset and validated on the remaining 20% and a novel dataset, the Typability Index explained 72-87% of the variance in typability, compared to the 34% explained by an earlier leading model (Bell, 1949). To promote higher control in typing research and assessments, we introduce a web-based tool to facilitate accurate measurement and fair comparisons of text typability.",

          "authors": "Cameron Pugach; Blair Elizabeth Wisco; Vera Vine",
          "abstract": "Rumination, or thinking passively and repetitively about one’s distress, and low emotional clarity, or not understanding one’s emotions, are risk factors for psychopathology. It has been suggested that people attempt to increase emotional clarity by ruminating, but whether ruminating works to help or harm emotional clarity in the moment is unknown. In N=74 adults, following an idiographic negative mood induction, we experimentally manipulated rumination and two comparison conditions – distraction and mindfulness – to assess their effects on negative emotion, subjective and implicit indices of emotional clarity, and self-insight. Manipulation checks showed that conditions produced a pattern of distinct experiences theoretically consistent with each response style. Compared to comparison conditions, rumination was less effective in alleviating negative emotion. However, all conditions produced similar effects on emotional clarity and self-insight. Whereas each condition failed to influence subjective emotional clarity, they increased implicit clarity and perceived self-insight. Results underscore the importance of incorporating multiple measures of emotional clarity and suggest that, compared to other cognitive emotion response styles, rumination may function as a double-edged sword that keeps one entrenched in negative emotion but without impairing implicit emotional clarity and self-insight. Findings may have implications for why people ruminate despite its negative impact on well-being.",

          "abstract": "Choosing an educational path is a difficult life decision that can lead to unfavorable outcomes when it goes wrong. However, little research has examined how to support successful study major choice processes. To address this gap, we draw on person-environment fit and (affective) forecasting bias theories, assuming that higher objective major-specific fit forecasts (interests, skills, expectations) predict success (motivation, satisfaction, dropout intention, achievement) beyond subjective forecasts. Additionally relying on expectancy-value theory and cognitive dissonance theory, we assume that higher objective major-specific fit forecasts, when displayed in feedback, predict higher motivation to choose a major and higher likelihood of enrollment beyond subjective forecasts. Finally, we propose that prospective students receiving feedback before enrollment experience more success than those receiving no feedback. We tested these hypotheses in a longitudinal field study. Over three years, more than 4000 prospective students received feedback on their objective major-specific fit forecasts in an online-self-assessment and reported their motivation for the major before and after feedback. Subsequently, over 500 of these prospective students entered their respective major and reported their success. Additionally, we surveyed over 200 students who did not receive feedback. As hypothesized, objective major-specific fit forecasts predicted success beyond subjective forecasts. Higher objective forecasts related to higher motivation to choose the major and higher likelihood of enrollment beyond subjective forecasts. Finally, prospective students who received feedback on their objective forecasts before enrollment experienced more success compared to no feedback. We discuss theoretical implications for study choice and success theories and practical implications for study guidance.",

          "authors": "Xander Cornelis; Nicolas Dirix; Louisa Bogaerts",
          "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that spontaneous eye blinks have a cognitive role in addition to their biological functions. Blinking has been associated with cognitive effort and processes related to the dynamic nature of incoming sensory information such as the release of attention. However, there is limited evidence supporting the cognitive role of spontaneous blinks, specifically during reading. This study provides the first systematic investigation of blinking patterns in eye-tracking data of naturalistic silent text reading. We hypothesized that blinks would be more likely to occur (1) around punctuation marks signaling a breakpoint in the text and (2) following fixations on lower-frequency words. To test these hypotheses, we utilized data from the large Ghent Eye Tracking Corpus (GECO), which includes eye movement data from 15 participants who read an entire novel in silence. The results indicate higher blinking proportions at punctuation marks compared to other positions in the text. Additionally, blink rates were modulated by word frequency, with higher word frequencies significantly reducing the probability of blinking. Extending previous research, our findings suggest substantial top-down regulation of blinking during reading.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigates whether inner speech—the mental rehearsal of words without articulation—facilitates naming recovery in individuals with aphasia. We hypothesized that items with preserved inner speech but impaired overt naming at baseline would improve more after speech therapy than items without inner speech. \nMethod: Nineteen participants with chronic, expressive aphasia participated in three pre-treatment naming sessions, nine treatment sessions (semantic feature analysis), and three post-treatment naming sessions. For each pre- and post-treatment naming session, participants named ~300 items (pictures of nouns) aloud and also indicated whether they had inner speech for each item. Based on pre-treatment naming sessions, 30 individualized items (“Treated30”) were trained using semantic feature analysis.  Mixed-effects models analyzed the effect of treatment, inner speech, psycholinguistic properties, and aphasia severity on naming outcomes immediately post-treatment. \nResults: There was an average of 60.8% proportional improvement on overt naming and 41% improvement on inner speech for the Treated30 from baseline to follow-up. In a series of hierarchical mixed models, baseline inner speech, inner speech across the study, aphasia severity, and interactions of inner speech variables with treatment were significant in predicting correct naming post-therapy. \nConclusions: Findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between inner and overt speech: baseline inner speech and, importantly, improvements in inner speech significantly influence therapy-related gains in naming. These results suggest that inner speech-focused interventions may improve outcomes by providing a cognitive scaffold for speech production.",

          "abstract": "Background: Consumers are increasingly using LLM-based chatbots to seek mental health advice or intervention due to ease of access and limited availability of mental health professionals. However, their suitability and safety for mental health applications remain underexplored, particularly in comparison to professional therapeutic practices.\nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate how general-purpose chatbots respond to mental health scenarios and compare their responses to those provided by licensed therapists. Specifically, we sought to identify chatbots’ strengths, limitations, and the ethical and practical considerations necessary for their use in mental health care.\nMethods: We conducted a mixed methods study to compare responses from chatbots and licensed therapists to scripted mental health scenarios. We created two fictional scenarios and prompted 3 chatbots to create six interaction logs. We recruited 17 therapists and conducted study sessions that consisted of three activities. First, therapists responded to the two scenarios using a Qualtrics form. Second, therapists went through the six interaction logs using a think aloud procedure to highlight their thoughts about the chatbots’ responses. Lastly, we conducted a semi-structured interview to explore subjective opinions on the use of chatbots for supporting mental health. The study sessions were analyzed using thematic analysis. The interaction logs from chatbot and therapist responses were coded using the Multitheoretical List of Therapeutic Interventions codes and then compared to each other.\nResults: We identified seven themes describing the strengths and limitations of the chatbots as compared to therapists. These include elements of good therapy in chatbot’s responses, conversational style of chatbots, insufficient inquiry and feedback seeking by chatbots, chatbot interventions, client engagement, chatbots’ responses to crisis situations, and considerations for chatbot-based therapy. In the use of MULTI codes, we found that therapists evoked more elaboration (t = 4.50, p = 0.001) and employed more self-disclosure (t = 1.05, p = 0.31) as compared to the chatbots. The chatbots used affirming (t = 1.71, p = 0.10) and reassuring (t = 2.29, p = 0.03) language more often than the therapists. The chatbots also employed psychoeducation (t = 2.69, p = 0.01) and suggestions (t = 4.23, p = 0.001) more often than the therapists did.\nConclusions: Our study demonstrates the unsuitability of general purpose chatbots to safely engage in mental health conversations, particularly in crisis situations. While chatbots display elements of good therapy, such as validation and reassurance, overuse of directive advice without sufficient inquiry, and use of generic interventions makes them unsuitable as therapeutic agents. Careful research and evaluation will be necessary to determine the impact of chatbot interactions and to identify the most appropriate use cases related to mental health.",

However, this phenomenon has been underexplored in second language (L2) speakers who may rely on more “shallow” representations. Using a megastudy dataset, we investigate how sensorimotor strength affects L1 and L2 word recognition performance. Bayesian hierarchical regressions revealed that variables associated with physical sensations (interoceptive strength, motor action) and communication experience (head or mouth movement, auditory strength) produced strong effects in both groups. On the other hand, variables associated with concrete objects (visual, haptic experience) and with taste/smell (olfactory, gustatory experience) influenced L1 word recognition performance to a larger extent than in L2. In L2, reliance on semantic information during word recognition is reduced, with stronger effects of lexical variables compared to L1. The findings provide implications for understanding second language processing mechanisms and demonstrate the usefulness of megastudy datasets in investigating L2 conceptual representations.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. The robust linguistic and clinical research literature focusing on English language acquisition is generally based on a model that presumes that the oral language a child acquires at home without formal instruction is the same language that is used for reading and writing. Arabic presents a qualitatively different scenario, in that children learning Arabic must acquire at least two different language systems: (1) a dialectal form that is largely used for informal interactions and which is not formally codified, and (2) a standard form, which is typically used in formal contexts and is almost exclusively reserved for reading and writing. Multilingual Arabic speakers are among the fastest growing language communities in the United States (US), yet very little is known about language development in Arabic-English speaking children, leading to critical knowledge gaps in language acquisition theory, assessment, and intervention. This project was designed to provide an initial overview of the Arabic-English language learning environment by addressing the following research questions: \nRQ 1: Do demographic characteristics such as parent sex and parent education influence caregiver reported parent-child use of language outside of the home in the standard form and spoken/home language form?\nRQ 2: Do demographic characteristics such as parent sex and parent education influence caregiver reported child grammatical outcomes, such as verb use, tense, and agreement? \nMethod. A community-based participatory approach was utilized for participant recruitment. The author partnered with community stakeholders to recruit a pilot sample of 42 families to the study. This study received institutional review board approval and followed all ethical guidelines. Questionnaires assessing caregiver ratings of their children’s language skills and the language richness of the home environment was administered in person within participants’ homes or in locations selected by participants (e.g., community centers). Families who consented were audio recorded for fidelity.",

The present research aimed to investigate whether L2 use could impact the judgment of bullshit, and, provided that the impact is observed, if the mechanisms behind the FLE could rely on emotionality. Bullshit is a form of meaningless material that is grammatically and syntactically correct, and has been studied in empirical psychology. We conducted two studies with participants differing in L2 proficiency. The participants were instructed to evaluate the profoundness of positive, negative, and neutral bullshit and mundane statements in their L1 and L2. The results suggest that people are more prone to accept the profundity of emotionally charged bullshit, whereas L2 use mostly impacts the judgment of less proficient speakers – it could diminish their ability to detect neutral nonsense and refute the profundity of negative mundane statements. This implies the dependence of FLE on valence, meaning, and their interaction. We discuss findings within Dual Process accounts of reasoning, noting that both emotional involvement and using a L2 lead to quick, intuitive processing. Therefore, to sound profound, use emotional words or a foreign language!",

          "abstract": "Background: Suicidal behaviour is a critical mental health issue in the adolescent population, often linked to serious emotional problems that leave survivors vulnerable to future risk. Psychological crises in adolescence are primarily associated with relational conflicts, with emotional crises involving depression or anxiety significantly increasing suicidal risk. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the rates of suicidal behaviour in adolescents undergoing emotional crises and explore their association with psychiatric diagnoses and demographic factors in Ecuador. Methods: An observational, correlational study using a quantitative approach was conducted. Data from 252 adolescents admitted to the Crisis Intervention Unit at the Institute of Neurosciences in Guayaquil, Ecuador, between 2011 and 2023 were analysed. Hospitalisation frequencies by year, gender, and associated psychiatric diagnoses were assessed. Data were obtained from each patient's unified clinical history. Results: Seventy-five percent of the patients were female, with 48% aged 17–18 years. Most adolescents were single (98%), and 86% had a secondary education level. The most frequent diagnosis was a depressive episode (73.4%), with 156 patients presenting suicidal ideation. Cutting and ingestion of psychotropic drugs were the most common suicide methods, predominantly among females. Logistic regression showed that a combination of an eating disorder and a depressive episode was associated with a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation or attempts. Conclusions: The high frequency of suicidal behaviour in adolescent females aged 16–18 years underscores the need for targeted prevention programs addressing emotional crises and stress management in this high-risk group.",

Clinical outcomes were derived from changes in repeated self-reported scores on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) surveys administered before the first and most recent treatment visits. Adjusted logistic and linear regression was used for the analyses examining type of provider characteristic selected, engagement, and changes in each clinical outcome.\nResults  This study included Grow Therapy patients (mean age 34.0 years; 69.8% identifying as female). Over a quarter of patients selected a provider specialty (27.1%) and 4.4% selected a provider identity. Patients met with their provider a mean of 9.6 times (67.4% had 3 or more visits) and, among complete case patients with at least 2 PHQ-9 and 2 GAD-7 assessments (n=67,105), a large proportion showed significantly improved symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 improvement=3.5, 60.0% with a minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) and anxiety (GAD-7 improvement=3.5, 66.1% MCID). Patients selecting a provider specialty had fewer visits but had greater declines in depression symptoms, and those selecting a provider identity engaged longer in care than patients not selecting each of these characteristics, respectively.\nConclusions and Relevance  This real world study demonstrates that a technology-enabled mental health platform that allows patients to self-select their provider is engaging and preliminarily efficacious. Patients may maximize benefits of these platforms by selecting preferred characteristics of their providers.",

          "abstract": "Young children mostly seek help from teachers in early care and education settings, yet little is known about the factors influencing their help-seeking expectations within teacher-child interactions. This study examined the help-seeking expectations of Han Chinese children aged 5–6 years (N = 90, 45 boys) from Hangzhou, East China, focusing on teachers’ familiarity and response quality. The results indicated that young children were more likely to expect to seek help from familiar teachers, particularly those who previously responded positively. In contrast, young children were hesitant to expect to seek help from unfamiliar teachers, regardless of their response quality. These results suggest that preschool children flexibly form help-seeking expectations based on teachers’ familiarity and response quality, prioritizing familiarity over response quality. The implications of these findings emphasize the importance of fostering positive and trusting relationships in early childhood education to promote adaptive help-seeking strategies.",

          "abstract": "It is common for mastectomy patients to present with sensorimotor symptoms that can affect the execution of voluntary movements, which engages endogenous motor representations. It is therefore necessary to expand our knowledge of motor representations in mastectomy patients to propose novel and complementary tools to conventional rehabilitation. The investigation of such motor representations may be conducted through the utilisation of tasks that implicitly engage a motor imagery process. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to ascertain the impact of a unilateral mastectomy on motor representations, employing an implicit motor imagery task. To investigate this, seven mastectomy participants and ten matched healthy controls had to judge the laterality of hands presented in a different view (i.e., back and palm) and different orientations (i.e., 0°, 90° lateral, 90° medial and 180°). The results demonstrated that the mastectomy group exhibited a lower hit rate than the control participants and a longer response time, particularly for the palm view in postures that engaged significant biomechanical constraints (i.e., 90° lateral and 180°). These findings suggest that mastectomy procedure induce alterations in patients’ motor representations. Accordingly, we propose that the mastectomy participants had greater difficulty in simulating the movement that allowed them to rotate their own hand in order to align it with the hand image presented on the computer screen.",

We collected evaluative ratings of the photos, using a convenience sample of 16,208 participants in a total of 25,321 sessions. We used multiple evaluation measures: binary positive/negative and like/dislike categorization, 7-point ratings on these attributes, both under no time pressure and under time pressure, and evaluative priming scores. The mean evaluation of the photos on the different measures was highly correlated, but some photos consistently elicited a discrepant evaluative reaction between the measures. The BRIC is a valuable resource for eliciting evaluative reactions and can contribute to research on evaluative processes and affective responses.",

Herein, we will challenge IIT-Concerned’s criticism by providing a historical parallel. And yet, our goal is not to promote IIT over other theories of consciousness. As discussed below, we believe that IIT has both strengths and weaknesses as a theory of consciousness; we are not arguing against reasonable criticisms of the theory.

          "abstract": "Objectives. This study aims to investigate historical trends in the incidence of anorexia nervosa in the U.S. and evaluate the alignment between actual rates and public and professional perceptions. Methods. We analyzed anorexia incidence rates using data from studies retrieved through scientific databases, including Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and Medline/PubMed. Incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 individuals. Additionally, we surveyed 264 U.S. adults and 23 mental health practitioners to capture their estimates of anorexia prevalence over time. Results. Historical data from 1942 to 2010 revealed a stable incidence rate of anorexia nervosa in one U.S. state until 1979, followed by an increase in nationally representative samples beginning in 1990. A slight decline in rates has been observed since then. Survey results indicated that both the general public and practitioners consistently overestimate anorexia prevalence, with the gap widening in more recent years. Notably, public estimates were less accurate compared to those of practitioners, though both groups significantly inflated prevalence rates. Conclusions. There is a persistent overestimation of anorexia nervosa prevalence among both the general public and mental health professionals, with professionals demonstrating slightly greater accuracy. These findings highlight the need for improved awareness and dissemination of accurate epidemiological data to mitigate misconceptions about the disorder's prevalence.",

          "authors": "Paul Linton",
          "abstract": "We present two new versions of the Hollow Face Illusion that challenge our understanding of depth cue integration. Traditional accounts of depth cue integration operate at the level of visual experience. On this account, perspective or shading can cancel out (or even invert) perceived stereo depth. By contrast, Linton (2017), Ch.2, argues that depth cue integration is merely ‘cognitive’, leaving our visual experience of stereo depth intact. The strongest challenge to Linton’s account is the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’, where shape from shading appears to invert stereo depth. Here, we argue that perceived depth is not inverted in the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’. 1. Un-Hollow Face Illusion: The hollow of the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’ is space that physically exists (mask is concave), and yet is impossible so far as the illusion is concerned (illusion is convex). When we fill this concave hollow space with 3D objects (balls, rods, protruding nose) that are inconsistent with the illusion, we experience the illusory motion (which persists) as occurring on a concave surface behind the 3D objects. (Some experience this concavity without the additional objects). 2. Morphing Face Illusion: If we attach small balls to the tip of the nose, base of the nose, and cheek, and morph from a protruding face to a hollow face and back again, the ordinal depth between these three points is seen as switching veridically. Our explanation for the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’ is therefore ‘cognitive’: whilst we might be fooled by the ‘Hollow Face Illusion’, our visual system is not.",

          "authors": "Paul Linton",
          "abstract": "We present a new illusion that challenges our understanding of visual scale. Since Helmholtz’s ‘telestereoscope’ (1857), we’ve known that stereo vision governs visual scale, turning a real-world scene into a miniature scene despite all other depth cues being present. This effect is attributed to vergence and/or vertical disparities (Howard &amp; Rogers, 2012). By contrast, Linton (2018) BioRxiv, attributes the effect to horizontal disparities. To adjudicate between these two accounts, we build a virtual reality ‘telestereoscope’ that can decouple changes in vergence and vertical disparity from changes in horizontal disparity. First, when horizontal disparity is ramped-up, but vergence and vertical disparity are normal, the scene looks miniature. This is an astounding effect, given all other distance cues indicate a normal scene. Second, when vergence and vertical disparity are ramped-up, but horizontal disparity is normal, the scene looks normal, challenging the role that vergence and vertical disparity play in visual scale. Third, ramping-up horizontal disparity also changes the slope of the ground-plane. Fourth, keeping vergence and vertical disparity fixed whilst ramping-up horizontal disparity creates a startling illusion. We judge the scene as a whole to reduce in scale, even though all that changes in our visual experience is a distortion of 3D shape (of the scene and its objects). The illusion changes our concept of ‘visual scale’ from being something that we directly perceive (vision having a range-finder, like vergence or vertical disparity) to something we merely cognitively infer on the basis of an association between accentuated 3D shape and closer distances.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive impairments are a core feature of psychotic disorders, but their long-term trajectory remains contentious. Previous meta-analyses were focused on the first 5 years following psychosis onset. Here, we evaluated the change in cognitive impairments in psychotic disorders through a meta-analysis of studies with follow-ups of 5+ years. \nFollowing pre-registration (PROSPERO, CRD42023447589), databases were searched for relevant articles until July 2024. Two authors screened the reports for studies reporting on the change in cognitive impairments in global cognition, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, working memory, attention, speed of processing, reasoning and problem-solving, and verbal fluency in individuals with psychotic disorders and with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Three authors extracted data, and the PRISMA guidelines were followed. Random-effects model meta-analyses and moderator analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the results. \nTwenty-four studies comprising 2633 patients and 1019 controls were included in the study. Over an average of 8.46 years, cognitive impairments remained stable in patients in all 8 measures: global cognition (g = .09; 95% CI, .03-.20), verbal memory (g = .05; 95% CI, -.11, .21), visual memory (g =-.16; 95% CI, -.35, .04), working memory (g =.03; 95% CI, -.09, .14), attention (g =.22; 95% CI, -.36, .80), speed of processing (g =.10; 95% CI, -.14, .35), reasoning and problem-solving (g =.16; 95% CI, -.03, .35), and verbal fluency (g =.08; 95% CI, -.03, .20). \nWe conclude that cognitive impairments remain stable over time, consistent with the neurodevelopmental view of psychotic disorders.",

          "abstract": "Background. Greater Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU: the tendency to find uncertainty negative) is associated with greater paranoia (mistrust of others) in clinical samples with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs). Questions remain on whether the relationship between IU and paranoia / prodromal symptoms is: (1) specific over other related negative affective traits and cognitive biases, and (2) specific to SSDs or is transdiagnostic. \nMethod. To examine these research questions, we conducted a survey in those with SSDs (n = 103), anxiety disorders (n = 102) a non-clinical sample (n = 102). Questionnaires included: IU, paranoia, prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, neuroticism, and jumping to conclusions bias. \nResults. IU, neuroticism, and jumping to conclusion bias was elevated in those with SSDs and anxiety disorders, compared to the non-clinical group. Both paranoia and prodromal symptoms were highest in those with SSDs, then anxiety disorders, and lowest in the non-clinical group. Greater IU was associated with greater paranoia and prodromal symptoms across SSDs, anxiety disorders, and a non-clinical sample. The majority of the relationships between IU and paranoia /prodromal symptoms remained significant when controlling for neuroticism and the jumping to conclusions bias. However, the relationship between IU and paranoia in the SSD group was not specific over the jumping to conclusions bias. \nConclusions. These findings highlight the potentially transdiagnostic role of IU in paranoia / prodromal symptoms across SSDs and anxiety disorders, which has implications for the development of transdiagnostic treatment interventions for SSDs and anxiety disorders.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Our sleep-wake rhythm is determined by the interaction of our work-life balance, i.e. the ‘social clock’, and our biological clock. After retirement, the social restrictions generally loosen up, possibly giving more room for our genetic predispositions to regulate the sleep-wake rhythm. In this study, we investigated shifts in wake-up times and chronotypes during employment and retirement. We hypothesized that the variance of chronotype explained by genetics is larger in retirees compared to employees. \nMethod: We used data from 20.189 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register. First, we fitted a regression model to assess the association between chronotype and age. Second, we applied a mixed-effects model to test whether the type of day (working day or non-working day) is a predictor of wake-up time in early birds and late risers. Third, we separated the employed from the retirees and performed a regression to assess the prevalence of chronotypes in the two groups. Fourth, we tested whether the two groups differed in their wake-up times on working days and non-working days using quantile regression. Finally, we used polygenic scores for Morningness to predict the variance in Chronotype in the employed and retirees. \nResults: Chronotype was both linearly and quadratically related to age. Both early and late risers have later wake-up times on non-working days compared to working days. Employment status was not a predictor of chronotype, but rather of wake-up time on working days. The effect of the polygenic score for Morningness on Chronotype did not depend on employment status.  \nDiscussion: Our study showed that the social clock influences wake-up time on working days, but not chronotype, making chronotype a relatively stable trait. Additionally, the social clock does not suppress the genetic predisposition for chronotype. These analyses enhance our understanding of how both society and genetics influence our chronotype and sleep-wake rhythm.",

OLP-treatment significantly improved wellbeing (negative emotions and sleep quality), while feedback did not significantly enhance this effect.

This study aims to improve the prediction of future depressive symptoms in adolescents by using a multimodal approach that integrates relevant clinical, demographic, behavioral, and neural characteristics. 103 adolescents (ages 12-18; 72.8% female) underwent a baseline assessment including self-report questionnaires, ecological momentary assessment, a clinical interview, and behavioral and neural measures of reward responsiveness. We used nested cross-validation to compare machine learning approaches as well as conventional linear regression in predicting depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire [MFQ]) at a 3-month follow-up. For the prediction of CES-D depression scores, the best performing model was a multivariable linear regression using as predictors five principal component scores from a principal component analysis of baseline variables (RMSE = 5.951, R2 = 0.739). For the MFQ, the best performing model was a simple univariable linear regression with baseline MFQ scores as the sole predictor (RMSE=8.054, R2=0.671). A factors analysis revealed that items assessing melancholic features were most predictive of future depressive symptoms. More complex machine learning approaches did not outperform regression in predicting future depression. The integration of relevant multimodal predictors reveals which adolescent characteristics (e.g., melancholic features and physical anxiety) might have a larger contribution to predicting short-term future depression. Future studies are needed with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to provide a more comprehensive test of such models.",

This study examined associations between motivation to make lifestyle changes for dementia risk reduction and engagement in health behaviors associated with dementia risk in 347 middle-aged adults. Multivariate linear regressions examined associations between motivation and engagement in health behaviors. Greater self-efficacy and higher education significantly predicted greater physical and cognitive activity and better sleep quality. Greater perceived barriers and general health motivation, lower self-efficacy, and younger age significantly predicted greater perceived loneliness. Self-efficacy consistently predicted engagement in healthy behaviors associated with dementia risk reduction in midlife.

However, unlike the standard frequency range, there are a lack of recommendations from organizations such as the International Standards Organization (ISO) and World Health Organization (WHO) regarding normative data in the extended high frequencies limiting clinical implications of this data. In the present study, we report proposed normative data in the extended high frequency region in over 726 participants evaluated on typical clinical equipment using methodology from both the ISO and WHO. We hypothesize that extended high frequency will worsen with age and show excellent test-retest reliability.  \nDesign: Audiometric thresholds were collected from 726 adult participants at all measurable frequencies between .25 and 16 kHz. Data were analyzed using the equations reported by the 2017 ISO 7029 report and by calculating a 4-frequency extended high frequency pure tone average in alignment with the WHO. \nResults: Males had worse hearing than females when analyzed using a 4-frequency PTA, but there was no significant difference in the age-related rate of decline. Extended high frequency thresholds (N = 129) showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC &gt; 0.9, p &lt; 0.001). Extended high frequency 4-frequency PTAs in participants with normal hearing in the standard frequency range had a range of -11.25 to 92.5 dB.\nConclusions: Adaptation of norms in the extended high frequency range is feasible due to agreement among the literature and stability of test-retest measurements. Male extended high frequency thresholds are worse than women, but the rate at which hearing declines does not differ between sexes. Future research in this area should take into account normative data and functional hearing performance.",

          "authors": "Eduardo Ekman Schenberg",
          "abstract": "Between April and October 2024, expert bodies in two countries reached strikingly opposite conclusions about the therapeutic use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). On the one hand, the Food and Drug Administration in the USA rejected a formal New Drug Application from a specific drug sponsor, Lykos Therapeutics, for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The decision was surprising to many, given the FDA granting it “breakthrough therapy status” a few years before. Across the Atlantic, the Dutch State Commission on MDMA recommended the same treatment to be made available as soon as possible for PTSD and also investigated for other conditions. \nApart from important differences regarding the legal mandate of these two expert bodies, some important epistemic differences are notable in these two distinct approaches to assess the evidence. These cases serve as examples of the current challenges to develop and implement evidence-based psychedelic therapies given the limitations of the prevailing influential framework of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM), which seems to have particularly influenced the FDA’s decision. On the other hand, the Dutch approach more closely resembles the recent EBM+ approach. Drawing from historically tragic fatal examples, as well as recent advances in evidence assessment, such as masking and mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is argued that a shift to EBM+ is paramount to allow reliable assessments towards evidence-based implementation of psychedelics as therapeutic tools.",

          "authors": "Sergei V. Jargin",
          "abstract": "Psychopathological approach to politics is successful if it identifies politicians or ideologists with a limited mental competence. An attempt is made here to analyze mental conditions of Vladimir Putin and the influential ideologist Aleksandr Dugin. Dmitry Medvedev and Ramzan Kadyrov are briefly discussed as well. Physical maltreatment was described in Putin’s biographies. It was hypothesized that he is re-enacting traumas in conditions of intergenerational traumatic chain. Child abuse is associated with various psychiatric and related conditions including paranoia. A paranoid call may sanction destruction of supposed enemies. Putin formulated the aims of his military operation: to protect Russian-speakers from “genocide”, to disarm and denazify Ukraine. Apparently, this idea is delusional. Certain war instigators are paranoid in their tendency to present themselves as prophets or world saviors. Some of them are aggressive against delusional goals. Mentally healthy people can be susceptible to psychotic appeals, a predisposing condition being fear of strangers and projection of hatred upon them. Some individuals, maltreated during their childhood, respond by acting out fight or flight responses, attacking weaker persons and submitting to dominant ones. This seems to be reflected by Putin’s relationships with Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechen Republic, who appears as a dominant personality. Certain ethnically non-Russian subjects of the Federation may be interested in a continuation of the Ukraine war; and there are concerns that Putin has come under their influence. An important topic in this connection is the inter-ethnic difference in the birth rate and migrations, which is avoided by Russian media and officials these days. In conclusion, mental derangements in politicians are dangerous and must be diagnosed by psychiatrists on the basis of speech, writings, and behavior. More expert opinions are needed.",

Combining motor imagery (MI) with neurofeedback (NFB) offers a potential complementary non-pharmacological therapy. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-guided NFB protocol that integrates MI of whole-body movements with changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration (d[HbR]) to alleviate motor symptoms of PD.\n\nThree groups (N = 19 each) completed four training sessions. The NFB group, consisting of healthy older adults, and the PD-NFB group performed MI tasks with NFB based on supplementary motor area (SMA) activity, while the noNFB group of healthy older adults performed MI without NFB.\n\nParticipants in the NFB groups generally reported positive perceptions of NFB controllability. The NFB group showed a significant increase in SMA activation compared to the noNFB group and, in part, for baseline MI compared to NFB MI. No significant differences were found between the NFB and PD-NFB groups. There was no significant difference between NFB training and baseline MI in the PD group.\n\nThis study is the first to investigate fNIRS-guided NFB combining MI with d[HbR] to enhance SMA activation. The results suggest potential of the studied protocol for motor neurorehabilitation, but simultaneously highlight the need for further refinement and research.",

Given the implications of developmental EEG research within policy, clinical, and educational domains, it is important to ensure that reported results are generalizable and reproducible. In this review, to provide an initial assessment of previous and current practices regarding participant recruitment and demographic reporting, we carried out a systematic review of the six journals publishing the most pediatric EEG studies between 2011-2023. We identified 700 articles reporting on pediatric EEG (N &gt; 80,000). We find that most studies did not provide complete reporting of basic demographic information (e.g., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical location). This trend persisted across years of publication, suggesting continued underreporting. However, the reporting of demographic information differed between journals, suggesting solutions for improving reporting practices. Our review also indicated that samples consisted of mostly White participants (78%) from North America and Western Europe (85%). Moreover, the median total sample size was 51 participants. Our discussion emphasizes the need for larger, more diverse samples and greater transparency in developmental EEG studies, while providing recommendations to address barriers to representation and reproducibility.",

The current study uses a novel evolutionary approach to explore which features of a complex flower-like stimulus reliably emerge as appealing, easy to view, disgusting and threatening. Across three experiments the procedure used approximately 20 parameters that became more or less likely to appear within the stimuli as participants selected the most and least appealing, easy to view, disgusting or threatening flowers from a selection of six flowers per trial. Most important to appeal was a high number of outer petals (ray florets) and symmetrical arrangement of outer petals. This was also found to be important to ease of viewing, consistent with the fluency processing theory of aesthetic appeal. The presence of binarized fractals was found to be important to the perception threat and disgust. This was unexpected but potentially mimics patterning on animals such as a saturated red against a black body. The novel evolutionary method developed for establishing the features important to a perceptual judgment shows potential for use with complex and high feature space stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Currently, no clinically relevant physiological markers of post-COVID exist, which stymies treatment development and rehabilitation efforts. Therefore, a monocentric cross-sectional study was conducted to characterize the long-term mental and physical health consequences of infection with SARS-COV-2. 156 participants were recruited as part of the voluntary post-COVID consultation hours at the BG Hospital Hamburg, Germany, after the insured persons were invited by the relevant statutory accident insurance providers. Overall, 34% of participants were unable to work. Based on German census data, poststratification was used to provide a profile of mental health and physical symptoms recorded in the long-COVID consultations. Although many characteristics were within the normal range, BMI values, limitations in physical role functioning, vitality issues, somatization, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism were borderline or slightly elevated. Furthermore, long-COVID patients with high BMI values, high medication counts, multiple ICD diagnoses, and secondary diagnoses tended to report poorer physical and mental health conditions. We also used a multivariate network approach to provide a comprehensive perspective of relationships between physical and mental health symptoms and identify the most influential symptoms to develop potential intervention routes. Notably, the number of months since the COVID-19 diagnosis was one of the most central elements of the multivariate network. Although people with a less recent COVID diagnosis tended to have more secondary diagnoses, they tended to report fewer sleep-related problems, less stress sensitivity, better physical functioning, and better overall quality of life, indicating that some symptoms may decrease with time. In addition to the number of months since the COVID diagnosis, other central elements of the multivariate network included physical functioning, social role functioning, phobic anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, and decreased sleep, highlighting potential intervention routes. Overall, our results might be used to design future diagnostic, preventive, and rehabilitation long-COVID measures.",

          "abstract": "We are currently seeing a dramatic decline in the mental health of children and young people. To successfully reverse this trend, we greater emphasis on promoting the wellbeing of children and young people. Low mental wellbeing is a significant predictor of future mental ill-health and it is also a distressing and disabling state that requires intervention in its own right. For these reasons we need large scale screening for low mental wellbeing, using validated measures. Encouraging young people to access interventions to boost their mental wellbeing may in fact be easier than encouraging children and young people to access interventions to treat subthreshold mental ill-health. Then we need to link young people into evidence-based interventions that promote mental wellbeing through their school, university, local community or online. This is how we can achieve an effective, low-stigma, approach to targeted prevention (i.e., selective or indicated). At a systems level, we also need to adopt a dual systems approach to mental health that aligns with the dual continua model of mental health. This requires building and then integrating a new mental health promotion system that complements our existing mental healthcare system. The dire state of youth mental health in Australia and globally is an urgent call-to-action for everyone in government, health, community, and family settings to do more to protect those in their care. Making full use of the available evidence and the tools at-hand is a logical first step.",

Participants selected four activities they wished to engage in and rated expected outcomes and anticipated emotions relating to activity completion before and after mental elaboration of each activity using either motivational mental imagery or verbal reasoning. Over the following week, utilising ecological momentary assessment (EMA), participants recorded the frequency with which they engaged in their chosen activities.

          "abstract": "Adults can reflectively revise their beliefs and selectively respond to unreliable informants, despite often forming and revising beliefs unreflectively without assessing their reasons. This study investigates how the strength of counterevidence coming from an informant affects adults’ ability to infer that the informant is unreliable through acquiring and responding to undermining defeaters (i.e., evidence suggesting that something was wrong with how the belief was formed). Participants (N = 120) watched videos of two informants acting on two locations: one whose actions reliably indicated the reward location, and one whose actions did not. The strength of feedback participants received after making a choice was manipulated across two conditions. In the Strong feedback condition, participants received positive feedback when they found the reward and explicit negative feedback when they did not, along with information about the reward's true location. In the Weak feedback condition, they received positive feedback, but incorrect choices simply resulted in no reward appearing. Participants responded selectively to unreliability, following the Unreliable informant’s evidence less often than that of the Reliable informant. This effect was observed after only two to three misleading trials, but only in the Strong feedback condition. In subsequent trials where informants were pitted against each other, participants in the Strong feedback condition, but not in the Weak feedback condition, consistently preferred the Reliable informant. These findings suggest that adults’ ability to infer informants’ reliability depends on the strength of counterevidence. Additionally, exploratory analyses reveal a key distinction between acquiring and responding to undermining defeaters.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by economic theory, neuroeconomics contends that value serves as a common currency for decision. This valuational view has amassed impressive support over the last two decades, but critics have recently raised serious concerns. They argue that there are important pathways to action that bypass value, highly dissimilar psychological systems do not share a common value currency, and the view cannot accommodate well documented kinds of “irrationality”, such as context effects. This essay offers a systematic response. Key refinements are made to the valuational view allowing for multiple formats for value information and two levels of valuation (options-level and systems-level). These refinements help address the criticisms and yield a more nuanced understanding of the role of value in human decision-making.",

Using graph theoretical approaches within a network neuroscience framework, we examined how the developmental timing of displacement (age of displacement, duration of displacement) related to functional integration, segregation, and small-worldness. Syrian refugee children (n=59, MAge=14 Range = 8-18), completed a resting state scan using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging. Data were analyzed to assess the link between neural network properties and developmental timing of adversity. Results indicate that prolonged displacement experienced earlier in life was significantly linked with neural network organization, impacting the balance between the brain's functional integration and segregation as quantified by the overall reduced small worldness in comparison to experiencing displacement at an older age. This study leverages the experiences of refugee children to advance our understanding of how the timing of adversity affects development, providing valuable insights into the broader impacts of early adversity on neurodevelopment.",

One indicator of emotional health is loneliness, which refers to a distressing experience that one’s social relationships are less in quality and quantity than those desired. This preregistered review aimed to examine the association between adverse childhood experiences (e.g., physical abuse/neglect, emotional abuse/neglect, sexual abuse, parental separation/divorce, family conflict, domestic violence) and loneliness in adulthood. A database search (Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, APA PsychINFO, Medline, Pubmed, Scopus) was conducted. After removal of duplicates, 3,689 papers were reviewed and 20 met inclusion criteria. When feasible, results were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis and inverse variance modelling and reported narratively. Meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant association between cumulative adverse childhood experiences and loneliness (r = 0.30, 95% CI [0.22-0.37]; prediction interval = 0.04-0.52) and between specific adversity types and loneliness, namely sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect. Some heterogeneity was observed across studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses revealed no differences in age, gender, age group, continent, or measures of adversity/loneliness. This research indicates that adversities in childhood may have some long-term influences on loneliness, both cumulatively and within adversity subtypes.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has garnered significant attention for their potential to augment and possibly even replace current forms of psychological assessment or treatment. However, current AI technologies have yet to demonstrate the capacity to effect lasting psychological change. This paper outlines five key criteria for developing effective AI clinical psychology interventions, grounded in clinical science principles and emerging evidence from the AI mental health field: 1) attending to mechanisms of patient change, 2) conducting meaningful evaluation, 3) attending to time and dose, 4) modeling key characteristics of therapists and patients; and 5) attending to engagement and sustainability. Despite their potential, LLMs face notable technical and therapeutic limitations, including memory constraints, failure to guide users through a coherent set of interventions, the tendency to engage in advice-giving over inquiry, and a proclivity to demonstrate rather than teach skills. We provide key technical considerations relevant to each criterion, including using multi-agentic models, using multi-step language programming, and finding more suitable objectives for reinforcement learning. Lastly, we discuss open questions in the field of clinical psychology AI, including whether humans will interact with AI the same way they interact with other humans, how scalability can be balanced with human monitoring, given safety concerns, and how large language models might radically disrupt how psychological interventions are delivered. Only by combining insights from clinical science with a clear understanding of the technical affordances and limitations of large language models will it be possible for AI to make a meaningful impact on human psychological suffering.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive optimization remains an open challenge in understanding how individuals can align their goals, routines, and values with their potential for growth and adaptation. The ESTIMAT framework introduces a theoretical model inspired by Fermi estimation to analyze and enhance human decision-making and self-regulation. Grounded in the principles of hierarchical decomposition, information theory, and behavioral adaptation, ESTIMAT aims to bridge abstract concepts of motivation, identity, and cognitive states with measurable, actionable metrics.\n\nThe central premise of ESTIMAT is to quantify \"Moments of Peak Motivation\" (MPMs)—states of heightened engagement and alignment—using a States Metric (SM). This metric, rooted in information entropy, evaluates the adaptive potential of individuals across physical, emotional, social, and intellectual dimensions. By breaking complex cognitive states into manageable components, ESTIMAT offers a structured method for designing tasks, routines, and long-term goals that maximize both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.\n\nThis paper outlines the conceptual foundations of ESTIMAT, presents its parallels with Fermi estimation, and discusses potential applications in self-improvement, behavioral sciences, and cognitive engineering. While empirical validation is forthcoming, the framework provides a robust starting point for interdisciplinary exploration and practical application.",

          "abstract": "Most prior literature tends to examine potentially traumatic event (PTE) exposure as a cumulative risk, whereby all PTEs are assumed to have equal impact on substance use (SU) or be equally impacted by SU. However, this dubious assumption could be obscuring important differences in the PTE-SU relationship. We operationalize McLaughlin &amp; Sheridan’s (2016) dimensional model of trauma exposure to examine the impact of PTEs types on SU and SU on PTE types concurrently and prospectively. We leverage data from 11,800 community youth (ages 9-15 years old) enrolled in the nationwide, longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We analyze concurrent and prospective (one year later) associations between PTE types (physical abuse, domestic violence, community violence, emotional neglect, poverty, and institutionalization/deprivation) and substance use (pooling alcohol, cannabis, or nicotine) whereby exposure to different PTE types predicts SU (self-medication), and SU predicts different PTE types (susceptibility). Concurrently, we find emotional neglect was significantly positively related to SU. Prospectively, institutionalization/deprivation, emotional neglect, and physical abuse significantly positively predicted SU and were predicted by SU. A majority of associations between PTE types and SU were accounted for by other PTE types and time-varying covariates (e.g., age, internalizing/externalizing symptoms). Emotional neglect is more likely to lead to SU and be predicted by SU than other PTE types. Findings suggest that surveillance for SU is especially warranted in youth with emotional neglect, relative to other PTEs. Future research should examine more types of PTEs along a wider age span to replicate findings.",

In addition, we discuss how calls for increased implementation of open science practices in psychological research can be reconciled with some of the challenges, concerns, and conflicts that can arise around open science practices, especially in clinical psychology. Finally, we extend open science's inclusive and collaborative stance to include \"experts by experience\" in the research process.

          "abstract": "Child maltreatment (CM) represents a key risk factor for a wide range of maladaptive developmental outcomes. In particular, child abuse and neglect are thought to exert detrimental effects on neurocognitive development, including impairments in executive functions (EF) during childhood. We conducted a preregistered multilevel meta-analysis to examine differential associations between CM dimensions and core EF domains: working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. Based on 59 studies with 13,022 participants, our results indicate a medium-sized association (g = 0.43) between overall CM and EF, although high levels of heterogeneity were observed both within and between studies. While differential outcomes as a function of EF domains may partly explain this heterogeneity, maltreatment dimensions (i.e., abuse vs. neglect) did not account for it. These findings suggest a non-specific association between CM dimensions and EF domains, potentially driven by shared attachment-related characteristics of CM.",

          "abstract": "In the Olympic sport of speed climbing, athletes compete to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. Since the standardization of the speed climbing route in 2007, improvement has been driven by a process of cumulative cultural evolution—new route sequences innovated by some are copied and improved upon by others. In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competitive speed climbing times (2007-2019). By analyzing the dynamics of the fitted model, we are able to gain some insight into the processes that may be driving cumulative improvement in speed climbing. Innovation and copying are used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a slight advantage. Slower agents in the model are more likely to innovate, likely in pursuit of strategies that give them a competitive advantage. Population size negatively predicts innovation, presumably because innovation is not as useful when there are plenty of existing solutions to choose from. Finally, the model suggests that climbers may not be using innovation and copying optimally—continued improvement may require more emphasis on innovation and less reliance on copying.",

These so-called climate emotions are an important driver behind pro-environmental behavior. However, they have also been associated with impaired mental health. In the light of the huge challenges we face, understanding the complex mechanisms behind emotions, behavior and mental health is crucial. The Inventory of Climate Emotions (ICE) presents the first validated scale to assess a multitude of different emotional responses (anger, contempt, enthusiasm, powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety and sorrow) to the climate crisis. This pre-registered study aimed to translate and validate the ICE in a representative German sample (N = 966). We replicated the 8-factor structure and all subscales showed acceptable to good internal consistency. Furthermore, we replicate a positive association between multiple climate emotions (powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety, sorrow) with general depressive and anxiety symptoms. We also show that climate emotions are generally positively associated with pro-environmental behavior, the only exception being climate contempt, which was negatively associated with pro-environmental behavior. In conclusion, we present a validated German translation of the ICE and provide evidence for a negative association of climate emotions and mental health as well as a positive association of climate emotions and pro-environmental behavior.",

Unravelling the mechanisms of plasticity in humans is a central goal for neuroscience. This chapter provides an overview of common methods used to study structural and functional brain plasticity in humans. The main structural methods we discuss are T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which is widely used to track anatomical changes in the brain, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which allows investigation of neurochemical processes, such as receptor density changes. The section on functional plasticity evolves around (T2*-weighted) functional MRI (fMRI) and attempts to provide an overview of analysis methods and MRI sequences that can be used to study functional changes in the brain, including resting state analysis, univariate and multivariate analyses. We further provide a short summary of non-invasive brain stimulation methods that, combined with other structural or functional methods, have proven to be useful tools for inducing and measuring plasticity. We also address limitations of these methods, in particular for tracking fast or microscopic changes and discuss the importance of a good study design that ensures measurements match the research question. This emphasises the benefits of combining non-invasive brain imaging with longitudinal designs to reveal the nature of plasticity in humans.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the longitudinal linking of dichotomous item responses at three time points, focusing on the performance of Haberman linking, Haebara linking, Stocking-Lord linking, and concurrent calibration in the presence of item parameter drift (IPD). Two general linking approaches, joint and chain linking, are examined. Three simulation studies were conducted to compare these methods under different conditions of IPD and linking designs. The first simulation study compared linking methods under conditions of sampling error and uniform IPD, with results indicating that the Haberman joint linking method performed best regarding bias and root mean square error (RMSE), especially at larger sample sizes, while the concurrent calibration method was most accurate when no IPD was present. The second simulation study expanded the analysis by introducing two additional linking designs: one relying solely on anchor items across all three time points, and the other using only adjacent items between consecutive time points. Both designs were examined under the same conditions as the first study, revealing that under no IPD conditions, the concurrent calibration method remained the most precise across both designs, while under uniform IPD conditions, the Haberman linking methods outperformed other methods, offering the best balance of bias and precision. The third study examined nonuniform IPD, where the Haberman chain linking method delivered the best overall performance in terms of both bias and RMSE. Overall, chain linking methods generally outperformed joint linking when IPD was present. Implications for the analysis of longitudinal linking designs are discussed.",

This study uses unique longitudinal data from TRAILS (analytic sample n = 2201), a prospective multiple-generation cohort study in the Netherlands to examine whether parents’ problem behavior (parents’ self-reported lifetime antisocial behavior and substance use, reported at mean age 40 years) predicts offspring problem behavior nearly two decades later (offspring self-reported aggression and delinquency at mean ages 29 and 32 years). In path analyses, independent and relative contributions of genetic (polygenic scores of parents and offspring) and environmental (harsh parenting) pathways were tested. Results confirm intergenerational transmission and consistently point to genetic nurture whereby genetic predisposition predicts parental problem behavior, which in turn predicts harsh parenting, which in turn predicts offspring problem behavior, all while accounting for offspring genetic predisposition, sex and family socioeconomic position. Though these findings are surprising in light of genetic contributions to behavior, they allow for tentative considerations regarding implication for practice to break intergenerational chains of problem behavior.",

The SET questionnaires, designed to assess nine dimensions of teaching quality, were analyzed for their effectiveness to capture differential teaching perceptions. The analysis incorporated socio-cognitive factors, based on the Central Model of Student Perception (CSP model), which studies how the perception and facilitative effect of teaching influences student response. Results indicate that students can distinguish between specific dimensions of teaching, which supports the validity of the questionnaire, although challenges related to possible perceptual biases and item interpretation persist.

Various strategies have been proposed to tackle this issue, but these usually restrict the algorithms' ability to adapt to varying task conditions and evolve in open-ended environments. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose leveraging a well-known cognitive bias to develop scale-invariant RL algorithms: reward range normalization. We compare a classical RL algorithm to one leveraging reward range-adaptation, finding that while the standard model’s accuracy is limited to certain reward magnitudes, the range-adapted model maintains consistent performance across all magnitudes. We next show that range-adaptation acts as autonomously adjusting the exploration rate, keeping it close to optimal for any given reward scale. Further, we show that the range-adapted model extends effectively to more complex, noisy, dynamic, and multi-step tasks.",

However, the evidence to support this has not been fully synthesised to date. This meta-analytic review aimed to investigate whether family interventions are effective in reducing psychosis symptoms and improving general functioning among children and adolescents with psychosis.\nMethods: Multiple databases were searched per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, supplemented by grey literature searches. Studies employing controlled designs to compare family interventions with other interventions or standard care were included. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tools. Bayesian meta-analyses were conducted to examine changes in psychosis symptoms and functioning. \nResults: Four studies (n = 111) met inclusion criteria. All studies assessed the effectiveness of different psychoeducation-based family interventions with varying duration and intensity. The quality of the studies ranged from a moderate to a critical risk of bias. The meta-analyses showed no significant effect of family interventions on psychosis symptoms or functioning and indicated anecdotal evidence in favour of the null hypotheses. \nDiscussion: We did not find evidence of a significant benefit of family interventions on psychosis symptoms or functioning in children and adolescents with psychosis. All included studies had significant methodological issues, which may have introduced bias. These results highlight a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of family interventions in children and adolescents with psychosis, and a need for high-quality research into psychosocial treatments for early-onset psychosis.",

          "abstract": "Head motion is one of the most common sources of artefacts for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain. Especially children, being intimidated by the dimensions and the noise of the scanner, tend to move considerably during image acquisition. Thus, the use of general anaesthesia or sedation is common practice in clinical routines to avoid motion artefacts. However, general anaesthesia requires additional equipment and personnel and concerns about potential drug-related risks are increasing.\nWith this thesis, I aim to compare different methods for motion correction of MRI as alternative strategies for avoiding motion artefacts during clinical MRI examinations. I evaluate the performance of prospective and retrospective motion correction on a set of six 2D- and 3D-encoded sequences from a clinical pediatric MR protocol. For each sequence, we acquired scans with and without a predefined motion pattern in 22 healthy volunteers. I analyse and statistically compare a set of image quality\nmeasures as well as observer quality scores. Furthermore, I quantify the influence of motion correction on motion-related changes in cortical thickness estimates using a general linear model.\nIn this work, I show that for the 3D-encoded sequences, image quality considerably increases from scans without motion correction, over retrospectively to prospectively corrected scans. Selectively reacquiring slices with the highest level of motion additionally improved image quality. Furthermore, cortical thickness estimates from motion corrected scans do not correlate with motion to the same extent as observed for uncorrected scans. For three of the 2D-encoded sequences I observe higher image quality due motion correction and reacquisition compared to the clinical standard, even though the effect size varies between the different sequences. I did not observe an improvement due to motion correction in the T2* sequence, which is known to be highly sensitive to field inhomogeneities.  owever, this sequence can be substituted by an accelerated, easily repeatable sequence. My findings confirm that the use of prospective motion correction is feasible for a full clinical children's protocol, reducing motion artefacts and ensuring diagnostic image quality. As a next step in establishing motion correction in clinical routines, the developed and validated set up will be tested on a clinical pediatric population.",

Participants read “choose-your-own-adventure” stories with full, partial, or no control over future events. In all conditions,  events which were causally or semantically central to the story were better recalled. However, even when all participants read the exact same events, those with full control recalled more idiosyncratic combinations of events. Moreover, their memories were less well predicted by generic sentence embeddings, suggesting a shift away from normative semantic space. Agency also increased the likelihood of jointly remembering or forgetting consecutive events. These results reveal that agency fundamentally reshapes memory organization, increasing the influence of idiosyncratic personal factors and strengthening local temporal integration.",

          "abstract": "This research note examines the potential of ChatGPT’s large language model for qualitative symbolic interactionist analysis of social media datasets. Using a small sample of 15 posts on mental health issues from the social media platform Reddit, we explore how large language models interpret, organize, and communicate information based on researchers’ prompts. Prompting itself is a process in which researchers provide both a definition of the situation and of relevant identities for a GPT to assume, which directly shape its interpretive capacity and output. We compare ChatGPT-4o, the latest personal subscription version available at the time of writing, and Microsoft AutoGen, a more powerful API version capable of organizing multiple GPT agents to complete research tasks semi-autonomously. We describe and evaluate the structure and content of each model’s output, including how they engage with data thematically, empirically, and conceptually. We also highlight differences in depth and coherence of their analyses. We show how changes to prompts influenced the GPTs’ interpretative actions, yielding both expected and novel analytical insights. Our preliminary findings suggest that GPTs hold promise for advancing qualitative analysis of big data, albeit with some limitations in analytic depth and occasional hallucination errors. The study contributes to nascent symbolic interactionist scholarship on nonhuman agents in qualitative research, positioning GPTs as semi-autonomous research collaborators.",

          "authors": "Florian Keusch; Bella Struminskaya; Joris Mulder; Stein Jongerius",
          "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of many health outcomes, especially for aging populations. The accurate measurement of PA is key to identifying determinants of health and developing appropriate interventions. To measure PA, many studies use self-reports which are usually limited to global measures and can suffer from measurement error. More fine-grained day-reconstruction methods are burdensome for respondents and prone to recall error. As an alternative, researchers are providing study participants with wearable devices that passively track PA, which reduces reactivity and recall error. However, participants’ non-compliance and high device costs are problematic. Many older adults now have smartphones that track physical activity, and individuals can share these passively collected physical activity data with researchers. We test a data donation approach among older adults. Based on legal requirements (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation), data controllers (i.e., social media platforms, health apps, etc.) must provide users access to all their data in a machine-readable format. We study (1) how willing and successful older adults are to donate their PA data from different smartphone apps; (2) what drives donation of PA data at the different stages of participation; and (3) what biases arises from selective data donation? We use a privacy-preserving data donation tool integrated in a probability-based online panel of the Dutch general population to collect PA data from various health apps. 2,086 members of the LISS panel aged 50 years and older completed a web survey in early 2024. All iPhone and Android smartphone owners were asked to download passively collected PA data from their devices (Apple Health, Google Location History, or Samsung Health) and donate them via the Port platform. Out of the 2,086 survey participants, 1,889 (91%) reported owning an iPhone or Android phone compatible for data donation, 606 (29%) reported being willing to donation their PA data, 354 (17%) started the data donation, and 256 (12%) successfully provided a data package. Gender, age, educational attainment, income, and smartphone ownership and usage behavior, privacy related attitudes, and type of health app from which the data were requested correlated with behavior at the different stages of study participation. Compared to the entire sample, older adults who successfully data donors reported higher levels of self-rated health, fewer health-related limitations, fewer difficulties performing everyday activities, and more physical activity. Our study shows that data donation from smartphones as part of a probability-based web survey of older adults is a feasible alternative for the measurement of PA. Nonparticipation correlates strongly with characteristics related to smartphone ownership and comfort with device use. However, substantive bias in health and PA outcomes persist for those who donated in comparison to all survey respondents.",

The findings reveal that regional variations in marketization levels lead to heterogeneity in the ownership composition of the primary labor market, resulting in different labor market segmentation structures. In southeastern coastal and metropolitan regions, the abundance of high-quality private-sector job opportunities makes the traditional “public-private” dichotomy insufficient for accurately describing the two-tiered labor market, thus challenging prevailing academic assumptions.\nDue to variations in local marketization levels, university graduates across regions exhibit divergent preferences for public and private sector employment. Moreover, limited job availability creates a complex sectoral choice pattern. Specifically, in inland provinces and smaller cities, individuals with higher human capital are more likely to enter the public sector, while no significant correlation is found in southeastern coastal and metropolitan regions.",

The current study builds on earlier theoretic work on quality education for sustainability teaching (QUEST), aiming to 1) initiate the development of an assessment instrument for monitoring the quality of sustainability teaching based on the perspective of those who the education aims to empower, i.e., the students and 2) contribute to further theory development. To this end, the QUEST-framework was developed into a set of five scales that tap into students’ perspective on the content (or what, i.e., relevant holistic knowledge and sustainability competencies), educational approach (or how, i.e., a pluralistic and action-oriented teaching approach), partners and locations (where and with whom) of teaching and learning. The five scales together build a questionnaire instrument to monitor quality education for sustainability teaching (QUEST-Q). Think aloud protocols and interviews with students and teachers support the cognitive and content validity of the scales. Reliability and construct validity were verified, with all scales showing acceptable model fit. Results are discussed in light of advancing theory and providing avenues for future research. We offer practitioners, policy makers, and researchers the QUEST-Q to monitor students’ experiences of quality education to support a sustainable future.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, venture capital (VC) has played a critical role in shaping the educational technology (edtech) market. This study employs social network analysis (SNA) to examine investment data, offering a novel perspective on the relational structure and dynamics of edtech investment. We construct bipartite networks of investors and edtech companies before and after the introduction of the Chromebook to the US market and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate differences in the structure of these bipartite networks using exponential random graph models, distributions of network statistics, and comparisons between the collapsed single-mode actor and event networks. Using these tools, we make estimates of influence and structural features that predict the probability of edge formation, highlighting patterns that contribute to the understanding of the structural dynamics of the edtech market, the key players driving its evolution, and the way each respond to exogenous shocks in the educational space.",

          "authors": "Keera Allendorf; Susan Short; Nancy Luke; Hongwei Xu",
          "abstract": "Modernization theory posed gender ideology as a unidimensional continuum ranging from “traditional” to egalitarian with egalitarianism increasing as societies progress. Recent research replaces a unidimensional view with multidimensionality, but other modernization remnants remain. We tackle such remnants by examining gender ideologies and their socioeconomic correlates in Tamil Nadu, an Indian context often labeled “traditional.” Using latent class analysis of 10 gender attitudes from the South Indian Community Health Study (SICHS), we identify six gender ideologies. Two ideologies are consistently egalitarian or essentialist, two are mixed, and two are characterized by ambivalent agreement. Attitudes toward mobility are a crucial divider; moderate support for equal mobility distinguishes “consistent egalitarians” from “seclusionist egalitarians” and “agreeable seclusionists” from the “highly agreeable.” These agreeable ideologies likely reflect acquiescence bias, but may also signal polite resistance to feminist scripts. The gender ideologies are correlated with gender, religion, and education, but have little to no association with caste, age, and class. These findings extend the multidimensionality of gender ideology to an Indian context and hint at the power of global and local cultural scripts. More broadly, they demonstrate the value – and challenges – of building a more global understanding of gender ideology freer of modernization remnants.",

          "abstract": "Research on national identity in Western Europe and the United States has found that people in these countries de-emphasize the ethnic components of national membership, such as having ancestry in the country, and favor civic components such as political participation. However, sociologists whose research center immigrants' experiences in these countries find that they are never fully perceived as \"national\" because of their ancestry. Using a pre-registered, nationally representative, novel conjoint experiment fielded in 5 different countries, I find that natives' understanding of who belongs in the nation might be understood as \"colorblind ethnocentrism\": while people espouse civic normative understandings of the nation, they draw symbolic boundaries of national belonging based on ancestry. Moreover, when respondents do express a normative preference for ancestry in survey measures, it translates to a revealed preference for white and Christian members of the nation. Finally, in Europe (outside the UK), people imagine the nation as White, while this is not the case in the US and the UK overall. These findings help us understand why nativist discourse can easily take hold in liberal democracies, despite people's explicit disavowal of such discourse.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the evolution of French film policy from early cinema to the present, examining the complex interactions between state intervention, cultural production, and artistic creativity. Through a comprehensive historical analysis, the study traces the development of a unique French model of cinema support, characterized by robust state involvement, selective funding mechanisms, and a commitment to cultural diversity. The research demonstrates how the French state has progressively transformed its approach to cinema, from initial regulatory and taxation strategies to sophisticated support systems like the ‘Avance sur Recettes’ (Advance on Receipts). Key turning points include the Blum-Byrnes agreements of 1948, Jack Lang's cultural policies in the 1980s, and the ongoing challenges posed by digital technologies and global streaming platforms in the 2000s. The analysis reveals the tension between commercial imperatives and artistic quality, highlighting how state interventions have sought to preserve a distinctive French cinematic identity. By examining policy documents, parliamentary reports, and critical debates, the paper illuminates the complex negotiations between economic sustainability, cultural expression, and national prestige in French film policy. Ultimately, regarding the recent France 2030 Plan, the study argues that French cinema policy represents a unique model of cultural intervention, balancing economic pragmatism with a profound commitment to artistic innovation and cultural sovereignty.",

In a large (N = 1,000) and demographically representative survey of young people in the US aged 14-22, we report the results of a pre-registered survey experiment that assesses the effects of evidence-based messaging on perceived and objective emotional support competencies. Our “creator-engaged” approach partnered with a TikTok influencer to create realistic control (pre-evidence-based content training) and treatment (post-training) videos that hold many design elements constant. We find that treatment exposure significantly increases both perceived and objective abilities to provide emotional support. Our results suggest that creator partnership programs can promote positive mental health outcomes on platforms like TikTok.",

          "authors": "Emil Kamalov; Ivetta Sergeeva",
          "abstract": "Autocrats often use legal repression to criminalize opposition organizations, targeting both domestic and exile groups to suppress dissent. While such measures may weaken cooperation with these organizations domestically, these organizations can simultaneously gain increased support from migrant communities. This study explores whether autocrats achieve their intended outcomes by legally repressing exile organizations through criminalization. Utilizing a conjoint experiment with 5,996 Russian emigrants residing in 89 countries who left their homeland following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, we investigate how attributes such as criminalization, anonymity of donations, and transparency influence their cooperation with exile organizations in a geopolitically shaped environment.\n\n\n\nOur findings show that criminalization can backfire: Russian exiles perceive it as a marker of political authenticity and effectiveness, providing crucial cues in an environment with limited information and fostering solidarity. Consequently, criminalization can facilitate collective action and the coordination of extraterritorial opposition, signaling which organizations are genuinely committed to opposing the regime. However, geopolitical alliances matter, as cooperation is hindered where perceived risks are high, particularly in host countries allied with the autocrat. Technological solutions, such as anonymous donations, significantly mitigate these risks and boost support, while transparency is key to engaging the most politically active donors. This study contributes to understanding the limits of autocratic transnational control and demonstrates how exile organizations can leverage low-cost measures to foster diaspora’s resilience and address problems of collective action and coordination.",

          "abstract": "AI-based technologies are having an increasing impact on society, which naturally raises the question of how this technology will be addressed politically. Thereby, political actors have a dual role to play: They can provide investment to enhance the efficiency and usage of these systems in different societal areas while also bearing the responsibility of safeguarding citizens from potential harm. Hereby, the degree of politicization of the topic, i.e. if a topic is part of the public and political debate, has an immense influence on the political approach to tackle the issue. The more a topic is politicized, the more urgency political parties experience to develop concrete governance approaches. Yet, existing research has not analysed party programs in terms of both discourse around artificial intelligence and policy recommendations within an election context. This study focuses on the Netherlands and considers and provides an empirical analysis to answer the following question: How do parties discuss AI in their political programs for the 2023 election in the Netherlands? We conducted a manual content analysis of all party manifestos for the 2023 elections in the Netherlands. Our analysis shows that most parties are not laying a big emphasis on AI. And if so, most of the policy proposals are rather reactive to issues that happened in the past rather than taking a prospective governance approach. We critically discuss the low level of politicisation of AI with a focus on practical governance issues that emerge as a result.",

          "abstract": "This systematic literature review addresses the intersection of two rapidly evolving areas of knowledge and practice: Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). There is growing scholarly recognition of the rich and diverse nature of IKS, which are unique intergenerational understandings of worldly relations from an Indigenous standpoint. There is now a vast literature on the promise and pitfalls of AI. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews showing how these two dynamic literatures are intersecting, and what the major themes are. AI has the potential to assist the promotion of IKS; however, there are also potential risks arising from AI for Indigenous peoples, such as the erosion of cultural knowledge, and data-grabbing that fails to respect principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These risks can exacerbate existing knowledge hierarchies and socio-economic inequalities. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review of articles published between 2012 and 2023 (January) on Indigenous peoples and AI. We shed light upon four unique overlapping categories into which existing literature can be classified and comprehensively discuss literature under each category. The first two categories discuss AI’s role in assisting the promotion of IKS and the third focuses on the pitfalls of using AI for Indigenous peoples. The final category discusses how IKS itself can enrich the development of AI. We further identify several gaps in the literature and highlight avenues requiring attention on AI’s role with Indigenous peoples and their knowledge systems.",

Guided by the question of how EC research has developed over time, this analysis particularly focuses on three distinct time periods—1967-2000, 2001-2015, and 2016-2021—to accurately trace the progression and shifts in the field.  A comprehensive bibliometric analysis, utilizing Python scripting for keyword co-occurrence network diagrams was used to ensure a rigorous examination of the literature. The study's findings highlight the crucial roles of sustainable development, public education, and engagement in EC research, emphasizing the need for an interdisciplinary approach that recognizes the intricate interplay between environmental, social, technological, and political factors.

Using geo-referenced administrative data from Germany and a conditional instrumental variable approach that exploits distances between place of residence and large firms, we find negative income consequences for dropping out of vocational training but show that the penalty is entirely concentrated among individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. We further show that these stratified scars partially reflect unequal vocational re-enrolment rates and unequal employment outcomes among dropouts who do not re-enroll. Our results indicate a great potential of policies targeting higher graduation rates to reduce social inequality in labor markets. Furthermore, our study suggests that social origins are important moderators of linkage strength between school and work even in institutional settings with strong links between credentials and the labor market.",

Contrary to widespread expectations of a mass exodus of Japanese firms from the UK post-Brexit, the study reveals no statistically significant impact of Brexit on either Japanese affiliate exit or divestment. This finding challenges a prevailing narrative surrounding Brexit's detrimental effects on foreign investment in the UK. The observed resilience of Japanese affiliates is likely attributable to FDI hysteresis effects, arising from the substantial fixed and sunk costs inherent in FDI. These costs create a strong incentive for firms to maintain existing operations even in the face of political and economic uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Over the past half-century, higher education expansion and changing gender imbalances in \neducation have reshaped the educational composition of the partner market. Nonetheless, the \nimpact of these concurrent trends on educational sorting in unions and marriages remains \nunclear. Using data from France (1962–2011) and US (1960–2015), we examine how (a) \neducational expansion and (b) the changing gender-education association contributed to \nchanging sorting outcomes in marital and non-marital different-sex unions. Counterfactual \ndecomposition techniques revealed two main trends. First, the changing gender-education \nassociation – apart from educational upgrading – has promoted rising hypogamy (she is more \neducated than he) and declining hypergamy (he is more educated than she). Second, \neducational expansion is associated with rising proportions of homogamous, hypogamous, and \nhypergamous unions involving more educated individuals and declines in these union types \nwith less educated women and men. However, the impact of these changes on overall \nhomogamy and heterogamy trends differs across countries. For example, while the increasing \nsupply of highly educated individuals has promoted hypogamy in France it has offset \nhypogamy in the United States. Our findings contribute to ongoing debates about the structural \neffects of educational expansion and the reversing gender imbalance in education on the \nformation of different-sex unions.",

          "abstract": "We examine the enforcement of two pillars of colonial rule in French West Africa, military conscription and head tax collection, using novel district-level data from 1919 to 1949. Colonial states are often characterized as either omnipotent Leviathans or administration on the cheap. Our findings reveal their notable coerciveness in achieving key objectives. Military recruitment targets were consistently met, even amid individual avoidance and poor health conditions, by drawing on a pool of eligible fit young men. Tax compliance was similarly high, with approximately 80% of the liable population meeting obligations. Spikes in head tax rates significantly increased tax-related protests, likely prompting caution among colonial administrators. The tax burden was adjusted according to perceived district affluence, and tax moderation was applied in times of crisis. However, local shocks such as droughts or cash crop price collapses were largely ignored. These results underscore the capacity of colonial states to enforce their authority despite limited policy responsiveness, offering new insights into the political economy of colonial governance.

          "abstract": "Rising economic inequality across rich countries has raised questions about whether family background increasingly determines children’s economic success. However, prior research has not addressed whether family background is of differential importance for children who end up in the top, middle, or bottom of the earnings spectrum and whether this has changed across birth cohorts. Using administrative data from Norway, we study cohort trends in sibling correlations across children’s earnings distribution for men and women born from the early 1950s up to 1980. By decomposing sibling correlations, we assess the extent to which these trends are accounted for by observed parental socioeconomic characteristics relative to unobserved family background factors. Our results reveal a modest rise in the influence of family background on average earnings and in the middle of the earnings distribution for both genders, but this trend hides important variation across the distribution. For men, we find a strong increase in the influence of family background on children’s risk of falling to the bottom of the earnings distribution, while sibling correlations for attainment of top earnings have declined over time. Moreover, unobserved family background factors are increasingly important for predicting men’s adult economic disadvantage. For women, sibling correlations have risen across cohorts except at the top of the earnings distribution, and the relative role of observed parental socioeconomic characteristics has increased. These results underscore the complexity of intergenerational trends in the influence of family background, indicating that rising economic inequality does not uniformly lead to reduced mobility but varies significantly across different earnings levels and between genders",

          "abstract": "Historical estimates of the total fertility rate (TFR) are relatively uncommon, owing to the onerous data requirements for direct calculation and the lack of digitized records. Recent advancements in indirect fertility estimation 1 allow for estimation of TFR using data as minimal as a population pyramid – relatively common data in historical contexts through census records and population registers. Here we use published data on the age structure of Roman Egypt circa AD 12 to AD 259 2 to estimate TFR and 90%ile credible interval in an ancient time period and place using a Bayesian approach. Furthermore, the population data is separated by urban and rural areas, allowing for an unprecedented glimpse into ancient fertility levels. We find that ancient Roman Egyptian women in urban areas had considerably lower fertility than women in rural areas -- urban TFR: 3.37 [2.26 – 4.55], and rural TFR: 8.57 [6.01 – 11.25]. Our findings suggest that the modern day urban/rural fertility differential dates back nearly 2000 years. As demonstrated here, the advancements in indirect estimation could be deployed to better understand historical and ancient fertility regimes, shedding light on societies far before the existence of modern vital statistics systems.",

          "authors": "Mathew Hauer; Dean Hardy; Emilio Zagheni; Andrew Jorgenson",
          "abstract": "Rarely are those most impacted by climate change the same as those most responsible for global carbon emissions. Assignment of responsibility for carbon emissions typically differentiates emissions across space and time but not birth cohort. Including young birth cohorts complicates assessments as they have yet to emit as much as older cohorts. Using formal demographic methods, we develop an approach to estimate carbon emissions across space, across time, and across the life course, creating a unified carbon emissions identity, comparable to other well-known carbon identities. We estimate the birth cohorts born between 1850 and 2020 with the highest lifetime carbon emissions. We show that globally, cohorts born between 1970 and 1990 have the highest lifetime emissions under a moderate carbon emissions pathway and those born since 2000 under a high emissions pathway. Our results suggest that carbon emissions pathways play the strongest role in determining which cohorts will be associated with the highest lifetime carbon emissions, with lower pathways suggesting earlier cohorts and higher pathways suggesting later cohorts.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the origins and evolution of technological complexity in\nCanadian regions using patent records linked to firm-level ownership and geograph-\nical data. Since 2000, larger Canadian cities have experienced a notable increase in\nlevels of technological complexity. The analysis examines the determinants of this\ncomplexity, with a particular focus on the role of intra- and inter-firm collaborations\nacross different geographical scales. The findings reveal the significant contributions\nof multilocational firms and intra-organizational collaborations to the development\nof more complex technologies in regions. Further analysis shows that the introduc-\ntion of complex technologies does not stem from novel recombinations of components\nbut rather from combinations developed internationally by firms, often coupled with\ncombinations originating within the host region.",

          "title": "Organizing Organizational Theory: Current Foundations, Future Directions",
          "authors": "Jose Eos Trinidad",
          "abstract": "This review synthesizes various organizational perspectives into seven clusters with the acronym SCRIPTS: structure, culture, relations, institutions, professions, transformation, and social conflict. These contemporary theories highlight how various organizational factors affect individual and organizational performance, change, innovation, wellbeing, and inequality. In organizational theory, structure focuses on formal elements like rules, roles, routines, and rewards while culture refers to informal elements like climate, identity, and sensemaking. Relations refer to effects of interpersonal and interorganizational networks while institutions refer to norms that influence isomorphism and dynamism. Professions feature psychological factors affecting performance and sociological factors shaping work and occupations. Transformation refers to episodic and continuous changes while social conflict foregrounds power, inequalities, and competition over resources. I map how these perspectives are connected with each other and also suggest future directions in the field by intersecting organizational theory with studies of new technologies, historic organizations, global interconnections, marginalized populations, political institutions, and larger societal consequences.",

Es wird ein kurzer Überblick über die institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen in Schweiz gegeben. Auf der empirischen Grundlage von 15 semi-standardisierten Interviews werden anschliessend drei zentrale Themenfelder identifiziert: (1) Heilpraktik als eine Berufung im Kontrast zur Lohnarbeit in anderen Pflegeberufen, (2) Exotismus und Nostalgie als Kritik an der modernen westlichen Medizin sowie (3) die Vorstellung, dass jede Person die Verantwortung für die eigene Gesundheit trägt. Entlang dieser drei Themenfelder wird in der Heilpraktik eine Kritik an der westlichen Moderne formuliert, welche sich als radikal Anderes zu dieser präsentiert, letztlich aber auf denselben Prinzipien beruht.",

          "abstract": "Cette étude examine les relations entre les caractéristiques du métier de chef de projet et la réussite des projets, en privilégiant l'identification des facteurs déterminants de l'efficience, de l'efficacité et de la performance. Cette recherche mobilise des entretiens semi-directifs menés auprès de chefs de projet informatique. Les résultats mettent en évidence le rôle prépondérant de la diversité des compétences, de l'identité des tâches, de l'autonomie et du retour d'expérience dans la réussite des projets, tandis que la portée des tâches apparaît comme un facteur secondaire dans le contexte informatique orienté résultats. L'autonomie constitue un levier essentiel pour favoriser l'innovation et l'adaptabilité, tandis que le retour d'expérience structuré s'avère indispensable pour aligner les efforts sur les objectifs organisationnels. La diversité des compétences est corrélée à un engagement accru, une prise de décision stratégique plus pertinente et une gestion des risques optimisée. Cette étude apporte une nouvelle perspective sur l'organisation du travail dans l'environnement dynamique et complexe de la gestion de projet informatique, tout en proposant des préconisations concrètes pour la conception des postes de chef de projet, permettant ainsi d'optimiser la performance et la motivation des équipes. Cette recherche propose également aux décideurs des axes d'amélioration concrets pour valoriser l'organisation du travail dans le secteur informatique. Il conviendrait, dans le cadre de futures recherches, d'étendre le périmètre d'étude à différents secteurs d'activité et territoires, ainsi que de mener des études longitudinales, permettant ainsi d'approfondir notre compréhension des liens entre l'organisation des postes et la performance des projets dans des contextes diversifiés.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Cecilia Potente; Lydia Palumbo; Marika Jalovaara",
          "abstract": "The increasing share of women achieving higher education in the second half of the twentieth century in Western countries has led to changes in the educational distribution of couples in the population. The consequences of the educational expansion for health, and especially mortality, have not received enough attention. We use Finnish full population register data and focus on married and cohabiting couples in 1987–2020, born up to 1970, to examine how the partner’s education is associated with individual-level mortality risk. Accelerated failure time models show that the individual and the partner’s educational level significantly relate to individuals' death risk. Overall, the higher the education level of both an individual and their partner, the lower the individual's mortality rate (p&lt;0.05), with men presenting stronger associations than those of women. Additionally, the type of couple to which individuals belong has a distinct association with their mortality. Homogamous highly-educated couples have the highest survival advantage, while low-educated couples have the greatest disadvantage. Heterogamous couples, where one partner is low-educated and another highly educated, are in between. These results are similar for marriage and cohabitation, and across cohorts. The latter finding highlights the importance of both men’s and women’s education for mortality outcomes. While both men and women show these trends, women present much lower differences in mortality than men. These results indicate that there is a clear resource multiplication mechanism influencing the relationship between partners' education and mortality for men, while for women, the mechanisms seem to fall between resource multiplication and substitution. Consequently, low-educated men partnered with low-educated women emerge as the most vulnerable group in terms of mortality risk.",
