          "authors": "Urvi Suwal; Amanda Royka; Julian Jara-Ettinger",
          "abstract": "Human social cognition is built on our capacity to think about other minds. Do people have a general capacity to infer the contents of other minds from observable behavior? Or is this capacity specialized for inferring certain mental states, while struggling with others? Using a novel paradigm, we tested people’s capacity to infer another person’s desires, beliefs, or visual experience across three logically equivalent tasks. Despite the logical equivalence, people were less accurate, slower, and reported expending more effort when inferring the content of others’ visual experience compared to inferring others' beliefs and desires (Experiments 1 and 2; N = 120 U.S. adults and N = 60 U.S. adults). However, additional training rapidly improved people’s capacity to infer others’ visual experience (Experiment 3; N = 60 U.S. adults). Our results show that different kinds of mental state inferences produce different performance signatures, which may relate to how frequently we need to make such inferences in daily life.",

          "title": "Introductory Statistical Pedagogy Should Be Reformed:  Transitioning from a Hypothesis Testing to Modeling Framework",
          "authors": "Dustin Fife; Joseph Lee Rodgers",
          "abstract": "The standard undergraduate statistics curriculum, which focuses on testing hypotheses, was first developed a century ago when hand-calculations dominated statistical analysis. While graduate training has advanced somewhat, the undergraduate curriculum has remained relatively unchanged for the last 50-100 years. This situation is particularly troubling when one considers how it fails to prepare students for advanced statistical methods, perpetuates misunderstandings, and masks the underlying logic of statistics. It also is highly limited in its application, leading researchers to shoehorn their analyses into a hypothesis-testing framework. An alternative to the hypothesis-testing framework is one that focuses on building, evaluating, and comparing models. In this paper, we argue that a modeling framework (and an extension of modeling called ‘model comparisons’) highlights the underlying logic of statistics, deepens understanding of the language of statistics, prepares students for advanced procedures, and promotes sound statistical reasoning. We argue for a pedagogical shift away from the hypothesis testing status quo and toward a modeling framework, all while discussing obstacles to such a change and how such obstacles might be (fairly) easily overcome.",

          "title": "From latent constructs to networks: modeling high-dimensional social inferences in naturalistic settings",
          "authors": "Junsong Lu; Chujun Lin",
          "abstract": "People make a variety of social inferences about others in daily life. Long-standing research suggests that these inferences are captured by a few latent dimensions (e.g., warmth and competence). However, prior work relied on constrained designs (e.g., face images, forced ratings), limiting ecological validity. Others suggest that social inferences are more complex than just a few dimensions could summarize but lack empirical support. Here, we conducted two pre-registered studies to test the high-dimensional properties of social inferences. To maximize generalizability, we computationally sampled diverse naturalistic videos and recruited U.S. representative participants (N = 1,598). Participants freely described people in videos using their own words. Cross-validation identified 25 latent dimensions which explained only 15% of the variance in the data. Alternatively, a sparse network model representing the unique correlations between inferences unreducible to shared latent constructs better represented the data. The network models informed the dynamics of naturalistic inferences, revealing what inferences people tended to make for the same individual and how inferences shifted from concrete to abstract over time (Study 1). The network models also indicated cultural differences in how one social inference was related to another between samples (Study 2, Asian N = 651, European N = 792). Together, these findings show that the high-dimensional network approach provides an alternative, non-mutually exclusive model for understanding the mental representation of social inferences in naturalistic contexts, which provides new insights into the dynamics and diversities of social inferences beyond the static, universal structure found with the low-dimensional latent construct approach.",

          "title": "Evaluating Individual Differences in Emotion Regulation in Response to Sadness Using Digital Phenotyping",
          "authors": "Colin Maxwell Bosma",
          "abstract": "Background: The majority of research on emotion regulation processes has been restricted to controlled laboratory settings that use experimental paradigms to investigate short-term outcomes. A true understanding of emotion regulation requires an unobtrusive, ecologically valid assessment of the construct as it occurs in the environment. Digital phenotyping is a novel method for evaluating human behavior in naturalistic settings. \nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate whether smartphone-based digital phenotyping data predicts individual differences in emotion regulation in both in-lab and naturalistic settings.\nMethods: During an in-lab session, unselected university student participants (N = 69) completed self-report questionnaires measuring trait emotion regulation as well as state emotion regulation and state affect following a baseline period, a negative mood induction, and a recovery period. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping data were then collected over the course of a 7-day follow-up. Variation in global positioning system (GPS) distance and mobile power state level were examined as predictors of longitudinal variation in negative affect, emotion regulation, and depression. \nResults: Results showed that variation in GPS distance was significantly associated with variation in state cognitive reappraisal (b = -0.0004, SE = 0.0002, p = .02) and negative state affect (b = 0. 005, SE = 0.002, p = .01) over time. Variation in power state level was also significantly associated with variation in cognitive reappraisal over time (b = -4.98, SE = 1.72, p = .005) and marginally associated with variation in negative state affect (b = -29.58, SE = 16.73, p = .08) over time. Cluster and classification analyses showed both power state level and GPS distance accurately classified two trait emotion regulation clusters with high sensitivity (.95 and .96 respectively) and specificity (.86 and .97 respectively). Variation in power state level and GPS distance together with trait and state emotion regulation did not predict current depressive symptoms (ps &gt; .05).\nConclusions: Overall, the findings provide initial and foundational data on the use of digital phenotyping data in predicting individual differences in state and trait emotion regulation in both in-lab and naturalistic settings. The results suggest that operationalizations of digital phenotyping data and modeling approaches are particularly important factors to consider when implementing digital phenotyping methodology in the study of mental health processes such as emotion regulation.",

          "title": "Unraveling the Contextual Nature of Racial Microaggressions, Coping, and Perceived Stress Using Ambulatory Assessment in Graduate Students of Color: A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study",
          "authors": "Maria Kalantzis; Sam Lim; Miranda Yannon; Abigail Nicole McDevitt; Aldo Barrita; Joshua B. Grubbs; Carolyn Tompsett",
          "abstract": "The construct of racial microaggressions has been well-contested in the psychological literature, and numerous methodological challenges have been presented in terms of operationalizing and measuring racial microaggressions. To that end, racial microaggressions, stress, and coping may be best measured by combining ambulatory assessment and qualitative methods to better understand how microaggressions are contextualized in real-time. This study aimed to explore the day-level associations between perceived stress and racial microaggressions among graduate students of color using an 8-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) method. Participants (N=36; M age= 28.4, SD=2.24) completed a baseline survey and a 7-day EMA protocol, providing contextual information on instances of racial microaggressions as well as bi-daily measurements of perceived stress. Qualitative analysis of EMA data, utilizing thematic and content analysis, revealed that racial microaggressions were primarily verbal, often related to assumptions of threat or intelligence. Quantitative analysis using linear mixed-effect models indicated no significant associations between the frequency of racial microaggressions and changes in daily perceived stress. However, greater frequency of microaggressions measured via the Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (REMS) were significantly related to a greater frequency of racial microaggressions as measured by EMA. These findings provide insights into the frequency, context, and impact of racial microaggressions among graduate students of color and call upon future research to employ more data-intensive approaches to understand racial microaggressions' impact on mental well-being in other marginalized groups.",

          "abstract": "Checking behaviours are engaged to prevent adverse outcomes and alleviate \nuncertainty. However, there is still a gap in our understanding as to how factors such as \nthreat level and performance feedback impact the frequency of checking and \nassociated concomitants. To address these questions, we collected data across two \nlab sites (n = 208) and manipulated threat level (low threat: performance score only; \nhigh threat: mild electric shock based on performance score) and performance \nfeedback (no feedback, feedback) during a visual discrimination and checking task. \nThroughout the task, we recorded checking frequency, ratings of the urge to check and \ndistress, task performance, and corrugator supercilii activity. High threat versus low \nthreat led to increased checking frequency in one testing site, but not the other. No \neffect of performance feedback was observed on checking frequency. Performance \nfeedback was associated with the urge to check differently across sites. Both, high \nthreat versus low threat, and no feedback versus feedback, were separately associated \nwith improved task accuracy for easier trial types. Lastly, no feedback, compared to \nfeedback, was associated with greater engagement of the corrugator supercilii. These \nresults suggest that: (1) higher threat level increases checking behaviour to some extent \nand improves task performance, and (2) the absence of feedback improves task \nperformance and is associated with greater distress or effort. Overall, these findings \nprovide insight into how factors such as threat level and performance feedback \ndifferently impact checking behaviour and its concomitants.",

          "abstract": "Increased attention to racial inequities catalyzed a surge in publications documenting racial biases in neuroscience with one recent article in Nature Neuroscience effectively drawing attention to how skin conductance response is less reliably detected for Black individuals than White. In this correspondence, we introduce pressing additional “real world” concerns in how polygraphs heavily rely on this measure. Despite well-documented issues of validity and reliability with polygraphs, they continue to be used in various stages of the legal system. With Black individuals already facing disproportionate incarceration rates, the reduced reliability for skin conductance used in polygraphs for Black individuals can further exacerbate legal system inequity. Furthermore, these biases accentuate existing challenges interpreting polygraph results given their subjectivity as well as the heightened police-related anxiety reported among Black individuals. We join calls for re-evaluation and possibly exclusion of polygraph evidence in legal settings, considering the amplified risks it poses to Black individuals.",

          "abstract": "Bad actors and bots present threats to data integrity in remote research designs, compromising estimates of cognitive task performance. Here, we share our experiences and recommendations for identifying and preventing bad actors and bots from enrolling in remote studies of cognitive task performance. As part of a large-scale study, 3,488 participants were recruited through various platforms, including social media and MTurk, and were compensated for their participation. Participants were categorized according to bad actor status as determined by 1) number and risk-level associated with red flags within initial screening and pattern of responses; and 2) a researcher review process to identify patterns of aberrant, patterned, or inconsistent responding. Participants were either automatically labeled as bad actors (n=2,829), labeled as bad actors after researcher review (n=242), or labeled as good actors after researcher review (n=417). Cognitive task performance was assessed with Adaptive Cognitive Evaluation Explorer (ACE-X), a mobile, gamified collection of executive function tasks including measures of working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. We considered differences between good and bad actors for mean response times, variability in response times, accuracy, and number of trials attempted. Across 6 of the 7 ACE-X tasks evaluated, bad actors responded slower than good actors on average (β=34.10-150.15, P&lt;.001-.047). Additional differences in task performance suggested that overall, bad actors also tended to be more variable in their response times (β=-0.32-1.01, P&lt;.001), less accurate (β=-2.15-.00, P&lt;.001-1.000), and responded to fewer trials (β=-1.30-.00, P&lt;.001-1.000). This study indicates that bad actors show differences in their patterns of performance on cognitive assessments. Findings presented here suggest a need for careful consideration related to study design and protocols to ensure data integrity when evaluating cognitive performance in remote research settings.",

          "abstract": "Receiving affirmation, whether from ourselves or others, is crucial for interpersonal relationships and goes awry in mental disorders. Meaningful evaluations emerge during interactions, where people can support or let each other down. However, such dynamics are difficult to understand comprehensively without quantitative theory and modeling. Here, we implemented an interactive decision-making game wherein two real-life participants evaluated, i.e. graded their approval, for themselves and their play partner. Young adult participants interacted in a multi-level version of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Crucially, each participant did not interact with the other directly, but instructed an avatar to do so on their behalf. This allowed increased experimental control while preserving considerable ecological validity. We tested computational models of participants’ evaluations of self and other, based on their beliefs about the quality of their decisions. However such models were less successful than a novel class of models, where self- and other- evaluations depended directly on the combination of self- and other- outcomes. The winning models suggested that for a given participant, evaluation of the self is proportional to how much one’s partner benefits, and vice versa. We found marked self-positivity bias, especially in dyads where neither partner cooperated. This was consistent with attributional theory, negatively evaluating others rather than the self for adverse outcomes. Between participants, self-positivity bias was explained by a reduced weight of one’s partner’s benefits for self-evaluation, hinting that the negative outcome subject to external attribution was the partner’s, rather than one’s own, poor returns. Preliminary analysis also suggested that a reduced sensitivity to others’ outcomes was associated, in this context when participants may have both cooperative and competitive motives, with reduced earnings for the self.  The proposed computational model provides a concise and novel account of self-serving bias in evaluations, clearly observed during interactions.",

          "authors": "Rhiannon Jones; Joost M. Leunissen; Adrian Whyte; Joydeep Bhattacharya",
          "abstract": "Background: Thought suppression is suggested as a causal factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as it can lead to a paradoxical increase in intrusive thoughts. However, the neural mechanisms through which obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) influence thought suppression, particularly in the context of attentional bias toward negatively valenced stimuli, remain unclear. We hypothesized that OCS would predict increased recruitment of frontal inhibitory neurocircuitry during the suppression of negative words and that this would be mediated by an attentional bias toward these stimuli. \nMethods: EEG was recorded from 48 non-clinical participants tasked with directed forgetting of negative and neutral words. We examined the influence of OCS on neural correlates of thought suppression, specifically fronto-parahippocampal beta-1 (13-18 Hz) synchronisation and alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in the parahippocampal cortex. The mediating role of attentional bias, measured via the late positive potential (LPP) following word was assessed using a mediated moderation model.\nResults: OCS predicted enhanced fronto-parahippocampal beta-1 synchronisation when instructed to forget negative words. This effect was mediated by attentional bias to negative stimuli, but only in individuals with higher levels of OCS. \nConclusions: Individuals with higher OCS exhibit compensatory engagement of frontal inhibitory mechanisms when attempting to suppress negative emotional stimuli. This compensatory activity is influenced by both attentional bias to negative stimuli and the severity of OCS, highlighting a neural mechanism that may contribute to the persistence of intrusive thoughts in OCD.",

          "abstract": "Background: Research suggests that affective responses to exercise and executive function (EF) processes contribute to habitual physical activity (PA) behavior. The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidence for an emerging cognitive-affect model of PA by investigating the effect of pre-exercise working memory and inhibitory control on exercise-induced affect and perceptions of exertion. \nMethods: Healthy active young adults (N=28, 22.50 ± 3.25 yrs; 75% ♀, BMI = 24.89 ± 4.37 kg·m-2) completed the Flanker and N-back tasks (2 &amp; 3-back) before completing an acute bout (31-min) of moderate-to-vigorous intensity (HR= 158.6 ± 9.9 b·min-1) treadmill running. Feeling Scale (FS) and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were recorded every 3-minutes during the running session. Participants’ prior enjoyment to running was recorded pre-session and the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was measured immediately following the session. \nResults: Reaction time (RT) measures were used for the cognitive tasks. Participants RT performance during 2-back (β= -0.51, t(23) = -2.51, P &lt; 0.05) and 3-back (β= -0.40, t(24)= -2.14, P&lt; 0.05) predicted more positive FS (i.e., pleasure) during exercise. Flanker RT significantly predicted RPE (β= 0.49, t(21)= 2.24, P &lt; 0.05). Finally, pre-exercise EF was not associated with post-exercise enjoyment (i.e., PACES). \nConclusion: Pre-exercise working memory and inhibitory control performance predicted affect and perceived exertion during exercise. Participants with faster RT to working memory tasks felt significantly more positive and those with faster RT during inhibitory control had significantly lower perceptions of exertion.",

          "abstract": "For three decades, researchers have assessed children’s genetic-essentialism through an “Adoption Task,” probing their beliefs about whether adopted babies grow up to resemble their birthparents or adoptive parents. The present study investigates these beliefs among children who were themselves adopted or donor-conceived (i.e., who share genetic material with neither or one parent, respectively; “ADC”), comparing them with children who were traditionally conceived (i.e., who share genetic material with two parents; “TC”). Children (n = 95, 4-8 years old, 30ADC/65TC, 34M/59F/2NB, 55 White / 35 of color / 5 did not report) completed five trials of an Adoption Task concerning five personal characteristics (hair color, spoken language, personality, interests, and intelligence). Across trials, ADC children made fewer essentialist judgments than TC children (ηp2 = .07); the odds of an essentialist response were threefold greater among TC than ADC participants. Exploratory analyses revealed that with age, children’s essentialist judgments became increasingly differentiated across different characteristics (e.g., increasingly divergent views of the genetic basis of hair color vs. spoken language), and that this differentiation was more pronounced in the ADC than the TC sample. No differences were observed in the genetic-essentialist views of ADC and TC children’s parents, suggesting that the mechanism underlying effects was children’s own sense-making capacities. Whereas nature and nurture are confounded for TC children, these factors are decoupled for ADC children, supporting them in building their causal theories. Cognitive, developmental, and social implications are discussed, along with translational implications for ADC children and their families.",

The present study (N = 44) applied a novel approach – the random generation paradigm – to explore how pre-existing social assumptions determine which information is retrieved from memory when prompted by different social categories. Specifically, we asked participants to imagine people working in certain professions and to say their names out loud. We found that the statistics of the uttered names reflected societal gender stereotypes and environmental statistics of actual people working in these occupations. Importantly, the proportion of female and male names generated for each profession by each participant predicted their performance in a sequential priming task (prime = stereotyped professions, target = female and male faces) better than the environmental statistics or participants’ explicit estimates of gender proportions. Together, these findings offer a new, and widely applicable, method for exploring cultural beliefs and help clarify how social information is sampled from memory when making social judgments.",

          "authors": "Maurizio Sicorello; Moritz Elsaesser; David R. Kolar",
          "abstract": "Difficulties in emotion regulation are an essential transdiagnostic phenomenon of mental health. While there is extensive literature focusing on emotion regulation difficulties as trait-like constructs, it is inherently a dynamic process that unfolds over time. This raises the need for state-like measures to capture these temporal dynamics in both laboratory and real-world settings, such as the State Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (S-DERS). In the present study, we report the German translation and validation of the S-DERS and present a cross-sectional network analysis to stimulate novel hypotheses for pathways linking single discrete difficulties. A sample of 214 participants underwent a negative mood induction followed by an assessment of the 21-item S-DERS. The results confirm the four-factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of the original English version. Consistent with previous studies on the trait-DERS, we find that an exploratory structural equation modeling approach with extensive cross-loadings is necessary to reach good model fit. Moreover, a model with four correlated factors outperformed a bi-factor and high-order model. This indicates there is no single latent construct of emotion regulation difficulties, but rather four distinct but related constructs for (a) Non-acceptance of Current Emotions, (b) Limited Ability to Modulate Current Emotional and Behavioral Responses, (c) Lack of Awareness of Current Emotions, and (d) Lack of Clarity about Current Emotions. These associations may imply a complex causal interplay between these factors.",

          "abstract": "Several police practices, including stop-and-search actions, involve selecting citizens for controls. These selection procedures have faced extensive criticism for being biased with respect to socio-demographic factors. However, the different methodologies adopted in prior research to assess target selection have made it difficult to evaluate the actual existence of biases, especially due to difficulties in establishing a comparable benchmark population. To circumvent these limitations, we propose using covert systematic social observations as a method to investigate and evaluate the potential bias of police’s selection procedures. Using the weapon control performed by the Dutch police in Amsterdam in 2022 as a case, we present a method to detect selection biases based on ethnic profiles of citizens that can be reliably applied and has the benefit of allowing for varying police’s selection practices. In sum, given how covert on-site observations offer a realistic picture of how the situation unfolds, we recommend this as a method to examine stop-and-search actions and other bias-prone citizen selection procedures.",

          "abstract": "New-age technologies have great potential to facilitate older individuals’ independent living in the community (aging in place). However, there is a mismatch between the elderly’s appreciation of assistive technology in theory and their adoption in practice. The current study investigates, via a mixed methods approach, key variables that influence the perception of the elderly towards in-house digital assistants. A prominent theme was that of control: Participants want to maintain some sense of autonomy. This factor has not (yet) been included in current technology acceptance models but may be an influential factor in the adoption and acceptance of technology by the elderly. Additionally, participants weighed the impact on their community (rather than themselves) heavily, accepting that adoption of assistive technology will greatly support their family, caregivers and/or the healthcare sector. Emphasizing these two factors may therefore increase the adoption and acceptance of digital assistants, allowing longer aging in place.",

          "abstract": "Smart home devices, increasingly prevalent in modern households, collect large amounts of data from their immediate environment. These data are often of significant monetary value to companies, sometimes without necessarily improving their functionality. As such, the type and scope of user data devices collect may entail privacy and security risks of relevance to the decision which of otherwise similar products to purchase. Our goal is to determine if users consider the value of the data to be collected when planning to use such devices. Drawing on theories from media and cognitive psychology, we proposed two causal and two extended models of privacy behavior and conducted a study to compare the evidence for one over the other respectively. We employed a factorial within-between-subject design (NA = 517; NB = 420), considering five types of smart home devices, three levels of endogenous data value (severity of risks), and three levels of exogenous data value (likelihood of risks). Bayes Factor model comparisons of the fit multilevel models indicated extreme relative evidence for the model assuming value-dependent privacy behavior over one predicting deviations from rational data valuation. We discuss implications for digital sovereignty and privacy interventions in smart home usage.",

          "abstract": "Spending time alone is a virtually inevitable part of daily life that can promote or undermine well-being. Here, we explore how the language used to describe time alone—such as “me-time” “solitude,” or “isolation”—influences how it is perceived and experienced. In Study 1 (N = 500), participants evaluated five common labels for time alone. Descriptive and narrative evidence revealed robust interindividual variability and significant mean differences in how these labels were perceived. Overall, “me-time” was rated most positively, and “isolation” was rated least positively (but not negatively). In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated the linguistic framing of time alone, describing it as either “me-time” or “isolation”. Participants (N = 176) then spent 30 minutes physically alone, without digital interaction. Notably, positive affect increased for participants in the “me-time” condition but decreased for those in the “isolation” condition. Negative affect decreased for both conditions, but the magnitude of the decrease was larger after “me-time”. Additionally, linguistic framing affected what people thought about, but not what they did, while alone. People’s beliefs about being alone improved after “me-time” but not after “isolation.” These findings demonstrate meaningful variation in how people perceive different labels that refer to time alone and suggest that simple linguistic shifts may enhance subjective experiences of time alone.",

          "abstract": "Social disconnection, which includes objective social isolation and subjective loneliness, is associated with increased risk of physical health problems and early mortality. The hypothesized nature in which social disconnection operates was recently outlined in the theory of social homeostasis. The theory proposes that individuals strive to maintain an optimal level of social connection, with loneliness serving an adaptive purpose by motivating social reconnection and preventing prolonged isolation. Social homeostasis may be especially relevant for explaining how social disconnection can evolve and change over time in various forms of psychopathology. In this paper we developed a mathematical model based on the theory of social homeostasis to help explain social disconnection in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, two mental disorders characterized by social functioning impairments. First, we formalized the theory of social homeostasis as a set of differential equations. We then implemented the equations computationally using simulations. From there, we simulated three examples of the model, including an example characterizing a theoretical healthy individual and examples characterizing theoretical individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The healthy simulation successfully reproduced the predicted dynamics of social homeostasis, while the bipolar and schizophrenia simulations revealed distinct patterns of social dysfunction. By formalizing social homeostasis through differential equations, we provide a more precise framework for understanding how social disconnection can evolve over time as a dynamical system. We also discuss the model’s implications for future psychopathology research and highlight potential avenues for theory and model refinement.",

          "abstract": "Emotional crying is a complex and multifaceted expression that is frequently observed in humans. Its communicative effects have been recently studied in more detail. However, many studies focus on just one specific feature of emotional crying, most often emotional tears, neglecting the complex nature of the expression. Reports about crying episodes observe that tears most commonly occur in combination with other features such as facial expressions, vocalizations, gestures, and varied temporal dynamics. This shortcoming in research is mostly explained by a lack of adequately controlled stimuli depicting different crying features. Here, we provide a solution for this problem by introducing the Dynamic Posed Emotional Crying Behavior Database (DPECBD), an openly available resource of 500 videos depicting 10 actors showing variations in tears intensity, facial expression intensity, vocalizations, gestures, and temporal dynamics and the combination thereof. We present two studies (N = 2729) providing evidence for the validity of the database. In addition, we developed a static supplementary resource (DPECBD-S) with 70 pictures depicting variations in tears and facial expression intensity that was successfully validated across two studies (N = 601). Overall, our findings support the validity of this new stimulus set that closes a gap in the research on the interpersonal effects of emotional crying.

          "abstract": "Objectives: Auditory processing underlies phonological representation and presents neural oscillation lateralization in the brain. Atypical lateralization in auditory processing has been widely accepted associated with impaired reading skills in alphabetic languages. However, whether Chinese adults with reading difficulty (RD) history presents atypical lateralization in auditory processing similar to those in alphabetic languages remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Chinese adults with poor reading would show lateralization of neural oscillations during auditory sampling. \nDesign: Thirty-two adults with self-report RD history and 44 adults without RD history were screened out by Chinese Adult Reading History Questionnaire (CARHQ). Reading accuracy, phonological accuracy, and rapid automatized naming (RAN) were assessed in all the participants. Auditory steady state cortical responses (ASSR) modulated at 10-80 Hz was recorded during a 6s white noise. Time-frequency power and phase synchrony indices were used to measure induced oscillatory power and synchrony of beta and gamma oscillations related to phonemic processing. \nResults: Adults with RD history performed worse than adults without RD history in reading accuracy and phonological accuracy. Also, adults with RD history showed atypical rightward lateralization in the gamma band, whereas the adults without RD history showed leftward lateralization. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in the left hemisphere negatively correlated with reading accuracy in adults with RD history, while left hemisphere ERSP lateralization positively correlated with phonological accuracy in adults without RD history. The inter-trial phase synchrony (ITPS) in the right hemisphere also correlated with reading accuracy in adults with RD history. \nConclusions: The present study revealed auditory lateralization deficits in Chinese adults with RD history. \nKeywords: Reading difficulty history, Chinese adults, Auditory processing, Lateralization, Event-related spectral perturbation.",

However, the collection and analysis of verbal-report data in experiments is relatively costly, and so is grossly underutilized. Here, we aim to reduce such costs by providing software that will collect, transcribe, and analyse verbal-report data. Verbal data is collected using jsPsych (De Leeuw, 2015), making it suitable for online and lab-based experiments. The transcription and analyses rely on machine-learning methods (e.g., large-language models), making them substantially more efficient than current methods using human coders. We demonstrate how to use the software we provide in a case study via a simple memory experiment. This collection of software was made to be modular, so that the various components can be updated and replaced with superior models and new methods easily added. It is our sincere hope that this approach popularizes the collection of verbal-report data in psychology experiments.",

Participants were 716 Dutch adolescents (Mage = 13.2 years, 48.3% girls). Latent profile analysis of self-reported time spent on SMU, intensity of online peer communication, and problematic SMU yielded four distinct patterns: problematic heavy use (n = 129), non-problematic heavy use (n = 262), moderate use (n = 197), and low use (n = 128). Adolescents' peer-reported social status and behaviors were associated with the SMU patterns. Withdrawn or more prosocial adolescents were less likely to engage in SMU overall. Popular or proactive aggressive adolescents were likely to show non-problematic heavy SMU, while disliked, reactively aggressive, or less pro-social adolescents showed some risk for problematic SMU. The findings suggest a distinction be-tween heavy and problematic SMU and that adolescents’ risk for problematic SMU varied between subtypes of social status and behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Retrieved-context models of memory posit that a slowly drifting neural context signal is encoded alongside items in memory. However, this signal can be disrupted by event boundaries, affecting the temporal relationships between items across event boundaries. Here, we investigated how temporal proximity and event boundaries affect the detailed recall of events. Specifically, we assessed memory for events in the movie Forrest Gump, chosen specifically because of its hierarchical event structure with individual events in the movie being nested within broader life-periods (e.g., childhood, college, etc.). Importantly, the trial order at recall was structured such that adjacent trials tested events that were (1) either temporally close or far and (2) either within or across a life period. Participants provided both more event-specific details and more false memories for an event when the preceding event came from the same life period, suggesting that recall of the life period supported recall of episodic information, but also increased the likelihood of providing false information. Further, participants provided more intrusions from non-cued events after just recalling an event that was temporally distant, with this effect exacerbated if the preceding event was also across a life period boundary. Quantifying event similarity between the cued event and the sources of intrusions suggests that participants may be providing supplementary information to help scaffold memory for the cued event. Altogether, these results demonstrate that both temporal proximity and event boundaries affect detailed memory recall, extending previous findings into the domain of naturalistic events.",

          "abstract": "Autistic individuals commonly exhibit difficulties with emotion recognition, difficulties that contribute to social issues in Autism. Both emotion recognition and social abilities are distributed along a spectrum in Autism and the general population. We explored this relationship between emotional processing, as measured via the physiological response of pupil dilation, and Autistic traits, including social abilities. We presented participants with dynamic, audiovisual stimuli of actors uttering a semantically neutral phrase. These utterances were expressed with either neutral tone of voice and facial expression, or with angry, fearful, disgusted, sad, or surprised tone and expression. Each emotion was presented with high- and low-intensity depictions. Participants were asked to identify the emotion and rate its intensity. Participants’ pupillary responses were recorded during viewing. Traits associated with Autism were measured through a battery of self-report scales. We then tested for associations between Autistic traits and pupillary response to emotional stimuli. Broadly speaking, individuals with higher Autistic traits exhibited smaller overall pupillary responses to emotional stimuli. More specifically, emotional responses were related to socio-communicative Autistic traits. Further, social traits were especially correlated with physiological responses to low-intensity emotional presentation. This reflects previous studies suggesting that Autistic individuals show more pronounced difficulties with emotion recognition when emotional expression is more subtle. Finally, social Autistic traits were related to physiological responses to anger, fear, surprise, and to a lesser extent happiness, but not to sadness or disgust.",

However, to date no studies have tested the presumed link between gender-STEM stereotypes and science task persistence. The reported preregistered study involving 109 5- to 7-year-old children from a suburb in the Eastern region of the US (58% White, 9% Asian, 3% Latinx, 2% Black/African American, 28% mixed race/ethnicity; average socioeconomic status above the national average) aimed to replicate previous findings of gender differences in science task persistence using a physical sink-or-float science task and test if any differences were related to stereotyping. No gender difference in science-task persistence was found, and Bayesian analysis indicated moderate support for the null hypothesis of no gender effect. Instead, task accuracy and enjoyment predicted persistence. There was mixed evidence of gender-STEM stereotypes, and stereotypes did not relate to persistence on the science task. These findings call for a reconsideration of previous results and suggest future directions for research on the origins of gender differences in STEM engagement.",

Traditional cognitive models have tried to capture the mechanisms underlying this process but remain mostly limited to two-choice tasks with simple stimuli.

We recently developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model – RTNet – that exhibits several important signatures of human decision making and outperforms existing alternatives in predicting human responses. Here, we use RTNet’s image computability to test four different confidence strategies on a task involving digit discrimination with eight alternatives. Specifically, we tested confidence strategies that consider the entire evidence distribution across choices (Softmax and Entropy), the difference between the winning choice and the second-best choice (Top2Diff), or only the evidence for the winning choice (Positive Evidence). Across 60 subjects, the Top2Diff model provided the best quantitative and qualitative fits to the data and the best predictions of humans’ image-by-image confidence ratings. These results support the notion that human confidence is based on the difference of evidence between the top two choices and demonstrate that Softmax – currently the standard way of deriving confidence from CNNs – is inadequate for modelling human confidence computations.",

Here we explore why this bias might exist, and whether its existence dooms the eventual acceptance and even celebration of art generated by artificial means. We do this by bringing together recent empirical evidence from the disciplines of neuroaesthetics, social cognition, art history, and human-machine interaction to develop several new perspectives that are ripe for empirical evaluation. Given the growing momentum and outlook of AI-generated art in today’s society, our aim with this paper is to provide novel evidence-based propositions for understanding the relationship between art and artificial intelligence with a clear focus on social cognitive neuroscience perspectives.",

As such, we expect analogies to enable the learning of complex, novel information by communication that takes advantage of shared cultural information. Here, we demonstrate the plausibility of this proposal and clarify its scope through computational modelling. We first model the individual-level process of learning via analogy with access to a shared repertoire of cultural information, using NK landscapes to represent high-dimensional solution spaces for complex problems. We then analyse a model of population dynamics to consider the conditions under which analogical communication will evolve and be maintained when costly. Our analyses suggest that even when analogy use is costly in terms of both search time and memory constraints, it can nevertheless be advantageous by allowing learners to obtain high-quality solutions more efficiently and more often than those who don't learn via analogy.",

We discuss results of a between-groups experiment investigating whether dislike can be neutralized using community notes moderation, and to what extent lexical style of the community note may affect neutralization. We found that a tweet accompanied by a community note explaining the gull behavior as natural led to a significantly less negative attitude towards the gull by reducing polarity, and discuss what implications this holds for a broader important use of media moderation to reduce polarization on social media.",

However, not all families benefit equally, and, to date, we have little insight into who benefits more or less, and why. One possible solution is to explore how different potential moderators cluster together in individual families and whether such family profiles predict who benefits more or less from these programs. This study explores: (1) how family, child, and parenting risk factors for disruptive behavior cluster together in families enrolled in the popular and evidence-based Incredible Years Parenting Program using latent profile analyses; (2) how family profiles relate to covariate family characteristics; and (3) whether profiles predict program engagement (i.e., number of sessions attended by caregivers), and effectiveness of (i.e., pre-post changes in disruptive behavior). Individual participant data from six studies across four countries (Norway, the Netherlands, England, Portugal) were used, including a total sample of 772 families with children aged 2.5 to 9 years (M = 5.14; SD = 1.10; 58.0% boys). Families could be profiled into a low and high risk profile, which differed on most child and family (but not parenting) risk factors as well as on covariate family characteristics, such as severity of disruptive behavior. Profile membership predicted engagement in, but not effectiveness of, the program. These findings provide useful insights into the heterogeneity in families participating in parenting programs, although there is a need for further research on how such differences may relate to differences in program effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal research has become increasingly popular in the social and clinical sciences in recent years. However, this popularity has brought about many challenges for both methodological and empirical researchers, including challenges regarding measurement. In this study, we are particularly interested in the assessment of the reliability when multiple items are used to measure the same construct in intensive longitudinal data. This is important because reliability estimates are necessary (albeit not sufficient) to evaluate the quality of measures. Here, we evaluate the internal consistency reliability of scales used during Stage 2 of the WARN-D study, a 3-month period of daily and weekly measurements. The WARN-D study is a prospective 2-year study of approximately 1750 students conducted in the Netherlands, aiming at building an early warning system for depression. Stage 2 includes three months of data on positive and negative affect measured four times a day, and depression and anxiety measured once a week. To assess the reliability of each scale, we use six different statistical approaches including three simpler approaches that estimate the reliability at the between-person and within-person level, and three idiographic approaches that estimate person-specific reliability coefficients. This paper also serves as a tutorial guide for substantive researchers, providing coded examples to facilitate the reporting of the reliability of Ecological Momentary Assessement (EMA) measures. We encourage all researchers to report the reliability of their data when applying the introduced statistical approaches, contributing to a collaborative effort toward developing more reliable measures in psychological and behavioral science.",

          "authors": "Yutaka Horita; Miku Yamazaki; Asuka Tahara",
          "abstract": "Relational mobility, the degree of opportunity to form new relationships in a particular environment, explains cultural differences in interpersonal behavior. Theoretically, relational mobility is thought to be related to the contrasting tendencies in social networks: expansion of relationships (i.e., trust) and commitment to existing relationships (i.e., intimacy). This study reexamined whether perceived relational mobility is associated with the formation and maintenance of social networks. A cross-cultural survey was conducted with 299 American and 298 Japanese people. We investigated the correlations between generalized trust, intimacy with friends, self-disclosure, and the number of social networks. Consistent with previous studies, this study found that Americans are more likely than Japanese to trust strangers, feel intimate with and disclose themselves to their closest friends, and have more relationships. Perceived relational mobility explained the cultural difference in generalized trust but not in intimacy with friends when controlling for other individual characteristics. Generalized trust was associated with a greater number of people to seek advice from, and a greater number of advice networks correlated with higher levels of well-being. The results suggest that relational mobility is associated with psychology related to expanding networks, rather than strengthening existing relationships.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests that positive contact with majorities may ‘sedate’ (undermine) minority support for social change, while negative contact may promote it. However, most studies to date have examined both forms of contact separately, which may not give an accurate picture of their effects. This study examines the joint effects and interplay of positive and negative contact on minority support for social change, and the role of system-fairness beliefs across seven ethnic minority samples in six countries (N = 790). Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling showed that negative contact predicted higher minority support for social change. Positive contact predicted both less support for social change indirectly via enhanced system-fairness beliefs, and more support for social change directly. Except for one national context, the total effects of positive contact were either non-significant or significantly positive. This shows that increased system-fairness beliefs can explain sedative effects of positive contact, and that positive contact may also promote support for social change. We conclude that sedative effects of positive contact may be overestimated by not considering negative contact.",

This longitudinal, comparative, lab-in-the-field study tested the impact of a socio-emotional learning intervention based on Humanitarian Principles (Humanity, Neutrality, Impartiality, Independence) and Values on social emotions (compassion, empathic distress, malicious joy) and on the willingness to help an in- or an out-group member (immigrant or local minority). 96 teenagers and young adults (mean [SD] age: 17.06 [3.56] years; female: 66) in Armenia, Belarus, The Gambia, and Russia were assigned to a three- or five-day intervention in Humanitarian Principles and Values or to a control group. Although there was no overall effect of the intervention on social emotions nor on the willingness to help an in- or an out-group member, an intervention-related increase in compassion and empathic distress predicted an intervention-related increase in the willingness to help an out-group member. We also observe differences between countries. This study highlights the importance of socio-emotional learning interventions in promoting prosocial behaviour in teenagers and young adults from different countries. In addition, this research contributes to the growing body of empirical and policy-oriented work on the implementation of socio-emotional learning and thus contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals 4 (Education) and 16 (Peace).",

          "abstract": "We present four experiments that examine perception and memory for a novel set of\nauditory stimuli, using multidimensional scaling and cognitive modeling to clarify how\nindividual people perceive and recognize these items. The stimuli are auditory “textures”\nconstructed by adjusting the distribution of power across upper frequency bands. In Experiment\n1, people rated similarity between pairs of stimuli; in Experiments 2 and 3, they also engaged in\na recognition memory task using the same stimuli. In Experiment 4, they did all the same tasks\nfrom the first three experiments, and rated stimuli for distinctiveness. Multidimensional scaling\nsuggested the stimuli were perceived along three dimensions, a result which replicated across all\nfour experiments. Similarity ratings, recency, and list homogeneity predicted recognition\nperformance, but distinctiveness ratings did not. These effects were accommodated by the\nExemplar-Based Random Walk model (Nosofsky and Palmeri, 1997)—extending prior work\n(Visscher et al., 2007) to show that memory and attention processes in the auditory domain are\nfundamentally like those in the visual domain, though particularly strong recency effects in the\nauditory domain may be due to echoic memory. We conclude by discussing how the stimuli\nintroduced in this article can be used as “building blocks” to test hypotheses about perception\nand memory for complex, naturalistic sounds such as speech or music while retaining tight\nexperimental control.",

Although rare, linguistic analyses that go beyond emotion words provide deep insights into emotional experience across cultures. In this study, we explored cultural models of emotions prevalent in the US and Belgium using verbal descriptions of recent emotional events collected from speakers of North American (US) English and Belgian Dutch in form of semi-structured interviews. We analyzed the interviews in three stages: 1) topic modeling to characterize content, 2) word counting to examine linguistic resources, and 3) inductive analysis to uncover broader themes. Our findings revealed notable cultural differences alongside some similarities. US English speakers used more first-person pronouns and emotion words, emphasized high-arousal emotions, and prioritized asserting personal achievements and openly expressing their feelings. In contrast, Belgian Dutch speakers’ descriptions reflected a more moderated approach to emotions, illustrating how social standards and broader worldviews gave meaning to the events, with use of fewer first-person pronouns and more language focused on relativization and comparison. Taken together, our observations are consistent with previous psychological research on US and Belgian culture. We evaluate our approach against other means of exploring the conceptualization of emotion across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Semantic knowledge plays an active role in many well-known false memory phenomena, including those emerging from the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) task. In this experimental paradigm, indeed, humans tend to falsely recognize newly presented words via activation of other previously shown stimuli. In the present study we aimed to test what happens in cases in which no apparent prior semantic knowledge is available, like in the case of entirely novel lexical stimuli. To do so, we evaluated semantic similarity effects in a DRM task with lists entirely composed by pseudowords (or “novel words,” i.e., letter strings resembling real words but lacking assigned meanings). Semantic similarity between pseudowords were established through a distributional semantic model able to represent in a vector space, not only attested words but also unmapped strings as bags of character n-grams. Participants were instructed to memorize those lists and then to perform a recognition task. Results showed that participants false and veridical recognition increased with increasing semantic similarity between each stimulus and the stimuli comprising its list, as estimated by the distributional model. These findings extend previous evidence indicating that humans are sensitive to the semantic (distributional) patterns elicited by novel words by showing that this sensitivity can even induce humans to falsely recognize stimuli that they have never encountered in their entire lives.",

          "abstract": "We investigated the benefits of two ways to use flashcards to perform retrieval practice: alone\nversus with a partner. In three experiments, undergraduate students learned word-definition pairs\nusing flashcards alone (Individual condition) or with another student (Paired condition).\nParticipants then made global judgments of learning (gJOLs; Experiments 1-3), and item-level\njudgments of learning (iJOLs; Experiment 3). Finally, participants took a cued-recall test after a\n5-min delay (Experiments 1-3) and a 24-hour delay (Experiments 2-3). In Experiment 1, students\nin the Paired condition dropped flashcards less often than in the Individual condition (dropping\nwas prohibited in Experiments 2-3). In addition, although final test performance tended to be\nsimilar across conditions, inaccurate gJOLs for the immediate test—inflated by ~20% relative to\nactual immediate test performance—were common in the Individual condition but not in the\nPaired condition in Experiments 1-2. In Experiment 3, we tested whether this difference in\nmetacognitive calibration was due to the Paired condition requiring overt retrieval by instructing\nparticipants in the Individual condition to retrieve out loud. With this change, participants in the\nIndividual and Paired conditions reported similarly accurate gJOLs and iJOLs. Taken together,\nthese findings suggest that although performing retrieval practice with flashcards alone versus\nwith a partner yields comparable amounts of learning, doing so with a partner can increase\nmetacognitive accuracy, a benefit possibly driven by the facilitation of overt retrieval. Overall,\nthese findings have implications for self-regulated learning and effective exam preparation.",

          "abstract": "During human spatial navigation, individuals transform visuospatial information between egocentric (i.e., first-person, viewer-dependent, body-centered) and allocentric (i.e., third-person, viewer-independent, world-centered) representations for optimal understanding of the surrounding environment. To capture reference frame utilization in a laboratory setting, researchers often utilize naturalistic, immersive, open-environment settings in virtual reality to mimic real-world navigation. However, few studies have paired navigation through these environments with robust, standardized, post-session testing of reference frame utilization. Therefore, this study developed a novel, immersive, city-like, naturalistic virtual reality environment (‘NavCity’), paired with an accompanying NavCity Allocentric Representation Assessment (NARA), to quantify naturalistic navigation ability and effects of repeated environmental exposure on the formation of allocentric reference frames within a singular experimental session. Notably, the NavCity task provides an open-source, standardized, editable, accessible, virtual reality paradigm for assessing naturalistic navigation ability, and the accompanying NARA serves to promote standardization of measures quantifying allocentric knowledge recall. Our central hypothesis is that we will observe within-session improvement in navigation performance after repeated NavCity exposure, which will scale with stronger recall of allocentric representations measured by NARA. Results support this hypothesis and show that within-session NavCity improvements are associated with the assessment of formed allocentric representations tied to the navigated environment. Importantly, this study addresses the need to standardize and methodologically measure transformations of first-person, egocentric navigation experiences to third-person, allocentric knowledge using an open-source, naturalistic tool. Immediate next steps are to characterize effects of aging on NavCity and NARA performance to provide understanding of aging-related deficits in allocentric reference frame utilization in older adults.",

During the think-aloud study, participants tested the decision aid while verbalizing their thoughts. After the think-aloud sessions, we piloted the decision aid at the university, asking early users to complete a brief questionnaire. The think-aloud study showed positive user experiences, no major issues, and insights for refining the decision aid and guiding other decision aid developers. The pilot study participants reported no issues, using the decision aid to evaluate options post-decision and to consider disclosure.

          "abstract": "As societies transition towards a reduction of meat consumption and a shift to plant-based diets to address sustainability challenges, several studies highlight the importance of social norm interventions in promoting sustainable food choices. Nonetheless, syntheses of research on the effectiveness of such interventions are currently lacking, hampering our ability to inform and propose new research directions to increase sustainability in real-world contexts. In this paper, we review and evaluate the current body of evidence, focusing on studies targeting a reduction in animal-based food consumption and/or an increase in plant-based consumption, and specifically motivated as contributing to the climate change discourse. We searched five databases, theses repositories, and grey literature and contacted authors in the field to obtain manuscripts and pre-prints. Our search identified 23 articles including 34 separate studies meeting our eligibility criteria. Since 2017, we witnessed a rapid increase in research interest for trials exploring the effect of social norms to nudge individuals towards sustainable food choices. Overall, based on the results of this review, we conclude these interventions have had limited success and we identify opportunities for future research on this topic, such as identifying the most relevant referent group for various segments of the population.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental assumption about human behavior forming the backbone of trait theories is that, to some extent, individuals behave consistently across structurally comparable situations. However, especially for unethical behavior, the consistency assumption has been severely questioned, at least from the early 19th century onwards. We provide a strict test of the consistency assumption for a prominent instance of unethical behavior – dishonesty – in a large (N = 1,916) and demographically diverse sample. Dishonest behavior was measured three times – up to three years apart – using different variants of well-established, incentivized cheating paradigms. A key advantage of these paradigms is that lying is individually profitable but not self-incriminating. Besides varying the specific task at hand, we experimentally varied the nature of incentives (i.e., money vs. avoiding tedious work) as well as their magnitude across measurement occasions. The consistency of dishonest behavior was estimated using a newly developed statistical model. Results showed strong consistency of dishonest behavior across contexts in most cases. Furthermore, theoretically-relevant personality traits (i.e., Honesty-Humility and the Dark Factor) yielded meaningful relations both with dishonesty and indeed its consistency. Thus, contrary to long-standing assumptions, there is notable consistency in dishonest behavior that can be attributed to underlying dispositional factors. Overall, the current findings have important implications for the theoretical understanding of dishonest behavior by providing strong evidence for (dis)honesty as a trait as well as for practice (e.g., honesty interventions). Moreover, the newly developed statistical approach can serve future research across scientific fields.",

          "abstract": "Health goal message framing refers to ways information about favorable consequences of healthy behaviors and unfavorable consequences without engaging in healthy behaviors can be presented in influencing attitudes, intentions, and behaviors (Rothman et al., 2006). Some findings have been mixed and sometimes contradictory while hundreds of studies have been conducted since the previous large-scale meta-analysis on health message framing (Gallagher &amp; Updegraff, 2012). This project includes three-level meta-analyses for message framing studies that aim to encourage healthy attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, with 836 effect sizes, 307 studies and 273 reports from 23 countries. When comparing pleasure-framing (benefits and/or problems prevented through healthy behaviors) and pain-framing (benefits forgone and/or potential problems without engaging in healthy behaviors), we found inconclusive evidence of pleasure-framed advantage for health promotion and/or illness prevention and found support for very small pain-framed advantage (g = -0.09) for health detection. Furthermore, we found evidence for moderation of behavioral frequency, with a very small pleasure-framed advantage for frequently repeated behaviors. When comparing gain-framing (benefits through healthy behaviors) and loss-framing (detriments without healthy behaviors), we found substantial cultural differences, with loss-framing outperforming gain-framing for people from non-western, collectivistic, and survival-oriented regions (gs = -0.27 to -0.28). Findings showed inconclusive evidence for moderations of indulgence-restraint, power distance, and dialecticism. Implications and directions, including culturally-congruent health communication (Betsch et al., 2016), more analyses and research on real-world benefits, costs, and risks of message framing choices as well as more realistic effect size expectations for sample size determination, were discussed. We also called for more multi-regional studies, experiments that tease apart confounds, and studies on mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: message framing, health behavior, behavioral function, cultural moderation, meta-analysis",

          "authors": "João Tenório",
          "abstract": "This paper aims to analyze the meanings and feelings represented by semiotic elements available in the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho. The theoretical approach adopted is the Semiotic Cultural Psychology (SCP) in which considers human beings as meaning makers in the world through the mediation of signs. In this paper we consider signs from the Peirce perspective as the representation of objects in the real world and divided into symbols, indexes and icons. From SCP we considered how these signs can represent mediation by pleromatization and schematization in order to understand meanings and feelings represented by field-like signs and point-like signs. In the excerpt from this article, we selected the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho to understand how meanings and feelings are regulated through existing complexes of signs during the narrative. To achieve this, we cataloged the main semiotic elements of the episode, classifying them as point-like signs or field-like signs. Subsequently, we analyzed which of these signs were part of a semiotic hybrid complex (pleromatization/field-like signs/hyper-generalization) regulating feelings related to the narrative and which expressed constructed and shared meanings (schematization/point-like signs/generalization). In the results, we found that semiotic elements can be considered as narrative devices to involve the viewer in the story based on the intentionality of the author. In the Yu Yu Hakusho first episode, the intentionality is based in the presentation of the character Yusuke and the creation of feelings related to him. In this sense, in order to present who Yusuke is, point-like signs were identified representing some characteristic about him. In the second part of the episode, there was a predominance of field-like signs in order to create some feelings about Yusuke based on the empathy constructed in the first part of the narrative. Then, as related in the literature, mediations by schematization and pleromatization acted all the time in order to relate cognitive elements (meanings constructed about Yusuke) and effective elements (feelings to be felt for Yusuke).",

Additionally, the study examined the role that resilience variables–mindfulness and emotion regulation–play in the association between victimization timing and PTSS severity.\nMethod: Participants were 247 cisgender community women aged 21-30 recruited for a larger study on high-risk drinking and sexual behaviors. Victimization history was assessed using the Computer Assisted Maltreatment Inventory and Sexual Experiences Survey-Revised. PTSS severity was measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Emotion regulation and mindfulness were evaluated using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-36 and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire, respectively. Negative binomial regression models tested the hypotheses.\nResults: Analyses revealed significant differences in PTSS severity by victimization timing: CSA + ASA was associated with the greatest PTSS severity, followed by ASA-only, and CSA-only reporting the lowest severity. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were directly associated with reduced PTSS severity across all victimization profiles. \nConclusions: Revictimization was linked to the most severe PTSS, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. Mindfulness and emotion regulation may facilitate recovery by alleviating PTSS severity, regardless of victimization timing. Future interventions should prioritize enhancing psychological skills, like mindfulness and emotion regulation, to reduce distress for victim-survivors of sexual victimization.",

          "abstract": "Elicitation methods, such as asking people to produce the deciles of a distribution, are standard practices in policy or applied statistics. Similarly, much of cognitive science and psychology focuses on determining people's people's beliefs or latent traits through questionnaires or judgment tasks. However, these approaches often only capture a rough outline of what people know and are usually limited to point estimates of people's beliefs. Here, we present a novel experimental paradigm that allows us to access people's beliefs and how variable these beliefs are. Our task is based on an established random generation paradigm in which participants produce quantities from a particular domain as randomly as possible. We hypothesize that due to the minds' general-purpose mechanisms for probabilistic inferences, these random sequences represent the participants' underlying prior beliefs. We show that our method can infer participants' beliefs for a wide range of numeric quantities at comparable accuracy as an established elicitation method.\nMoreover, these inferred beliefs are consistent with individual participants' generalization and inference patterns in a subsequent conditional prediction task. We then extend our approach to non-numeric belief elicitation, highlighting how our method can go beyond numeric elicitation and provide insight into complex beliefs that are challenging to assess experimentally. Empirically, our results highlight that people know the rough shapes of environmental distributions, and these beliefs guide inference and generalization. Moreover, using our novel approach, we also show that people know the fine details of environmental distributions. Finally, our experimental results show that random generation paradigms can be a useful tool for cognitive scientists, psychologists, and applied statisticians.",

While past research had found a correlation between Hikikomori and internet addiction, the research was limited to a sample of college students in Japan. With cases of both Hikikomori and internet addiction being recognized across the globe, more research is required to investigate this correlation in non-Japanese countries. In the current study, we administered the Hikikomori Questionnaire and Young’s Internet Addiction Test to 437 US college students recruited through Prolific. We found a sizeable positive correlation between Hikikomori and internet addiction (r = .30). We also found that the correlation among the US college students in our sample did not significantly differ from the correlation among the Japanese college students in the prior study (r = .39). Although more research is required to further understand the relationship, the present results indicate that extreme social withdrawal could be a risk factor for internet addiction in the US (and vice versa).",

          "authors": "Xiaomei Li; Megan Wylie; Jessica P. Lougheed; Tom Hollenstein",
          "abstract": "Adolescents draw from a repertoire of strategies to regulate increasingly intense, complex, and changing emotions in their everyday lives. However, little research has systematically examined how much they use multiple strategies in a given emotional event (polyregulation) and how much they use different strategies across emotional events (flexibility), two well-known predictors of regulatory success among adults. Leveraging the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index to quantify the collective, multi-strategy modulation from one event to the next, we examined adolescent polyregulation flexibility and its two mechanisms: strategy switching (prioritizing certain strategies while decentralizing others) and effort scaling (engaging or disengaging multiple strategies together). We tested whether polyregulation flexibility was associated with emotional intensity, emotional complexity (multiple emotions simultaneously), polyregulation effort, and trait-level emotional mindset and awareness. We also tested whether polyregulation flexibility uniquely predicted regulatory success. Adolescents (N=117, ages 12-15, 55% girls) completed an ecological momentary assessment for 14 consecutive days (4 prompts per day) reporting on the intensity of four negative emotions, effort for six strategies for a focal emotion, and perceived regulatory success. Using multilevel modeling, both at the within- and between-person levels, adolescents showed greater polyregulation flexibility in response to more intense and complex emotions. Further, greater effort scaling (but not strategy switching) since the last emotional event uniquely predicted greater success at the current event after controlling for emotional intensity, complexity, and polyregulation effort. Findings support the dynamic nature of flexible strategy deployment among adolescents, highlighting the need to overcome more static approaches (e.g., counts, range) of capturing emotion regulation.",

Emotional eating involves the consumption of food in response to a series of negative emotions. Associated with both are emotional regulation difficulties. People can also be susceptible to overeating because of the hedonic nature of certain foods, such as those high in fat and sugar. We aimed to analyze the differences between increasing levels of binging in hedonic and emotional eating, and its relationship with emotional regulation, and body mass index (BMI). \nMethods 143 adult cis women (between 18 and 59 years old) completed the Binge Eating Scale, the Garaulet Emotional Eating Questionnaire, the Power of Food Scale, and the Emotional Regulation Difficulties Scale. \nResults Participants with higher levels of binging showed greater emotional dysregulation, levels of both emotional and hedonistic eating, and BMI. However, emotional dysregulation and BMI do not predict differences in the two types of feeding behavior. \nConclusions Results are discussed through different perspectives, such as responsiveness to a caloric food environment, an association with a restrictive eating style, an uncontrolled eating pattern associated with impulsivity, or weight bias that generates stress in people with larger body sizes. Interventions based on intuitive or conscious eating are proposed to address some of these problems.",

Whereas previous research indicates that self-awareness of ego-nonthreatening biases enhances self-regulation, the effects of self-awareness of ego-threatening biases remain underexplored. Preliminary findings suggest that awareness of ego-threatening biases related to rumination and may lead to maladaptive states. However, these findings await replication with standardized instruments. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. In Study 1 (N = 1609), we developed and validated the 12-item Self-Awareness of Ego-Threatening Biases Questionnaire (SAETBQ). Consistent with our hypotheses, self-awareness of ego-threatening biases (as measured by the SAETBQ) correlated with higher moral disengagement, lower self-diagnostic motive, and lower integrative self-knowledge, indicating a tendency towards ego deterioration, whereas self-awareness of ego-nonthreatening biases (as measured by the Metacognitive Self questionnaire) showed the opposite pattern of correlations, indicating a tendency towards beneficial self-regulation. In Study 2 (N = 681), Dark Triad traits correlated positively and Light Triad traits negatively with self-awareness of ego-threatening biases. These results underscore the complex role of self-awareness in managing cognitive biases.",

Fictional situations were created to spotlight either the recipient's experience (e.g., a person being tripped on the street) or the initiator experience (e.g., a person tripping another). Participants were presented with a series of vignettes describing moral transgressions and asked to judge as quickly as possible whether the emotional reactions of third parties depicted in different facial expressions were consistent with what would be expected regarding the misconduct. In two studies (N = 315) we tested the hypotheses that focusing on the initiator would stress their poor moral character and elicit distancing reactions typical of moral disgust, while focusing on the recipient would emphasize the harmful act and the recipient's resulting personal distress, aligning more closely with moral anger. The results indicate that directing participants' attention to the recipient resulted in a quicker and more frequent selection of angry expressions compared to disgust. However, a preference for disgust was primarily evident in scenarios depicting moral transgressions in the initiator-focus condition but not in the recipient-focus condition, only when compared to neutral affect.",

In the present study, we aim to explain variations in online learning engagement and online academic stress in terms of students’ epistemic beliefs and self-regulated learning skills. We hypothesize that epistemic beliefs indirectly influence online learning engagement and online academic stress through their effect on motivation and self-efficacy. The study involves 398 students in grades 10 and 11. Results from the path analysis suggest that students who believe that knowledge is evolving (development) and gets handed down by authority figures (source) are more likely to be self-efficacious in their learning and exhibit higher levels of both learning- and performance-goal orientations. Additionally, mastery-goal orientation, performance-goal orientation, and self-efficacy are found to positively predict online learning engagement. Specifically, the mastery-goal orientation and self-efficacy are negatively associated with academic stress, while the performance-goal orientation is positively associated with academic stress.",

          "abstract": "It is intensively debated whether Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) constitute appropriate models for human vision. Here, we investigated whether CNNs show a typical characteristic of human face perception, namely holistic processing. In Experiment 1, we compared unfamiliar face matching performance between a CNN trained on face recognition and N = 32 human participants for different types of face images: Normal faces (with intact holistic and local feature-based information), Mooney faces (with intact holistic and degraded local feature-based information), and scrambled faces (with intact local feature-based information and degraded holistic information). The CNN showed significantly larger performance decrements for both Mooney and scrambled faces than human participants. In Experiment 2, we trained three CNN architectures on face recognition, one with unrestricted field size and two with field sizes restricted to approximately 1/9 and 1/16 of the input image, respectively. Subsequently, we compared unfamiliar face matching performance between these CNNs and N = 36 human participants who viewed face images either in an unrestricted fashion or through a movable spotlight-like viewing aperture covering approximately  1/9 or 1/16 of the face images. While human face matching accuracy was substantially impaired by restricting the visual input with apertures, CNN performance was not affected by restriction of the receptive field size. These results suggest that (a) CNNs are able to achieve high face matching accuracy without using holistic information (b) the reliance of holistic information in CNNs depends on the specific optimisation conditions under which models were trained.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the role of semantic interpretability and syntactic legality on complex nonword recognition. A rating experiment tested the correlation between these two linguistic factors by asking participants to rate the interpretability of legal and illegal nonwords made up of stem-suffix combinations. Results showed that these two factors are highly correlated. In two further lexical decision experiments (unprimed lexical decision in Experiment 2 and masked primed lexical decision in Experiment 3), we carefully dissociated interpretability and legality by comparing four types of nonwords: high-interpretability syntactically legal, high-interpretability syntactically illegal, low-interpretability syntactically legal, and low-interpretability syntactically illegal nonwords. To test whether or not the activation of embedded stems was modulated by their morpho-semantic and morpho-syntactic context, all complex nonwords were compared against a matched non-stem control.  A significant effect of stem status was found in Experiments 2 and 3, providing evidence for the important role of embedded stems in complex nonword recognition. Moreover, a significant effect of interpretability was found only in the unprimed lexical decision (Experiment 2), but not in masked priming (Experiment 3), suggesting that semantics does not influence complex word recognition until participants have enough time to thoroughly process the nonword. No effect of syntactic legality was found in either experiment. These results highlight the independent roles of semantic interpretability and syntactic legality in visual nonword recognition, supporting an initial semantically blind stage in morphological parsing.",

          "abstract": "The intricate interplay between visual art, aesthetic appreciation, and human cognition has long captivated artists and scientists. One difficulty of this line of research is that artworks differ on many dimensions that influence aesthetic appreciation. While trying to keep the out-of-scope dimensions constant is a typical strategy, using a stimulus set with balanced dimensions avoids noise and bias. Although several visual art datasets exist, none have been specifically designed to control many dimensions simultaneously. In response to the need of a well-controlled and balanced stimulus set, the Leuven Orthogonalized Art Dataset (LOAD) controls and balances dimensions related to aesthetic appreciation, including style, content, emotional valence, and liking/beauty. Each artwork in the image set was first carefully selected to fit a balanced design, then annotated by 50 participants on measures of pleasure, fluency, interest, liking, emotional valence, and familiarity for further validation. This careful annotation process also aims to disentangle the often- ambiguous interrelations among several aesthetic appraisals such as pleasure, interest, and liking. By providing balanced designs across multiple dimensions, LOAD serves as a valuable and highly flexible tool for exploring the complexities of aesthetic appreciation.",

The present study explored this hypothesis by contrasting the effects of two conventional and two unconventional (sham) hypnotic inductions on subjective hypnotic experiences and electrophysiological correlates. \nIn a 2x2 balanced placebo design, all participants were exposed to four conditions: conventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, conventional induction labeled as “control”, unconventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, and unconventional induction labeled as “control”. EEG was recorded from 128 channels.\nConsistent with the predictions of expectancy theory, we found that one of the unconventional (sham) inductions, “white noise hypnosis”, evoked comparable subjective hypnosis depth to the conventional hypnotic inductions. Moreover, EEG correlates of conventional versus unconventional inductions did not substantially differ. Furthermore, we found that labeling a procedure as “hypnosis” resulted in greater hypnosis depth and greater baseline-to-hypnosis reductions in midline frontal alpha activity compared to procedures labeled “control”. However, contrary to the predictions of the expectancy theory, “embedded hypnosis”, another unconventional induction, evoked smaller hypnosis depth reports than the other three inductions. The change in midline frontal gamma power negatively correlated with hypnosis depth in both conventional and unconventional inductions. Conversely, correlations of frontal gamma power, occipital theta power, and frontoparietal connectivity in the alpha2 band with hypnotizability differed between conventional and unconventional induction trials.\nOverall, our results provide partial support for the expectancy theory of hypnosis. However, our findings should be considered exploratory. Confirmatory research is required to strengthen our confidence in these effects.",

          "abstract": "In the last 30 years, the Visual World Paradigm has rapidly become a dominant experimental paradigm for understanding real-time language processing.  Part of this derives from the rich visualizations of the millisecond-by-millisecond timecourse of language processing that it offers.  While the field has converged on strong statistical approaches for this in experimental paradigms, a great deal of recent work has sought to apply the Visual World Paradigm in individual differences paradigms to examine factors such as development and aging, multi-lingualism and various types of communicative and cognitive disorders.  However, sophisticated individual differences work must confront issues of collinearity and co-morbidity among predictor variable, and often seek to examine more than just a simple correlation with some portion of the timecourse of processing.  We argue that existing statistical and methodological approaches are unsuited to this.  Instead, we argue that analysis should start by developing a quantitative “profile” of processing that can be captured in a small number of variables.  These can then be used in more sophisticated regressions like hierarchical regression, commonality analysis and mediation analysis which can unpack shared and unique variance, and test multiple causal pathways.  We illustrate this with tutorials based on our own work on hearing loss, development and language disorders that illustrate how these approaches can provide greater insight into individual differences.",

Contemporary models of evaluation like the APE model (Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006) imply that spontaneous evaluations are a function of the evaluative implications of the stereotypic associations of a target object and the context in which it is encountered. In this manuscript, we examine the question whether these models can also inform the debate on the link between social categorization and spontaneous evaluations: Specifically, we ask whether the link between categorization and evaluation is moderated by the subset of associations that is implied by a specific context. In two studies, we assessed the extent of categorization in conditions of the Who Said What? -paradigm with very different contextual implications for Whites versus Blacks. This score was then correlated with the evaluative preference for Whites over Blacks in an Evaluative Decision Task. In contexts in which it is an asset or advantage to be Black, there was less anti-Black bias the more an individual categorized by race. The reverse was true in contexts that are likely to activate negative racial stereotypes.

This paper comprises two studies that assess these core components of executive function orthogonally and examine their correlation with ASD and ADHD traits in the general population. Both studies utilized a paradigm with two tasks, each assessing working memory and one type of inhibitory control concurrently: the modified Flanker task, which measured working memory and interference control, and the modified Spatial Conflict task, which measured working memory and response inhibition. The study aimed to explore the main effects of memory and inhibitory load in each task, investigate potential over-additive interactions between executive function components, and examine the correlations between autistic and ADHD traits and task performance. Each study involved 100 typically developing adult participants. In Study 1, results showed that reaction time in the Flanker task was significantly influenced by demands on both working memory and inhibitory control. In the Spatial Conflict task, reaction times were affected by congruency, with a potential role of memory load in incongruent trials. Study 2 introduced modifications that revealed effects on reaction time in the Spatial Conflict task due to both memory and congruency load. The Flanker task demonstrated memory effects in reaction time, but congruency effects were only evident under low memory conditions. No interactions between executive function components in an over-additive way were observed in either Study 1 or Study 2. Bayesian linear regression and correlation analyses found evidence against any meaningful correlations between the size of the congruency or memory effect for either dependent variable (accuracy or reaction time) and ASC or ADHD traits in both studies.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Mental health issues among international students are concerning. However, international students tend to underutilize and benefit less from traditional mental health services compared to their domestic counterparts. The current paper proposes digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) as a promising approach to bridge mental health inequities faced by international students. Methods: We explore the definition, types, and efficacy of DMHIs. We outline the unique promise of these interventions in reducing barriers to health service access encountered by international students. To illustrate these points, we discuss example studies of DMHIs for international students. Results: Recent studies have supported the potential benefits of DMHIs for improving international students’ psychological distress, well-being, and help-seeking outcomes. However, many scientific questions remain unsolved. Discussion: To optimize the potential of these interventions for international students, researchers should conduct well-powered randomized controlled trials, examine correlates of intervention use, design single-session interventions, co-develop interventions with the international student community, integrate interventions within the larger system, incorporate ecological momentary assessment and digital phenotyping, and leverage immersive and interactive digital technology.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Although Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) demonstrates clinical utility, its benefits and challenges for treatment-seeking individuals who engage in Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) are not well understood. This study evaluates self-reported benefits (i.e. increases in self-insight and self-efficacy) and challenges of EMA (i.e., beep disturbance, and negative emotional experiences) in this population.\nMethods:  Ninety-seven in-treatment patients with past-month NSSI completed baseline assessments which assessed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Following intake, they completed a 28-day EMA-protocol with six assessments each day. After this self-monitoring period,  a feedback survey was completed in which general and NSSI-specific increases in self-insight and self-efficacy, compliance, beep disturbance, and negative emotional experiences related to EMA were assessed. \nResults: Average EMA compliance was 72.14% (SD=20.47) and decreased linearly over time (β=-0.50, p&lt;.001). After using EMA, 32.98% reported increased general self-insight and 9.27% reported increased general self-efficacy. In contrast, 63.91% reported increased NSSI-specific self-insight and 41.24% reported improved NSSI-specific self-efficacy. Additionally, 21,62% experienced negative emotional experiences due to EMA. Higher levels of negative emotional experiences were significantly associated with lower compliance (r=-.297, p=.004), higher beep disturbance (r=.383, p&lt; .001), and lower general self-insight (r=-.286, p=.005).\nConclusion: EMA appears feasible and may promote NSSI-specific self-insight and self-efficacy for most patients.",

          "authors": "Bohan Fu; Alexandra Cook",
          "abstract": "Even when experiencing symptoms, people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) still often go to work, which aligns with the construct of presenteeism - attending work while ill. Existing evidence highlights the detrimental effects of presenteeism in acute conditions, but less is known about chronic conditions. Besides, leadership behavior is critical in follower presenteeism, as leaders’ health-oriented care towards followers (StaffCare) may impact followers’ decisions to work while managing MS symptoms. This study focuses on the reciprocal effects of MS symptoms and presenteeism by analyzing existing data from a 3-wave monthly online study carried out in 2020. Presenteeism remained stable at the monthly level, but we did not find reciprocal relationships between presenteeism and symptoms. StaffCare behavior did not buffer the hypothesized effects of quantitative demands and symptoms on presenteeism but was negatively related to presenteeism. In addition, we extracted three factors from MS symptoms, and further exploratory analyses show a quadratic relationship between presenteeism and symptoms. By highlighting the interplay between disease symptoms and presenteeism, the study extends presenteeism and health-oriented leadership literature to chronic conditions such as MS. It also provides practical insights for individuals, leaders, and organizations on the relation between disease and work.\nKeywords: Multiple Sclerosis (MS), presenteeism, symptoms, health-oriented leadership, quantitative demands",

          "authors": "Christin Scholz; Hang Yee Chan; Hanneke Hendriks; Eva van Reijmersdal",
          "abstract": "Objective: Within complex information environments, persuasive messages are often viewed in close proximity to other relevant and possibly contradictory content. While persuasion research focuses on optimizing individual message types (e.g. anti- or pro-alcohol messages), scarce knowledge about competition between message types hinders the prediction of message effects in real-world settings. We directly compared effects of competing message types to understand relative effects and underlying mechanisms. Methods: Across three studies, English-speaking convenience samples from online panels and our University’s student pool (N=468) viewed a large sample of alcohol-related messages (N=190) of different types (pro-, anti-, and\nnon-alcoholic messages from professional and peer sources). Using within-subject designs, we measured the relative impact of message types on alcohol craving and mechanisms driving these effects. Results: Pro-alcohol messages were more impactful than anti-alcohol messages, especially among frequent binge drinkers. Although emotional responses and familiarity with the alcohol-related content were relevant mechanisms for both pro- and anti-alcohol message effects, both mechanisms were more strongly coupled to craving in response to pro- (vs. anti-alcohol) messages. Conclusions: Accounting for a large variety of messages, our results suggest that restricting pro-alcohol content may be more effective in reducing consumption than producing anti-alcohol content within populations represented by our English-speaking convenience samples. The findings further raise specific concerns about the effectiveness of anti-alcohol messages that target familiarity and emotional processes, especially when viewed in direct competition with pro-alcohol information. Further research on the competition between related message types is crucial to support understanding and prediction of message effectiveness.\nSIGNIFICANCE: We examined how health promotion (professional anti-alcohol) messages perform relative to other relevant confirmatory (peer-produced anti-alcohol messages) and contradictory (professional/peer-produced pro-alcohol) information by comparing alcohol craving across message types. Understanding competition between message types will help improve predictions of message effects in modern, diverse information environments.",

          "authors": "Clara Moeller; Holly Maclean; Paul Hoffman",
          "abstract": "Producing coherent discourse requires us to regulate the content of our speech and avoid interference from discourse-irrelevant concepts that become active in semantic memory. The inhibitory deficit hypothesis proposes that coherence declines in later life are due to a reduced ability to inhibit these irrelevant ideas. However, existing evidence in support of this view is correlational. We performed an experimental test of the hypothesis by asking young (18-25) and older (70-90) participants to produce discourse on a range of topics while attending to two types of visual distractors: images of meaningful concepts and meaningless abstract patterns. The overall global coherence of responses was lower when participants were distracted (cf. no distraction) but this effect was not larger for meaningful distractors. Participants also spoke more slowly under distraction. These effects did not differ between age groups. Critically, however, in the meaningful distractor condition, responses diverged from the original topic more quickly than in the other conditions. This effect was only present in older participants. These results suggest two underlying effects at play. First, performing a concurrent task has a general effect on the speed and coherence of discourse, which in this study was age-invariant. Second, for older people, tasks that activate a series of irrelevant semantic representations have an additional cumulative effect on discourse content, causing it to deviate off topic more rapidly. Our results support the inhibitory deficit hypothesis and suggest that older people can improve their coherence by avoiding semantically-laden environmental distractors like TV or radio programmes.",

          "abstract": "Faces and bodies serve as important cues of physical attractiveness and reproductive fitness. Previous studies however indicate that there are sex-related differences in the visual processing of erotic stimuli. Here we measured eye movements from 43 male and 67 female subjects to investigate gaze patterns and sex differences during perception of dynamic sexual scenes (intercourse; Experiment 1) and static (nude and clothed men and women; Experiment 2) erotic stimuli. Dwell times were longest for faces in both experiments and faces were most likely to be looked at first. In the video experiment, male participants looked more at female chest, buttocks, and genital areas while female participants looked more at male faces. In the picture experiment faces received more fixations when stimuli were clothed, whereas fixations on chest and genital areas increased when the stimuli were nude. Our results show that i) sex differences during sexual perception are larger for static versus dynamic stimuli, ii) that faces are prioritized over sexual signals both while viewing dynamic sexual scenes and static images of humans, and iii) that visibility of sexual cues increases saliency of the sexually relevant body regions (genitals; chest). The overall preference for faces even when viewing sexual intercourse may reflect both the importance of facial characteristics in mate selection as well as the role of facial expressions in evaluating partner satisfaction while having sex.",

          "abstract": "Despite concerns over AI-generated misinformation, it is unclear how much people are impacted by such misinformation or how effective countermeasures are. This study examined whether the influence of AI-generated misinformation on people’s reasoning could be reduced by a pre-emptive, source-focused inoculation or a retroactive, content-focused debunking. In two experiments (N &gt; 1000), a misleading AI-generated article influenced people’s reasoning, regardless of its alleged source (human or AI). In both experiments, the inoculation reduced participants’ general trust in AI-generated information, but failed to significantly reduce the specific influence of the misleading article. Additional trust-boosting and disclaimer interventions used in Experiment 1 also had no impact. By contrast, a debunking used in Experiment 2 effectively reduced misinformation impact, although only a combination of inoculation and debunking eliminated misinformation influence entirely. Findings demonstrate that generative AI can be a persuasive source of misinformation, potentially requiring multiple countermeasures to negate its effects.",

          "abstract": "When individuals are unable to connect to the Internet, they experience anxiety, leading to the phenomenon known as nomophobia. To explain this phenomenon, it is essential to explore the relationship between humans and the Internet. This study investigates that relationship and explains nomophobia through the concept of Internet Extension of Virtual Capacity, which refers to how individuals extend the Internet as part of their own capabilities, unrestricted by specific devices. In Study 1, a Virtual Capability Extension Scale was developed, encompassing four dimensions: intrusiveness, accessibility, functionality, and autonomy. The scale demonstrated a high internal consistency with a Cronbach's α = 0.900, and validity indicators meeting research standards. Study 2 employed a behavioral experiment using a two-group (type of device) and three-phase (the presence or absence of the device) single-factor design to investigate the question \" Where does self-extension occur and what is its content?\". Results indicated: 1) The object of self-extension, and the primary cause of nomophobia, is the Internet rather than specific devices such as smartphones; 2) Internet Extension of Virtual Capacity serves as a precursor to nomophobia; 3) The Internet significantly extends individuals' sense of self-efficacy, more so than simply impacting their broader sense of self. Future research should further explore and apply the Internet Extension of Virtual Capacity, while also considering people's ambivalent attitudes of both love and hate towards Internet.",

A quantitative, cross-sectional design was employed using validated measures to assess leadership perceptions and their impact on students' psychological constructs and career goals. The findings revealed that optimism and hope significantly mediated the relationship between servant leadership and future expectations, highlighting their importance in shaping student ambitions. Life satisfaction, however, played a minimal role. This study underscores the potential of servant leadership in educational settings to foster a positive and future-oriented mindset among students. The limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the study, reliance on self-reported data, and a sample drawn from a specific cultural context. Future research should adopt longitudinal designs and consider diverse psychological constructs to expand the understanding of the influence of leadership.",

          "authors": "Saoirse Connor Desai; Jaimie Lee; Brett Hayes",
          "abstract": "Consensus among sources often signals a claim’s trustworthiness. However, when all sources simply echo information from a single origin, an “illusion of consensus” can arise, leading individuals to feel equally convinced by a dependent consensus (a single, repeatedly cited source) as by an independent consensus (corroborated information from multiple sources), unless their independence is made clear. This effect may occur because repetition can be perceived as a cue for credibility; thus, undermining source credibility might prompt individuals to discount a dependent consensus. We conducted three experiments to test whether whether explaining that source repetition resulted from biases in source selection can enable people to discount a dependent consensus. Participants engaged in a political polling task to assess confidence in claims supported by an independent consensus (news outlets citing different polling companies), a dependent consensus without explanation (news outlets citing the same polling company), or a dependent consensus accompanied by explanations that either boosted or undermined source credibility. While an independent consensus was more persuasive than dependent consensus, explanations alone did not affect claim confidence (Experiments 1-2a, 2b). In Experiment 3, when participants generated their own explanations for why source repetition might undermine reliability, confidence in claims supported by a dependent consensus was reduced. These findings suggest that social inference processes contribute to the illusion of consensus, with implications for interventions designed to mitigate the impact of misleading claims repeated in media.",

          "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is the prototypical nociplastic pain condition, characterized by widespread pain and issues with cognition, mood, and sleep. Currently, there are limited treatment options available that effectively treat FM symptoms. Psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) is an emerging combined drug-therapy intervention, but no studies to-date have investigated PAT for FM. Here, we report findings from an open-label, proof-of-concept trial of PAT for FM (N=5; NCT05128162). In conjunction with psychotherapy (two preparatory, four integration sessions), participants received two doses of oral psilocybin (15mg and 25mg) delivered two weeks apart. Regarding safety (primary outcome), there were transient elevations of blood pressure or heart rate during dosing which normalized by the end of treatment, with no serious adverse events. Four of five participants reported transient headaches following dosing. Compared to baseline, participants reported clinically meaningful improvements in the following secondary outcomes one month following their second psilocybin dose (reported as Cohen’s d): pain severity (d=-2.1, 95% CI[-3.7 to -0.49]), pain interference (d=-1.8, 95% CI [-3.27 to -0.24]), and sleep disturbance (d=-2.5, 95% CI [-4.21 to -0.75]). Using the Patient Global Impression of Change, one participant reported their symptoms “very much improved,” two reported “much improved,” and two reported “minimally improved.” Compared to baseline, there were improvements in the following exploratory outcomes after the intervention: FM symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue. This small open-label trial preliminarily supports that PAT is well-tolerated by people with FM, establishing a basis for larger randomized controlled trials.",

          "abstract": "The current child and adolescent mental health crisis necessitates both empirical and theoretical innovation. This review presents a new framework conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC) - formulated from a transdiagnostic preventative perspective. The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours, including emotional awareness and regulation of distraction, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with the intertwined activity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to activity in the theory of mind, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

The goal of the present study was to investigate temporal relationships between the intensity/frequency (I/F) of use and impairment related to alcohol and substance use and SI in a longitudinal BSD cohort.\n\nMethods: Participants with BDI (n=565), BDII (n=162), and BD NOS (n=61) were included (median enrollment=72 months). Alcohol and substance use were measured using a modified version of the AUDIT administered every 6 months. SI was measured every 2 months using item 9 from the PHQ-9. Linear mixed effects models tested concurrent associations and Dynamic Structural Equation Models tested prospective associations between alcohol and substance use I/F and impairment with SI. \n\nResults: Cocaine I/F and alcohol and substance use impairment were concurrently associated with SI. When a person had more frequent and intense cannabis use compared to average, they had higher SI at the next timepoint. When individuals experienced more alcohol and substance use impairment than average, they had higher SI at the next timepoint. \n\nConclusions: Both alcohol and substance use appear to increase SI for those with BSDs, though in different ways.",

To optimize its reach and fit with StrongMinds’ service delivery model, the SSC was delivered by trained lay providers in both individual and group-based formats. Within two months (September-October 2023), the SSC was delivered to 200 Ugandan adults with elevated depression symptoms (ages 16-86; 73% female) upon initial outreach for StrongMinds’ group psychotherapy services. SSC clients reported significant improvements in hopelessness and depression symptoms at 2-week (ds = -0.73, -1.12) and 1-month follow-ups (ds = -0.96, -1.44), while waiting for group psychotherapy. SSC clients reported high SSC\nsatisfaction (M = 4.47/5), and intervention effects did not significantly differ by delivery format (i.e., individual vs. group format).

This systematic literature review identifies and narratively synthesizes longitudinal studies of risk and protective factors for loneliness in children and adolescents aged below 25 years. A systematic literature search was conducted in October 2023 using PsycINFO and MEDLINE, resulting in k = 398 articles, with k = 105 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. The examined factors included demographic (e.g., gender), socio-economic (e.g., income sufficiency), social (e.g., peer acceptance), mental health (e.g., depression), physical health (e.g., disabilities), health behavior (e.g., sport participation), and psychological factors (e.g., shyness). Additionally, adverse childhood experiences (e.g., child maltreatment) and environmental factors (e.g., neighborhood characteristics) were investigated. Despite the wide range of potential risk and protective factors examined, relatively few studies provided strong evidence for a prospective association with loneliness. Risk factors that were consistently identified across multiple longitudinal studies included low peer acceptance and peer victimization, depression, social anxiety, internalizing symptoms, low self-esteem, shyness, and neuroticism. Additional replication is required to evaluate factors that have shown significant associations with loneliness in only a limited number of longitudinal studies (e.g., aggression).",

          "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has long been associated with economic and social decision-making in neuroimaging studies. Several debates question whether different ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) regions have specific functions or whether there is a gradient supporting social and non-social cognition. Here, we tested an unusually large sample of rare participants with focal damage to mPFC (N = 33), individuals with lesions elsewhere (N = 17), and healthy controls (N = 71) (total N = 121). Participants completed a temporal discounting task to estimate their baseline discounting preferences before learning the preferences of two other people, one who was more temporally impulsive and one more patient. We used Bayesian computational models to estimate baseline discounting and susceptibility to social influence after learning others’ economic preferences. mPFC damage increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls and increased overall susceptibility to social influence compared to those with lesions elsewhere. Importantly, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) of computational parameters showed that this heightened susceptibility to social influence was attributed specifically to damage to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, area 9). In contrast, lesions in the vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum were associated with a preference for seeking more immediate rewards. We show that the dmPFC is causally implicated in susceptibility to social influence, with distinct ventral portions of mPFC involved in temporal discounting.",

          "abstract": "Time series are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing us to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. Much of the current modelling work focuses on variations of vector autoregressive (VAR) models, in which variables are predicted by themselves and other variables at previous time points. An alternative to these models are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which model time series with a process that switches between a number of latent states, each associated with a different response distribution. Despite the fact that HMMs are often both theoretically interesting and can provide a better model fit for many time series, HMMs have rarely been used to model psychological time series. The reason for this has been the lack of software to fit HMMs in a multilevel setting, which is required both to make estimation feasible in a realistic applied setting, and to quantify and account for heterogeneity between subjects. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing multilevel HMMs and their estimation in a Bayesian setting; we evaluate with numerical experiments how well these models can be estimated in settings corresponding to empirical research using the R package mHMMbayes; and we provide a fully reproducible tutorial that guides the reader through all steps of model selection, model checking, and interpretation using an openly available dataset on emotion dynamics. Finally, we discuss the potential positive impact of adding multilevel HMMs to the time series modelling toolbox and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "authors": "Manda Fischer; Morris Moscovitch; Claude Alain",
          "abstract": "How does memory influence auditory perception, and what are the underlying mechanisms that drive these interactions? Most empirical investigations on the neural correlates of memory-guided perception have used static visual tasks creating a bias in the literature that contrasts with recent research highlighting the dynamic nature of memory retrieval. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to track the retrieval of auditory associative memories in a cue-target paradigm. Participants (N=64) listened to real-world soundscapes (cue) that were either predictive of an upcoming target tone or nonpredictive. Three key results emerged: First, targets were detected faster when embedded in predictive than in nonpredictive soundscapes (memory-guided perceptual benefit). Second, changes in theta and alpha power differentiated soundscape contexts that were predictive from nonpredictive contexts at two distinct temporal intervals from cue onset (early - 950 ms peak for theta and alpha, and late - 1650 ms peak for alpha only). Third, early theta activity in the left anterior temporal lobe was correlated with memory-guided perceptual benefits. Together, these findings underscore the role of distinct neural processes at different time points during cued retrieval.

          "abstract": "Meta-analytic systematic reviews are crucial for advancing research and practice in Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology (CCAP). Despite their importance, there has been no systematic investigation into transparency- and quality-related aspects of these reviews in leading CCAP journals. This study protocol (https://osf.io/qhrau/) proposes a meta-review to assess the transparency, methodological quality, and statistical consistency of recent meta-analytic systematic reviews (2022-2024) published in leading journals from CCAP, aiming to improve future practices in the field. We will include meta-analytic systematic reviews from seven leading journals publishing CCAP-related content between 2022–2024 (estimated sample size based on piloting = 60). Eligible systematic reviews need to have conducted a frequentist meta-analysis, define eligible populations as children or adolescents between 0–20 years (ideally based on primary study sample mean), may include a clinical psychological or psychotherapeutic intervention, and need to focus on clinical psychological outcomes (no comparators defined). We will search Web of Science (Core Collection) by combining journal names and systematic review-related keywords. Eligible meta-analytic systematic reviews will be assessed for transparency (PRISMA-adaptation; newly developed set of items for CCAP-related content), methodological quality (AMSTAR 2), and statistical consistency (statcheck). Descriptive analyses will include overall and domain-based scores, as well as exploratory analyses assessing associations with transparency-promoting factors on review and journal level. This meta-review can potentially shed light on and enhance the transparency, quality, and statistical consistency within meta-analytic systematic reviews from the field of CCAP. In doing so, it may provide guidance for researchers, reviewers, and editors, while laying the groundwork for future, large-scaled meta-studies in this field.",

          "abstract": "Mental health disorders are highly heterogeneous, presenting diverse symptoms, risk factors,\nand treatment responses. Identifying distinct subgroups within these disorders is essential for\ndeveloping personalized treatment strategies, improving therapeutic outcomes, and\noptimizing resource allocation. This systematic review explores how cluster analysis has been\napplied in mental health research to categorize subgroups across various psychiatric and\npsychological populations, evaluating its implications for personalized care and addressing\nkey methodological challenges. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO,\nScopus, and Web of Science (October 2021 to October 2024) yielded 31 studies that used\ncluster analysis to identify subgroups within disorders such as depression, PTSD, anxiety,\nschizophrenia, BPD, ADHD, and OCD. In alignment with the study’s objectives, data\nextraction focused on clustering methodologies, subgroup characteristics, and the clinical\nimplications for treatment personalization. Studies employed a range of clustering techniques,\nincluding K-means, hierarchical clustering, latent class analysis, Gaussian mixture models,\nand DBSCAN, which effectively identified clinically meaningful subgroups characterized by\nunique symptom profiles, biological markers, and treatment responses. For instance,\nmelancholic, atypical, and anxious subtypes in depression were identified, each requiring\ntailored therapeutic approaches. Similarly, biomarker-based subgroups in generalized anxiety\ndisorder emphasized the potential for targeted interventions. This review affirms that cluster\nanalysis is a valuable tool in precision psychiatry, offering insights into disorder\nheterogeneity that support the development of individualized treatment plans and improve\npatient outcomes.\nKeywords: Cluster analysis, mental health, subgroup identification, personalized care,\nsystematic review, precision psychiatry",

The wide range of genetically related species exhibiting such complex behaviour allows for hypotheses regarding its evolution and the cognitive abilities of their common ancestor. Although there's much debate on the precise definition of tool use, most experts agree it involves using a manipulable object to change another object's physical characteristics through mechanical interactions1. This current report details an event where a house crow (Corvus splendens) and a Sunda crow (Corvus enca) entered our research laboratory and spontaneously solved unattended tool-use tasks. House crows have previously been reported to use tools in captivity2, but this is the first documentation of Sunda crows using tools. We first describe the instance of tool use before briefly exploring what this event suggests about the potential evolution of tool use in this cognitively advanced family of birds.",

          "abstract": "Background. Altered temporal experience lies at the core of various psychiatric conditions, including Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Mainstream research in psychopathology tends to explore BPD with scrutiny while neglecting other personality disorders (PD). At the same time, the dimensional approach to PD proposes looking through the disorders' subtypes and tracing lived experience-based commonalities. This study is the first to explore the temporality of PD by investigating the relationship between symptom severity and lived time and combining objectified measures of time perception with phenomenological interpretation. \nMethods. 63 participants of various educational backgrounds, with personality disorders (36,5% male), following ICD-10 coding diagnosed with paranoid (3.2%), borderline (41,3%), narcissistic (33,3%), avoidant (4,8%), dependent (1,6%) and unspecified (15,9%) personality disorder. Levels of personality functioning and intensity of maladaptive trait domains were controlled with Level of Personality Functioning – Brief Scale 2.0 and Personality Inventory for ICD-11, respectively, resulting in the overall sample classification as comprising 9 subclinical, 13 mild, 20 moderate, 16 severe, and 5 extremely severe conditions. Polish Short Version of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (PS-ZTPI) and Cottle’s Circles Test (CT) were used to assess the temporal experience. \nResults. In comparison to healthy individuals, those with PD are more oriented toward past negative (4.01 vs. 2.98) and less toward past positive (2.31 vs. 7.71) and future (3.04 vs. 3.47), as measured with PS-ZTPI, their pre-reflective temporal experience as measured with CT is dominated either by the past or the future, while the present remains marginalized. BPD distinctiveness among other PD lies in higher orientation towards hedonistic present and lower orientation toward the future. While the general temporal profile of PD is independent of age and duration of hospitalization, it is related to the severity of the condition. The more severe the impairments in self-functioning, the higher the negative past perspective and pre-reflective past dominance, and the lower the positive and future perspective. The results of this study highlight temporality as an essential aspect of lived experience in PD. Lived time interplays with the level of self-disturbance and, as such, may be conceptualized phenomenologically as comprising the core of PD.",

          "abstract": "This paper synthesizes research on temporal experience in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from a phenomenologically grounded perspective. It advocates for a closer integration of phenomenology with empirical research results, with the specific goal of bridging the gap between theoretical and evidence-based understanding of BPD temporality. Utilizing a variant of indirect phenomenology, the paper adopts phenomenological insights into temporality to integrate the existing literature from cognitive sciences, chronobiology, and psychoanalysis, which provides qualitative, quantitative, and theoretical inputs. The findings reveal a coherent picture of BPD temporality characterized by fragmentation and discontinuity. Past experience is dense yet disorganized and recreated in the presence of present affective stimuli. The present absorbs one in an immediate, immersive manner. The future is perceived as blurred and disowned, with its horizon being truncated. This contributes to the feeling of being stuck and disoriented within one's temporal landscape. One lives in disturbing cycles between a negativity-biased past and a narrow present, which hinders the process of self development.",

          "abstract": "Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in China, yet access to evidence-based treatments remains limited. Written Exposure Therapy (WET) offers a brief intervention option but shows high dropout rates among Chinese patients and a need for culturally informed adaptations. Guided Written Exposure (GWE) builds on WET by integrating elements from Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) and specialized components tailored for Chinese patients to enhance trauma processing and treatment engagement. This study presents the protocol for a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of GWE in reducing PTSD symptoms in Chinese patients. Methods: Ninety adults aged 18–65 with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD will be randomly assigned to either GWE or minimal contact control (MCC) in a 2:1 ratio. GWE includes 5–8 online sessions over three weeks, incorporating enhanced psychoeducation, increased session frequency, and structured guidance on emotional expression to improve treatment acceptance. Primary outcomes are clinician-rated and self-reported PTSD severity, with secondary outcomes including depression and insomnia. All participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up assessments, with the GWE group undergoing additional follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. Group differences over time will be analyzed using multilevel modeling. Discussion: This study evaluates GWE's effectiveness as a culturally adapted PTSD treatment for Chinese patients, expanding the evidence base for PTSD therapies in diverse populations. By addressing barriers to treatment engagement, GWE may serve as a scalable and acceptable intervention for PTSD in China, offering insights for adapting exposure therapies cross-culturally.",

          "abstract": "Analysis of longitudinal data often relies on models which can be prone to statistical artifacts. We have previously shown that several published prospective associations can be explained by a combination of a general association between constructs, imperfect measurement reliability, and regression to the mean. Here, we formalize our analysis of this type of statistical artifact and introduce the Spurious Prospective Associations Model (SPAM). We show that the SPAM performs better than adjusted cross-lagged effects models to explain several observed prospective associations, including a new example involving loneliness and social anxiety, without assuming any true increasing or decreasing effects between constructs over time. Moreover, unlike the models we challenge, the SPAM is consistent with seemingly paradoxical findings indicating simultaneous increasing and decreasing effects between constructs. We conclude that the SPAM agrees well with observed data and is better supported than competing adjusted cross-lagged effects models in the cases investigated here.",

However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory. This model is the foundation of brain-inspired AI.",

          "abstract": "Shame appears to be part of human nature, yet it varies across time and between cultures. While differences in social norms or attributional styles are often cited as driving forces behind variation in shame, these approaches struggle to explain cross-cultural regularities in shame and the tight alignment between the features of the shame system and the challenges it addresses. In this chapter, we characterize shame from an adaptationist perspective—viewing this emotion as an evolved adaptation shaped by natural selection. We argue that despite its diversity of cultural expressions, shame functions to mitigate the actual or potential costs of being devalued by others. This framework can account for both cross-cultural similarities and differences in how shame is felt, expressed, and regulated. What may appear as culturally unique expressions of shame can be understood as variations on a universal theme: a finely tuned system evolved to manage the adverse consequences of devaluation. This approach reveals that even cultural differences in shame stem from a common adaptive logic.",

Contrary to hypotheses, average anxiety severity and strength of implicit/explicit self-as-anxious associations did not spike at the start of the pandemic, and rates of change did not significantly differ by age from 2011-2020, except for explicit, non-relative self-as-anxious ratings. Instead, anxiety mostly remained stable, with emerging adults exhibiting consistently higher anxiety symptom severity and stronger implicit/explicit self-as-anxious associations than adults age 26+.",

To evaluate the efficacy of treatments, reliable pre- and post-treatment assessments are needed. Behavioral avoidance tests (BATs), where one is asked to approach a spider, are commonly used as such measures. With the increasing popularity of computerized interventions, there is a demand for quick assessments for fear of spiders, that can be completed using computers or smartphones. Here, we tested the validity of a novel computerized BAT (cBAT) that we introduced in our previous work. In this cBAT, participants unblurred three images of spiders up until a point where they still felt comfortable viewing them. We expected that the cBAT would be moderately to strongly correlated with established measures for fear of spiders. Our analysis revealed that the cBAT showed moderate convergent and concurrent validity through correlations with self-report questionnaires indicating spider fear, and with a real-life BAT, respectively. However, the latter was no longer observed in a follow-up. While the cBAT facilitates ease of application and has a quick, straightforward participant task, we conclude that the cBAT is a limited measure for fear of spiders and might not fully capture the complexity of spider-related avoidance behavior compared to tasks that simulate real-life scenarios more closely. We propose the development of a refined cBAT that maintains an easily applicable participant task.",

Novice (n = 8), intermediate (n = 8), or expert (n = 8) exercisers (based on self-reported habit strength) were recruited via purposive sampling to partake in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were analyzed with deductive content analysis and inductive thematic analysis. A total of 96 self-enactable techniques were identified and 45 were considered as frequently reported in at least one of the experience groups. Techniques were further grouped to information seeking, support, acceptance and overcoming initiation inertia, restructuring the environment, and personal growth. Two themes emerged: 1) using different techniques, 2) using techniques differently. Current findings indicate that people with different levels of experience and reported habit strength toward physical activity may require different approaches from physical activity habit interventions, which requires tailoring. Within-persons longitudinal studies using validated measures of technique use are needed to improve scientific understanding of habit formation processes.",

          "abstract": "Achieving far transfer, the application of learned skills to new and diverse contexts, has posed a persistent challenge in cognitive training, where gains often remain task-specific. The Strategy-Capacity Training Method addresses this limitation by integrating automatised core cognitive processes—such as working memory, attention control, and inhibition - with flexible, domain-general meta-strategies within the Successor Representation (SR) framework. This approach automates foundational cognitive skills to reduce cognitive load, creating a dynamic yet stable basis for adaptive strategy use across varying contexts. By embedding meta-strategies like decision trees, cost-benefit analysis, and causal reasoning into the SR's predictive coding framework, the method promotes cognitive flexibility, adaptive problem-solving, and efficient resource allocation. This training system exemplifies a hybrid of model-free and model-based learning, linking procedural efficiency with flexible strategic reasoning. Continuous feedback, supported by dopaminergic signalling (Reward Prediction Errors and Epistemic Prediction Errors), ensures adaptable refinement of automatised skills, facilitating seamless strategy transfer. This systematic alignment of core cognitive processes with meta-strategy execution enables far transfer, optimising general cognitive benefits and adaptability across tasks.",

Using four waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study (N = 11,390) spanning 12 years, we investigated the reciprocal associations between sense of purpose and multiple objective and subjective markers of health (e.g., self-reported health; grip strength). Across the 12 years, better health was associated with higher levels of purpose for all investigated health markers. Cross-lagged panel models implied reciprocal associations for six of the 11 health markers. When looking at within-person associations (i.e., random intercept cross-lagged models), purpose emerged as a stronger predictor of later health than the other way around, with purpose changes predicting subsequent changes in five health markers while changes in only two health markers predicted later changes in purpose. Taken together, these findings further support the notion that sense of purpose has protective effects  against health decline in older age. We discuss the findings in the context of lifespan theory and emphasize the potential benefit of considering sense of purpose as a potential target for public health interventions.",

          "authors": "Zheng Huang; Silvia Seghezzi; Patrick Haggard",
          "abstract": "Generating a voluntary action typically involves some experience of conscious intention. Prospective theories propose that conscious intention is a readout of action preparation processes, while retrospective theories view conscious intention as an inference retro-inserted into narratives of one’s own behaviour. Studying conscious intention experimentally is difficult, because (a) eliciting voluntary actions in laboratory settings is problematic, and (b) existing measures of conscious intention using post-action reports could involve post hoc biases. We developed touch-typing versions of a verbal fluency task to elicit voluntary actions to address (a), and then interrupted participants quasi-randomly, asking “Were you about to type your next word?”, to address (b). Across two experiments with 51 participants, we found conscious intention emerged at 1079 ms (SD=1366 ms) and 1258 ms (SD=749 ms) before the estimated time of upcoming action. EEG results showed more reduction of beta-band oscillations and a greater readiness-potential-like deflection prior to probes that elicited reports of conscious intention, compared to probes that did not. Our results offer novel support for prospective theories of conscious intention, and may partly address methodological difficulties of previous studies.",

Although animals can use that contingency to maximize reward, their performance is much less flexible than the graduated judgments that have been reported in the human literature. Here, we report three experiments in which monkeys wagered a small, medium, or large number of tokens on the accuracy of their performance (retrospective metacognition), or anticipated performance (prospective metacognition), on each trial of a matching-to-sample task. Subjects’ wagers tended to maximize reward and minimize risk. They were also influenced by the number of tokens needed to earn a reward on each trial. Alternative cues such as reaction time and test difficulty could not account for our results which show, for the first time, that monkeys can make graduated and strategic metacognitive judgments.",

          "abstract": "Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition, significantly affecting movement and coordination ability. Whilst prior work has shown that those with DCD face challenges in motor mental imagery, links between general mental visual imagery skills and movement ability have yet to be identified. We therefore tested the prevalence of aphantasia (i.e., a lack of mental imagery), and general mental imagery skills, in adults with probable DCD (pDCD) using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ). We found 20% of pDCD participants reported comorbid aphantasia, in comparison to 2-6% found in the general population. Strikingly, 100% of pDCD participants meeting criteria for aphantasia had co-occurring developmental prosopagnosia and/or autism, suggesting a strong link between these conditions. Movement difficulties were associated with weaker mental imagery, both in the social and non-social domains. Despite this, single case analyses revealed dissociations between DCD symptoms and mental imagery abilities, i.e., some with pDCD can exhibit hyperphantasia, that is, exceptional mental imagery skills. Given the elevated prevalence of aphantasia in pDCD, and the utilisation of mental imagery related treatments to support this group, we highlight some essential considerations for professionals working with those with DCD in mental health, occupational therapy, and education.",

However, the exact nature of this prioritization remains unclear. The target location task employed in the experiments allows interpretation in terms of spatial attention and response-related processes; the target discrimination task – in contrast – allows unambiguous interpretation of effects in terms of spatial attention. In the present experiment, we replicated Vogt et al.’s procedure while varying the task in a between-participants design. We replicated Vogt et al.’s results in the location task and found a corresponding – albeit significantly smaller – effect in the discrimination task. Stimuli associated with current goals were thus prioritized with respect to spatial attention. However, the reduced effect size in the discrimination task suggests that in the original experiments, response-related processes were at play in addition to attentional processes.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This review will map existing literature to identify and describe the extent to which Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles of engagement, representation, and expression are applied to the design, delivery, and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs in Australia. Introduction: UDL is an education framework that aims to create inclusive learning environments for students with diverse needs. Approximately 25% of Australian students are likely to live with language, literacy, and/or learning differences that place them at elevated risk of mental health problems. Many school-based mental health programs exist with the shared aim of promoting positive outcomes for students.  Early prevention and mental health promotion efforts that are inclusive to students with language and/or learning differences are critically important. However, there has been no previous exploration of the extent to which UDL has been applied to school-based mental health programs. This review aims to identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in existing Australian school-based mental health programs. Eligibility criteria: This review will consider studies that report the development and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs within an Australian education context. This review will exclude non-English studies, reviews, books, and theoretical or opinion pieces. Methods: This review will be informed by the JBI guidelines for scoping reviews and will be conducted between October and December 2024. Five databases will be searched (PsycInfo, Medline, Informit, Scopus, and ERIC) and two reviewers will independently screen all identified studies against inclusion criteria by title, abstract, and full text review. Conflicts will be resolved by consensus. Results: Two independent reviewers will extract relevant data from the selected studies and results will be presented numerically and narratively.  The review will identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in descriptions of the design, delivery, and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs in Australia. Synthesis and interpretation of included studies will be framed within the three principles of UDL. The review will outline key findings of the included papers, gaps in the literature, and salient directions for future research. Conclusion: The outcomes of this review will be disseminated via publication and plain language summaries. The outcomes may also inform conference presentations relevant to inclusive education, mental health, and child language and learning differences.",

          "authors": "Kentaro Katahira",
          "abstract": "Cognitive and computational modeling has been used as a method to understand the processes underlying behavior in humans and other animals. A common approach in this field involves the use of theoretically constructed cognitive models, such as reinforcement learning models. However, human and animal decision-making often deviates from the predictions of these theoretical models. To capture characteristics that these cognitive models fail to account for, artificial neural network (ANN) models have recently gained attention. One of the roles of ANNs in cognitive and computational modeling is to provide a (upper) benchmark of predictive accuracy for cognitive models, helping ensure that no important factors are missing in theoretical models. For modeling choice behavior involving reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a type of ANN, have been frequently used. RNNs are able to capture how the choice probability changes depending on past experience. In this work, we demonstrate that RNNs can improve future choice predictions by capturing individual differences on the basis of past behavior, even when a common single model is fit to the entire population. We term this property of the RNN the individual difference tracking (IDT) property. While the IDT property might be useful for prediction, it may introduce excessive flexibility when providing an upper bound on the predictive accuracy. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate the properties of RNNs and discuss their implications and issues for further consideration.",

          "abstract": "Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent phenomenon, marked by delusions and hallucinations, along with other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation, depression, anxiety, and apathy. These neuropsychiatric symptoms, also known as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), affect up to 97% of Alzheimer's patients. The presence of psychosis in AD significantly impacts patients' daily lives and places a considerable burden on caregivers. The development of AD-related psychosis (ADP) is influenced by a range of factors, including genetic predispositions and life-acquired factors. AD affects cognitive function and various brain regions, resulting in widespread brain atrophy. In addition to its neurological impact, AD can induce pathological physiological changes that serve as biomarkers for ADP. Research efforts have focused on developing pharmacological treatments for psychosis in AD, aiming to minimize side effects. Brexpiprazole has emerged as a promising medication for ADP, alongside other antipsychotics. Treatment approaches for ADP extend beyond pharmacology, incorporating methods such as sensory stimulation and digital therapeutics. This review will explore the characteristics of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, the pathological underpinnings of ADP, and the current therapeutic landscape, highlighting emerging opportunities for managing this challenging condition.",

In the context of psychiatric disorders, the consequences of affect-based impulsivity can be dire, including suicidal behavior and harmful substance use. Here, we articulate a decision neuroscience account of affect-based impulsivity. Recasting this phenomenon in terms of Pavlovian and goal-directed decision systems, we consider how negative affect influences whether to act, what actions to consider, which action to select, and how vigorously to engage in a selected action. Further, we describe the neural and neuroendocrine targets of these computations. Specifically, we propose that modulation of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids during negative affective states enhances the pursuit of rewards by reducing goal-directed computations and increasing appetitive Pavlovian computations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Frequent out-of-home food sector (OOHFS) use is associated with poor dietary intake and obesity. There are limited real-world studies on pricing interventions to encourage healthy eating in the OOHFS. We performed a pilot study to collect preliminary trial data on the potential impact of a price reduction intervention on healthier menu items on purchasing and consumption of kilocalories (kcal) in a full-serviced restaurant among people from both lower and higher socioeconomic position (SEP).  \n\nMethods: The main trial design was a pre vs. post price reduction comparison (within-subjects), where participants (adults aged ≥18 years) received a control menu with standard pricing at visit 1 and a menu with price manipulations (30% reduction for healthy items) at visit 2. A sub-study was conducted with a comparison sample to estimate potential pre-post changes to outcome variables in the absence of a pricing intervention. Linear mixed models assessed pre-post changes in kcal purchased and kcal consumed.\n\nResults: In total, 114 participants were recruited; 92 were randomised to the main study and 22 to the comparison sub-study. Of those participating in the main study, 78 completed and 14 were lost to follow-up. There were no participants lost to follow-up in the comparison study. Of the completers, 46 participants were considered higher SEP (i.e. bachelor’s degree or higher) and 32 participants were lower SEP (i.e. some college or associate degree or lower). Kcal purchased and consumed decreased from visit 1 to visit 2; however, this reduction was only statistically significant for total kcal consumed (regression coefficient: -98.0 (95% CI -181.9, -14.2), p=0.02). There were no notable intervention effect differences between higher and lower SEP participants. In the comparison study, kcal purchased and consumed was also lower at visit 2 compared to visit 1, although this should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.\n\nConclusion: A price reduction intervention on lower energy menu items is potentially effective in encouraging healthier eating in a restaurant setting. Larger studies with inclusion of a control group (e.g., randomised controlled trials) are now needed to confirm intervention effects and whether they are equitable across different socioeconomic groups.",

          "abstract": "Gratitude interventions are known to increase psychological wellbeing. However, it has also been suggested that not everyone experiences equivalent benefits of engaging with gratitude activities, and there have been calls to better understand the moderators of such effects. In Study 1, we explored the effects of writing a gratitude letter, relative to a neutral letter, on changes in positive and negative affect, and observed that the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect was exacerbated in participants with elevated life satisfaction. Study 2 sought to replicate the findings of Study 1 whilst minimising demand characteristics, but failed to observe the moderating effect of life satisfaction. In Study 3, we sought to investigate whether these mixed findings could be explained by demand characteristics. We observed that priming participants with information about the benefits of expressing gratitude ameliorated the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect, but life satisfaction did not moderate this priming effect. On the basis of the findings from these three studies, we conclude that life satisfaction does not moderate the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect, but further work should be undertaken to better understand the conditions under which gratitude writing is most effective. Further, we suggest that demand characteristics are an important consideration for both researchers and interventionists delivering gratitude interventions.",

During these developmental years, adolescents encounter numerous difficulties, and art therapy is particularly appealing and accessible to them because it uses diverse materials and mediums. Traditional art supplies and structured activities are commonly employed and have proven effective in therapeutic settings. Both long-term and short-term therapy are frequently applied to address complex issues such as PTSD, dissociation, and deep-rooted emotional struggles. Long-term therapy, in particular, fosters deeper emotional exploration and expression through creative mediums, which can sometimes be more effective than verbal communication. The availability of materials like canvas, crafts, and writing tools makes it easier for adolescents to engage with therapeutic practices, supporting their developmental needs for self-expression and exploration.",

          "abstract": "Patterns of volunteering have predominantly been explained by focusing on the supply side of volunteering, where differences in volunteering reflect differences in resources and motivations. In this article, we shift the focus to the demand side of volunteering, and argue that a proper account of differences in volunteering must include differences in demand for help. We develop the concept of demand networks, as the inverse of support networks, and argue that demand networks are important to explain voluntary social work and support. We define demand networks as the demand for support requested through ego’s personal network. We propose a model where the amount of demand for help in ego’s network influences the likelihood that ego helps. We then turn to explain what factors create differences in amount of demand in personal networks as well as how they mediate and moderate the effect of demand networks. We focus on factors at 1) a structural level concerning the socio-economic strata of the individual and the organization of the voluntary effort, distinguishing between informal- and formal civil society, and 2) at an institutional level focusing on altruistic values and gendered social roles that may differentiate expectations to care for others and respond to demands for help. We test the resulting associational hypotheses using a cross-sectional population survey inquiring about volunteering during COVID-19 in Denmark. The results support the main hypotheses, indicating the importance of the demand side to adequately explain volunteering.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the rapid growth of China’s science and technology (S&amp;T) sector within the broader context of higher education, focusing on the often-overlooked role of Hong Kong in this transformation. While conventional explanations emphasize China’s relationship with the United States, this study argues that Hong Kong has played a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in advancing China’s higher education and S&amp;T capabilities. Despite its reputation as a finance-driven city, Hong Kong has developed a robust academic and scientific community that fostered close collaborations with mainland institutions. In the 1990s, as Hong Kong’s research doctoral programs were gaining momentum, mainland students sought high-quality advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese academic diaspora returned to join Hong Kong universities. This cross-border collaboration thrived despite cultural and ideological differences, combining the mainland’s motivated talent pool with Hong Kong’s free academic environment. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Web of Science, institutional archives, university leader biographies, and PhD dissertation records from Hong Kong’s top universities, this paper provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. The findings reveal that this relationship was evolutionary, initiated by forward-thinking educators long before formal mechanisms were in place, and was instrumental in China’s rise to global prominence in higher education and S&amp;T. By revisiting this underexplored dimension of China’s educational development, this paper offers a new understanding of the forces behind the country’s remarkable achievements in higher education and scientific research.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tools for cognitive support in aging populations, focusing on their ability to enhance memory, provide task reminders, and facilitate social engagement. As the global population ages, the demand for adaptive technologies that support aging in place increases, while healthcare resources grow increasingly strained. LLMs represent a promising avenue for addressing this gap by offering culturally competent, conversational interfaces capable of supporting cognitive function. Despite current limitations in context retention and response accuracy, advancements in LLM technology could enhance personalization and continuity of care, potentially transforming LLMs into significant companions for older adults experiencing cognitive decline. This paper provides an overview of existing LLM capabilities, the challenges that remain, and a projection of how these models might evolve to meet the growing needs of an aging society.",

          "authors": "Dor Shilton; Aniruddh D. Patel; Kim Hill; Chris von Rueden",
          "abstract": "Current prominent music evolution theories suggest music evolved as a participatory group activity, whose adaptive functions were strengthening and/or signaling social cohesion. However, the prevalence of collective music-making varies substantially across societies, and in some cases is exceptionally rare. Here, we consider hypotheses for three factors which could attenuate collective music-making: diminished collective action more generally, an emphasis on musical expertise, and solo-oriented musical styles. We look at data related to these hypotheses in four societies in which collective music-making is rare: the Tsimane of lowland Bolivia, the Ache of eastern Paraguay, the Ayoreo of Bolivia and Paraguay, and the Tuvans of the Russian Republic of Tyva. Our results suggest that the scale and religiosity of collective action is the most important factor related to the overall degree of collective music-making in a culture. The effect of musical expertise was mostly limited to the dominance of shamans in religious contexts, while well-developed solo musical styles did not necessarily prevent group performance in other social settings. We also note the importance of cultural loss due to influence of invading colonial and imperial forces in diminishing indigenous forms of collective music-making. Notably, in all the cases we consider, episodes of some form of collective music-making do (or historically did) occur during important social events, a fact which supports the group-functionalist view. Our findings also point to the centrality and ubiquity of the religious function of music, and suggest this aspect of musical behavior needs to be better addressed by evolutionary theories of music.",

          "authors": "Travis Van Isacker; Thom Tyerman",
          "abstract": "This article analyses the (post)colonial politics of UK bordering through the lens of monstrosity. Historicising contemporary bordering within colonial-era monsterisations of racialised people and their mobility, we identify four mechanisms through which migrants are constructed and policed as monsters today: animalisation, zombification, criminalisation and barbarisation. We then examine how the state embodies monstrosity itself through border policies of deterrence and creating ‘hostile environments’. In addition to the instrumentalization of horror, this entails extending the border’s reach domestically throughout everyday life and internationally through deportation and externalisation measures. We argue these developments embody a new form of state power, depicted as a headless tentacled Leviathan. Doing so provides insights into monstrosity as a form of liberal statecraft, the local/global diffusion of bordering, the transnationalisation of sovereign power, and the racialisation of citizenship. It also raises important questions about the construction of border violence as a necessary and legitimate monstrosity in (post)colonial liberal societies, the everyday complicity of citizens, and the limits of efforts to humanise monsterised migrants or reform monstrous state institutions. Revealing how within liberal regimes of citizenship and humanitarianism values ‘there be monsters’, we argue, opens space for thinking about abolitionist alternatives in international politics.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of toxic gaming behavior and profanity-laced language in online gaming communities has become a significant concern among adolescents in rural communities. Despite extensive research on gaming behavior in urban settings, there is a notable gap in understanding these dynamics in rural areas. This study aims to fill that gap by exploring the extent and nature of toxic behaviors and the use of offensive language among rural adolescents playing online games in Baybay City, Leyte. Through Symbolic Interactionism, this study aimed to identify the underlying factors contributing to such behaviors and their potential impacts on communication and social development. This study conducted a series of interviews, focus group discussions, and community observation to supplement the initial survey. Results showed that adolescents in rural areas are aware of their toxic behavior, but due to its normalization, do not think of it as a problem and instead see it as part of online gaming culture. This suggests the need to strengthen proper communication and improve maturity among players engaging in online games that require them to socialize.",

          "abstract": "Indian students’ ideas about climate change are a mix of incomplete knowledge and misconceptions. Students are also apprehensive about climate change and feel helpless in the face of it. Formal teaching about climate change is fragmented across subjects, and limited to explanations of the scientific mechanisms, ignoring the entire socio-economic, historical and political context that led to and perpetuates the phenomenon. This empirical research explores the outcomes from the Young Climate Authors, a holistic climate justice intervention where middle &amp; high schoolers wrote storybooks on climate change. The program was implemented with a cohort of 18 10-15 year olds in Chennai, India in 2023. Data in the form of pretest, midpoint &amp; postttest questionnaires, semi structured interviews, focus group discussions, and student artefacts was analyzed using Template Analysis. Results reveal that the YCA had a transformative decolonizing impact by created a sense of proto-conscientization based on deepened place-ecological meaning. The participants’ understanding of climate change shifted from vague, ‘textbook’ish knowledge to a nuanced and holistic understanding impacting Chennai, its marginalized communities and the more-than-human. Emotion was deeply intertwined in this understanding where a sense of empathy and anger, that the learning had engendered, shaped the storybooks that were written. The scientific understanding of climate change also improved. The results highlight the importance of using critical and constructivist pedagogy for climate change education which shape place-based and decolonized student ideas about climate change.",

          "abstract": "*This is a draft and is currently undergoing peer review.\n\nAmong climate adaptation technologies, the development of new wind energy infrastructure is widely supported in the United States. Yet, the siting of wind farms is often contentious. This research problematizes how local stakeholders frame their opposition to offshore wind projects at a time when the swift adoption of renewable energies is generally seen as a necessity for environmental, social, and economic reasons. Through qualitative content analysis of 89 public comments pertaining to offshore wind projects planned for the North Carolina coast, we argue that objections to wind projects reflect an understanding of the infrastructure’s environmental burden and, importantly, a desire to protect environmental privilege. Findings suggest a need for expanded research on the dimensions of privilege that may be at play across wind farm sites and that any consideration of a just transition must consider how expressions of privilege inform environmental political discourse and siting decisions.",

          "abstract": "There is considerable debate about the fairness of university admissions processes, particularly in national contexts with substantial prestige differences between providers. However, there does tend to be agreement that admissions processes should be transparent. This study investigates the extent to which undergraduate university admissions in the UK are transparent, particularly with regard to their use of an admissions essay called the UCAS personal statement. Our methods are twofold: 1) we assess whether university staff use the personal statement in ways that align with information on student-facing websites, and 2) we perform an in-depth transparency analysis of fifteen university course websites to assess the extent to which universities helped applicants to understand what a high-quality personal statement looked like. We find considerable evidence of issues related to transparency, with some examples of good practice. The paper concludes with several recommendations for providers to enhance their transparency. The 2025-26 reforms to the UCAS personal statement offer an opportunity for all universities to update their public-facing websites and guidance, so this paper represents a timely intervention.",

It dissects the actors and dynamics that triggered, fueled and disseminated the hype. Through the lens of hype studies the paper interrogates three empirical realms: 1. Company websites where the chatbots are presented, 2. Blog entries and newspaper interviews by prominent tech figures from the Silicon Valley, and 3. New York Times articles in the timespan between November 2022 and August 2024. The paper shows how the chatbot hype is driven by a dynamic between privileged actors (hypers) and a media frenzy both influencing and being carried by society and politics alike. Different interdependent building blocks in the chatbot hype construction are identified: 1. Depicting Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots as knowledge models, 2. Entertaining the uncanny and manipulative side of chatbots, 3. Staging a spectacle of competition between tech giants, and 4. Praising the dualism of doomsday apocalypse or a tech-religious calling for a promised future.

          "abstract": "Ideations and intentions are important precursors of actual behaviour but are still understudied in the literature on the transition to adulthood. Our article provides a descriptive overview of ideations and intentions about the timing of four key events in the transition to adulthood (exit from the parental home, cohabitation, marriage, and parenthood) using cross-nationally representative data for 33 Eu-ropean countries from the Generations and Gender Survey and European Social Survey. Results show that ideations and intentions about the transition to adulthood –just like actual behaviours– are gendered and display remarkable country differences. The heterogeneity in the timing of intentions hints that key events, such as cohabitation, are not uniformly pervasive in young adults' lives. Also, a gap exists between ideal and actual ages at which events are experienced, particularly among men who are less likely to experience events at their “ideal” time compared to women. The extent to which intentions and ideations regarding the transition to adulthood translate into actual behaviours varies across countries and gender.",

          "abstract": "In 2020, several governments declared specific occupations as essential for maintaining the functioning of society in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A current question in the public debate on fair pay is whether essential workers are sufficiently remunerated. Using data from the Netherlands, I analyze the wages of essential workers relative to other workers before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Wage decompositions indicate that, between 2006 and 2019, essential workers earned less compared to other workers within higher-paid strata, while they earned more within lower-paid strata of the occupational structure in the Netherlands. These wage differentials are shaped by sex composition and sectoral employment. In addition, I employ a difference-in-differences design based on quarterly data between 2017 and 2022 to assess whether the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic reduced an existing average wage gap in response to an increasing public appreciation of essential work. Results indicate that the collective experience of the Covid-19 pandemic has not benefited essential workers in the short-term.",

          "abstract": "Statistical discrimination theory suggests that discrimination arises when gatekeepers lack individual-level information and therefore draw on their knowledge on the group-level. According to this perspective, the policy solution is straight forward: provide gatekeepers with accurate individual-level information and discrimination will cease. Grades are important signals to students about academic ability and influence future educational choices. Previous studies find that teachers exhibit negative grading bias against boys, racialized minority students, and low-SES students so these groups receive signals about lower academic potential than merited. In this study, we test whether grading bias stems from statistical discrimination. First, we leverage a natural experiment in which teachers were given information from standardized tests and see whether this change mitigates grading bias. We further test this mechanism by analyzing the role of the performance of a given social background group at the same school the year prior. We find substantial grading bias but conclude that statistical discrimination is not likely to play a major role.",

Yet, despite its ubiquity and \ncentrality within global mobility infrastructures, the exact mechanisms through which citizenship \nshapes human movement on the planetary scale remain surprisingly ambiguous. This article examines the multifaceted ways in which citizenship operates as an organizing principle within the complex of rules and norms governing transnational human mobility, including how the increasing acceptance of dual nationality status and the emergence of citizenship-by-investment schemes reverberate throughout the legal infrastructure and create new pathways for elite mobility. Using citizenship as an exploratory lens, the article thereby seeks to theoretically complement and nuance existing scholarship in migration and mobility studies, arguing that physical space remains the dominant structure for human mobility. As we show, legal infrastructures reconfigure access to human mobility in ways that simultaneously fragment and compress physical space as it pertains to transnational movement.",

          "authors": "Cristin Kearns",
          "abstract": "In the digital age, online industry documents have become an available and abundant source to inform qualitative health research on the commercial determinants of health. I offer the situational scoping method as an approach that applies rigorous and transparent methods to conduct an overview of large databases of industry documents by focusing on specific empirical “situations” as the object of study. It is conducted by a collective of transdisciplinary researchers and community members who shape knowledge production based on their unique experience and opinions about which situations are deemed essential for emancipatory action. The situational scoping method is rooted in a critical constructivist epistemology and consists of three stages: 1) identification of a broad range of external events over time perceived by industries as a threat or opportunity to business interests; 2) selection of a sample of external events for further analysis; and 3) social worlds/arenas mapping of industry responses to selected external events. I describe the epistemological and methodological influences, development, and procedures of the situational scoping method drawing from my experience conducting a pilot study with a project team engaged in scoping of documents related to environmental exposures and breast cancer in the University of California, San Francisco Industry Documents Library, which houses millions of documents produced by the tobacco, opioids, chemical, drug, food, and fossil fuel industries.

Synthetic control analysis is applied to estimate the causal effect for each individual school. The findings show the program has had limited effect on educational outcomes with little variation between schools. Our contribution is in showing how several factors, such as goal switching, lack of participation, and teacher shortages, hamper program effectiveness and discussing to what extent a concept such as the HCZ is transferable to other international contexts.

The national two-party vote share prediction builds on the economic fundamentals model from Fair (2009), enhanced by incorporating a candidate quality differential measure based on newspaper endorsements from DeLuca (2024), resulting in what I call the Economy-Quality Model. According to this model, Kamala Harris is projected to win the popular vote with 52.5% of the two-party vote share, approximately 1.5-2 points higher than most other forecasts and polling averages. I then calculate each state’s deviation from the national vote share (its relative Democratic or Republican lean) based on recent high-quality polling, adding these deviations to the Economy-Quality Model’s national prediction to derive state-level predictions and electoral college results. The model forecasts Kamala Harris winning the electoral college with 319 votes.",

We draw on interviews with 67 immigration advocates representing 76 immigrant-serving nonprofits across the United States between November 2021 and February 2023. The interviews affirm advocates and their organizations’ important frontline roles in reducing systemic harm by addressing immigrants’ immediate material, social, and/or legal needs. Yet, when it comes to preventing harm by reforming or transforming the immigration system, many advocates believe their efforts do little but maintain the system’s structure. Advocates attribute this dynamic to several sources, including the ever-evolving harms of the current system; the demands of the public and private funders their organizations rely on; intraorganizational challenges common to immigrant-serving organizations; and the perceived immovability of the national, state, and local political contexts they work in. We conclude with several immediate and long-range suggestions for immigration advocates to consider as they continue their work.",

          "abstract": "Bogotá es la sexta ciudad más poblada de América Latina, cuenta con una población aproximada de 7,4 millones de personas y una extensión de 1775 km2, según el censo del DANE para 2018 (SDP, 2020). Esta ciudad, al ser una de las más grandes en la región necesita un sistema de transporte competente para movilizar a sus habitantes; sin embargo, tras cuatro décadas de propuestas en la actualidad carece de un sistema de trenes urbanos o metro, y, sólo hasta el año 2020 se comenzaron a desarrollar fases previas a la construcción, bajo los lineamientos del contrato firmado entre Empresa Metro de Bogotá y la empresa Metro Línea 1 S.A.S. Debido a lo anterior, en este trabajo se busca describir las posibles razones de carácter económico que han influenciado a los proyectos más significativos de este sistema de transporte en la capital durante casi 40 años, hasta la puesta en marcha de la Primera Línea del Metro de Bogotá (PMLB), esto mediante una revisión de los diferentes estudios que se realizaron desde 1981 hasta 2020 para la construcción del mismo.",

          "abstract": "Purpose — This paper aims to investigate how best to classify money laundering through online video games (i.e. virtual laundering). Currently, there is no taxonomy available for scholars and practitioners to refer to when discussing money laundering through online video games. Without a well-defined taxonomy it becomes difficult to reason through, formulate and implement effective regulatory measures, policies and security controls. As such, efforts to prevent and reduce virtual laundering incidence rates are hampered.\nDesign/methodology/approach — This paper proposes three mutually exclusive virtual laundering\ncategorizations. However, instead of fixating on the processes undergirding individual instances of virtual laundering, it is argued that focusing on the initial locale of the illicit proceeds provides the appropriate framing within which to classify instances of virtual laundering. Thus, the act of classification becomes an ontological endeavor, rather than an attempt at elucidating an inherently varied process (as is common of the placement, layering and integration model).\nFindings — This paper proposes three mutually exclusive virtual laundering categorizations.

          "authors": "Tommaso Vitale",
          "abstract": "This chapter commences with the presentation of three questions. Firstly, what are the strengths of political and social science research work on associationism? Secondly, which areas have been treated with a greater degree of ideological bias and would therefore benefit from a more critical realist approach (Pratschke, 2003)? Thirdly, what insights have been gained? In responding to these queries, the chapter considers the ways in which research has frequently examined associationism with a view to elucidating broader dynamics, including those pertaining to politics, professionalisation, organisation, community, elites, cooperation, and categories of stratification. As we examine the ways in which cities engage with associations, we observe a multiplicity of modes of governance, a diversity of instruments of public action, and a structure of associational opportunities. This allows us to investigate the mechanisms and processes involved, adopting a historical and comparative approach that aligns with Weberian principles.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the implementation of responsive curricula in higher education through an embedded case study of the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Groningen. The study analyzes a four-year project (2020-2024) aimed at developing responsive curricula across 17 bachelor and master programmes. A survey of 64 staff members involved in the project revealed notable changes in curriculum content, focusing on sustainability, data science, and professional skills. Teaching methods shifted towards active learning, blended learning, and creating an inclusive learning environment. The project positively impacted programme quality, organizational culture, and knowledge sharing, with three-quarters of respondents perceiving increase organisational readiness to respond to societal development and improve courses and programmes. Key tools for curriculum development included teaching innovation grants and discretionary programme-level budgets. These findings offer valuable insights for higher education institutions seeking to implement responsive curricula and navigate the complexities of organizational change in academic settings.",

          "abstract": "The idea that labor scarcity can induce economic development has long been hypothesized (Hicks, 1932; Habakkuk, 1962), but the evidence remains limited. This paper examines how the Second Great Migration (1940–1970) spurred structural change in the American South between 1970 and 2010. Empirical results using shift-share instruments show that out-migration incentivized capital investment and capital-augmenting technical change, increasing capital per worker and output in both agriculture and manufacturing, at least until 2010. Labor was reallocated from agriculture to non-agriculture. I then develop a dynamic spatial equilibrium model that allows for substitution between factors of production, factor-biased technical change, and factor abundance-based trade to characterize this process. The quantitative analysis indicates that labor-capital substitution played a major role in adjustments to South-to-North migration.",

          "authors": "Moa Mårtensson; Maria Nordbrandt; Joakim Palme; Lauri Peterson",
          "abstract": "Carbon taxation is widely embraced as an effective tool for reducing emissions, yet it is economically regressive, disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable groups. Hence, it is no surprise that carbon taxes often are perceived as unfair, and if implemented without consideration of distributive effects, they risk generating polarization and climate policy setbacks, as well as increasing existing inequalities. We provide the first causal analysis of how and to what extent existing social protection programs could be used to reduce opposition to carbon taxes. We employ a conjoint experiment targeting 5,188 respondents from Sweden to assess the causal effect of increased generosity in pensions, sickness insurance, unemployment insurance, and child benefits, benchmarked against the effect of monthly monetary handouts. Our findings suggest that increasing benefit generosity within each of the four examined social protection programs reduces opposition to carbon taxation. Most importantly, increased old age pension generosity have a substantial and significant impact across various demographic groups, regardless of the respondents’ political affiliation. This effect is more potent than other compensatory measures, a critical insight in the search for socially acceptable climate policy strategies that avoid increasing inequalities.",

          "authors": "Bernard Barruga",
          "abstract": "This policy brief proposes a shift in the standard measurement and reporting of rainfall from depth-based metrics (e.g., millimeters per hour) to a volume over area-based metric that measures rainfall as water volume over area per time (e.g., cubic meters per hectare per hour). This change is grounded in studies indicating that area-based rainfall metrics can more accurately predict flood risk, especially in flash-flood-prone regions. Studies have shown that traditional depth measurements do not adequately reflect runoff potential, while volume-over-area metrics better represent the hydrological impact on various landscapes (Peleg et al., 2017). A proposed rainfall intensity scale, modeled after hurricane categorization systems, aims to improve communication of rainfall severity and promote preparedness. \nKeywords: rainfall measurement, flood forecasting, climate resilience, volume-over-area, flash flooding, rainfall intensity scale, climate change, public risk communication",

          "authors": "Sven Broschinski; Martin Heidenreich",
          "abstract": "Faced with the demographic shift to a smaller and older labour force, the recruitment of migrants and their successful integration into the labour force is an essential challenge for all European countries. This article discusses the immigrant-native gap regarding the risk of overeducation for 28 European countries on the basis of the EU-LFS 2021 ad hoc module. Immigrants’ higher overeducation risks are interpreted as the result of processes of legal closure as well as statistical and taste-based discrimination. Higher overeducation rates of third country nationals (TCN) in contrast to EU migrants indicate that EU citizenship reduces discrimination and facilitates the recognition of educational certificates – they are skill-preserving devices for EU citizens but not for TCN. The large overeducation rates in particular in Southern Europe can be explained by segmented labour markets with higher unemployment and lower skill requirements increase overeducation risks, in particular for TCN. Moreover, it can be shown that EU citizenship, a higher educational level of the population, and more inclusive labour markets facilitate the occupational integration of immigrants.",

If concerns exist, what are they, and how can they be effectively resolved?” This question guided the panel’s work, inviting a thorough exploration of the potential ethical, legal, and governance issues arising when former board members continued their involvement with an organization in different capacities.

          "abstract": "Deflation represents an increase in consumer wealth through postponed consumption decisions. State-imposed \"monetary policies\" not only expropriate this increase in wealth attributed to deflation (a fiscal motive) but also penalize consumers for postponing their consumption of goods and services (a form of social engineering). Consequently, there is a shortfall in the state's legal frameworks adequately protecting consumer freedom and property rights. In response, the Bitcoin network has emerged as a private currency governed by a distinct legal framework rooted in proof-of-work. Consumers holding Bitcoin benefit from the economic advantages of global deflation-advantages often usurped by central banks-and experience enhanced freedom to delay consumption, navigating their life paths free from the constraints of social engineering. Thus, Bitcoin contributes value by addressing the shortfall in state legal systems that safeguard consumer freedom and property rights",

          "authors": "Andrew Van Horn; Alexander Stewart",
          "abstract": "Styles of traditional decorative art vary substantially across cultures. While early theorists attributed this variation to differences in environment, scholarship has long focused on decorative artworks as vehicles of social information and stylistic variation as a consequence of social factors. However, if the capacity to create and consume art evolved as a mechanism to shape shared attention, it is possible that environmental factors may indeed play a role in variation of decorative style. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the compositional structure of 198 textiles from eighteen cultures across the globe using the complexity-entropy plane. Entropy and statistical complexity have previously been used to characterize changes in the compositional structure of paintings of the Western canon over the last millennium. We observed that complexity and entropy are useful measures for characterizing traditional textile designs: high-entropy/low-complexity samples feature dense repetitions of small Euclidean shapes, while low-entropy/high-complexity samples feature large, single-color fields with bold borders. We observed weak-but-significant associations between these measures and three environmental variables: absolute latitude, Koppen climate classification, and a composite variable representing subsistence mode. Interestingly, we observed a significant difference between works from Afro-Eurasia/Oceania and the Americas. Controlling for this and other factors related to social transmission improves the strength of the relationship between compositional structure and subsistence mode. We propose that aesthetic preferences may be affected by subsistence mode as well as cultural factors, and suggest that further studies with more granular environmental data are necessary. We further discuss potential explanations for the observed difference between \"hemispheres.\"",

          "abstract": "In response to a remarkably high out of pocket (OOP) health expenditure in India, various state and the national governments in India, tried to introduce public health insurance programs. Despite being free, the take up and utilization of these programs remain low. In this paper, we seek to explain this puzzle by studying the role of informal networks in explaining insurance-adoption behavior in the context of the Arogyasri health insurance program introduced in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh between 2007 and 2008. We use household panel data from the Young Lives Survey (YLS) to empirically study how the adoption of Arogyasri among poor households respond to their membership in informal networks. In this context, we differentiate between two types of network – financial network and information network. We find that adoption and utilization are significantly higher for households with access to informal financial networks. However, adoption and utilization increases much more for households outside informal networks, after they experience health shocks. Information sharing role of informal networks do not seem to affect the decision to adopt insurance. We also provide a simple theoretical framework to discuss the potential mechanisms underlying our empirical results.",
