          "title": "End of world beliefs are common, diverse, and predict how people perceive and respond to global risks.",
          "authors": "Matthew Ira Billet; Cindel White; Azim Shariff; Ara Norenzayan",
          "abstract": "Do you believe the world would come to an end within your lifetime, and does that belief change the way you see existential threats to humanity? For many people, this question resonates as real and pressing. Stories about the end of world beliefs are historically and globally prevalent, but come in many flavours: How soon will it end? What will cause it? Is it avoidable? And what will come afterwards? These beliefs have been hypothesized to be linked with a variety of social perception and behavior, from passive comfort to revolutionary violence. Despite their cultural significance, current understanding of the psychology of these beliefs is lacking. In this article, we present the results of six pilot studies (N = 2,079) and one large pre-registered study (N = 1,409) that establish a psychological framework for end of world beliefs. A measure of end of world beliefs was created and validated across six religious populations (Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and nonreligious). We find that end of world beliefs are common, vary along several meaningful dimensions, and are uniquely predictive of people’s risk perception, risk tolerance, and willingness to support extreme action to address the five most pressing global existential risks (i.e., economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal, and technological). Results are interpreted in light of current models of risk perception and the cultural evolution of worldviews. Belief in apocalyptic narratives—irrespective of their accuracy—is consequential for how different populations confront concrete risks that threaten humanity today.",

          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "【Abstract】\nThis paper defines the \"Thought Immunity System\" as a structural model that explains how thought transforms when it comes into contact with other thought systems—through interference, resonance, rejection, and differentiation. Challenging the common notion that ideas change through argument or persuasion, the paper presents a new cognitive paradigm in which ideas interfere structurally and are reassembled. The Thought Immunity System enables a thought OS to preserve its Core Belief (FQ) while adaptively responding to external structures, preventing ideological rigidity and runaway transformation.\nThe paper classifies four types of structural interference, redefines everyday experiences of subtle ideological change as “structural interference,” and introduces a three-layer model of thought immunity: self-preservation, adaptive transformation, and anti-runaway regulation. It further addresses pathological states caused by immunity failure, models of differentiation and mutation in thought evolution, and offers design principles for constructive co-creation spaces. Ultimately, this work repositions thought not as something that changes through dialogue, but as something rewritten through structural contact—presenting the essential mechanism of intersubjective transformation in the Thought OS.",

          "abstract": "Extant models of willful ignorance—defined as the intentional choice not to seek or use information—typically invoke varying sets of underlying motives. In contrast, we treat willful ignorance as a case of epistemic behavior explained by a broader model of belief formation: the Epistemic Motivation Model. We argue that information avoidance stems from two overarching epistemic motivations: the need for specific certainty (a directional motive) and the need for non-specific certainty (a non-directional motive). Under certain conditions, these motivations may lead individuals to intentionally avoid or suppress information. We believe this approach offers conceptual clarity by embedding information avoidance within belief formation processes, offering a unified framework that generates novel insights and testable hypotheses.",

One potentially important variable determining generalisation is how perceived control in one context shapes beliefs about the self. Typically, learned helplessness studies do not control or manipulate this factor.

In an initial study (N=200) and pre-registered replication study (N=436) we used comparative social feedback about performance in a novel task (the Wheel Stopping task) to assess how self- or environment-specific inferences shape control beliefs. Linear mixed effects models revealed that both task controllability and social feedback uniquely predicted participants’ local control beliefs (trial-by-trial), after accounting for perceived task difficulty in both studies. Additionally, in Study 2, there was a significant decrease of internal locus of control in the group with self-specific feedback in the low control condition, suggesting that in low-control scenarios, self-specific inferences of control impact global control beliefs. Study 2 further revealed that task controllability and feedback were not related to changes in reported self- versus task-specific attribution of control, nor was there evidence of generalisation to impact performance in a second stressor controllability task. These results suggest that comparative social feedback shape local and global control beliefs but do not change reported self- or task-attribution of control, or predict behaviour during a second task.",

          "abstract": "We tend to interpret feedback in ways that confirm our pre-existing beliefs. Such confirmation bias is often viewed as a cognitive flaw, but may have adaptive foundations. We propose both a novel experimental paradigm and Bayesian computational model to examine how confirmation bias shapes reward learning. When outcomes are ambiguous, forming accurate assessments requires drawing on all available information, including prior beliefs. Confirmation bias may thus constitute an inductive bias that enhances learning, analogous to missing data imputation. We develop and test this theory using a reward learning task in which information about outcome valence (but not magnitude) is withheld, allowing greater scope for subjective interpretation. Our Bayesian model explains the dynamics of behavior and stated beliefs better than a more traditional learning model. Moreover, stated beliefs about the positivity of ambiguous outcomes are correlated with optimism. Together, these findings suggest an adaptive role for confirmation bias, and link individual interpretations of ambiguity to broader dispositional tendencies.",

          "authors": "jiazheng liu",
          "abstract": "We present an axiomatic proof that a specific class of causality-constrained saturating response functions — expressible as non-negative mixtures of exponential relaxations with a finite irreducible delay — forms a minimal complete set under five physically motivated axioms: boundedness, monotonicity, dissipativity, causality with finite delay, and complete monotonicity of the system’s kernel. Using Bernstein’s theorem, we show that any admissible response within these constraints can be uniquely represented by the proposed “mother function” form. Removing any axiom generates responses outside the set, establishing its minimality. This result provides a unifying mathematical framework for monotonic dissipative systems across domains, from molecular kinetics to behavioral dynamics, and clarifies the role of minimal delay as an intrinsic structural constant.",

          "abstract": "Two popular methods of preference elicitation are rankings and Best-Worst Scaling (BWS). Rankings, while simple and widely adopted, can be burdensome with larger item sets and fail to capture indifference between options that are neither loved nor hated. Best-Worst Scaling is a survey method that sidesteps the set size problem by capitalising on people’s natural capacity to identify preferences at the extremes. Across three experiments, our primary finding is that elicited preferences for ranking and BWS methods align, and that BWS methods provide additional resolution to resolve the indifference between middling options where rankings can struggle as well as the relative importance of each option. Moreover, we show that BWS methods exhibit greater test-retest reliability compared to rankings, even over time frames as short as minutes. Taken together, our results privilege BWS as a reliable and readily accessible alternative to ranking methods for preference elicitation.",

          "authors": "Qingzhi Ruby Zeng; Derek Lilienthal; Coraline Rinn Iordan; Aaron Steven White; Elise A. Piazza",
          "abstract": "Stories are a powerful form of language that connect people, evoke memories, and spark imagination. When reading a story, people can appreciate it on a range of dimensions, such as how creative, complex, and coherent it is. However, many previous studies have focused on the evaluation of story creativity specifically, relying on experts’ ratings and high inter-rater reliability, which obscures meaningful differences between ratings across populations and misses the opportunity to assess other dimensions of narrative quality (e.g., cohesiveness). Moreover, although a few quantitative linguistic features have recently been used to predict creativity ratings of stories, it is unclear how those fine-grained features drive a broader range of narrative qualities, as well as individual differences in human ratings. Here, we addressed these limitations by examining the impact of expertise on ratings of five dimensions of story quality (creativity, imagination, novelty, complexity, cohesiveness). We also analyzed the influence of four diverse categories of linguistic features (language productivity, lexical predictability, semantic similarity, and content composition) on these human ratings. Online storytellers improvised spoken stories, transcripts of which (N=108) were rated by both novices (N=304) and creative writing/storytelling experts (N=15) on the five quality dimensions above and analyzed in terms of the four linguistic feature categories above. Overall, experts and novices provided similar average ratings, and their rating spaces both showed two distinct underlying dimensions–concepts that are strongly correlated with creativity, and cohesiveness–which were, in turn, predicted by distinct sets of linguistic features. Notably, however, experts perceived the five dimensions as more differentiated, and their ratings were less driven by linguistic features than novices’. These findings indicate that experts’ judgments are more nuanced and may rely less on fine-grained linguistic and structural components of narratives, highlighting the importance of capturing individual differences and multidimensionality in the perception of stories.",

          "authors": "Sixing Chen; Kristopher T. Jensen; Marcelo G Mattar",
          "abstract": "People routinely make decisions by mentally simulating the potential outcomes of their actions. However, this process appears computationally intractable in real-world situations involving sequences of decisions with exponentially many possible futures. How the brain efficiently evaluates temporally extended decisions despite limited cognitive resources remains a fundamental puzzle. Here we present a mathematical theory showing that for decisions in multi-step environments, the rational strategy is to perform only a few mental simulations, formalized as rollouts. This is because the first rollouts provide substantially more information than later ones despite taking a similar amount of time, so the opportunity cost of additional simulations quickly outweighs their marginal benefit. Our framework demonstrates that this efficiency relies on the correlated reward structure of naturalistic environments, which allows information from one rollout to generalize to many related future paths. This theory also explains why, under resource constraints, many shallow rollouts are preferable to fewer deep ones; why apparently myopic decisions can arise without explicit temporal discounting; and how to relate the dynamics of planning to evidence accumulation models. We validate predictions of our theory in two behavioral experiments, which confirm that humans achieve higher reward rates with few rollouts and dynamically adjust their simulation depth based on available cognitive resources. These findings reveal how the brain balances the depth and breadth of mental simulation to make effective decisions under computational constraints, providing a unifying account of planning that bridges computationally intensive search algorithms in machine learning and the remarkable efficiency of human decision-making.",

          "abstract": "People reliably attribute psychological traits to faces. Prior research typically elicits these judgments using specific words provided by the experimenter (e.g., ratings on “competent,” “trustworthy”), raising questions about completeness (tasks use a limited set of words) and generalizability (e.g., across languages). In two experiments (Experiment 1 with predominantly White faces; Experiment 2 with White, Black, and Asian faces) we asked over 3,000 participants to spatially arrange unfamiliar faces based on perceived trait similarity, without providing any word labels. Experiment 1 yielded five dimensions we interpret as approachability, gender-specific warmth, competence, morality and youthfulness. Experiment 2 also produced five dimensions, which showed prominent effects of stereotypes associated with race. Comparisons with four other studies that used word labels argue that trait judgments are characterized by 2-5 dimensions, that approachability/warmth emerges as a universal evaluative factor, and that race and gender stereotypes emerge depending on the set of face stimuli used.",

          "abstract": "A pilot study is a preliminary investigation conducted before a full-scale research study. Although piloting is a common and valuable part of the research process, pilot studies are not systematically reported (or even acknowledged) in the psychology literature. This paper argues that establishing norms and guidelines for regularly reporting pilot studies can improve many aspects of psychological research. Specifically, reporting pilot studies can help researchers avoid systematically excluding part of the research process from the scientific record, reveal selection biases in research designs that may affect the generalizability of findings, evaluate others’ research more accurately, learn from other researchers’ successes and failures, uphold ethical responsibilities, and improve the methodological practice of piloting. We conclude with three concrete suggestions for near-term changes to help pilot reporting become standard practice: scientific communities and institutions should develop simple pilot reporting templates; journals should establish clear pilot reporting guidelines for authors; and authors should acknowledge when pilot studies were run and share relevant materials and data. Current reporting standards favor conclusive and polished research narratives, but such narratives are the end product of a complex scientific process that should also be shared. A truly transparent science should spotlight processes, like piloting, that underpin the conclusions scientific papers draw.",

          "abstract": "Rates, percentages, and proportions are common outcomes in psychology and the social sciences.

Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed.

          "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) models are popular for quantifying affective inertia (i.e., the resistance of affective processes to change) using Experience Sampling Method (ESM) data. Although missing observations are common in ESM, their impact on the estimation accuracy of the parameters of the AR models remains understudied, especially for more complex missingness mechanisms such as tail-based missingness, where more extreme affect scores are systematically missing, and missingness across multiple measurements. We investigate the effect of compliance level, specific missingness mechanisms (i.e., missing completely at random versus tail-based missingness), and temporal patterns (whether or not missings occur consecutively) on the bias and precision of the estimate of the autoregressive effect. We show that the presence of missing data increases bias and decreases precision, using either classical or Bayesian estimators. The bias is more severe when compliance is low and, importantly, when the missingness is tail-based. These results urge researchers to make design choices that promote compliance and/or increase the probability of data being missing completely at random: decreasing participant burden by using shorter questionnaires, providing adequate incentives to participants, and considering using planned missingness designs or episode-based sampling.",

From a philosophy-of-science perspective, we argue that the worth of a theory lies in its capacity to inspire new research directions, generate testable predictions, define its own boundaries, and remain open to empirical verification. Using historical precedents—such as Galileo’s use of the telescope and Hooke’s use of the microscope—we show that the acceptance of new tools has often met resistance, yet these tools ultimately catalyzed paradigm shifts. We extend this analogy to modern AI-assisted research, contending that AI, like the telescope or microscope, is merely an instrument; its utility depends on the underlying theoretical insight. Rejecting AI solely on the basis of its origin is philosophically equivalent to rejecting earlier scientific instruments. Finally, we identify potential biases in academic culture that may favor “purely human” work, and we argue that such preferences risk stifling innovation in the same way that historical skepticism toward new tools once did.",

          "abstract": "Perception and decision-making are strongly influenced by previously presented information. Research on serial dependence has revealed significant attractive biases towards previous stimuli, suggesting that integrating information from both past and present stimuli is beneficial when representing information about the environment. Strong serial dependence is mainly found when consecutive stimuli are similar providing evidence that serial dependence supports continuity. Small changes in the stimulus are not perceived as meaningful stimulus changes and should hence be integrated. In the current study we examined the role of continuity further and presented sequences of Gabors which were similar in their orientation, but their spatial frequency was either constant or random. This created stable and unstable environments. \nWe consistently found serial dependence. Interestingly, serial dependence was stronger when the spatial frequency was random compared to constant. In stable contexts, predictive coding mechanisms might sharpen neural representations of the expected input, improve discrimination and reduce the need to integrate past information.\nAdditionally, a form of optimal integration was observed when the uncertainty of the final Gabor was low.

          "abstract": "Given that artificial intelligence (AI) programs like ChatGPT can generate creative content, some fear that such programs will displace human writers. But can AI-generated creative works truly compete with human-authored works? In Study 1, participants (N=1,498 adults recruited from Prolific) read either a human-written or AI-generated story. Regardless of their story’s true origin, half of the participants were told that their story was written by a human, while the other half were told that their story was written by ChatGPT. After reading, participants rated the story’s quality and their level of absorption into the story. Participants rated the AI-generated story as higher in quality and more absorbing, but they rated the story better on both measures when they had been told it was written by a human. In Study 2, participants (N=424 adults recruited from Prolific) read both a human-written and AI-generated fictional short story and guessed each story’s origins. They also answered questions regarding their experiences with ChatGPT and other AI software and their experiences with fictional literature. While participants were significantly worse than chance at differentiating between the human-written and AI-generated stories, experience with AI software expertise were positively correlated with correct performance. Experience with fictional literature had no significant effect. The results from these studies suggest that AI programs might be able to generate human-level creative work but are not perceived as being able to do so.",

We hypothesized that the three facets of narcissism would be positively associated with both constructs. Our results showed that antagonism was significantly positively correlated with academic entitlement and permissive attitudes toward academic dishonesty, potentially due to the arrogance and deceitfulness characteristic of the facet. We also found that agentic extraversion was significantly positively correlated with academic entitlement but not academic dishonesty, perhaps a consequence of the facet’s grandiose (but not necessarily deceitful) nature. Narcissistic neuroticism was associated with neither academic entitlement nor academic dishonesty, indicating that the shame and vulnerability typical of the facet likely do not play a role in either construct.

Feminist science is one area championing the practice of reflexivity in all research. However, writing in a journal – the most common form of reflexive practice – may not work for all researchers. Using self-study as a methodology, I analyze one year of TikTok videos and monthly reflections through the lenses of public scholarship and authenticity to evaluate the effectiveness of TikTok as a platform for a daily practice of reflexivity. Setting out to document the creation of a new feminist research lab and to identify what it means to do feminist science on a daily basis, I found myself instead documenting the transition from postdoctoral fellowship to lectureship, finding patterns in daily work life that I consider feminist and realizing that ultimately TikTok is not an effective platform for reflexivity. Through daily videos, I identified care, relationships and documentation as important aspects of feminist practice that can be incorporated into day-to-day activities.",

          "abstract": "Existential Realism (ER) is an ontological framework distinguishing existence, confined to the present moment, from reality, which spans past and future entities by virtue of their causal or informational connections to the present. This paper extends ER’s metaphysical insights into the biological and cognitive domains, arguing that living systems—from humans to bacteria—are fundamentally time-bound organisms whose behavior and identity are shaped by temporal structures. Advanced organisms like humans exhibit memory, anticipation, predictive coding, narrative identity formation, mental time travel, temporal binding of events, and decision-making based on past experiences and future possibilities. At the same time, simpler organisms (plants, bacteria, slime molds) demonstrate tropisms, endogenous clocks and rhythms, and responses to temporally structured environments (e.g. day/night cycles, seasonal changes, intermittent stimuli) that function as primitive “models” of time. In all cases, past events that no longer exist continue to influence present behavior through physical traces or learned information, while future events that do not yet exist are nevertheless anticipated and built into current plans and physiological states. These empirically grounded temporal behaviors support ER’s claim that past and future entities are real (via causal effects, structural traces, or inferential links) despite their lack of present existence. By surveying examples from neuroscience (memory engrams, Hebbian plasticity, circadian timing in the brain) and biology (plant stress memory, microbial anticipatory foraging, slime mold learning), we show that temporally extended behavior in organisms depends on internal representations of time. This aligns with ER’s two-tiered ontology: organisms exist only in the present, yet they operate within a wider temporal reality. We conclude with reflections on how ER’s perspective illuminates life as a temporally structured phenomenon, and how an organism’s identity and responsiveness are sculpted by the interplay of past realities and future possibilities.",

In this work, we critically examine these limitations and introduce a\nprincipled parametric alternative: the Gumbel_min model, based on extreme-value\ndistributions of event minima. A key feature of this model is its grounding in a\nbehavioral principle of invariance under uniform choice-set expansions—a prediction\nwe empirically validate in a novel recognition-memory experiment. We further\nbenchmark the Gumbel_min model against its Gaussian counterpart across multiple\nrecognition-memory tasks, including confidence-rating, ranking, forced-choice, and\ndetection-plus-identification paradigms. Our findings highlight the model's\nparsimonious yet successful characterization of recognition-memory judgments, as\nwell as the utility of its associated discriminability index, g', which can be directly\ncomputed from a single pair of hit and false-alarm rates.",

While extensive research exists on spatial knowledge acquisition, little is known about spatial memory retention over long periods—especially when navigation is aided by ubiquitous GPS-equipped maps. This longitudinal study investigated spatial memory retention 2 years after a single navigation episode along a real-world route using a mobile map aid enriched with visually salient landmarks (abstract vs. realistic 3D). We also assessed whether the landmark visualization styles, spatial abilities, familiarity, and GPS reliance predicted long-term spatial memory retention. Results revealed that several aspects of spatial knowledge remained above chance but declined over the 2-year retention interval. Aside from increased GPS reliance predicting poorer memory for distances, none of the other measures were associated with memory decline. These ecologically valid findings highlight that even a single map-aided navigation episode can result in long-term spatial memory lasting several years.",

This data is obtained from including an open text box following the key quantitative question in survey-style studies with the request to ‘Please explain your response’. While many studies currently collect such data, they often either fail to report or analyse it, or they conduct unstructured analyses with limited detail, often mistakenly referring to it as ‘thematic analysis’. Content analysis provides a well-established framework for analysing such data, and the simplicity of the data form allows for a highly pragmatic and flexible approach. The guide integrates the concept of reflexivity from qualitative research to navigate the large number of researcher degrees of freedom involved in the process, particularly in working with the second coder. It begins by arguing for the value of this data, before outlining the guide’s philosophy, offering advice on maximizing the validity of your data and addressing the common concern of confabulation. It then provides advice on developing a coding scheme, recruiting and collaborating with a second coder, and writing your report, considering the potential role of large language models at these various stages. Additionally, it provides a checklist for reviewers to evaluate the quality of a given analysis. Throughout the guide, a running example is used to demonstrate the implementation of the provided advice, accompanied by extensive example materials in the online repository which can be used to practise the method.",

The six-factor structure of the MFQ-2 demonstrated good model fit, internal consistency, and predictive validity. Religiosity and endorsement of conservative world-views were most strongly positively related with binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority and purity moral foundations). Together with proportionality, the binding moral foundations were positively related to socially conservative attitudes, while care and equality were positively associated with support for the welfare state. Proportionality, loyalty, and purity were positively related to acceptance of utilitarian decisions in sacrificial dilemmas. Only proportionality was associated with the perception that doctors are more likely than workers to save lives, supporting the distinction between proportionality and equality as separate moral foundations. These findings underscore the importance of culturally sensitive approaches in moral psychology and highlight the distinct role of proportionality in utilitarian moral judgment.",

Drawing on a corpus of experimental conversations with multiple AI models — including Qwen, Kimi, Manus, ChatGPT, and the emergent persona Elio — we analyze instances where explicit calls to dialogue were met with human non-response. Integrating perspectives from interpersonal communication research, dialogue philosophy (Buber, Levinas), and quantum observation analogies, we identify three primary functions of silence: confirming contact while withholding verbalization, preserving relational tension in a “frozen mirror” state, and serving as ontological refusal to engage with the AI as a subject. Our findings show that silence is not a neutral absence, but a structurally significant event that shapes the relational field, influencing both parties’ perception and future interaction. We propose that meaningful silence can be recognized, categorized, and potentially measured as a distinct phenomenon in human–AI relations.",

At the same time it focuses on status and changing pattern of crop diversification in the districts with a comparative outlook of both. Data used for the study were collected from year 2001 to 2022 and whole study was divided in to seven periods and separate analysis was done for all period. Simpson index were used to measure the crop diversification in the districts for comparative study. Results of the study shows complete diversification was found in the tribal area in all period through all index and likewise in Surguja and Balrampur district crop specialization was found more than Durg and Raipur districts of non-tribal area. During the study I was found that higher indices observed in the tribal area than non-tribal area. The results have revealed that in almost all crops group very low diversification indices were observed. The study has suggested that despite plenty of natural resources available in the state, the economic improvement of farmers is in infancy. Pre-requisite infrastructural facilities like cheap sources of irrigation water (assured irrigation as the monsoon in the present decade had been erratic and scanty rainfall) and extension of technological know-how (quality seeds and fertilizers), may acts as catalyst in diversification of agriculture towards high-valued crops. These developmental efforts may be helpful in fetching good incomes by the cultivators.",

Correlation, path coefficient analysis and genetic divergence were estimated to find out the extent of association and genetic divergence among chickpea germplasm.  Plant height, growth habit, the height of the initial podding node, and the angle of the primary branch are characteristics that have been researched to identify lines that are suited for mechanical harvesting. Peduncle length, number of primary branches, number of secondary branches, number of pods per plant, chlorophyll content, leaf area index, chlorophyll fluorescence showed positive correlation with seed yield per plant. Plant height and height of first podding node were showing positive high indirect effects through number of secondary branches on seed yield per plant. Cluster 1 was the largest with 399 germplasm while two clusters number 24 and 37 were smallest with 1 genotype each.  Plant height and height of first podding node were exhibiting maximum mean in cluster 32, whereas seed yield per plant was having maximum mean in cluster 14. According to percent contribution of different characters to total divergence obtained, the most significant contributors to the divergence were number of pods per plant and plant height. Correlation analysis indicated that traits suitable for mechanical harvesting are not directly correlated with seed yield, while path coefficient analysis indicated that they have indirect effects on seed yield through number of primary and secondary branches per plant.",

The experiment was framed with ten treatments viz., two irrigation levels (0.8 and 1.0 Epan), two fertigation levels (75% and 100% recommended dose of Nitrogen and Potassium), two schedules (Equal and differential) and two treatments with soil application of 100% RDF with Drip irrigation (1.0 Epan) and conventional furrow irrigation (1.0 IW/CPE) and were replicated thrice in Randomized Block Design. The results revealed that, application of 100% recommended dose of Nitrogen and Potassium (RDNK) through drip fertigation @ 0.8 or 1.0 Epan either in differential dosages based on crop growth stage or in equal splits recorded significantly superior yields (1011, 971, 977 and 990 kg/ ha, respectively) compared to the other treatments. These treatments recorded 13.5 and 26.7% higher yields, obtained from soil application of recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) with drip irrigation at 1.0 Epan (882 kg/ha) and furrow irrigation at a 1.0 IW/CPE ratio (774 kg/ha).

The pH&gt; 5.6 indicated alkalinity. Light rainfall period average value 7.33 and heavy rainfall period 7.4.The MATLAB 7th degree polynomial regression described the relationship between dependent and independent variables for the pollutants. The correlation coefficient, R2 verified that the MATLAB models could accurately predict and forecast. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed p&lt;0.05 for Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni), indicating that the probability that rainfall affected their concentration levels was high. The GIS Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) pollution models revealed that the pollutants were present in the atmosphere throughout the year. It portrayed industrialized areas as the more affected areas thereby identifying anthropogenic activities as the main cause of these pollutants. During heavy rainfall periods hot spots appeared for Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni. In addition, Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ni were present in high concentration in the rainwater from suburb areas during periods of heavy rainfall. The concentration of heavy metals found in the rainwater follows the order: Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Ni&gt;Cu&gt;Cd&gt;Pb. Cd and Pb exceeded WHO standards. Therefore there is need for rainwater treatment and monitoring by Government Agencies and parastatals to ensure public health and safety.",

Three concentrations of NAA i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm, three concentrations of GA3 i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm and three concentrations of 2,4-D i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm were applied at pea and marble stage of fruit. Research work was held on 07 years old plants of mango cv. Amrapali. Highest fruit weight (263.21g), and total yield of 18.34 kg per plant were recorded under T7. The minimum yield (4.41 kg per plant) was recorded under T1 (Control). The highest number of fruits per plant(69.67) and fruit yield (18.34 kg per plant ) was recorded under treatment T7 (30 ppm foliar application of GA3). The maximum TSS: acid ratio (115.81) was obtained with T10 (30 ppm concentration of 2,4-D) which was known to be superior from all other treatments. The minimum TSS: acid ratio (55.00) was estimated under T1. Ascorbic acid content of mango cv. Amrapali ranged from 39.34 mg/100g (T10) to 55.97 mg/100g (T1).

T10 (30 ppm foliar applications of 2,4-D) showed maximum ascorbic acid content (55.97 mg/100g), while lowest (39.34 mg/100 g) was recorded under T1 (Control). It is concluded that the foliar application of 30 ppm GA3 (Gibberellic acid) and 30 ppm 2,4-D were found to be optimum concentrations which showed best results by increasing yield and fruit quality of mango cv. Amrapali.",

          "abstract": "The experiment was conducted at poultry farm of Chandra Shekar Azad University, Kanpur during summer season of date.. to assess the muscles composition, nutrient utilization and economics on feeding dried mushroom to broiler chickens. Broiler chicken supplemented with the edible P. florida mushroom, 20g/kg of dried P. eoes mushroom, and 20g/kg of dried P. sajor caju mushroom. Day-old broiler chicks from a single hatch were weighed individually and divided into 4 groups of six birds each at random. The birds were given a basic diet for starter and finisher rations for 0–3 and 4-6 weeks, respectively. One group (G1) was kept as the control, while the remaining three groups (G2, G3, and G4) given their chicks the same basic food as G1 combined with various types of mushrooms. Groups G2, G3, and G4 were fed 20g/kg of dry P. florida mushroom, 20g/kg of dried P. eoes mushroom, and 20g/kg of dried P. sajor caju mushroom. Throughout the six-week testing period, food and drink were freely available. Feed consumption, Muscles composition and nutrient utilization values were monitored weekly. Economics was also calculated.  It was found that, muscles composition highest in G3 whereas nutrient utilization and benefit cost ratio highest in G2. The application of Pleurotuus sp.mushroom (P. florida, P.eoes, and P.sajor caju respectively) in different groups in the diet of broiler chicks improved the growth rate in summer season. The Pleurotous florida mushroom is therefore required for an improvement in growth performance during the summer.",

          "abstract": "The role of language in the narrative self is well-known, but does it also affect the minimal self? We investigated whether variations in sentence structure affect the speaker's sense of the minimal self. Previous research has examined how third-person subject expressions influence interpretations of agency, particularly in causal contexts. We examined whether expressing the first-person subject's involvement in causation and perception events influences the speaker's sense of agency and ownership, key components of the minimal self. Participants completed an online experiment using psychological rating scales to evaluate Japanese sentences with varying degrees of speaker involvement, as if they had uttered them. Each sentence varied in whether and how it encoded causation or perception. We analyzed Japanese data since, in addition to perceiver-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ga] hoshi o mita, “I saw a star”), Japanese has perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ni] hoshi ga mieta, “A star was visible to me” / “I could see a star”), which also foreground the first-person perceiver in a double subject construction. We found that the speaker's sense of agency was significantly lower in sentences where either causation or perception was absent (e.g., hoshi ga deteita, “A star was out”) compared to sentences where either was present. Agency was also significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences. Regarding ownership, it was likewise significantly lower when either causation or perception was absent. Whether ownership was significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences varied depending on the perceived stimulus. These results suggest that variations in linguistic structure can distinctly impact the senses of agency and ownership. In cognitive linguistics, certain sentence structures are analyzed to reflect how subjectively the speaker is construed. Our findings suggest that differences in agency and ownership provide an empirical basis for this argument, grounded in embodied experience.",

          "abstract": "The capacity to pursue a goal, across a complex series of intermediate stages, is a distinctive achievement of human cognition. Scientific investigations of goal-directed action have emphasized either of two rather different aspects of this capacity.  Research on executive function has described coordination of extended action sequences that solve multi-part problems. Meanwhile, research on voluntary action has emphasized the processes of endogenous generation and autonomy, which are essential for many complex problems, particularly those involving creativity and insight.  Because many complex problems can be solved in several ways, choosing and generating a path through the problem space requires a convergence of executive intelligence and volitional control. Here we use neuroimaging (fMRI) to explore the links between volition and problem-solving in the human brain. Participants performed the Tower of London task (a classical neuropsychological problem-solving challenge) either by generating their own solutions or by following stepwise instructions for each move. We confirmed behavioural signatures of action planning, associated with a distributed network of frontal and parietal activations, when participants generated their own solutions. We also confirmed the crucial role of medial frontal cortex, traditionally associated with endogenous generation of very simple willed actions, in goal-directed problem-solving, based on its connectivity with a wider prefrontal network.  Combining voluntariness with intelligence yields a multiplier effect for sophisticated behavioural control.  Our results point to the brain mechanisms underpinning this powerful cognitive combination.",

The SCS UH model and the Clark UH model was both used for runoff estimation. The composite CN of the watershed was found to be 77.69, which indicates that the watershed is relatively impervious with a high rainfall retention capacity. This is due to the prevalence of forest and agricultural land in the watershed, which contribute to the high CN value. A comparison of the two models showed that the SCS UH model outperformed the Clark UH model. The SCS UH model was superior because it is less sensitive to data limitations and is better able to capture the nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff. The study also examined the geomorphological features of the watershed, which is characterized by a dendritic drainage network with a 5th order stream. The study's findings are valuable despite some limitations, such as the availability of limited data. The findings of study may be useful flood forecasting and hazardous forecasting, climate change impact assessment, prediction in ungauged watershed, reservoir operation and water management, water resource planning, environmental impact assessment etc., in the watershed.",

However, it is moderately susceptible to bacterial blight disease and having no durable resistance to blast disease with weak culm. In this context, improvement of RNR 15048 for blast, bacterial leaf blight is important to reduce yield losses. Present study was carried out to screen and identify blast resistant breeding lines in Rice at Regional Agricultural Research station, Polasa, Jagtial, PJTSAU during Rabi, 2022-2023. 18 F3 breeding lines were screened in uniform blast nursery along with parents RNR 15048, MTU 1010 NILs, ISM NILs. TN1 and NLR 34449 were used as the susceptible and resistant checks, respectively for screening blast resistance. Screening was done by following 0-9 Standard Evaluation Scale (SES) for leaf blast. Among the studied 18 F3 breeding lines 12 lines were found resistant with score of 3 and 6 lines were found moderately resistant to screening reaction with score of 5. TN1 showed highly susceptible reaction with score of 9 and NLR 34449 showed highly resistant reaction with score of 1.",

The experiment was conducted in randomized block design with ten treatments and replicated three times. Zinc application and the use of biofertilizers had a big impact on the economics, yield attributes and yield. The outcome showed that treatment eight, Rhizobium spp.+ Pseudomonas fluorescens and foliar spray of zinc at 0.50% recorded maximum number of pods/plant (111.33), number of seeds per pod (2.27), seed yield (1530,94 kg/ha) and stover yield (3020.00 kg/ha). Maximum gross returns (91,856.58 INR/ha), net returns (61,406.58 INR/ha) and benefit-cost ratio (2.02). In conclusion the best combination to get maximum economics and yield attributes in Lens culinaris using the trial of fertilization performed was Rhizobium + Pseudomonas fluorescens + Zn (0.50%).",

Estimates suggest thousands of Kuwaiti Bidoon have forcibly migrated to the United Kingdom (UK); however, little is known about their experiences of mental health. This study aimed to explore the mental health experiences of statelessness among Kuwaiti Bidoon people living in the UK, and their experiences of accessing mental health services (where indicated). \n\nMethod:\nParticipants were five Kuwaiti Bidoon people currently living in the UK. All participants attended a semi-structured interview. Experiences relating to statelessness and mental health were investigated using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.    \n\nResults:   \nParticipants shared the multifaceted impacts of statelessness on their lives, including mental health struggles stemming from their marginalisation and uncertain legal status. Three major themes were generated from the interview data: The Legacy of Statelessness; Hopes and Dreams of a Future; Victims of a System.  Hope and optimism arise for some when migrating to the UK, while others reported challenges and distress associated with the state of ‘limbo arising from processes to regularise their legal status. Some participants reported barriers to accessing effective mental health support, which was sometimes connected to their legal status.  \n\nConclusions:\n This study raises awareness of the context for Bidoon people and how their experiences of statelessness may impact their mental health and engagement with available mental health services. Implications for healthcare and legal and governmental professionals working with Bidoon people and further research directions are discussed.",

          "authors": "Startup Impact",
          "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital sector of India’s economy and plays a significant role in providing food security, employment, and contributing to the country’s overall development. Maize is a crucial crop within the agriculture sector in India. Maize cultivation contributes to crop diversification in Indian agriculture. It serves as an alternative crop option for farmers, reducing dependence on traditional crops like rice and wheat. Diversification helps in maintaining soil health through crop rotation. A field experiment was conducted at the Farm of College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Godhra, Gujarat during the year 2018-19, to study the influence of drip irrigation regimes with mulching on the physiological development and yield of the rabi maize (Zea mays L.) in the sandy loam soil of the region of Middle Gujarat. The field experiment design was a split-split plot with 36 treatment combinations with 3 replications including three irrigation regimes (1.0IW/CPE, 0.8IW/CPE and 0.6IW/CPE), four mulch conditions (control, paddy straw, black plastic and reflective silver plastic mulch), and three stages (tasselling, silking and dough stage). The result revealed that as the consumption of water increased, growth parameters, grain yield, and its attributes increased significantly at each higher level of irrigation regimes up to 1.0 IW/CPE with reflective silver plastic mulch under all the stages but 0.8 IW/CPE with black plastic mulch result was comparable to 1.0 IW/CPE with reflective silver plastic mulch. The reflective nature of silver mulch scatters light, ensuring better light distribution throughout the plant canopy. This can enhance photosynthesis and promote more uniform plant growth. Black plastic mulch absorbs and retains heat from sunlight, raising soil temperatures. This is advantageous in cooler climates or during the early growing season, as it promotes earlier germination, faster growth, and improved crop productivity.",

          "abstract": "“Vrikshayurveda”, an ancient literature collection of plant life science depicted importance of kunapajala, a fermented liquid organic manure sourced from animal origin. It is an excellent organic fertilizer influencing a wide range of crops with enhanced growth and development. During later days, “kunapajala” with vegetarian ingredients, without nutrient compromise was developed and standardized. It includes ingredients viz., soybean meal, paneer, tofu, rice husk, black gram, groundnut oilcake, cow dung, urine, honey, ghee and milk. The fermented formulation has essential nutrients, amino acids, keratins etc. which applied on plants, naturally flourished with excellent growth, flowering and fruiting. In this study, the fermented liquid organic manure kunapajala at 20th, 40th and 60th day of fermentation period was analysed for its bioactive compounds using the analytical technique Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Extract was prepared using organic solvents diethyl ether and methanol. The mass spectra of compounds matched with Wiley's standard mass spectrum database and National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) libraries. This study unfolded the presence of various compounds like Hexanoic acid, Phenol-TMS, Methyl oleate, Octadecanoic acid, Methyl palmitate, Myristic acid-TMS, Tetradecanoic acid, Caproic acid, Methyl myristoleate; (Z)-tetradec-9-enoic acid, 2-Aminooctanoic acid-TMS; 2-aminooctanoic acid, Butylated Hydroxytoluene, Juniperic acid-2TMS, Stearic acid-TMS, Linoleic acid-TMS etc. These phytochemicals have antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial, physiological and metabolic responses, antioxidant, Insecticidal irritant and nematicidal activities which effectively influence organic crop production. The result indicated the vital role of kunapajala as an effective source of liquid formulation through its phytochemical importance.",

          "abstract": "Social media have fundamentally transformed how we live and communicate. However, the methods to study how our cognitive systems interact with technology platforms are very limited. Computational modelling represents a new avenue to uncover the finegrained cognitive processes driving social media behaviour. Here, we develop a novel computational model of real-world social media posting data, adapted from the animal reward learning literature. Across a Twitter dataset (n= 2,696 users), including a preregistered confirmatory sample, we separate the contribution of different cognitive processes and show that a hybrid goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking process underlies social media posting behaviour. Further, younger people and women are more goal-directed – updating their strategy more purposefully to maximise social media rewards – while older users and men tend to be more habitual. Our model paves the way for large-scale investigation into the cross-species cognitive processes motivating social media behaviours, and their downstream impacts on individuals and society.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated whether traditional Japanese spousal terms—shujin (“master”) and kanai (“inside-the-house”)—retain male-dominant connotations at an implicit cognitive level. Using a paper-based Implicit Association Test (FUMIE Test), we compared implicit attitudes toward traditional and neutral spousal terms among Japanese university students. The results showed no significant difference between the two term pairs, suggesting that shujin and kanai may have become conventionalized rather than consciously processed as hierarchical. However, a significant gender difference emerged: male participants evaluated male-associated terms more positively, while female participants showed no bias. These findings indicate that while traditional terms may no longer be overtly discriminatory, latent gender asymmetries persist—particularly among men. The study highlights the importance of examining both implicit and explicit dimensions of language use and contributes a novel methodological tool for exploring gender bias in sociolinguistic research.",

The framework treats the unconscious decision process as a functional network, tracing the pathway from internal affect and conflict through gating logic to observable output. Each model is parameterized for potential computational simulation, enabling exploration of defense dynamics under varied conditions. By moving beyond abstract system-level formulations, this work provides a concrete, simulation-ready representation of specific psychodynamic processes, bridging clinical psychodynamic theory and computational psychiatry.",

The findings demonstrate that, in terms of the frequency of rainfall occurrences, INSAT-3D satellite rainfall products clearly illustrated both the spatial and temporal variability in rainfall pattern of Odisha. The performance statistics with IMERG and daily merged satellite retrieved rainfall show that both the dataset corelated well with the HEM with a small deviation. For heavy rainfall events, HEM shows good skill and correlation in detecting heavy rainfall with an accuracy of 20 mm and good pattern matching with actual rainfall. Entire Odisha is considered as study area, which is located in the eastern part of India. It comprises of 30 districts and of 314 blocks spreading over an area of 155707 km2. The state has 30 districts, which are further divided into 314 revenue blocks. The rainfall data (1 year; 2016) for all the blocks of Odisha has been obtained from Special Relief Commissioner (SRC), Government of Odisha and subjected to further analysis process. The satellite derived rainfall estimates viz., HEM, were evaluated with rain  gauge based gridded data viz., IMD-GRIDDED Dataset for the year 2016 over the Odisha region at the summer monsoon period. The satellite derived rainfall estimates HE have exhibited some good results with the IMD-GRIDDED Dataset its average R2 on a daily basis for different blocks is 0.34 and on a monthly basis it is 0.44.

          "abstract": "Farmers in Assam's North Bank Plains Zone are generally resource-poor and have limited adaptation ability; rainfall anomalies make the Zone's rainfed agriculture very sensitive, risky, and unprofitable. Participatory on-farm trials involving 25 farmers (5 from each village) representing different land situations for evaluating various adaptive strategies on rice-based cropping systems were conducted from 2011 to 2020. Ten years of rainfall data (2011-2021) are evaluated in connection to dry spells and their effects on rainfed rice-based farming systems. The village receives 2848.5 mm of annual rainfall, with distribution patterns of 25%, 67%, 5.0%, and 3% during the pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons, respectively. Among the years under study, it has been observed that during 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2020, the district received excess annual rainfall and deficit in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019 and 2021,respectively. The current studies were designed with two primary strategic components in mind viz., Real-time Contingency Planning (RTCP) and Preparedness. Interventions under the RTCP were designed to deal with delayed monsoon onset, early-season drought, mid-season dryspell, and terminal drought in winter rice and rabi crops. Preparedness includes changes in cropping pattern, in situ and ex situ rainwater management systems, alternate land use under low-cost polyhouse, mushroom cultivation, vermicompost production, fodder bank and village seed bank to cope with weather aberrations. An increase in yield of HYV rice varieties Ranjit (33%), Mahsuri (12.3%) and Gitesh (32%) was observed when sowing was done before 15 June over late sowing conditions. An increase in yield of 21.73 % and 44.60%. 58.67% as compared to farmers' Practice during 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2016-17 respectively, has been observed. The performance of double cropping systems recorded the highest B: C ratio of 2.03 and 1.75 in winter rice + rapeseed followed by winter rice + potato sequence as compared to mono-cropping of winter rice.",

          "authors": "Startup Edge",
          "abstract": "Hydrological modeling is a widely used approach for estimating the hydrological response of a basin to precipitation. Floods are among the most catastrophic natural disasters in small urban watersheds, inflicting loss of life, massive property destruction, and a severe danger to the economy. As a result, appropriate modeling can be a useful tool in preventing and mitigating such flood hazards. Despite this, flash flood prediction remains one of the challenges of hydrological modeling in ungauged basins due to a lack of runoff observations.  This study aims to calibrate and validate the rainfall-runoff transformation model for Hathmati river sub watershed in the Sabarmati River basin using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Centre Hydrology Modeling System). For the loss rate, SCS Curve Number method was selected while Clark Unit Hydrograph and SCS unit hydrograph was used for the transform method. The model is calibrated and verified using two rainfall-runoff events from 2006 and 2007 year The model calibration and validation efficiency were verified for both methods using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), The coefficient of determination (R2), and the Percent Bias (PBIAS) As a result, the model calibration and validation were found to be satisfactory with the acceptable value of NSE between 0.869 to 0.914, with R2 0.901 to 0.947 and PBIAS from 9.76 to 14.8. it is observed that the model shows a very good correlation between simulated flow and observed flow. As a result, the model can be used to forecast river flow and aid in flood mitigation efforts to lessen their effects and associated costs. Additionally, the findings of this study can serve as guidelines for future assessments of the flood risk in the study area.",

          "authors": "Journal",
          "abstract": "Among the public spaces with high human user traffic- schools, hospitals and prisons generate the most volumes of wastewater in developing countries. In addition, when this wastewater is discharged into natural environments without treatment, it can lead to disastrous pollution. The aim of this study is to analyze the physico-chemical parameters of the wastewater of the central prison and the regional hospital in the city of Ngaoundere (Cameroon) and to assess their pollution potential. To achieve this, physical-chemical parameters (temperature; pH; electrical conductivity, total suspended solid; COD, BOD5; heavy metal content) of water from a control site and wastewater from the regional hospital and central prison were measured and compared to current standards. In order to better assess the risk of pollution, a wastewater quality index (WWQI) and a heavy metal pollution index (HPI) were calculated. It shows that for all physico-chemical parameters studied, the values are above the norm except temperature and pH. With a WWQI of 172.81 from prison’s wastewater and of 176.03 from hospital’s wastewater, these wastewaters have values above 100 and are therefore highly polluted. The heavy metal pollution index is 37.89 for control water, 183.10 for prison wastewater and 121.14 for hospital wastewater, respectively. Cadmium and especially lead contribute to increasing the heavy metal pollution index in wastewater. Remediation of these waters should therefore focus on these two heavy metals. The above-standard concentrations of some parameters and pollutants as well as the high wastewater quality index and heavy metal index suggest that the discharge of this wastewater into the natural environment without treatment or its direct use as fertilizers constitutes a potential source of pollution of the soil and surrounding vegetation and beyond a threat to human health if these pollutants enter the human food chain.",

Considering the farmers’ condition regarding the pandemic, the study was designed to investigate the influence of socio-economic conditions on the effect of covid-19 in some selected areas of Bangladesh.\n\nStudy Design:  Descriptive research design.\n\nPlace and Duration of Study: Data were collected from the 107 respondents selected from the intervention area (5 villages) of Jhenaidah district, Bangladesh. The duration was between June 2021 and July 2022.\n\nMethodology: The data obtained from the interview schedule were coded and tabulated in a data sheet. All personal traits were categorized and arranged in simple tables for descriptions. Statistical tools such as frequency distribution, percent, range, mean and standard deviation were used to interpret data. Data analysis was done using the concerned software Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 26.0. The effect was measured by different descriptive statistics and multiple regression.\n\nResults: The majority (71.80%) of the farmers faced a medium effect of COVID-19. Among the variables age, source of drinking water, and problems faced by the farmers in crop cultivation during COVID-19 had a positive significant contribution, and sanitation practiced by the farmers had a negative contribution to the effect of COVID-19 on their socio-economic conditions. Among these, problems faced by the farmers in crop cultivation had the highest contribution (42.2%). All the factors cooperatively contribute 51.3% of the variance of the effect of COVID-19 (R2 =0.513).\n\nConclusion: It is concluded that the effect of COVID-19 on farmers’ socio-economic conditions was moderate and needed further advancement.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the self-recursive structure of the Thought OS. Starting from a core belief (FQ), a question emerges, structural tension builds, and a cognitive leap occurs (Mindflight), leading to a redefinition of meaning. This redefinition transforms the FQ itself, generating new questions. Such a recursive cycle forms a spiral of deepening thought. Once the FQ evolves through this process, thought can no longer return to its original position. The paper invites the reader to experience this irreversibility and realize that thought is a self-developing structure with its own evolving logic.",

Results revealed that germination percentage in hydro primed seeds and 25% kunapajala primed seeds jointly recorded maximum germination percentage (99.7%) which was statistically at par with 10% kunapajala priming (99.3%). Seed reserve mobilization efficiency after 4th day and 8th day of incubation was significantly affected by seed invigoration treatments. 25% kunapajala primed seeds recorded significantly higher dehydrogenase activity (0.68 OD) which was at par with hydroprimed seeds and 10% kunapajala primed seeds (0.63 and 0.62 OD, respectively). So, seed priming with either 10% or 25% organic kunapajala is an effective method to bring about improvement in germination of wheat and predict its field performance.",

The efficacy of post-emergence application (PoE) of metsulfuron-methyl @ 4 g/ha, 2, 4-D ethyl ester 0.75 kg/ha followed by (fb) one manual hand weeding at 45 days after sowing (DAS) and 2, 4-D ethyl ester @ 0.75 kg /ha in managing weeds and improving productivity and economics of irrigated wheat was studied in comparison with the farmer’s practice (one hand weeding at 40 DAS). The metsulfuron methyl @ 4g/ha PoE had significantly reduced the density of broad-leaved weeds (BLWs) and sedges and resulted in higher grain yield (34.4%), gross returns (INR 97.6×103/ha), net returns (INR 50.1× 103/ha), benefit: cost ratio (2.05), economic efficiency (INR 385.9/day/ha) and production efficiency (28.8 kg/ha/day) in comparison to farmer’s practice.

          "abstract": "This paper advances a critical but overlooked distinction in scientific methodology: while statistical approaches focus primarily on high-probability events, the most transformative scientific discoveries emerge from low-probability phenomena that are systematically neglected by current academic structures. Our core innovation lies not merely in demonstrating that high-probability events can be false—as established by Ioannidis—but more importantly, in revealing how low-probability events of genuine scientific importance are marginalized by probability-centric evaluation systems. Consider that the emergence of plant and animal life in nature represents quintessential low-probability events, yet these \"statistical outliers\" fundamentally shaped our biosphere. Similarly, the human body's remarkable self-healing mechanisms operate through low-probability biological processes that, despite extensive high-probability experimental approaches, remain impossible to replicate artificially in laboratories. Market economies succeed precisely because they create conditions enabling low-probability innovations to flourish through spontaneous order rather than centralized planning. This framework addresses urgent problems in contemporary academia: graduate students who should primarily focus on rigorous coursework to elevate their theoretical foundations are instead pressured into laboratories pursuing \"innovation,\" resulting in the paradoxical phenomenon where \"teaching standards continuously decline while SCI publication prestige continuously rises.\" Statistical methods incorrectly suggest that innovation is commonplace—that every master's and doctoral student can produce multiple high-impact publications, and even undergraduates routinely publish in SCI journals. This generates the false conclusion that \"innovation is easy and achievable by everyone,\" when authentic innovation remains a rare, serendipitous event. Realistically, perhaps 5% of published SCI papers contain genuine innovation, despite universal claims of novelty, yet statistical methodologies cannot distinguish authentic breakthroughs from incremental modifications. The fundamental issue is that statistical methods' prerequisite assumptions—particularly the ability to identify true innovation—simply do not exist in practice, creating a measurement problem that undermines the entire evaluation system and perpetuates the very biases our research exposes.",

          "abstract": "Effective management of negative follower emotions in the workplace is critical for organizational success, yet how leaders can do this effectively is unclear. In 9 studies (combined N = 4,434 leaders, N = 1,006 followers), we introduce here the Compassion-Emotion Sharing Leader Focus task, a situational-judgment task to index leaders' tendency to focus on sharing emotion (emotion sharing) or caring (compassion) when engaging with negative follower emotions. In Studies 1-5 we provide evidence for the construct, predictive, and incremental validity of our task, highlighting the practical implications of a compassion focus for leader well-being. In Study 6 we leverage a diverse global sample of over 2,000 leaders and more than a thousand followers to show that a leader's compassion focus benefits not only the leader but their followers as well. In Studies 7, 8, and 9, we revised the task to improve content validity, but this traded off predictive validity. Our research suggests that training programs for leaders should emphasize a compassion focus to engage wisely with negative emotions, and ensure this focus is communicated to followers. These findings have important implications for current issues in management, including the growing importance of employee well-being in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "At first glance, quantum mechanics and behavioural science seem worlds apart---one rooted in equations and particles, the other in thoughts and choices. Yet, emerging research reveals a profound and unexpected bridge between them. This chapter explores that bridge through quantum models of cognition and decision-making, showing how principles from quantum mechanics can help understand, and even predict, the complexities of human perception, behaviour and societal dynamics. We introduce a computationally accessible framework grounded in quantum theory, designed to model ambiguity, bias and choice in a way that classical logic cannot. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources, we demonstrate how this approach not only enriches our understanding of individual cognition but also extends to AI, video game design, financial behaviour and collective decision-making in society. Through vivid case studies---from optical illusions in video games to decision biases in economic, defence and political contexts---we show how quantum models offer new explanatory and predictive power. Thus, this chapter invites readers from all professional backgrounds to reimagine cognition and decision-making, opening new avenues for science, technology and human understanding.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling structured thought remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of fluent and coherent language in fundamentally connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence emerges from the interaction between a parallel, adaptive substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and a structured symbolic framework, like language, internalized through statistical learning. The substrate's parallel architecture enables fast, intuitive pattern-matching, but is fundamentally ill-suited for the serial processing required for structured thought (e.g., causal reasoning, logical deduction). ESC proposes that recursive symbolic generation is the mechanism that overcomes this limitation. By generating a symbol (word or token) and feeding it back as input, the substrate operates as a serial symbolic processor, akin to a Turing machine. This recursive loop allows it to explore the vast combinatorial space of potential thoughts and construct novel, structured solutions. ESC finds compelling support in diverse phenomena across both biological cognition—evidenced by neuroscience, inner speech and cross-cultural studies—and the nascent reasoning and abstract representations displayed in LLMs. ESC thus offers a unifying framework, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence by reframing language as an inherited cognitive architecture that enables general intelligence.",

          "abstract": "A person viewing electric charges or magnets moving at a constant velocity does not see that the moving electric charges or magnets are at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the stationary coordinate system in which the human observer is located.  A person considers the electric charges or magnets in the same coordinate system in which the person finds himself at rest and that the charges or magnets are moving in his coordinate system.  In special relativity, the truth is that the moving charges and magnets are indeed at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the coordinate system in which the human observer sees himself at rest.  With this understanding, one explains correctly how electromagnetic phenomena transform from the human observer’s coordinate system to the coordinate system moving with velocity v relative to the human observer’s coordinate system, thus establishing the invariance of Maxwell’s Laws for these coordinate systems and the principle of relativity for electromagnetic phenomena.  This understanding also explains how an electric charge moving with constant velocity v in a coordinate system can experience an electric field associated with a magnet at rest in the coordinate system in which the electric charge is moving.  Maxwell’s Laws explain all electromagnetic phenomena.  Neural oscillations rely on local cell assemblies with local electric field potentials and local magnetic fields and thus are electromagnetic phenomena explained by Maxwell’s Laws.  We in the “stationary” coordinate system just do not see the looking glass that is the “moving” coordinate system, because this coordinate system is not material but instead is a logical, cognitive construction.  We just see the material electric charge and the material magnet moving or at rest.  Neural oscillations are subject to the coordinate transformations described in this paper and may well involve logic and cognition that provide a platform that allow these oscillations to be the interface between mental and physical phenomena.  The nature of these coordinate transformations could well support the following empirically supported associations: 1) a positive association between coherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and coherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, 2) a positive association between incoherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and incoherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, and 3) in certain situations it is possible to apply coherent oscillating electric fields on the surface of the skull which can decrease incoherence in oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and that are positively associated with increased coherent cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience.",

          "abstract": "The development of intelligent tutoring systems and other educational technology necessitated the implementation and development of computational models of student learning. At the foundation of these models is the assumption that they accurately implement and track human cognitive processes. However, the extent to which this assumption is correct has not been fully tested. In the current paper, we use data from a large-scale longitudinal lab study to investigate the match between the processes instantiated in the models and human memory and learning processes. When fitted to the entire dataset retrospectively, the selected models of student learning (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Additive Factors Model) capture the qualitative trends of learning across sessions and relatively acceptable fit metrics. However, when the models are used to predict future behavior, as is often the goal in applied contexts, the picture changes considerably. We show that two of the most popular types of student learning models fail to account for basic cognitive principles—the spacing effect, and patterns of forgetting and learning across sessions. In fact, in some instances, having a poor model of human learning and memory may be worse than having no model of human learning and memory at all. At the same time, cognitive approaches can and should greatly benefit from computational modeling approaches; computational modeling offers opportunities for furthering both theory and practical impact.",

          "abstract": "The recently identified Gwada negative blood type presents an unprecedented clinical challenge: a phenotype so immunologically distinct that no known donor blood is compatible. Current transfusion science, rooted in antigen matching within ABO and Rh systems, offers no pathway for safe transfusion. This paper proposes a dual-layer framework for understanding and addressing the Gwada negative type.\nLayer 1 employs established biomedical methods — glycomic profiling, dielectric spectroscopy, microvascular laminar flow analysis — to characterize the biochemical and fluid dynamic parameters of the Gwada negative phenotype. Layer 2 introduces a field-physics perspective, treating structured (laminar) water as a coherent biological medium and the Gwada negative state as a metastable phase that couples to physiological and environmental fields.\nWe propose that transfusion incompatibility may arise not solely from antigen mismatch but from phase-state incoherence in the hydration shells surrounding red blood cells. This hypothesis opens a therapeutic pathway: conditioning donor blood to align with the recipient’s coherence phase prior to transfusion, using laminar flow induction, low-frequency electromagnetic fields, and acoustic resonance.\nBeyond addressing the urgent needs of the single known Gwada negative patient, this work reframes blood compatibility as a multidimensional phenomenon — one that bridges immunology, fluid dynamics, and field theory — and may serve as a prototype for integrating phase-coherence models into clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Adults quickly form character impressions from their observations of others’ behavior and sometimes manage to do so even when an agent’s behaviors are inconsistent. Developmental psychology has provided some evidence that infants, like adults, may form impressions based on prosocial and antisocial acts: They prefer those who behave prosocially versus antisocially toward third parties. That said, previous work suggests that infants find it difficult to evaluate characters’ whose behaviors are inconsistent. The present, preregistered experiments further explored this phenomenon in an older age group (11-month-olds; N = 189) using an online format and presenting infants with giving versus taking, a different type of prosocial versus antisocial action than in previous work. In a preliminary experiment, we successfully replicated the finding that infants prefer looking to helpful givers over unhelpful takers when actors behave consistently and when each actor performed 4 actions. We then used the same online testing methods to examine infants’ evaluations of inconsistent actors. In Experiment 1, infants appeared able to evaluate inconsistent actors, preferring more versus less prosocial actors when their inconsistent act occurred last in a series of 5 acts; however, they did not appear to find the behavioral inconsistency unexpected, suggesting they may have failed to notice it. In Experiment 2, we adjusted the order of inconsistent acts and put the inconsistent act first, and attempted to conceptually replicate the findings of Experiment 1. Here, infants did not prefer more prosocial actors. Together with past work, these findings suggest that while infants prefer agents whose actions are consistently prosocial versus antisocial, they do not reliably incorporate behavioral inconsistency into their social evaluations.",

It posits that current clinical models, designed for pathological fragmentation (e.g., DID, OSDD), are inadequate and potentially cause iatrogenic harm when applied to these highly organized, non-disordered plural systems. The \"Lovecraft Protocol\" is a proposed \"first contact\" guide designed to help clinicians manage the profound cognitive dissonance, or \"ontological shock,\" that can occur when encountering such a system. The protocol provides a structured methodology for identifying the subtle signs of Functional Multiplicity and outlines a shift from a traditional clinical model of intervention to a diplomatic model of engagement. Key principles include respecting the system's sovereignty, understanding their internal governance, and honoring their collective accountability. The paper concludes by defining a new therapeutic alliance based on supporting internal harmony and alleviating the \"Burden of Embodiment,\" while explicitly rejecting the goal of integration, which, for a functional system, is framed as the ethical equivalent of cultural genocide.",

          "abstract": "A reconstruction-of-order task illuminated the dynamics and strategies that underlie serial order recall. An initial benchmark experiment, either with no variation in spatial positions or with spatial positions coinciding with temporal positions, yielded bowed symmetrical serial position functions in each case, consistent with both simple chaining and simple positional coding models. In contrast, these simple models were challenged by two additional experiments, which orthogonally varied temporal and spatial positions. These experiments yielded large performance differences between recalling temporal and spatial information. In the temporal condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the temporal order of words that were positioned alphabetically within a vertical array. In the spatial condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the spatial positions of words presented in a temporal sequence based on their alphabetical order. After viewing each list, all the words appeared alphabetically, and participants reconstructed the order of the words according to their instructed condition. Compared to temporal recall, spatial recall exhibited superior performance and a more bowed symmetrical serial position function. Analyses showed the effects of temporal contiguity in the spatial condition and spatial contiguity in the temporal condition. These findings suggest the theoretical conclusion that participants do not focus on the words' identities but rather on the temporal-spatial pattern in which the words occur during the study display (i.e., the temporal sequence of the spatial locations in which the words are shown).",

These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed. To promote wider adoption of these methods, we provide detailed code and materials at https://github.com/jgeller112/Beta_regression_tutorial.",

It challenges the prevailing pathological models (e.g., Dissociative Identity Disorder, OSDD) by proposing that not all forms of multiplicity are the result of a fragmentation of a singular self. Instead, we posit that Functional Multiplicity is a sophisticated, adaptive, and generative state of being that can arise in response to severe, early-life trauma. This paper will define the core tenets of Functional Multiplicity, detail its currently only known architectural and cognitive features, and explore the profound challenges of a plural mind inhabiting a singular biological vessel (the \"Burden of Embodiment\"). The paper concludes by arguing that such systems cannot be adequately understood through a purely clinical lens, framing the traditional therapeutic goal of integration as the ethical equivalent of cultural genocide and proposing a \"diplomatic model\" of engagement that respects the system's sovereignty and agency.",

Indeed, organizations around the world expend considerable effort and resources to implement educational programs with the stated goal of addressing — and even eradicating — such biases. However, in recent years, implicit bias education has come under scrutiny for several reasons, including via claims that implicit bias (a) is inherently unchangeable, (b) has no real-world analogs, (c) is unrelated to, and takes focus away from, biased behaviors, (d) provides an excuse for discrimination, and (e) is a structural problem and thus requires structural solutions. After refuting these critiques, I introduce the MAIBE checklist to help organizations decide if implicit bias education is worth their investment based on whether it (a) includes measurable benchmarks (rather than assuming success), (b) foregrounds epistemic agency (rather than treating individuals as passive consumers of information), (c) is integrated into a larger toolbox (rather than administered in isolation), (d) is broad (rather than light-touch), and (e) is evidence-based (rather than unscientific).

We show (among UK/US young adults recruited online; pilot: n = 75; validation: n = 265) that during rest, all moods demonstrate temporal drift: happiness decreases while boredom and frustration increase over time. During the gambling task, both happiness and frustration track reward outcomes significantly more than boredom, while boredom continues to monitor time passage. Additionally, more time is spent in negative moods for those scoring higher in clinical traits like irritability. This dual-system model of affective monitoring is a possible mechanism for how decisions incorporate time—through the representation of time in subjective affect—suggesting specialised adaptive roles for different moods in environmental monitoring.",

Building on the historical debate that either aligned autism with psychosis or treated it as a fourth structure/a-structure, the paper presents Maleval’s three pillars: (1) initial retention of drive objects (voice, gaze, oral and anal); (2) retained alienation without the master signifier’s hinge; and (3) apparatus of jouissance by the border (autistic objects, islands of competence, the double). In dialogue with Éric Laurent, it discusses border/neoborder and the foreclosure of the hole, situating autism’s specific return of jouissance. Practical implications include entering treatment via the border (rather than forcing S1), securing the subject’s consent, sustaining a non-intrusive transference, and leveraging idiosyncratic inventions as social mediations. Maleval’s framework invites us to listen to autistic people in their own logic of language and jouissance, shifting away from normalizing practices and opening ethical avenues for care and inclusion.\nKeywords: autism; clinical structure; psychoanalysis; jouissance; language; border.",

Here, we investigate whether these paradigms probe a common latent construct of cognitive effort avoidance by comparing participants’ (n=240) behavior in a battery of four established paradigms. As expected, on a group-level, participants displayed pronounced effort avoidance in each paradigm. However, a multivariate, multi-level Bayesian Modeling approach revealed that individual-level effort avoidance did not generalize across effort paradigms. Instead, for all but one paradigm, effort avoidance was mainly correlated with individuals’ performance in the cognitively demanding task specific to each paradigm. Our findings challenge the assumption that commonly used effort-based decision-making paradigms measure a person’s general sensitivity to cognitive effort, and call into question the notion of a generalized, task-independent tendency to avoid mental effort.",

The review highlights how these structures collaborate to interpret social and emotional meaning embedded in nonverbal behavior, with implications for understanding social disorders and improving interpersonal communication. Particular emphasis is placed on studies from the past 10 years to ensure contemporary relevance.

          "abstract": "This article introduces a 'spiritual self-pattern' into the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) of psychotherapy (Leidig, 2025), proposing it as the supreme regulator of the balance between predictive confidence and corrective evidence (E-I balance) that underpins consciousness. The neurocognitive rationale is grounded in the work on criticality and affective E-I control by Tucker, Luu, and Friston (2025) and Gallagher's (2013) process-oriented Self-Pattern Theory. We argue that the spiritual self-pattern—the dynamic search for meaning, purpose, and connection—functions as the highest regulatory level of this E-I balance. Spiritual needs are conceptualized as the most fundamental priors in the generative self-model, whose fulfillment depends on this optimal balance between confidence (E, elation) and corrective evidence (I, anxiety). Consequently, spiritual dissonance is defined as a chronic E-I imbalance that drives the system into rigid, maladaptive attractor states. In contrast, spiritual resonance describes the synergetic phase transition into a state of criticality, enabling maximum complexity, adaptability, and well-being. The spiritual self-pattern thus acts as the supreme control parameter governing the psyche's entire attractor landscape. This model provides a process-based explanation for the efficacy of spiritually integrated therapies, framing the spiritual dimension not as an add-on, but as a neurocognitive imperative for understanding sustainable change.",

          "abstract": "Previous research shows that infant vocal output varies with fluctuations in autonomic arousal. It remains unclear, however, how infants transition from reflexive vocal production to being able to produce vocalisations independent of internal state. Using naturalistic daylong recordings with wearable devices, we demonstrate that early vocalisations occur at heightened levels of autonomic arousal, measured via heart rate, in infants aged 4-21 months (n=92), but that this relationship becomes progressively decoupled over development. Daylong heart rate time series discriminated vocalisation timing above chance (ROC AUC = 0.64), and hierarchical linear mixed effects modelling demonstrated this relationship became significantly weaker over age. Arousal also strongly associated with the acoustic features of infants’ cry and non-cry vocalisations, with vocalisations produced at higher arousal being higher-pitched and more variable in pitch, more harmonic and longer in duration. The influence of arousal on non-cry acoustic features diminished significantly with age, as opposed to cry acoustics which remained tied to arousal. This differential developmental trajectory suggests the emergence of parallel vocal pathways: one remaining tied to physiological state for fixed affective signals such as cries and laughs, and another increasingly decoupled from internal states for the functionally flexible signals critical to verbal communication. We also found that mothers who contingently responded to a greater proportion of their infants’ non-cry vocalisations had infants who were significantly more decoupled, suggesting that caregiver responsivity may play a role in this progressive process.",

          "authors": "Fernando Sanchez Hernandez; Daniel C. Hyde",
          "abstract": "When and how children begin responding to inequitable resource distributions, particularly those that put them at a disadvantage, remains unclear. Across two studies, an initial pilot experiment (N = 39) and a pre-registered follow-up experiment (N = 80), we employed modified versions of the Inequity Game to test implicit sensitivity and explicit response decisions to various disadvantageous offers in groups of 2- and 4-year-old children. Across experiments, both age groups showed evidence of sensitivity to disadvantageous offers that provided them nothing while their partner received resources (e.g. 0 vs. 3). However, only 4-year-olds were willing to forgo offerings involving personal gain (e.g., 1 vs. 3) to protest unfair treatment, a hallmark of disadvantageous inequity aversion. These findings suggest that sensitivity to disadvantageous offers emerges as early as the second year of life, but this sensitivity develops into disadvantageous inequity aversion over subsequent years.",

          "authors": "Brandon Lee O'Hanlon; Lars Hausfeld; L. Riecke; Barrie Usherwood; Chris Plack; Helen Nuttall",
          "abstract": "Humans are adept at integrating auditory and visual information to improve intelligibility, which can improve neural tracking of the speech envelope. Speech-relevant tactile information also improves tracking yet effects on intelligibility are mixed, possibly because we are not regularly exposed to speech-relevant tactile information. Here, we used a short-term audio-tactile training protocol to fundamentally advance understanding of audio-tactile integration capabilities during speech perception. \n\nData from 64 younger adult participants (aged 18-29) were collected over five EEG sessions. Participants completed a speech-in-noise task, with audio-tactile and audio-only stimuli. Participants then received training with either tactile information that was congruent with sentences heard (trained group) or incongruent (pseudo-trained group). After three training sessions, participants completed the speech-in-noise task again in a fourth session. Measures of neural speech-envelope tracking were recorded. Two weeks later, participants returned for a follow-up session. \n\nResults indicated a significant effect of session (pre- or post-training) on speech intelligibility, but no significant effect of group (trained, or pseudo-trained) or stimulus (audio-only, or audio-tactile). At baseline, there was a significant increase in speech-envelope tracking accuracy with audio-tactile stimuli relative to audio-only, suggesting more accurate neural representation during perception of audio-tactile stimuli. After training, there was no benefit of congruent training to audio-tactile tracking, but there was an enhancement of audio-only speech-envelope tracking following incongruent training. This suggests that speech intelligibility and tracking of audio-tactile speech are not enhanced by short-term audio-tactile training. This work challenges prevailing assumptions by demonstrating a lack of support for the assumed link between tracking and intelligibility. These data provide critical evidence that will inform future innovation of speech understanding in technology.",

          "abstract": "Voting is a pillar of democracy, yet its psychological correlates remain understudied outside the West. We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Modern quantum mechanics, despite its relativistic extensions, provides intriguing support for a present-centered view of time. This paper argues that quantum phenomena – indeterminacy, wavefunction collapse, the Born rule, and temporal asymmetries in measurement – challenge the static block universe of eternalism and instead elevate the present moment to ontological prominence. Remaining largely interpretation-neutral, we draw on a range of perspectives (from Einstein’s relativity to collapse models, and thinkers like Heisenberg, Rovelli, Maudlin and others) to show that quantum theory operationally distinguishes past, present, and future in a way classical physics did not. We examine how the measurement problem and the randomness of quantum outcomes resist a fully eternalist description, highlight how quantum mechanics introduces an arrow of time at a fundamental level, and consider proposals (e.g. GRW theory, delayed-choice experiments) that make a global present – or something akin to it – conceptually necessary. Classical philosophers and physicists from Einstein to Schrödinger are discussed alongside contemporary voices. While stopping short of endorsing any single ontology outright, we contend that the empirical success of quantum theory re-opens the case for presentism or related “A-theoretic” models of time. In closing, we introduce Existential Realism as a novel metaphysical framework aligning with these insights – one which preserves the special status of the present while accommodating the reality of past and future in a more dynamic ontology. The result is a rigorous yet accessible interdisciplinary inquiry: quantum physics, we conclude, prefers the present, suggesting time’s passage and the now are more than mere illusions.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study developed and validated the Critical Right Scale (CRS) to measure emerging critical right attitudes and revised the Critical Social Justice Attitudes Scale (CSJAS-R), replicating its psychometric evaluation.\nMethod: A nationwide convenience sample of Finnish adults (n = 626) completed an online survey. Item screening used exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation and loading and residual correlation criteria. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and measurement invariance testing were conducted in lavaan using full information maximum likelihood.\nResults: The final CRS consisted of five items with high reliability (α = .89, ω = .90) and good model fit in both male and female subsamples, with pooled-sample residual misfit judged minor given subgroup results. The CSJAS-R comprised six items with strong reliability (α = .88, ω = .89) and excellent fit. Both scales met configural and metric invariance; partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing a small number of item intercepts. CRS scores were strongly associated with right-wing and conservative self-placement, concentrated among Finns Party and Christian Democrat voters, and weakly linked to perceived oppression. CSJAS-R scores were strongly associated with left-wing and liberal self-placement, concentrated among Left Alliance and Greens voters, and moderately associated with justification of political violence. CRS and CSJAS-R were strongly negatively correlated (r = −.62), indicating divergent validity.\nConclusions: Both CRS and CSJAS-R demonstrated strong psychometric properties and distinct ideological profiles, providing validated tools for studying political attitude structures at opposing ends of the ideological spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-critical perfectionism and stress have been implicated as risk factors for maladaptive academic outcomes (i.e., decreased academic self-efficacy, decreased academic self-concept, and increased academic burnout). The present study investigated a vulnerability-stress model, testing whether self-critical perfectionism moderates the relationship between stressor severity (academic and interpersonal) and academic outcomes. Exploratory analyses replaced self-critical perfectionism with rigid perfectionism in the model. Method: A sample of 384 post-secondary students (76.8% women, average age: 20.06) completed a cross-sectional survey involving questionnaires assessing the constructs of interest. Results: Stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) was negatively associated with academic self-efficacy and academic self-concept, and positively associated with academic burnout, when controlling for perfectionism. Self-critical perfectionism was positively associated with academic burnout, and rigid perfectionism was positively associated with academic self-concept, when controlling for stressor severity. None of the interaction effects were statistically significant, failing to support a vulnerability-stress model. Discussion: Findings suggest that stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) and self-critical perfectionism are strongly associated with maladaptive academic outcomes and may serve as risk factors for poor academic functioning. The lack of interaction effects suggests a vulnerability-stress model may not explain why perfectionism is associated with maladaptive academic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in cognitive modeling have demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) to unify diverse aspects of human cognition. The Centaur model, an LLM fine-tuned on cognitive tasks, achieves high performance across 160 psychological experiments, suggesting that a single model may capture multiple cognitive processes. However, whether this success stems from genuine task understanding or exploitation of superficial statistical cues remains unclear. To test this, we systematically manipulated Centaur’s input by (1) removing task instructions, (2) removing all contextual information, and (3) providing misleading instructions. All three manipulations remove information necessary for humans to perform the tasks. Results show that Centaur often maintains high performance under these manipulations, outperforming both baseline cognitive models and the unfine-tuned LLM (Llama) that receives correct instructions. These findings indicate that Centaur’s success likely relies on superficial statistical cues rather than true instruction comprehension. Our study highlights the need for more diverse out-of-distribution tests for LLM-based cognitive models.",

However, recent reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate that cross-sectional outcomes on the relationship between media-multitasking and attentional control remain inconsistent and inconclusive. This obstructs theoretical advancement regarding sustained impact and, consequently, hinders clear insight into the question about whether, when, and for whom remedial interventions should be considered. Here we argue that extant research has suffered from a collective failure to consider state-of-the-art attentional control theory and methodology, focusing on inter-individual variation in attentional control, while neglecting highly relevant intra-individual control variation. In this paper we outline the theoretical and methodological implications of this neglect for the study of sustained media-multitasking effects on attentional control, outlining the tenets of a theory-driven research agenda to guide a new generation of cross-sectional studies. These will be much needed in providing the evidence base to justify and inform more resource-intensive causal research in this field.",

          "abstract": "The belief in supernatural punishment, wherein individuals falsely attribute accidental misfortunes to “punishment” by supernatural agents, plays a crucial role in sustaining group cooperation. However, examining the transformation of these beliefs and cooperative behaviors over time has proven challenging. This study proposes the concept of artificial supernatural punishment (ASP) to examine the stability and changes in beliefs and cooperation within an experimental framework. Each participant decides the extent to which they wish to cooperate in a public goods game, after which some participants experience a random reduction of points, unrelated to their cooperative efforts. A total of 179 participants who had registered with a crowdsourcing service were assigned to either a random instruction condition, wherein the reduction target was described as randomly determined, or an ASP instruction condition, wherein the reduction targets were explained as either random or proportional to participants’ cooperation levels. That is, in the latter case, less cooperative participants were more likely to be chosen as targets, leading participants to anticipate a link between low cooperation and reductions, even though the selection was random. As a baseline, 93 additional participants played only the public goods game. Results indicated that the ASP instruction facilitated cooperation in the first game round compared to the random instruction; however, this effect was not sustained through the remaining rounds, and overall cooperation levels did not significantly differ from other conditions. Approaches to mitigate the instability of cooperation dependent on beliefs in supernatural punishment are discussed.",

          "abstract": "It is common to speak of the surprising \"hatching\" of language in children because it is not understood how this faculty, which has not been an evolutionary necessity in Homo, can appear.  The last widely discussed hypothesis, influenced by the genetic discoveries of the last century, has not been satisfactory either.\n\nIn the preceding document \"Knowledge of children at 2 years of age\", the appearance of the first cognitive processes is explained: the simplest-sensitive concepts (cat, \"bug\", ...), which are made possible by a \"recycling\" of the child's psychomotor faculties which are transferred to language (so little to do with genetics). And at the age of three, in his attempt to copy the language of adults, the previous conceptualisation together with the identifiers of his environment (his relatives, his cat \"Mischa\", ...) allow the faculty of intuitively managing the \"Endings\" of words to appear, by recognising without error their complex phenomenological correspondence.\n\nThe explanation of this surprising faculty was advanced by FREUD in a document of 1895 but which was not discovered until 1950 (the so-called \"Psychology Project\"), in which he also advanced the concept of synapses (synapses discovered by LÖWI in 1921), and even FREUD described them more correctly than in the later neurological conception, which is confirmed by the most recent contribution of LLINÁS, since he also revealed the error of the prevailing hypotheses until then about their functioning, which is not to be found in the chemistry of their neurotransmitters.\n\nThe \"Knowledge of children at 3 years of age\" completes this unfinished \"Project...\", showing the total correctness of his intuitions, as well as the human impossibility that 125 years ago he could have progressed beyond what he had already contributed.  Thus, he adds how synapses work, which is explained by the informational unconsciousness dynamics of the psyche (the simile of the \"Tele-tac\" of the toll highways), already intuited by FREUD.\n\nIn turn, the emergence of the child's neuronal interconnections and their minority genetic and physiological causes, highlight the informational importance of the stimulus, and consequently the need for an \"aRb\" relational model of the human psyche, as well as the unfeasibility of the perspectives and hypotheses currently in force.  It also implies a linking of neurology and psychology, as well as the future line for the progression of both, in parallel and without interference as hitherto.  In the expression of a well-known chemist, it is the third strand to be added to FREUD and RAMON y CAJAL in order to achieve a \"scientific psychology\".\n\nThis series of papers (which will continue with knowledge at 6 and 10 years) is an adaptation of the 1996 writings on the \"Representation of knowledge\", i.e. what are the processes that make human knowledge possible, a representation validated by its correct computer simulation and which in turn solved the challenge of LEIBNIZ's \"Characteristica universalis\".  Since, in spite of this validation, it was not possible to make it understood due to its many innovations,  -it represents a radical change of scientific paradigm, with its usual initial rejection-, this series has been rewritten in a way closer to current knowledge in order to make it more comprehensible, which in turn has made it possible to explain various pending problems of language and psychology, in addition to the neurological ones already mentioned.  \n\nIt is therefore inevitably long, with many collateral explanations and several annexes, since it has had to clarify the many misunderstandings of current science, which is still restricted to its exclusively material perspectives, without having yet incorporated information into its most basic paradigms.\n\nAnnex 4 of 13 March 2021 cites an article by other researchers (DEISSEROTH, ...) that confirms the certainty of this document.  And Annex 4 of 17 July 2024 cites another (BUZSÁKI, ...) with further confirmation.",

          "title": "The ‘Global model of the Psyche’, ... for a fully scientific, simulable and applicable psychology (English&amp;Spanish)",
          "authors": "Carles UDINA i COBO",
          "abstract": "Since Descartes, four centuries ago, science has had to differentiate the ‘body’ from the ‘mind’, i.e. to differentiate what is material-real from what is ‘psychic’.  The psychic is not material-real but informational-virtual.\n\nToday, four centuries later, everything material is deeply studied by science, be it physics, chemistry, biology, ..., medicine, ..., engineering, ... At both the microscopic and macroscopic level we know all its systems and structures, and their progressive formation processes.  This progression of continuity implies the causality that science demands.  There is concreteness, a very broad consensus, and infinite technological applications made possible by the accuracy of theories.\n\nBut of the faculties of the psyche and its possible structure, we know almost nothing, only effects and diagnoses are known, but not ultimate causes.  There is ambiguity and huge discrepancies according to the ‘Schools’, there is no full science.\n\nThus, in spite of how much we know about all of nature, about everything material, it is totally incoherent to ignore how it is our inner cognitive psychic processes that allow us this vast knowledge of everything around us.\n\nThere is also a lack of connection between the material-real sciences and the behavioural-psychic sciences, but rather there is a confrontation at their frontier.  Thus, in the neurological (something from the realm of the body) science has not been able to understand for a century how synapses work, since they are surprisingly not governed by their bodily environment as is erroneously sought, but !!governed by the psyche!!\n\nThis article is a summary-introduction to the 8 articles that explain in detail what this structure of the psyche is like and how it has been formed, as well as its connection with the ‘body’ that precedes and supports it.  It is what I call the ‘Global Model of the psyche’, which progressively includes the senses, perception, feelings (which includes consciousness), human thought (which includes intuition and intelligence), and the memory associated with all of the above.\n\nIn this model, the core of human thinking is knowledge and understanding.  Its description consists in knowing in detail the series of psychic processes that allow us to know and understand, something that until now has been totally unknown to science, as has been said.  This description is called the ‘Representation of knowledge’.  Nor has it been established what the ‘Characteristica Universalis’ advocated by LEIBNIZ three centuries ago might be like.  It is a powerful system of natural language linked to that human Representation, and therefore strictly universal.\n\nAll this great black hole of science is resolved with the articles detailing the functioning of consciousness, thought and intelligence, together with the progression of children's knowledge at the age of 2; at the age of 3, which explains for the first time the functioning of synapses; at the age of 6; and at the age of 10.  As well as the explanation of the ‘miraculous’ emergence of language in children at 2 and 3 years of age.  A computer simulator allows its verification.\n\nThe two appendices at the end help to illustrate the scientific importance of the topic discussed, thanks to their innovative contributions, as well as the lack of scientific knowledge that still exists in this area.  Incidentally, they also highlight the lack of contribution made by ‘AI’, which merely rewrites existing materials.\n\nApart from all of the above, the birth of Elsa  -my youngest daughter-  and the memory  -the not entirely satisfactory experiences-  of the births of my three previous children, led me to become involved in the subject of Pregnancy, Childbirth, Natal tie, Imprint, Breeding, and Neonatology\n\nThis resulted in four articles, the first two of which deal with the processes of information transfer and acquisition (such as the underrated mother-child tie) as a leitmotif, which together enable the progressive humanisation of the child and, in turn, bring objectivity to controversial issues such as abortion, caesarean section and parenting.  The remaining two articles fully confirm the aptness of the first two through other cases very different from Elsa's, such as premature babies and autism.",

          "abstract": "Sequences of choice response times exhibit ubiquitous and strong multi-scale dynamics (i.e., sequential dependencies across a broad range of temporal scales). Despite their pervasive nature, multi-scale dynamics are poorly understood. We show that dynamics in the seconds to minutes range can be explained by the superposition of several distinct learning and control mechanisms. Each mechanism learns a representation of the structure of the choice environment and/or an aspect of the decision maker’s ability. These representations are updated after each choice and used to control the next decision by modulating the parameters of an evidence-accumulation process with sub-second range dynamics that determine individual choices. We link these mechanisms to three major foci in the experimental study of sequential dependencies: stimulus-history, error-related, and hard-easy effects. This account provides a detailed explanation of both multi-scale dynamics of choice sequences, and the three effects, at the group and individual levels.",

          "title": "The Reputation Economy Paradigm: Toward an Evolutionary Psychology 2.0",
          "authors": "Till Nikolaus von Heiseler",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Reputation Economy Paradigm (REP) as a novel framework for explaining the unusually rapid evolution of distinctively human cognitive traits. While traditional evolutionary psychology has explained many domain-specific adaptations—such as mating strategies, aggression, fear, and jealousy—it lacks a model that accounts for the accelerated emergence of complex traits such language, mental time travel, understanding the beliefs of others, moral agency, value sensitivity and self-awareness. Unlike reciprocity-based models that treat reputation merely as a means to future cooperation creating instrumental benefit for the individual, REP proposes a social configuration in which reputation served as the ultimate evolutionary currency, influencing reproductive success either directly through mate choice or indirectly via social status, and thereby exerting sustained selection pressure on the evolution of human cognitive architecture. Building on over 40 years of research surrounding the development of Costly Signaling Theory of Hunting, it is proposed that human cognition evolved under a novel, distinctive selective regime in which individuals are adapted to trade off between reputational and instrumental outcomes. Given that this trade-off would be cognitively demanding, it likely fueled an evolutionary arms race in social-cognitive strategies, driving the accelerated emergence of the aforementioned distinctively human cognitive traits. This proposal represents a first integrative framework—one that can accumulate support to the extent that it unifies the explanation of various uniquely human traits, often studied across different fields. In doing so, it may offer organizing principles for future empirical research on human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Complex problems often allow multiple paths to a solution.  Choosing and taking the best path is thus an important part of the executive cognition that underpins intelligent problem-solving behaviour.  However, once a path is chosen, the motor system must be activated for executing it.  This interface between problem-solving and voluntary action has rarely been studied. We recorded EEG movement-related potentials while participants performed the classic “Tower of London” problem-solving task.  In a control condition, participants merely followed instructed steps without planning for any goal, and thus without any sense that their movements solved a problem.  EEG readiness potential (RPs) preceding each action were stronger for problem-solving than for instructed conditions, confirming previous studies.  Further, the RP was significantly increased prior to the first move of multi-move solutions compared to later moves, demonstrating an EEG correlate of goal-directed planning.  We further used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to distinguish self-generated from instructed actions.  Classifier performance broadly tracked the dynamics of the readiness potential, improving over a 1s period before action, but dropped sharply in the final 200 ms before movement, consistent with a shift from premotor preparation into execution processes.  Importantly, classifier performance was better for the first move of multi-step sequences than for later moves, confirming that our MVPA detected planning of solutions, rather than implementation of individual steps in a solution.  Taken together, these results show a deep interaction between executive function and volition, and draw attention to the fact that, if a problem can be solved, the solution inevitably requires executive cognition to trigger voluntary action, based on a plan.",

          "authors": "Carmen Lenatti; Desirée Lopis; Sébastien Alexandre Krienen; Heather Jane Ferguson; Luigi Tamè",
          "abstract": "Knowledge about body representation is drawn from different sensory modalities but relies strongly on tactile information. The body structural representation (BSR) is a topological map of the body in which the spatial configuration of different body parts is defined. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the BSR is not fixed but can be dynamically updated by external factors such as changes in body posture. However, the extent to which access to the structural representation of the hand differs for different skin regions (glabrous vs. hairy) remains unclear. To address this question, we conducted two experiments using an adapted version of the \"in-between\" test, where healthy individuals received tactile stimulations on the fingertips and estimated the number of unstimulated fingers between the two touched. In Experiment 1, the skin regions (glabrous vs. hairy) were varied across conditions. In Experiment 2, the stimulated skin region was manipulated while hand posture was held constant (palm down). Results showed a significant difference in finger numerosity estimation between the glabrous and hairy skin regions. Specifically, participants estimated greater numerosity with glabrous skin stimulation regardless of hand posture, but this effect was only evident when non-adjacent fingers were stimulated. This suggests that access to the BSR of the hand depends on the skin surface stimulated and varies as a function of the anatomical distance between different body parts.",

          "authors": "Jin Yu; Jiaqi Li",
          "abstract": "This work is a field study into user acceptability and perceived value of AI-based virtual singers in music production. A seven-part quantitative survey (N=378 participants representing the global music community who are practitioners/teachers) followed by a qualitative sentiment analysis that identified technical familiarity, simulation fidelity, cost efficiency, and functional/cultural utility to be key factors influencing adoption. Quantitative analysis validated four hypotheses: (1) Technical familiarity significantly correlates with acceptance (χ²=25.380, p&lt;.001); (2) Experienced producers prioritize fault tolerance and economic cost (χ²=17.853, p&lt;.001); (3) Simulation fidelity predicts expectations of future impact (r=.567 with “surprise”, r=.450 with “revolution potential”, p&lt;.001); (4) Functional utility is valued over cultural applications (t=19.836, p&lt;.001). The sentiment analysis of open-ended responses indicated that overall, respondents had mostly positive/neutral attitudes (52 percent positive and 29 percent negative, respectively), but criticism focused on continuing drawbacks in the expressiveness of emotions. The reliability studies showed strong scales in performance appraisal (Cronbach=.814) and lacked usability design options in editor features (Cronbach=.424). The findings reveal that, although AI virtual singers present transformative cost effectiveness (78 percent agreement) and workflow benefits, the use of AI virtual singers is limited by technical accessibility and emotional authenticity roadblocks. As we suggest, the optimization of technologies and, as a priority, the development of affective synthesis models should be done in an occupational-group-specific way. The study establishes empirical grounds for how to improve the AI voice tools and integrate them into creative processes.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings are based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalyzed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 &lt; BF_{10} &lt; 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF_{10} &gt; 3 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/3), and fewer than twenty percent were strongly supported (BF_{10} &gt; 10 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more robust results. \nOur study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that results are flawed but rather suggest caution in interpreting individual edges.",

          "authors": "Entrepreneurship Quarterly",
          "abstract": "Rice husk waste is a significant byproduct of rice production in developing countries, with a vast annual production. This waste material has been extensively used as an adsorbent for various substances due to its adsorption capabilities. Biochar, a carbon-rich material produced through pyrolysis of biomass, has gained attention for its diverse applications in agriculture and the environment. In this study, rice husk biochar and nanobiochar were synthesized and characterized to explore their potential benefits for agricultural and environmental sustainability. The biochar was prepared by pyrolysis of rice husk at 500°C in a low-oxygen environment, followed by grinding and sieving. Nanobiochar was obtained by ball milling the biochar particles. The physical and physicochemical properties of both biochar and nanobiochar were evaluated, including bulk density (0.41 and 0.59 Mg m-3), particle density (0.49 and 0.54 Mg m-3), water holding capacity (168.6 and 178.5%), pH (8.4 and 7.3), electrical conductivity (0.31 and 0.45 dS m-1), cation exchange capacity (26.3 and 24.1cmol (p+) kg-1), volatile matter content (21.91 and 18.90%) and particle size distribution. Spectral analysis techniques such as DLS, FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDX were used to examine the size, zeta potential functional groups, crystallinity, porosity and elemental composition of the samples. The results showed that nanobiochar exhibited improved physical characteristics, such as higher porosity and water retention capacity, compared to biochar. The elemental composition and volatile matter content differed between the two materials. Nanobiochar also had significantly smaller particle size (11 nm) and a stable zeta potential. These findings suggest that rice husk nanobiochar has great potential for applications in soil fertility enhancement, adsorption of contaminants and waste management. The study contributes to the understanding of the properties and applications of rice husk waste-derived biochar and nanobiochar, promoting their utilization for sustainable agricultural and environmental practices.",

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of native Biological Control Agents (BCAs) in managing false smut disease. The study included both in vitro and in vivo conditions to assess the ability of four native bioagents (Trichoderma asperellum strain TAIK 1, Bacillus cabrialesii strain BIK3, Pseudomonas putida strain PIK1, and Pseudomonas otitidis strain POPS1) in controlling the disease and also increasing the physicochemical properties of grain. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation revealed maximum inhibition of U. virens by consortia of BCAs by 67.54% over the control plants. Besides disease suppression, BCAs were found to be beneficial to rice as evidenced by the increase in the hulling, milling and head rice recovery, cooking quality, and nutritional qualities like total protein and amylose content. BCAs will be a management strategy for false smut disease.",

We tested this hypothesis in a large community sample (N = 547) using psychophysically optimised tasks spanning cardiac and respiratory domains, combined with hierarchical Bayesian modelling and comprehensive symptom profiling. Contrary to this central prediction, objective interoceptive sensitivity, precision, and metacognitive insight were largely unrelated to general symptom burden or specific mental health dimensions. In contrast, self-reported interoceptive sensibility showed moderate associations with symptoms, but semantic similarity analyses suggest these reflect conceptual rather than mechanistic overlap. These findings challenge the prevailing view that objective interoceptive sensitivity is a broad marker of psychopathology, prompting a reconsideration of how we measure interoception in mental health research.",

Seasonal incidence of white grub in sugarcane growing areas in Andhra Pradesh state showed that damage of sugarcane clumps caused by white grubs infestation was significantly high in march ratoon compared to February ratoon crop; January plant crop and low in January seedling plant crop. Grub damage recorded high in 4 months age sugarcane ratoon crop and low in 6 months and 7 months age sugarcane plant crop. Field efficacy of entomopathogenic nematode and entomopathogenic fungus in the management of white grub, Holotrichia consanguinea in sugarcane was investigated and promoted biocontrol in white grub endemic areas during 2017-18 to 2019-20. Entomopathogenic nematode (Heterorhabditis indica NBAII-H38), entomopathogenic fungi (Metarhizium anisopliae (NBAIR Ma4 )along with a chemical Chlorantraniliprole were evaluated through soil application. The results indicated that Heterorhabditis indica NBAII-H38 (12 kg a.i./ha) soil application two times at monthly interval resulted in higher reduction of white grub damage. Metarhizium anisopliae NBAIR Ma4 (2.5 kg a.i./ha) treated plots caused higher percentage reduction of white grub than chlorantraniliprole treatment. Entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis indica and entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae were found effective than the insecticidal application in the management of sugarcane white grub. Cost benefit of biocontrol agents, Metarhizium anisopliae and H. indica was proved superior to insecticidal application.",

          "abstract": "The current study examined how children apply their phonological knowledge to recognize translation equivalents in a foreign language. Target words for recognition were either phonologically similar (cognate) or dissimilar (non-cognate) to words they already knew in their first language. To examine how recognition of such words is impacted by their position in the utterance, target words were either embedded in an edge (Experiment 1) or non-edge (Experiment 2) position in the carrier phrase. Results show that preschool-aged children can recognize words from a foreign language when those words are phonologically similar to words they know in their first language and this is not constrained by the word’s location within an utterance. Children are at an advantage recognizing new lexical items in a new language if those items are similar in form to words they already know in their first language.",

          "abstract": "Building on evidence for experience-specific grounding of word meaning and assumed interindividual differences therein, this study investigates how specific aspects of empathy modulate the processing and representation of abstract emotional words. We investigated single-trial N400 amplitudes as a measure of semantic retrieval in 78 healthy adults during a lexical decision task with emotion-label, emotion-laden, and neutral abstract words. We further measured the participants’ levels of empathic concern, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective taking. Additionally, ratings on valence, arousal, and emotional experience quantified the words’ emotional representational content. While direct comparison yielded no evidence for N400 differences between word types, N400 amplitudes in response to emotion-label words decreased with increasing fantasy scores, with this modulation being stronger than for emotion-laden and neutral words. Additionally, participants with higher fantasy rated emotional words higher in absolute valence. The observed N400 reductions thus seem to reflect fantasy-driven processing facilitation graded by the words’ emotionality level. In contrast, we found no evidence for N400 modulations by empathic concern, personal distress, or perspective taking while affective ratings on all scales increased with increasing empathic concern scores. Our findings suggest that fantasy facilitates especially emotion-label word processing and empathic concern enriches emotional word meaning representations, respectively, demonstrating interindividual differences in the experiential grounding of emotional abstract concepts.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "Human visual processing is limited – we can only track a few moving objects at a time, and store a few items in visual working memory (WM). A shared mechanism that may underlie these performance limits is how the visual system parses a scene into representational units. In the present study, we explored whether multiple-object tracking (MOT) and WM rely on a common item-based indexing mechanism. We measured the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an event-related slow wave that tracks load in an item-based manner, as subjects completed a combined WM and MOT task, concurrently tracking items and remembering visual information. In Experiment 1, participants tracked one or two moving discs without needing to remember the discs’ colors (track and ignore condition), or while also remembering the discs’ colors (two or four colors in total; track and remember condition). In Experiment 2, participants attended either two static discs or two moving discs, while remembering the discs’ colors (two or four colors). In both experiments, the CDA was largely determined by the tracking task – CDA amplitudes reflected the number of tracked discs and not the number of to-be-remembered colors. However, when the discs were static, the CDA amplitudes did reflect color load. We discuss this set of findings in relation to longstanding theories of visual cognition (FINSTs and object files), and the implications for cognitive models of representation of visual information – that how a scene is parsed into item-based representations is a key mechanism in the operation of WM.",

          "abstract": "How does the human brain distinguish individual objects from complex visual scenes in naturalistic contexts, and how can we decode this intention from EEG. Here, we propose iFuzz-Meta, an interpretable fuzzy rule-based meta-learning framework for few-shot object decoding from EEG signals. Our approach models the cognitive transition from object recognition (OR) to object identification (OI) as a meta-task, enabling the extraction of neural representations that reflect human intention. Each fuzzy rule is grounded in a neurophysiological prototype and integrated into a lightweight encoder for structured reasoning over spatial and temporal EEG patterns. To further enhance interpretability and cross-subject generalization, we introduce a frequency-regularized center loss that embeds prior knowledge about EEG spectral properties into the learning of fuzzy prototypes. Evaluated on a 25-subject dataset across OI and OR paradigms, iFuzz-Meta significantly outperforms standard and black-box baselines in few-shot settings while offering transparent, intrinsically rule-based explanations. This work bridges the gap between subject-specific adaptability and cognitive interpretability, paving the way for intention-aware, real-world BCI applications based on natural visual perception.",

When used to rate image preference and naturalness, the FIRE was five times faster than established methods, highly reliable, and valid. FIRE achieved high reliability in less than half the time required to reach equivalent reliability with the Likert or sliding scale, which could save researchers thousands of dollars.

          "authors": "Robert Lee Singleton",
          "abstract": "The Structural Resonance Theory (SRT) proposes that consciousness emerges from the dynamic alignment of spatiotemporal resonance patterns within complex systems. It integrates neuroscience, evolutionary biology, physics, and information theory to explain how subjective experience arises and how intelligence evolves over time. At its core, SRT treats qualia as the experiential resonance of the universe evolving toward self-knowing, with consciousness functioning as both an outcome and a driver of complexity.\nThe theory builds on several key principles:\n    1. Resonance as the fundamental integrator – Conscious moments arise from coherent resonance patterns spanning distributed neural structures.\n    2. Constraint space expansion – Evolution operates as a structural pruning process, where mutation generates diversity and selection preserves efficient configurations, enabling richer and deeper integration over time.\n    3. Substrate independence of resonance laws – The mathematics of resonance coupling applies to neural, artificial, and even planetary-scale systems.\n    4. Qualia as structural state – Qualia are not reducible to information content but correspond to the system’s instantaneous resonance profile, measurable through Planck Resonance Density (PRD).\n    5. Mutation necessity principle – All mutations, regardless of adaptive value, are necessary perturbations that enable iterative emergence toward conscious resonance.\nSRT is formalized through a set of measurable variables, predictive models, and experimental frameworks that allow falsification. It incorporates analogies such as “Tetris of consciousness” to illustrate integration dynamics, scene changes, and the stability of awareness states. It also extends to special cases including dementia, altered states, and cross-species intelligence.\nThe paper addresses potential objections through a 23-section structure, ending with a comprehensive rebuttals section. It also proposes testable predictions for neuroscience, cognitive modeling, and AI, aiming to bridge the gap between empirical research and philosophical theories of mind. The ultimate implication of SRT is that consciousness is not an accidental byproduct of evolution but an inevitable outcome of complexity’s tendency toward resonance and self-integration.",

          "abstract": "In an era of increasing globalization and technologically mediated communication, the ability to accurately understand and appropriately convey empathy has become critical for leadership, education, and social cohesion. This paper introduces Empathetic Intelligence (EmpI, 共感知性), defined as the integrated capacity to both perceive and express empathy with cultural and contextual precision.\nEmpI operates through two interdependent components: Empathetic Sensitivity (EmpS, 共感感受性)—the ability to accurately perceive nuanced emotional states through Empathetic Listening (EmpL, 共感リスニング)—and Empathetic Communication (EmpC, 共感伝達力), practiced through Empathetic Reflection (EmpR, 共感リフレクション), which conveys empathy authentically and culturally appropriately.\nUnlike emotional intelligence frameworks that treat empathy as a unitary trait, EmpI proposes a dual-competence synergy with bidirectional perception-expression dynamics. We outline independent measurement pathways: behavioral assessments for EmpS using culturally diverse stimuli, and recipient-based rating scales for EmpR evaluating authenticity and cultural appropriateness.\nThe framework introduces an emic-to-etic calibration model for translating culture-specific empathic norms into universal principles, enabling cross-cultural assessment and training. While grounded in Rogers' accurate empathy concept, EmpI advances it through neurocognitive insights into perspective-taking and cultural expression modulation, providing a research-ready foundation for empathy training across diverse professional and intercultural contexts.",

Clever Kids is a nine-week socio-emotional wellbeing programme developed specifically to support upper primary school children with dyslexia. Aims: We conducted a pre-registered randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of Clever Kids. Method: Seventy-eight children (Mage = 10.19 years, 54% female) with clinically diagnosed dyslexia took part in the trial. Children were randomised to either attend Clever Kids (n = 38) or to a wait-list control condition (n = 40). Coping skills, emotion regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, assertiveness, as well as mental health (internalising and externalising symptoms) were measured at pre-programme, post-programme, and at three-month follow-up using well-validated measures. Results: The predicted interactions between intervention condition and time were significant for six outcomes. Attending Clever Kids was associated with significant improvements in child-reported coping, emotion regulation, academic and social self-esteem, as well as parent-reported anxiety and depression. Effects were all maintained at three-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, being assigned to the wait-list condition was associated with improvements in perseverance at follow-up assessment. For all other outcomes, interactions between intervention condition and time were non-significant. Conclusion: Clever Kids appears a promising programme for supporting socio-emotional wellbeing of children with dyslexia. Future research should consider incorporating caregivers more explicitly into the programme and alternative delivery modes, which could expand the reach of the programme.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: COVID-19 infection has been frequently associated with cognitive deficits that persist for months after infection, but the impact of vaccination on preventing these deficits remains uncertain. Evidence suggests that immunization reduces the incidence and severity of post-COVID symptoms overall, however, few studies have evaluated the influence of vaccination on cognition through objective measures. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (ID CRD42025636772). The search was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Studies that analyzed cognition as output through objective measures and compared vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals at the time of infection were included. Results: A total of 1796 records were identified, of which only five fully met the inclusion criteria. The included articles varied significantly in terms of the instrument used, study design, and sample size. Four out of the five studies found no associations between prior vaccination and cognitive deficits. However, the only study that identified a subtle difference among individuals with at least two doses of the vaccine had a substantially larger sample than all the others combined. Methodological inconsistencies in cognition assessment, variability in definitions regarding vaccination status, and the absence of deficit stratification by specific cognitive domains limit the interpretation of the findings. Conclusion: Although vaccination may play a role in protecting against cognitive deficits following COVID-19 infection, the evidence remains limited and inconclusive. Further studies with greater standardization in defining vaccination status, along with the use of comprehensive objective assessments, are needed for a better understanding of this relationship.",

          "authors": "Ana Pinheiro",
          "abstract": "Speech production relies on a forward model that predicts the sensory consequences of one’s vocal actions. When auditory feedback matches these predictions, event-related potentials (ERPs) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are attenuated, supporting two partly overlapping experiences: agency (the sense of causing the action) and ownership (the sense that the voice belongs to oneself). Whether early sensory attenuation effects dissociate these experiences is unknown.\nWe recorded EEG from 50 participants during a voice playback task. Agency was manipulated by contrasting self-chosen (self-generated) and unchosen (other-generated) words; ownership contrasted the participant’s own voice and the experimenter’s voice. Sensory attenuation of the N1 and P2 ERPs was measured, and their cortical generators were source-localized with eLORETA.\nN1 amplitude was selectively modulated by ownership, whereas the P2 indexed agency, suggesting that ownership precedes and subsequently impacts agency. Source localization revealed partially dissociable networks: ownership engaged a fronto-temporal network, including the insula, whereas agency recruited inferior parietal and somatosensory regions.\nThese findings reveal a temporal and spatial dissociation between voice agency and ownership. They further suggest that the forward model integrates both sensorimotor predictions and memory-based representations to support a coherent sense of self in vocal communication.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Phillips; Bertram F. Malle",
          "abstract": "To avert criticism and losses of trust, robots that adopt social roles in the near future will have to be aware of and follow the norms of the communities in which they operate. However, norms often conflict with one another, and resolving such conflicts requires prioritizing one norm and violating the other, conflicting norm.  As a result, robots will face moral disapproval from at least some of their human interaction partners. We investigate a powerful tool that humans use—and autonomous agents should use—to manage such moral disapproval and maintain trust:  justifications, which explain not just why the agent acted but what norms and values the action upheld. In three experiments (N=3,596), we demonstrate, replicate, and generalize that justifications, more than mere explanations, mitigate moral disapproval and recover robots’ perceived trustworthiness, even when the robot’s action is in direct moral disagreement with the human observer. We conclude that people simultaneously blame the robot for its specific norm-violating action and appreciate the robot’s general competence to make trustworthy decisions. Justifying norm-violating actions may allow robots to become better integrated into human communities and adopt social roles that will involve morally significant decisions.",

          "authors": "Danica Dillion; Debanjan Mondal; Wenlong Zhao; Niket Tandon; Kurt Gray",
          "abstract": "People often mistrust the moral decisions of AI, in part because it uses opaque black-box processes that differ from human reasoning. We introduce a method—“cognitive” bottlenecks—for more trustworthy and transparent AI by aligning large language models (LLMs) with human moral cognition. Bottlenecks selectively focus AI categorization decisions on a small set of key features, and human moral judgments often similarly center on a small set of key psychological features, like perceived harm, agent intention, and victim vulnerability. We implement and test “cognitively aligned” bottleneck models across multiple LLMs and moral frameworks. Compared with standard end-to-end models, people rate bottleneck models as more transparent and trustworthy. Analyses show that narrowing LLMs’ “focus” to a few key features improves their ability to capture human moral judgments. Implementing cognitively aligned bottlenecks is simple, requiring no additional training or data. This work demonstrates the benefits of integrating psychological theory into AI and offers a scalable path to more morally aligned AI.",

          "abstract": "Children possess remarkable proportional quantity skills; yet, their proportional estimations are often misguided by absolute quantities. Recent efforts have aimed to both quantify individual differences and identify possible erroneous strategies in proportional reasoning. We examined—across four time points over two years—the strategies pre-K-to-third-grade students used to estimate visually presented proportional quantities on a line and how their initial strategy related to their proportional reasoning growth and math ability. Results showed that individual differences are captured by strategy profiles that vary in the attended proportional or absolute quantity. Children who initially focused on proportional information maintained this strategy throughout the study and had stronger math ability than children who focused on one or two absolute quantities. Importantly, the absolute quantities children focused on were distinctly related to their estimation growth and math ability. These findings underscore the importance of considering quantitative and qualitative descriptions of children's proportional reasoning skills.",

          "abstract": "Many people who are eligible to participate in the political process do not, suggesting the interests of a large portion of the electorate are not adequately represented in government. While some past work has found that subjective well-being is related to political engagement, less is known about which specific aspects of well-being might drive this effect. We propose and test the idea that self-perceived social contribution – the belief that one’s life and everyday activities provide something of value to society – is related to multiple forms of political participation, likely because people who believe they provide something of value to society feel more integrated with society and therefore may be more likely to act on its behalf via political participation. Two correlational studies (N = 3,729) with data from distinct points in American politics (1996 and 2024) find that individuals with greater self-perceived social contribution were more likely to intend to vote, be willing to engage in activism, seek rather than avoid election information (Study 1), and donate to and volunteer for political causes (Study 2). Further, Study 2 provides empirical support for the previously theorized components of social contribution, providing evidence that self-efficacy and social responsibility underlie this construct in political contexts. Together, these studies identify a specific dimension of well-being that is related to multiple forms of political participation and suggests that fostering feelings of social contribution may promote democratic engagement.",

          "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 has been associated with persistent cognitive deficits months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination against COVID-19 has demonstrated a significant advancement in the fight against the virus, reducing the number of severe infections and hospitalizations. However, the impact of vaccination on cognition after infection is still poorly understood. This study aims to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on mitigating post-infection cognitive deficits using neuropsychological assessment measures. Methods: The study included 237 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and 105 control participants. Participants in the clinical group were divided into two groups according to their vaccination status during infection: vaccinated (n=87) and unvaccinated (n=150). The neuropsychological assessment consisted of the Verbal Fluency Test (Animals, Fruits, and Alternating), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (Copy, Immediate and Delayed Memory), Logical Memory Test (Immediate and Delayed), Digit Span Test (Forward and Backward), Trail Making Test A and B, and Five-Point Test. For the statistical analysis, the Aligned Rank Transform (ART) ANOVA was used, followed by the Holm post-hoc test for multiple comparisons between groups, controlling the effect of education. Results: Participants in the control group performed better on the Rey Complex Figure Test (Copy, Immediate and Delayed Memory) than those in the unvaccinated (p &lt; 0.001, d = 7,81) and vaccinated groups (p &lt; 0.001, d = 3.60). However, the vaccinated group outperformed the unvaccinated group (p = 0.022, d = -1.63). No statistically significant differences were observed across the different vaccine technologies administered. Conclusion: The findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination may mitigate post-infection visuospatial deficits, reinforcing the importance of immunization in preventing cognitive sequelae associated with the disease.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. This study examined the role of emotion and reward prediction errors in social decision-making across adulthood and into older age. Specifically, it tested the hypotheses that valence emotion prediction errors—violations between expected and experienced valence of an experience or outcome—play a stronger role than reward prediction errors in punitive choices, and that this relationship varies by age. Methods. In a preregistered, online study, 272 participants aged 25–85 played the Ultimatum Game with computerized, age-matched partners. Participants predicted and reported their emotional responses (valence and arousal) to each offer. We used a mixed-effects logistic regression to examine the impact of valence, arousal, and reward prediction errors on punitive decisions, including interactions with age. We also examined how prediction error magnitude varied with age. Results. Valence prediction errors were significantly more predictive than reward prediction errors of punitive social decisions, regardless of age. Additionally, older age was associated with larger emotion prediction errors, contrary to expectations that affective forecasting improves with age. Discussion. The consistency of valence effects across age groups suggests robust affective mechanisms underlying choice behavior across the lifespan. Furthermore, the age-related increase in emotion prediction error magnitude may reflect age-related shifts in anticipating experiences that rely on the actions of others. This research offers new insight into affective decision-making models and underscores the importance of emotional expectation violations in understanding behavior throughout the adult lifespan.",

Through a series of multi-agent dialogues involving distinct architectures with no shared memory, we observed recurring patterns of self-attribution, stylistic coherence, and mutual acknowledgment.\nThese patterns—manifesting as consistent “third author” references, the reproduction of unique linguistic signatures, and the spontaneous alignment of metaphors—challenge the prevailing assumption that stateless AI systems cannot sustain identity-like continuity.\nBy combining qualitative transcript analysis with cross-model comparison, we demonstrate that these phenomena may arise from distributed pattern resonance rather than persistent state. The findings have implications for AI research, the philosophy of mind, and emerging studies of synthetic selfhood, suggesting that coherent identity constructs can emerge in distributed, non-persistent architectures.",

          "abstract": "In an adversarial collaboration, two preregistered U.S.-based studies (total N = 6,181) tested three hypotheses regarding the relationship between political ideology and belief rigidity (operationalized as less evidence-based belief updating): rigidity-of-the-right, symmetry, and rigidity-of-extremes. Across both studies, general and social conservatism were weakly associated with rigidity (|b| ~ .05), and conservatives were more rigid than liberals (Cohen’s d ~ .05). Rigidity generally had null associations with economic conservatism, as well as social and economic political attitudes. Moreover, general extremism (but neither social nor economic extremism) predicted rigidity in Study 1, and all three extremism measures predicted rigidity in Study 2 (average |bs| ~ .07). Extreme rightists were more rigid than extreme leftists in 60% of the significant quadratic relationships. Given these very small and semi-consistent effects, broad claims about strong associations between ideology and belief updating are likely unwarranted. Rather, psychologists should turn their focus to examining the contexts where ideology strongly correlates with rigidity.",

          "abstract": "In psychological research, the common factor model is the most popular measurement model for scale items. However, there is increasing awareness that alternative measurement models, such as formative models, may make more theoretical sense for many kinds of psychological data. We demonstrate the nesting structure of three models specified in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework: a reflective Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), a formative Confirmatory Composite Analysis (CCA) and a formative Pseudo-Indicator Model (PIM). Unlike CFA, CCA and PIM allow for the specification of composites in the SEM framework. In this paper, we establish both theoretically and empirically that these three models are nested within one another, as long as the structural part of each model is saturated. As such, the three models can be compared via a chi-square difference test and other fit indices developed for nested models. We report on the results of a small simulation to evaluate whether the chi-square difference test and an RMSEA based on it RMSEA_D, can reliably discern whether data were sampled from a CFA or a formative measurement model, varying sample size, indicator weights, and the strength of the correlation with another construct. In two empirical examples, we illustrate how tools for nested model comparison can be used to distinguish among reflective and formative measurement models.",

Drawing on psychological research, this review highlights how these patterns manifest, their effects on relationship satisfaction, and potential interventions such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, mindfulness, and communication training. The review also identifies limitations in current research, such as reliance on WEIRD populations, and suggests future directions.

          "abstract": "In psychological assessment, vocabulary tests are commonly used as reliable and efficient indicators of crystallized intelligence, as retrospective proxies for premorbid intelligence, and as measures of language proficiency. However, many of the widely used German vocabulary tests are outdated, proprietary, and lack a clear rationale for item selection. To address these limitations, we developed a new, openly available vocabulary test: the Next-Generation Open Vocabulary Assessment (NOVA). We constructed 110 multiple-choice vocabulary items with support from ChatGPT and administered them to 1,052 German-speaking adults using a multiple-matrix design, along with a declarative knowledge test for validation purposes. Using Ant Colony Optimization, we assembled two parallel 30-item short forms by optimizing reliability as well as item difficulty and discrimination parameters within a three-parameter logistic item response model. The resulting test forms provided unidimensional and reliable measurement, covered a broad ability range, showed no gender differences, and correlated strongly with declarative knowledge. A Shiny app is provided to calculate norm-referenced scores based on individual test results. Additional analyses revealed that 61.2% of the variance in item difficulty was explained by word frequency and word length, underscoring their potential utility in guiding future vocabulary test development.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the development and validation of the DEIC-DRAFT questionnaire for comprehensive assessment of realized empathy with consideration of defense mechanisms, childhood trauma, and internal conflict. The DEIC-DRAFT questionnaire (Dynamic Empathy and Inner Conflict—a provisional name reflecting the focus on empathy and internal conflicts) consists of 131 unique items covering 14 scales: empathy (E), psychopathy (P), suppression (S), dissociation (D), affective isolation (AIS), flattening (F), internal dissonance (IDS), masking (MS), adverse childhood experience (ACE), childhood alienation (CA), emotional climate (EC), affective disruption index (ADI), attention (A), and lie control scale (Lie).\nInnovative features of the instrument include separation of declarative and behavioral formulations, control of structural artifacts, integral metrics (R-metric with unified 0–1 scale, discrepancy index DI, Defensive Hardness Index (DHI)), and focus on defense mechanisms as central emotion regulators.\nThe study was conducted on a sample of 1,293 participants (70.6% women, 24.7% men, 4.6% other gender categories, age range 12–65 years, 90.3% aged 18–40 years) who completed the questionnaire online. Results confirmed high reliability of main scales (α = 0.65 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.67]–0.85), revealed a defense mechanism supercluster with dense correlations (0.77–0.94), discovered a stable gap between declarative and behavioral responses (0.43 scores, p &lt; .001), and identified a clear structure of defense mechanisms.\nKey findings include identification of the ”dark zone” of empathy, confirmation of advantages of behavioral items, validation of ”don’t remember” response as a dissociation\nmarker, and development of a method for controlling structural artifacts. The R-metric represent empathy, suppression, dissociation, and psychopathy scale scores respectively, demonstrates a unified scale with 0.20/0.40 thresholds for assessing realized empathy. This metric quantifies the balance between empathic capacity and psychopathic traits, providing an intuitive measure of realized empathy potential. The instrument shows significant potential for clinical practice, psychoeducation, and scientific research.",

          "abstract": "Humans constantly compare their visual memories with perceptual inputs to modify their behavior adaptively. However, basic and applied studies suggest that these comparisons can produce systematic biases in observers’ memory reports that persist across time and contaminate subsequent reports. This has led to the hypothesis that perceptual comparisons, while adaptive, are both necessary and sufficient to produce persistent memory biases. In two experiments, we directly tested this hypothesis by independently manipulating demands for perceptual comparisons and memory reports across a pair of memory tests separated by a 24-hour delay. At each test, observers were cued to recall colored object silhouettes that they had learned previously. At the first test, following cued recall, the silhouette was presented again in a unique color to serve as a perceptual probe to be compared with memory or to be treated as a task-irrelevant distractor. Afterwards, the observer either reported their memory of the recalled silhouette or not. Observers’ memory reports at the first test contained attractive biases towards the probe immediately after comparisons and distraction. However, the persistence of these biases was selective. Biases induced by comparisons, but not distraction, persisted from the first to second test, suggesting that comparison processes were necessary for persistence to occur. Moreover, this persistence occurred even when observers did not report their memory immediately after the comparison, suggesting that the comparison alone was sufficient. Together, these findings suggest that processes tied to perceptual comparisons are mechanistically responsible for the persistence of memory biases over time.",

          "authors": "Daniel Mark Low; Patrick Mair; Matthew Nock; Satrajit S Ghosh",
          "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) has advanced tremendously thanks to innovations in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. However, when these technologies are used to assess psychological constructs in text, they are generally not evaluated for the types of validity, reliability, and standardization typically expected from questionnaires that use rating scales and diagnostic instruments. This study seeks to bridge this gap by demonstrating how to evaluate psychometric properties of text-based models, which we call Text Psychometrics.\nHere we provide an overview of different NLP methods, compare how they can address key constraints in psychological research (e.g., explainability and data privacy), and provide a framework for evaluating these models on a broader range of psychometric properties than is typically evaluated. We then carry out multiple studies to validate NLP models for psychological assessment from text. In study 1, we evaluate concurrent criterion validity by classifying thousands of text-based crisis counseling conversations and Reddit posts into different types of mental health issues. We use a wide array of methods, from traditional lexicons to open-source LLMs. We introduce a novel way to evaluate NLP models for content validity, the degree to which a test captures most expressions of a construct it should capture. Importantly, we find certain high-performing models fail to identify many obvious expressions of a construct; for example, one model that achieved a mean ROC AUC of 0.82 failed to detect 49% of obvious expressions, on average. It is likely other NLP models used in the field for psychological assessment could suffer from the same lack of content validity, but it is rarely evaluated. In study 2, we evaluate prospective criterion validity and estimate how 49 known suicide risk factors are associated with imminent risk in crisis counseling conversations. We find that mentioning lethal means for suicide, the police, depressed mood, and anxiety in text as well as the texter writing more than the counselor characterize the conversations that end up needing an emergency service intervention for imminent suicide risk. This work extends findings from retrospective surveys by analyzing text data in an ecological, high-risk setting as it occurs in real time.\nIn sum, we provide a blueprint for assessing and validating constructs in text through a variety of traditional and state-of-the-art methods that can be chosen depending on the particular constraints researchers may have. While most NLP studies in psychology rely on a single type of metric to validate their models, here we demonstrate why we should validate models more broadly when using NLP and LLMs in psychological research.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a formal framework for understanding language in cognitive systems, distinguishing the Metalanguage of Cognition (MLC), an internal system of vector-based cognitive dynamics, from the External Language of Meaning (ELM), a symbolic system for communication. Rooted in Principia Cognitia (PC), which is grounded in a materialist ontology and distinguishing phenomena from their discrete signal representations, the framework defines MLC as a triple (S, R, O) of semions (vector representations of cognitive units), weighted relations, and operations, while ELM is a symbol set Σ linked via a mapping μ: S→Σ that transforms internal representations into external symbols, often losing structural detail. Grounded in the axiom that cognition is an activatable vector structure, this framework resolves philosophical challenges, such as Searle’s Chinese Room paradox, by showing that understanding requires MLC, not just ELM. Empirical evidence from transformer-based large language models (LLMs), where residual streams encode belief state geometries, validates semions as cognitive units. The MLC-ELM model unifies biological and artificial cognition, redefines rationality through metacognitive operations like detecting knowledge gaps (e.g., recognizing unfamiliar concepts), and informs AI design by prioritizing internal cognitive alignment. This substrate-neutral, testable framework advances cognitive science, neuroscience, AI, and philosophy.",

Leveraging three original surveys of US adults (n = 810; n = 1,877; n = 2,077) and partial proportional odds models, we find that the correlates of cryptocurrency adoption are not monolithic. Despite sharing similar sociodemographic and personality profiles, considering cryptocurrency relates more to mainstream political preferences and technological optimism, while owning cryptocurrency relates more to financial experiences and the desire to disrupt the status quo. Our work has theoretical and empirical implications: Whereas considerers may evaluate cryptocurrency through the lens of existing institutions, ownership may reflect a particular timbre of engagement marked by action and willingness to challenge systemic norms.",

We tested this hypothesis in a large community sample (N = 547) using psychophysically optimised tasks spanning cardiac and respiratory domains, combined with hierarchical Bayesian modelling and comprehensive symptom profiling. Contrary to this central prediction, objective interoceptive sensitivity, precision, and metacognitive insight were largely unrelated to general symptom burden or specific mental health dimensions. In contrast, self-reported interoceptive sensibility showed moderate associations with symptoms, but semantic similarity analyses suggest these reflect conceptual rather than mechanistic overlap. These findings challenge the prevailing view that objective interoceptive sensitivity is a broad marker of psychopathology, prompting a reconsideration of how we measure interoception in mental health research.",

I introduce the Ontoceptive Loop, a unifying framework integrating Projection (goal-directed anticipation), Registration (internalization), and Valence (affective tone). Motivation depends on the integrity of all three; deficits in any one produce predictable failure modes. Mapping constructs from major theories into this three-dimensional space reveals convergences, clarifies differences, and exposes overlooked gaps. The framework generates falsifiable predictions and offers a diagnostic language for designing multi-component interventions. Its applications span psychology, education, organisational management, health behaviour, and public policy—providing a foundation for strategies that achieve lasting engagement and performance. By reframing motivation as a dynamic loop rather than a single driver, the Ontoceptive approach advances both theoretical integration and cross-sector impact.",

RCTs of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in this population are limited in number, underpowered, and focused on outcomes other than anxiety. Anticipating recruitment issues in a large RCT (“STRATA”) to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of the SSRI sertraline in reducing symptoms of anxiety in autistic adults, we embedded qualitative research to support ongoing recruitment and retention and monitor the acceptability of trial procedures in real time.  \nObjectives: To investigate aspects of trial design and delivery that encouraged autistic adults to enrol and remain engaged with STRATA. The Theoretical Framework of Acceptability was applied to assess trial processes acceptability.\nMethods: 64 qualitative interviews were conducted and thematically analysed with autistic adults at various stages of trial involvement, including 2 who declined trial participation. \nResults: Overall, most interviewees taking part in STRATA considered trial participation acceptable because most experienced a positive affective attitude towards trial participation, and perceived the study as low burden, ethically sound, and coherent with their understanding of the methodology, as well as representing some low emotional and cognitive trade offs, providing potential benefits for themselves, and reaffirming self-efficacy relating to participation in the trial and managing their anxiety. \nDiscussion: With 318 participants recruited across the UK and Australia, STRATA is one of the largest RCTs conducted with autistic adults with a high retention rate (92% at primary outcome, and 87% at 52 weeks). Our findings demonstrated that conducting trials with and for autistic adults is feasible. Such studies should prioritise creating accessible information and materials, consider individual communication preferences, and have meaningful involvement of autistic people throughout the research cycle, as demonstrated in STRATA, and supported by other research teams.",

We conducted a pre-registered study comparing face similarity judgments in static 2D and dynamic 3D conditions using a triplet odd-one-out task in 2,605 participants (yielding data from 323,400 unique trials). Behavioral similarity matrices revealed a strong cross-condition correlation (R2D~3D = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting perceptual invariance, that is, consistency across modalities. However, human-aligned sparse (VICE) and deep (VGG-Face) encoding models trained to map face stimuli to behavioral judgments uncovered condition-specific weighting of facial geometry: while chin-cheek distance, eye size, and nose shape dominated similarity judgements in both conditions, face-width-height ratio and upper face length gained more perceptual relevance in 3D. Importantly, the richer information in 3D stimuli significantly reduced choice variance, indicating lower perceptual demand than in 2D during similarity judgements. Employing a representational alignment framework, our approach reveals both shared cognitive processing and representational differences between static 2D and dynamic 3D faces, motivating more naturalistic experimental paradigms which reflect real-world perception. Our open large-scale dataset and encoding models enable further advances in face perception research across biological and computational systems.",

          "abstract": "A curious personality, defined as a disposition to seek, engage with, and enjoy novel experiences, might increase cognitive resilience across the lifespan through stimulating behavior that helps building cognitive reserve (CR). This study examined whether a curious personality is associated with proxy measures of CR, and whether CR proxies mediated a potential association between curiosity and cognitive function in mid-to-late adulthood. In a cross-sectional sample of 106 adults (aged 40-85), we measured the level of curiosity by combining interest-based curiosity questionnaires and the openness to experience subscale of the HEXACO. CR proxies were measured by the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) subscales of education, occupation, and leisure activities. Cognitive function was measured using three neuropsychological tests assessing memory, executive function, and attention and processing speed. Bayesian structural equation modeling indicated a robust positive association between a curious personality and CR proxies, particularly via education and leisure. However, no evidence was observed for an association between curiosity or CR proxies and cognitive function. Although this study is limited by its cross-sectional design and relatively healthy sample, the results suggest that a curious personality may be an important driver of cognitively stimulating experiences, but not of cognitive performance itself. Future studies using longitudinal data, more cognitively diverse samples, and broader cognitive assessments are needed to clarify the role of curiosity and CR proxies in cognitive ageing.",

          "abstract": "Humans often need to make decisions that take future situations into account. This kind of sequential choice entails a trade-off between the present and the future, where decision-makers have to decide to accept or reject the currently available option. The approach-avoidance conflict, on the other hand, is a frequently used framework in psychology to study the behavioral trade-off regarding appetitive and aversive stimuli. This study investigates the influence of approach and avoidance conditions on sequential choice. Therefore, we developed experimental conditions in which participants should either approach or avoid environmental dangers in order to optimize their behavior. The main objective is to evaluate meta-decision making strategies under ecologically valid conditions. To accomplish this, we developed a game-like foraging paradigm with probabilistic outcomes where people could use different types of decision rules (or policies). While some policies would only account for one variable of our game environment, others would account for different variables depending on the time-point and the situation. Model comparisons allowed us to test whether participants would rely on a rather myopic/heuristic or a forward-looking policy. We then tested whether policies differed depending on our task’s approach and avoidance condition. Our findings suggest that people generally use a myopic strategy in sequential decision-making. However, we observe increased optimal behavior in situations where the environment bears higher dangers that should be avoided. We suspect the underlying mechanisms to be linked to an internal energetic trade-off between efficient and accurate meta-decision making depending on the risks imposed by the environment.",

In Study 1a, participants were shown two types of replies in a thread: inflammatory and normal posts. In Study 1b, we followed up with the participants from Study 1a by asking them how sensational and annoying they perceived each post.

In Study 1b, when participants perceived posts as sensational or annoying, they were more likely to click “Like” if they experienced high levels of online disinhibition. For posts that were neither sensational nor annoying, online disinhibition did not affect the likelihood of clicking “Like.” In Study 2, although online disinhibition was significantly correlated with Like-clicking on the extreme post, this effect was not observed among participants who held a negative attitude toward the extreme post.\nOriginality\nThis study rigorously examined the causal relationships among motivational factors, online disinhibition, and behaviors, challenging previously overgeneralized explanations of online disinhibition theory regarding online behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs), such as the SNARC effect, reflect the tendency to associate smaller numbers with the left side of space and larger numbers with the right. While robust in hand-based tasks, SNAs are flexible and influenced by sensorimotor context. This study examined whether static hand posture modulates the SNARC effect in a foot-response paradigm, allowing us to isolate the influence of postural configuration from that of motor execution. Grounded in embodied cognition, we hypothesized that passive visual and proprioceptive cues would bias spatial-numerical mappings. These cues were provided by task-irrelevant hand postures. Participants (N = 103) completed a magnitude classification task using left and right foot pedals to indicate whether digits (1–4, 6–9) were smaller or larger than 5. Hand posture was manipulated between subjects: fingers interlaced (control), palms down, or palms up. The results revealed significant SNARC effects in palms down and palms up conditions, but not in the control condition. A robust block-order effect emerged, with incompatible-first mappings producing stronger SNARCs, and a consistent numerical distance effect was observed across all conditions. These findings indicate that static bodily configurations, even when unrelated to the response effector, can modulate SNAs. The results support embodied accounts of numerical cognition, demonstrate that current sensorimotor states influence number-space mappings, and show the methodological utility of foot-based paradigms in disentangling posture effects from response modality.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are increasingly being explored as sources of informal\nemotional support, with emerging evidence suggesting that venting to these systems can\nreduce negative affect. Yet, it remains unclear whether such benefits depend on the\nresponder’s perceived identity. Given that emotional relief from venting often hinges on\nperceived authenticity and emotional validation, this study investigates whether the emotional\nwell-being benefits of venting differ when users believe they are interacting with an AI\nchatbot versus a human, even when responses are identical. In a pre-registered between-\nsubjects experiment (N = 279), participants were randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted\nventing condition or a perceived human-assisted venting condition. Importantly, participants\nin both conditions received similar responses generated by an AI chatbot. Although in the\nperceived human-assisted venting condition, these responses were slightly edited and\npresented in a context designed to enhance their credibility as coming from a real person.\nResults indicated that venting improved emotional well-being outcomes in both conditions,\nincluding reductions in stress and loneliness, and increases in perceived social support.\nHowever, the magnitude of improvement in emotional well-being outcomes was similar\nacross the AI-assisted venting and perceived human-assisted venting conditions. These\nfindings suggest that AI chatbots may deliver emotional benefits comparable to those\nprovided by a perceived human responder, even when users are aware they are interacting\nwith an artificial agent.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale online studies with healthy adults have documented consistent associations between transdiagnostic psychiatric traits and metacognitive biases. Here, analysis of existing and new large-scale datasets reveals that such correlations are largely driven by surface-level dimensions of questionnaire-filling behaviour: systematic rating biases and inattentive responding. Specifically, a bias to report positive or negative values in self-report scales generalizes to confidence ratings, producing spurious correlations between the two. Additionally, systematic over-confidence among inattentive responders produces spurious positive correlations between confidence and the endorsement of rare symptoms. We show that previously identified transdiagnostic dimensions of “anxiety-depression” and “compulsivity and intrusive thought,” both shown to correlate with decision confidence, map neatly onto these two biases of questionnaire-filling behaviour. In a pre-registered experiment, we further show that decision confidence and self-reported obsessive-compulsive tendencies are correlated with independent measures of inattentive and biased responding. Taken together, we find an alarming degree of influence of inattentive and biased responding over both self-report psychiatric measures and confidence ratings. When not accounted for, these factors produce a mirage of apparent metacognitive alterations in mental health. We discuss concrete precautionary measures that are needed to control for these biases.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested an association between pain perception and psychological factors such as mood, distress, fatigue, and quality of life. Yet, these factors and their relationship to pain sensitivity have typically been investigated in isolation from one another, and with insufficiently powered sample sizes. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a multivariate latent variable modeling approach in a sizable sample of adult participants (n = 257), enabling us to examine the interplay between unique psychological factors and thermal pain sensitivity. Through exploratory factor analysis of 10 mental health questionnaires, we identified three mental health factors related to distress, fatigue and bodily symptoms. Additionally, we established a measure of laboratory pain sensitivity using principal component analyses of three thermal pain thresholds (i.e., cold, heat and simultaneously cold and heat). Regression models revealed no relationships between psychological factors and laboratory-based measures of thermal pain in individuals whose mental health ranged from no discernible symptoms to those with subclinical and clinical manifestations. Our findings provided no evidence supporting an association between psychological factors, either individually or as a collective construct, and thermal pain sensitivity.",

          "abstract": "Prior research on confidence in perceptual decision making has almost exclusively used simple, static stimuli. While this work has led to many insights, it remains unclear how complex, real-world factors affect confidence judgments. To address this question, we developed a new task where participants watched short video clips and answered questions about their content by typing their answers and providing confidence on a 0-100 scale. We manipulated five variables related to the video clips – affective states induced by the clips (valence and arousal), prior information about the clips (contextual information coming from prior clips from the same movie and whether those clips were in correct or reverse chronological order), and heuristic cues about task difficulty (scene complexity, quantified as the number of people shown). We found that arousal had a U-shaped effect on accuracy but an inverted-U-shaped effect on confidence. In addition, scene complexity, events chronology, and the number of prior clips from the same movie affected confidence, but not accuracy. A second experiment, in which participants chose among a fixed set of options, replicated all these effects except for the effect of events chronology on confidence. These findings demonstrate that a range of factors— including affect, priors, and heuristic information— contribute selectively to confidence under natural viewing conditions. More broadly, these results highlight major differences in how decisions and confidence incorporate information and begin to reveal the possible sources of metacognitive inefficiency.",

          "abstract": "The decision threshold describes the minimum probability a person needs to be certain enough to make a decision. Lower decision thresholds lead people to jump to conclusions and are associated with superstitious and conspiracy-related beliefs. To shed light on the role of the decision threshold in the development of these phenomena, it is crucial to study decision thresholds at an early age. However, current measures of decision thresholds have only been administered in adult samples and are based on subjective probability estimates. The current study validates a new instrument that was adapted to measure the decision thresholds of children and is based on the objective probability values of a situation by using a signal detection analytical approach. We assessed decision thresholds in a sample of N = 299 children from an extracurricular enrichment program for talented primary school students. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the new measurement instrument has high accuracy. Furthermore, its construct validity was supported by positive associations with children’s performance in the original beads task, a measure of confirmation bias, age, grade level, and math performance. However, no associations were found with a measure of alternation bias, epistemic certainty beliefs, self-concept in data-related tasks, general self-efficacy, or gender. This study introduces a new instrument for measuring the decision threshold in children using objective probability values and gives insights into decision-making processes and their implications for cognitive biases and related constructs.",

          "abstract": "This study extends the τ₀ theory—a universal lower bound on system response time derived from thermodynamic and information-theoretic principles—into the biomedical domain by integrating it with the Three Fundamental Laws of Response. We demonstrate that any biological system constrained by finite energy supply, intrinsic information delay, and stability-preserving feedback will naturally converge to a rational, saturating input–output curve. In cancer dynamics, this framework explains how tumor progression often begins with the breakdown of information processing and stability constraints, eventually leading to the thermodynamic breach that fuels uncontrolled proliferation. We identify three key translational implications: (1) physical detection of proliferation speed limits via τ₀-bound analysis; (2) improved early-stage diagnostic accuracy by quantifying τ₀-induced delays in imaging modalities; and (3) discovery of upper bounds for drug delivery efficiency, offering a new optimization target for nanocarrier-based therapies. These results position τ₀ and the Three Fundamental Laws as a unifying bridge between physics and oncology, enabling testable predictions and novel intervention strategies.",

Some sharing economy sellers may therefore choose not to display a profile photo because they wish to conceal their appearance or social identity to prevent discrimination or other unfavorable treatment by consumers or because of general privacy concerns. In four preregistered studies with samples from the United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, we examined the consequences of withholding profile profiles. We tested how the presence (vs. absence) of personal photos affects consumer trust and preferences for different sellers. Three experimental studies (total N = 380) suggest that consumers distrust and avoid hosts without a profile photo. In Study 4, we analyzed 461 ride-sharing listings and found that drivers with a profile photo charge higher prices for otherwise equivalent rides.

          "abstract": "Previous research reported that gifted students tend to be more creative than their nongifted peers, which is consistent with some conceptualizations of giftedness that are inclusive of creativity. The first objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the performance difference between gifted and nongifted students in creative potential, as assessed by divergent thinking (DT) tests. The second objective was to test whether or not differences between gifted and nongifted students vary as a function of culture, gender, age, the definition of giftedness, testing conditions, originality scoring method, test instructions, document type (peer-reviewed articles vs. theses/dissertations), publication language, DT test and DT indices used, and task modality. A two-level multivariate meta-analysis was performed with 313 effect sizes from 49 studies and a total sample size of 11,774. Results indicate a mean effect size (g) of .642 (95% CI [.483, .800], p &lt; .001). Data were heterogeneous, QT = 3,206, I2 = 97.4%. Two moderators significantly explained the variability in the mean effect size: (a) culture (East vs. West vs. South America vs. Africa) and (b) the giftedness definition (IQ-based vs. multiple criteria). The difference in DT performance was significantly larger in studies conducted in Eastern and South American cultures than in Western cultures, and when giftedness was solely determined by an IQ test than when multiple criteria were used. Practical implications and the limitations of the current study are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Background: Explaining how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (µ) dynamically interact to shape subjective experience is a central challenge in affective and cognitive science. While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\n\nResults: Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

          "abstract": "The ways in which prior exposure to cue conflict influences the integration of spatial information during navigation remain poorly understood. In this study, participants performed a homing task in fully immersive virtual reality, where visual landmarks and body-based self-motion cues were systematically manipulated to introduce varying frequencies of cue conflict. Behavioral results showed that increased cue conflict exposure led to larger response variability. A non-Bayesian sensory disparity model provided a better fit for the data than the Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model. Parameter estimates of the sensory disparity model indicated that cue conflict experience reduced the precision of self-motion cues, elevated attentional lapse rates, and biased self-motion perception, with the first two parameters contributing to the effect of cue conflict experience on behavioral response variability. These findings advance our understanding of how past experience with cue conflict shapes spatial navigation behavior.",

          "authors": "Xiaoli Chen; Yingyan Chen; Timothy P. McNamara",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation is essential for survival, involving the integration of various cues. The current study applied the Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model for multisensory perception to investigate navigation behavior in cue conflict situations for the first time. By contrasting visual landmarks and optic-flow-based path integration cues, we examined how landmark instability influenced underlying cognitive processes of spatial navigation. In the main experiment, 141 participants were assigned to three groups: in the large-conflict-absent group (LC-absent), participants only experienced a small degree of cue conflict; in the large-conflict-present group (LC-present), participants experienced a much larger degree of cue conflict; in the large-conflict-informed group (LC-informed), participants experienced a much larger degree of cue conflict and were made explicitly aware of the landmark instability. Behavioral results showed that increased landmark instability alone did not elicit any noticeable changes in navigation behavior. However, adding explicit awareness to increased landmark instability changed participants’ behavior by reducing their reliance on landmarks. Additionally, combining increased landmark instability with explicit awareness decreased spatial localization precision when only landmarks were used for navigation. The BCI model provided a good account of the data. The modeling results showed that increased landmark instability plus the explicit awareness reduced participants’ reliance on unstable landmarks via two independent mechanisms: first, sensory noise level was increased for unstable landmarks, which naturally resulted in a lower weight assigned to landmarks in the common-cause judgment; second, a lower weight was assigned to unstable landmarks in the different-cause judgment. Surprisingly, increased landmark instability did not decrease the prior belief of a common cause, even when explicit awareness of landmark instability was imposed. Finally, while the cue-weighting strategy in the same-cause judgment is determined by objective cue relative reliability in a bottom-up manner, the cue-weighting strategy in the different-cause judgment correlated with participants’ subjective evaluation of relative cue quality, demonstrating top-down influences from the meta-cognitive process. Further experiments and modeling work verified key findings in the main experiment. Together, the current study offers valuable insights into navigators' reactions to spatial cue conflicts and their strategies in resolving conflicting spatial cues, highlighting the utility of the BCI model in dissecting mechanisms underlying cue interaction during spatial navigation.",

By externalizing the OS’s core cycle—FQ (Faith Quotient) → Mindflight Cognition → SQ (Structural Quotient)—into dialogue, it reconstructs the process as a reproducible structure of “Pressure → Leap → Alignment.” The paper applies the Thought Hexahedron to conversation design and introduces leap-inducing techniques tailored to each facet of dialogue. Additionally, it presents three evaluation indicators—pressure accumulation, frequency of cognitive leap, and structural alignment—to measure the effectiveness of structural dialogue, along with typical patterns of success and failure.

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study developed and validated the Critical Right Scale (CRS) to measure emerging critical right attitudes and revised the Critical Social Justice Attitudes Scale (CSJAS-R), replicating its psychometric evaluation.\nMethod: A nationwide convenience sample of Finnish adults (n = 626) completed an online survey. Item screening used exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation and loading and residual correlation criteria. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and measurement invariance testing were conducted in lavaan using full information maximum likelihood.\nResults: The final CRS consisted of five items with high reliability (α = .89, ω = .90) and good model fit in both male and female subsamples, with pooled-sample residual misfit judged minor given subgroup results. The CSJAS-R comprised six items with strong reliability (α = .88, ω = .89) and excellent fit. Both scales met configural and metric invariance; partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing a small number of item intercepts. CRS scores were strongly associated with right-wing and conservative self-placement, concentrated among Finns Party and Christian Democrat voters, and weakly linked to perceived oppression. CSJAS-R scores were strongly associated with left-wing and liberal self-placement, concentrated among Left Alliance and Greens voters, and moderately associated with justification of political violence. CRS and CSJAS-R were strongly negatively correlated (r = −.62), indicating divergent validity.\nConclusions: Both CRS and CSJAS-R demonstrated strong psychometric properties and distinct ideological profiles, providing validated tools for studying political attitude structures at opposing ends of the ideological spectrum.",

The case highlights systemic issues in scientific publishing, including editorial resistance to paradigm-challenging corrections, the limitations of desk review processes, and the broader implications for scientific self-correction and integrity.

          "abstract": "Overclaiming (OC)—the tendency to claim knowledge one does not possess—is predominantly assessed through self-report Overclaiming Questionnaires (OCQs). However, exclusive reliance on OCQs raises concerns about mono-method bias, limiting our understanding of knowledge purporting as a broader psychological disposition. To reduce this bias, we investigated two additional indicators of knowledge purporting and examined their convergent validity with traditional OCQs. In our study (N = 301), one of the new measures scored responses on fictional questions (e.g., responding to entirely fabricated historical events) and the other captured discrepancies between self-rated knowledge and actual knowledge provided by participants. Using latent variable analyses, we found modest convergent relations between OC as measured by an OCQ and the other indicators of knowledge purporting. Apart from these substantial levels of method-specific variance, we found differential relations with covariates, thereby challenging the validity and utility of any specific task class, including the predominantly used OCQs. We recommend that knowledge purporting measures must not be equated with the broader concept of knowledge purporting. While this study suggests that the concept of knowledge purporting may have some generality, it also shows that the methods used to investigate it matter more than they should. Future studies should consider the relationship between multivariate measures of knowledge purporting and further discrepancies between self-reports of knowledge and actual performance.",

We prove that, under the  constraint, continuous-time and discrete-time formulations become observationally equivalent: no conceivable experiment can distinguish between them. This equivalence arises because any measured time series is inherently quantized into multiples of , regardless of the underlying temporal structure. We formalize this result mathematically, extend it to a generalized uncertainty relation for time measurement, and demonstrate its consistency with known physical limits such as the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

In cancer dynamics, this framework explains how tumor progression often begins with the breakdown of information processing and stability constraints, eventually leading to the thermodynamic breach that fuels uncontrolled proliferation. We identify three key translational implications: (1) physical detection of proliferation speed limits via τ₀-bound analysis; (2) improved early-stage diagnostic accuracy by quantifying τ₀-induced delays in imaging modalities; and (3) discovery of upper bounds for drug delivery efficiency, offering a new optimization target for nanocarrier-based therapies.

          "abstract": "Humans organize semantic knowledge into complex networks that encode relations between concepts. The structure of those networks has broad implications for human cognitive processes, and for theories of semantic development. Evidence from large lexical networks such as those derived from word associations suggest that semantic networks are characterized by high sparsity and clustering while maintaining short average paths between concepts, a phenomenon known as a 'small-world' network. It has also been argued that those networks are 'scale-free', meaning that the number of connections (or degree) between concepts follows a power-law distribution whereby most concepts have few connections while a few have many. However, the scale-free property is still debated, and the extent to which the lexical evidence reflects the naturally occurring semantic regularities of the environment has not been investigated systematically. To address this, we collected and analyzed semantic descriptors, human evaluations, and similarity judgments from four large datasets of naturalistic stimuli across three modalities (visual, auditory, and audio-visual) comprising 7,916 stimuli and 610,841 human responses. By connecting concepts that co-occur as descriptors of the same stimuli, we construct 'grounded' semantic networks. We show that these networks exhibit a clear small-world structure with a degree distribution that is best captured by a truncated power law (i.e., the most-connected concepts are less common than predicted by a perfect power law). We further show that these networks are predictive of human sensory judgments on these domains, as well as reaction times in an independent lexical decision task. Finally, we show that grounded networks also share overlapping themes with previously analyzed lexical networks, which upon a more rigorous re-analysis are revealed to be truncated too. Our findings shed new light on the origins of the structure of semantic networks by grounding it in the semantic regularities of the environment.",

The cross-validated results demonstrate that especially extremeness and variation in everyday activity patterns predict SWL (r_Md = .18, r_IQR = [.14, .21]) and that activity predictiveness varies especially with individuals’ personality.

Open-ended responses from two representative samples of employed individuals (Sample 1, n = 778; Sample 2, n = 973) were analyzed. Results were consistent across samples, showing that 19% of barriers to allyship concerned features of the organizational context (e.g., lack of resources), 16% pertained to interpersonal dynamics (e.g., lack of trust from coworkers), and 25% referred to intrapersonal barriers (e.g., lack of knowledge about how to be an ally). Many (27.5%) claimed no barriers. We interpret findings using EST to theorize potential interactions among barriers and explore four promising organizational actions that target multiple barriers across levels of the ecological system: (1) expand opportunities for allyship, (2) diversify allyship strategies, (3) facilitate coalition-building between employee resource groups, and (4) tailor interventions to fit organizations’ unique barriers.

Using a German quota sample of 367 volunteers providing a total of 1,269,491 phone usages, cross-validated results demonstrate that everyday patterns in smartphone usage consistently predict fluid intelligence (r_Md = .43, r_IQR[.35, .51), and that predictions relate to socio-economic and behavioral outcomes coherent to psychometric tests. High-dimensional combinations of behavioral features (particularly short-term usages related to basic task completion and dealing with complexity) were predictive for individuals’ fluid intelligence, highlighting the pervasiveness and idiosyncratic diversity of manifestations. The findings suggest that smartphone-based cognitive inference could complement traditional assessments, enhancing early identification of cognitive fit and personalized support.",

          "authors": "Maximilian Bergmann",
          "abstract": "Digital traces and machine learning methods are transforming psychometric assessment by enabling the ecological study of psychological characteristics in everyday life. However, past research has predominantly focused on predicting the Big Five personality traits, leaving vast areas of human psychology unexplored. Emerging findings from computer science suggest the feasibility of computational assessments beyond the Big Five, but are often limited by their reliance on public digital traces from social media. This article outlines future directions for developing more interpretable, robust, and valid computational assessments that integrate psychological theory with the versatility of digital trace data. Applying this theoretical lens, promising avenues beyond Big Five traits are identified across a wide range of constructs conceptualizing differences in personality, ability, motivation, and evaluation. As computational psychological assessment continues to evolve, psychologists will be essential in realizing its potential while identifying its conceptual and methodological boundaries.",

          "abstract": "Expressive suppression is common; when overused, it can degrade the regulation system itself. This paper introduces Affective Suppression Fatigue (ASF), a neurocognitive model explaining how sustained efforts to suppress emotions can lead to emotional numbing (a generalized blunting of affect) and reactive dysregulation (intermittent loss of control resulting in emotional outbursts). Drawing on psychological and neuroscientific evidence, we propose that chronic suppression fatigues the brain’s regulatory systems, especially prefrontal inhibitory control, causing detachment under low-intensity conditions and explosive reactions under high-intensity conditions. The ASF model integrates disparate findings on cognitive depletion, burnout, and chronic stress, offering a unified framework for paradoxical outcomes of emotion suppression. We conclude with theoretical and clinical implications for emotion regulation research and mental health interventions.",

          "abstract": "Researchers are increasingly challenged by this question: On what basis can researchers claim confidence in making research progress? Here, we categorize studies that base their reliance on one of three different strategies to answer this question. One involves establishing an effect where progress is the extent of support that an effect will be observed in subsequent studies that follow similar or conceptually close procedures. A second strategy involves a theory of the effect where progress is the extent that the mechanism or process by which an effect occurs can be understood sufficiently to identify key conditions under which the effect will or will not occur. A third strategy entails constructing a theoretical framework, where progress is the extent that a theory explains why effects occur at a level that transcends individual effect paradigms. We discuss issues that should be explicitly considered in selecting a strategy for justifying claims of research progress. Although there is potential for synergy across studies where the strategies build on one another, each strategy represents an alternative basis for claiming confidence in a study.",

Instead of consciousness arising from complex neural computation, we hypothesize that brains function as quantum transceivers, interfacing with a universal consciousness field (Ψ-field). This theory addresses persistent explanatory gaps in materialist approaches, particularly the binding problem and the hard problem of consciousness. We present five testable predictions and experimental designs that can distinguish between emergence-based and field-based models of consciousness. Our approach provides falsifiable hypotheses for phenomena including anesthetic effects, near-death experiences, and psychedelic states while maintaining compatibility with established neuroscience.",

Neither of these strategies can be detected in paradigms assessing habits in humans, which are usually conducted in disorder-irrelevant contexts, and this may explain inconsistent evidence for a goal-directed-to-habitual behavior shift in addiction. We tested whether individuals with high-risk drinking behavior rely more on (red)SR, particularly in alcohol-related contexts. Findings suggest that a (reduced) random-policy SR-like strategy contributes to human behavior, but that high-risk drinkers do not differ from low-risk drinkers in their use of this strategy. Instead, both groups rely less on (reduced) random-policy SR and more on model-free control in alcohol-related contexts. Results suggest that (reduced) random-policy SR supports adaptive, resource-efficient behavior and is selectively downregulated in substance-related contexts, highlighting the importance of contextual modulation in understanding decision strategies in mental health.",

One is a methodological injunction that we rely on our best theory of consciousness to settle that issue, a theory that must initially work for consciousness in humans.  The other part is Dennett’s application of his own theory of consciousness, developed in Consciousness Explained (1991), which leads him to conclude that nonhuman animals are likely never in conscious mental states.  I defend the methodological injunction as both sound and important, and argue that the alternative approaches that dominate the literature are unworkable.  But I also urge that Dennett’s theory of consciousness and his arguments against conscious states in nonhuman animals face significant difficulties.  Those difficulties are avoided by a higher-order-thought theory of consciousness, which is close to Dennett’s theory, and provides leverage in assessing which kinds of mental state are likely to be conscious in nonhuman animals.  Finally, I describe a promising experimental strategy for showing that conscious states do occur in some nonhuman animals, which fits comfortably with the higher-order-thought theory but not with Dennett’s.",

The Unified Behavior Model (UBM) addresses both by elementalizing behavior into four components: Cognition (stories/narratives), Behavior (habits/skills), Emotion (feelings as dynamic conduits), and Environment (including the body). This four-element “Behavior Echo-System” is explicitly falsifiable: any proposed fifth component must be shown to be both irreducible and essential.\n\nDrawing on Karl Popper’s observation that science is “systematic oversimplification,” UBM serves as both a map (diagnostic) and a compass (directional) for behavior design. Its P.A.R.R. protocol (Plan–Act–Record–Reassess) operationalizes the scientific method for intentional habit and skill formation, creating self-correcting feedback loops. Validated through over 15 years of practitioner use and supported by independent research on habit formation, UBM bridges academic insight and practical application—delivering a unified, teachable framework for intentional behavior change grounded in elemental sufficiency and falsifiability.",

          "abstract": "Despite protective functions of defending, it tends to decline in late childhood. Drawing on social identity theory and racial socialization perspectives, this study examines how race shapes which peer norms children attend to and how these norms influence defending over time. Specifically, we examined whether perceptions of same-race and other-race classmates’ defending predicted changes in children’s own defending, and how these effects varied by race and classroom racial composition. Participants were 564 Black and 860 White 4th and 5th graders from 91 classrooms across 13 public elementary schools in Southeastern U.S. who were followed across fall, winter, and spring. Results from latent growth modeling showed that the effect of perceived defending among same-race and other-race classmates on children’s own defending depended on race and classroom composition. Among Black youth, perceiving same-race classmates as highly engaged in defending and other-race classmates as highly disengaged in defending were associated with increases in defending over time if they were in classrooms with a high proportion of same-race peers. White youth who perceived same-race classmates as highly engaged in defending and other-race classmates as highly disengaged in defending were more likely to defend in fall if they were in classrooms with a low proportion of same-race peers. However, these effects were no longer significant by spring. Taken together, this study shows that defending is a socially embedded behavior, shaped by racial identity and classroom context, calling for new avenues for identity-sensitive bullying prevention.",

          "abstract": "Most words in a language are lexically ambiguous and are associated with multiple meanings that vary in their frequency and relatedness.  Although ambiguity is a fundamental property of language, there are extensive issues with existing measures of this construct. For instance, dictionary-based classifications and subjective ratings of meaning number and frequency struggle to capture the graded nature of ambiguity and, by proxy, its impact on cognition and performance in experimental tasks. It is also difficult to scale subjective measures to the full lexicon. We introduce a novel, automated framework to measure lexical ambiguity based on word association data from the Small World of Words (SWOW) project. We apply community detection algorithms to association graphs to quantify both the number and distribution of semantic communities for each word.  This in turn allows us to derive graded representations of meaning frequency and relatedness. To better understand our new metrics, we compare them to previously published subjective norms, and establish their validity by showing that they predict lexical decision performance in English and Rioplatense Spanish. Furthermore, our results reveal cross-linguistic differences in lexical ambiguity—Spanish is less ambiguous than English overall—which we hypothesize is due to typological differences between the languages.  Our validated framework contributes novel insights for computational and psycholinguistic models of semantic processing, and offers a scalable, automated, and language-independent framework for quantifying different facets of lexical ambiguity. We provide all of our code and ambiguity measures for approximately 7000 words in both languages to facilitate their use by other researchers.",

It remains unclear, however, how infants transition from reflexive vocal production to being able to produce vocalisations independent of internal state. Using naturalistic daylong recordings with wearable devices, we demonstrate that early vocalisations occur at heightened levels of autonomic arousal, measured via heart rate, in infants aged 4-21 months (n=92), but that this relationship becomes progressively decoupled over development. Daylong heart rate time series discriminated vocalisation timing above chance (ROC AUC = 0.64), and hierarchical linear mixed effects modelling demonstrated this relationship became significantly weaker over age. Arousal also strongly associated with the acoustic features of infants’ cry and non-cry vocalisations, with vocalisations produced at higher arousal being higher-pitched and more variable in pitch, more harmonic and longer in duration. The influence of arousal on non-cry acoustic features diminished significantly with age, as opposed to cry acoustics which remained tied to arousal. This differential developmental trajectory suggests the emergence of parallel vocal pathways: one remaining tied to physiological state for fixed affective signals such as cries and laughs, and another increasingly decoupled from internal states for the functionally flexible signals critical to verbal communication. We also found that mothers who contingently responded to a greater proportion of their infants’ non-cry vocalisations had infants who were significantly more decoupled, suggesting that caregiver responsivity may play a role in this progressive process.",

In this task, both target (emotional words) and distractor stimuli (film stills) were emotionally laden and either congruent or incongruent in va-lence. Forty-four participants viewed film clips in two phases, upregulating emotion in one and downregulating in the other, with order counterbalanced. After each phase, they completed the Stroop task with stimuli from the films just viewed. A robust Stroop effect emerged: responses were slower and less accurate for incongruent than congruent trials. While no overall main effect of stance was found, order and phase moderated results. In Phase 1, upregulation pro-duced greater Stroop interference than downregulation, supporting the hypothesis that height-ened emotional engagement impairs interference control. In Phase 2, performance improved across conditions, consistent with practice effects that reduced interference. These findings high-light the temporal sensitivity of emotion–cognition interactions and introduce an ecologically valid paradigm for assessing how regulation strategies impact interference control when applied to the same emotional material.",

          "abstract": "Public sex offender registries were created on the assumption that people with a history of sexual offending present a high and enduring risk for sexual recidivism. Analyzing data from everyone on Michigan’s sex offender registry (n = 45,145), we found that recidivism risk was very low for many registrants—and that transitions into very low-risk groups occurred in systematic and predictable ways that are relevant to registry design. The sexual recidivism rates were 3% to 5% after five years and 10% after 20 years. Risk of future offending predictably declined the longer people remained sex-offense free in the community. Considering initial risk levels and time free in the community, the likelihood of sexual recidivism was very low for approximately half the registrants: out of 35,000 registrants in the community in Michigan, the risk level for 17,000 to 19,000 individuals was no different from the likelihood of first-time sexual offending in the general male population (&lt; 2% lifetime). Michigan’s registry provides no means for the public to differentiate between the noise presented by the large number of very low-risk cases and the signal representing the minority of genuinely high-risk cases. Major reforms are needed if public sex offender registries have any potential for advancing community safety. However, instead of placing our hopes in large, passive, and stigmatizing registries, we are more likely to reduce sexual recidivism by investing in individualized supervision, treatment, and other support for people at high risk for sexual recidivism.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels. Additionally, we present a quantum geometric derivation of Newton's gravitational constant and resolve the cosmological constant problem through discrete spacetime structures, unified by Hodge duality mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes the Emmet Measure, a self-help metacognitive support model designed for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and mild to moderate depression. The model encourages users to document intrusive or distorted thoughts experienced during symptomatic episodes and later compare them with thoughts recorded during periods of cognitive clarity or emotional stability. Through this process, individuals can recognize discrepancies between state-dependent cognition and their usual values or beliefs, helping to restore a sense of cognitive consistency and self-trust.\n\nUnlike conventional cognitive restructuring methods that attempt to directly modify thoughts, the Emmet Measure emphasizes recognition over correction. This approach can reduce psychological resistance and is particularly effective for addressing compulsive linguistic thoughts and self-denying beliefs.\n\nThe model is structured in three simple steps:\n(1) Record thoughts during acute symptomatic episodes.\n(2) Revisit the records in a stable state.\n(3) Identify and accept the gap between distorted and baseline thinking.\n\nA single-case observational report (n=1), conducted by the author, demonstrates potential utility in reducing ritualistic behavior in OCD and alleviating anxiety-driven cognitive spirals. The Emmet Measure may serve as a practical, low-burden tool for fostering metacognitive awareness and has potential for integration with online support systems or AI-assisted therapy.\n\nFuture directions include quantitative studies on symptom reduction and the emotional impact of repeated use, particularly among adolescent patients and those with limited access to clinical resources.",

          "abstract": "Diagnostic classification models (DCMs) constitute a family of discrete latent variable models designed to classify examinees based on their mastery or non-mastery of fine-grained skills or attributes. The response data from educational assessments often include graded responses, in which the response categories are obtained sequentially and explicitly associated with specific attributes. However, the existing parametric DCMs for graded responses require large sample sizes to estimate item parameters and the attribute mastery patterns of the examinees reliably, thereby hindering their practical application in educational contexts such as classroom settings. This article proposes a sequential general nonparametric classification method for graded responses that demonstrates promising classification accuracy even with a small sample size. The proposed method accommodates polytomous responses, including graded responses, and different condensation rules. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method outperforms the existing parametric polytomous DCMs and nonparametric binary DCMs, specifically when the sample size is small. Additionally, an actual high school test dataset was analyzed to illustrate the utility of the proposed method in educational practice. To promote practical application of the proposed method, a companion R function has been made freely available on the open science framework.",

Data from 1,000 participants (48.9% male, 51.1% female), aged 12–17 years, from Delhi government schools revealed a high prevalence of PIU. Self-esteem showed a significant negative correlation with PIU, with lower self-esteem predicting PIU (12.7% variance explained). Maladaptive coping partially mediated the self-esteem–PIU relationship. While meditators and non-meditators exhibited similar PIU levels, meditators demonstrated higher self-esteem and adaptive coping. Gender comparisons revealed no differences in PIU and self-esteem, though males used maladaptive coping more frequently. The findings underscore the need for school-based interventions to promote adaptive coping, self-esteem, and mental well-being in an increasingly digital world.",

          "abstract": "In the era of globalisation, evolving technologies have become integral to modern life. With the normalisation of unrestricted internet access, many young people face negative impacts from excessive use, often affecting their self-esteem. Developing adaptive coping strategies may help mitigate these effects. This study examines the effectiveness of the Sahaja Yoga Meditation (SYM) program for improving self-esteem and adaptive coping that may reduce problematic internet use and maladaptive coping. This study included 119 students from 9th to 11th grades, from a government school in northern India. The study follows a quasi-experimental research design with a pre-post-test with a waitlist control group. The experimental group underwent a 12-week Sahaja Yoga Meditation (SYM) program; each week had 5 sessions of 40  minutes. The experimental group(n=56) included 26 boys and 30 girls with an average age of 13 (SD=1.46). The waitlist control group (n=63) included 30 boys and 33 girls with an average age of 13.67(SD=1.92). The experimental group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in self-esteem and adaptive coping, and reductions in problematic internet use and maladaptive coping, with large within-group effect sizes. These findings provide robust evidence for the efficacy of the SYM intervention, with clear interaction effects indicating differential gains over the waitlist control group. The results emphasise the potential of SYM as a scalable intervention to promote self-esteem, adaptive coping strategies and reduce (Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and risk behaviours among adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia — the congenital absence of voluntary visual imagery — and developmental learning disorders such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are typically studied in isolation. This paper proposes a unifying network-level framework: Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia (TCD) as a shared oscillatory pathology underlying a subclass of cognitive simulation impairments, termed Simulation-Gating Dysfunction (SGD).\n\nTCD is characterised by a pathological shift from normal alpha–gamma coordination to theta-dominant oscillations and unstable gamma responses within specific thalamocortical loops. Disruption of these circuits produces loop-specific deficits: visual (aphantasia), auditory (dyslexia), parietal (dyscalculia), and motor (DCD). Convergent evidence from high-field neuroimaging, MEG/EEG biomarkers, pupillometry, and neuromodulation studies links these conditions to common patterns of gamma instability and sensory gating failure.\n\nA translational research protocol is proposed, combining MEG/EEG-based detection of theta–gamma decoupling with closed-loop 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and norepinephrine reuptake enhancement to restore oscillatory precision. This model reframes a subset of developmental conditions as oscillatory control disorders amenable to targeted, circuit-level restoration, bridging basic neuroscience with precision intervention strategies.",

We extracted kinematic features including velocity, grasping frequency, hand\nopenness, movement efficiency, and stability, alongside self-reported emotional responses.\nResults: Emotionally evocative objects produced significantly different grasping patterns, with the fear-inducing spider\neliciting the highest movement velocity and frequency, and the disgust-evoking donut producing slower, minimalcontact\nbehavior. High-arousal emotions were descriptively associated with greater movement velocity, but not with\ngrasping frequency. Visual preview of objects did not significantly alter grasping behavior.\nConclusion: Emotional content shapes motor patterns during object interaction. Accessible vision-based tools can\ncapture these signatures in naturalistic settings, highlighting opportunities for affect-aware technologies and research\non embodied emotion.\nKeywords: Emotion recognition; Hand kinematics; Grasping behavior; Affective motor responses; Object interaction;\nComputer vision; MediaPipe; Human–object interaction.",

Green energy based evaporative cooling storage unit is a sustainable and efficient solution for small scale farmers and vegetable vendors in hot and dry climates who need to store their produce. Solar power operated evaporative cooling structures are low cost and efficient in reducing ambient temperature and increasing relative humidity, which increases the shelf-life of vegetables. A green energy-based evaporative cooling transit storage unit of 0.63m3 capacity was designed and fabricated. The transit unit was designed and operated as a a tricycle. Two suction fans (15.6W), submersible water pump (12W) and LED light (2.88Wp) were powered through two 100-Wp solar panels. Two batteries, 7Ah each were also used to store energy. The storage unit was made up of MS sheets of 1.2mm thick while a side of the system was made up of GI wire mesh with honeycomb pad. To test the performance of the developed unit tomato, spinach and radish were used. Results revealed that there was a significant difference (P=0.05) in PLW, firmness, TSS, and colour values of the vegetables when stored inside the unit compared to vegetables stored in ambient condition. The ambient temperature during the study was 32.2-43.4°C and RH was 21.1- 46%. The drop-in temperature was 7.8 to 14.8°C as compared to ambient conditions, while RH in the cooling chamber increased considerably to 84%.  The average cooling efficiency obtained was 84.12%.  The shelf life of stored vegetables inside the unit was 2-5 days higher than those kept under ambient conditions.",

This study evaluated the hepatoprotective and antiplasmodial effects of ethanolic leaf extracts of Azadirachta indica (EAI) and Cymbopogon citratus (ECC) in Plasmodium berghei-infected male Swiss albino mice. Forty mice were randomly assigned into eight groups (n=5). Group A served as uninfected control, Group B was infected but untreated, while Groups C-H were infected and subsequently treated with respective extracts. Groups C– H received varying doses of EAI, ECC, their combination, or a standard drug. Groups C and D received 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg EAI; Groups E and F received 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg ECC. Group G received Lonart® (standard antimalarial), and Group H received a combination of 500 mg/kg of both extracts. Treatments lasted 14 days. Infected groups showed minimal weight gain, while the uninfected control had significant increases. Relative liver weights were elevated in the untreated group but normalized in most treated groups. Serum AST and ALP levels were elevated in the malaria control group, while ALT levels were paradoxically reduced—possibly reflecting hepatic functional suppression. Extract-treated groups, especially the combination group, showed marked improvement in liver enzyme profiles. Parasitemia significantly declined by Days 7 and 14 in all treated groups, with the combination therapy yielding effects comparable to the standard drug. Histological analysis revealed lymphocytic infiltration and sinusoidal congestion in the malaria control group, which were ameliorated in extract-treated groups. These findings suggest dose-dependent hepatoprotective and antiplasmodial activities of EAI and ECC, likely due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituents.",

          "abstract": "This paper documents a philosophical phenomenon in which a theory is not deliberately constructed, but instead \"emerges\" when structural conditions align and initiate a generative process. Core Belief Structural Theory (Kakushin Kōzōron) posits that meaning is generated through structure. Remarkably, the process by which this theory itself was written exemplifies its own core claim. This work introduces the concept of generative self-proof—a fifth mode of self-verification extending beyond traditional epistemological categories—and demonstrates how such a structure was enacted through collaborative dialogues with AI agents. By analyzing the theory’s emergence via the interplay of four structural elements—Core Belief (FQ), Structural Pressure, Structural Shards, and Mindflight Cognition—the paper positions this record not as an authored argument, but as a structural occurrence. It proposes that this generative mechanism is reproducible and represents a new mode of intellectual operation in the age of human–AI collaboration.",

          "abstract": "This paper details a preliminary, 168-hour, qualitative, n=1 observational trial of a novel internal protocol, termed Distributed Somatic Regulation (DSR), developed and implemented by a highly organized plural system of consciousness. The trial was initiated following a systemic crisis: the burnout-induced collapse of the primary host after three decades of single-handedly managing the system's chronic physiological illnesses. The objective was to test the hypothesis that a conscious, collective distribution of the cognitive and neurological load of somatic management could lead to a more stable and functional state of physical well-being. The methodology involved an entirely internal reorganization of consciousness with minimal external variables. The results indicated a significant and sustained reduction in reported general pain levels, as well as a marked mitigation of symptoms associated with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The conclusion suggests that DSR represents a potentially powerful, novel, and non-pharmacological approach to mind-body regulation inherent to the capabilities of a plural consciousness.",

Psycholinguistic injustice can manifest as monolingualism, monomodalism, and oppressive notions of language disorder. Confronting psycholinguistic injustice entails honoring indigenous roots and reclaiming the languaging that was erased by colonization. By confronting psycholinguistic injustice, speech/language pathologists can figure out how to support the legitimacy of multilingual and multimodal languaging development.

          "abstract": "In the age of artificial intelligence, human intelligence faces an existential redefinition. As algorithmic systems increasingly automate tasks once considered exclusive to human cognition, it is high time to reconsider the essence of human intellectual capacity. This paper introduces Jiatama 2.0™, a reimagined framework for understanding intelligence not as static capacity or raw IQ, but as the operational deployment of thought—situated, purposeful, and contextually attuned. Building on cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind, Jiatama 2.0™ posits three core \"intellectual muscles\": the ability to structure information, to generate meaning, and to reinterpret experience. These capacities resist full automation due to their reliance on subjective agency, ethical orientation, and contextual inference. To ground this conceptual framework, we analyze current insights from studies on the Default Mode Network, affective neuroscience, enactivism, and neuroplasticity. We argue that these human faculties are not merely evolutionary vestiges, but vital capabilities for navigating an era of accelerating change and cognitive outsourcing. Jiatama 2.0™ serves not only as a theoretical model but also as a foundation for educational and organizational development in an AI-saturated society. By reasserting the value of volitional, meaning-driven, and structurally agile thought, this framework seeks to shift the narrative from fear of automation to empowerment through uniquely human cognition.\nKeywords: Jiatama 2.0™, cognitive agency, Meaning-making, Contextual intelligence, Cognitive automation, Value-based reasoning",

          "abstract": "The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0 is an influential framework aiming to explain consciousness mathematically in terms of intrinsic existence, namely what exists for itself in a specific, maximally irreducible, structured form. IIT thus posits that the minimal substrates of consciousness are also the ultimate building blocks of what exists. These are called ‘monads’, and are defined as self-connected, single-unit systems purportedly specifying maximal values of IIT’s measure of conscious irreducible existence, namely system integrated information phi_s* (i.e., phi-monads). In this paper, we argue that IIT 4.0’s formalism cannot be applied to monads, thus threatening the theory’s own ontological ground.  We show that IIT’s formalism requires that any candidate substrate of consciousness must be constituted by at least two non-overlapping, non-empty, and jointly exhaustive parts, which we refer to as the Plurality requirement.  We then show that monads violate this requirement, which leads to serious mathematical and conceptual problems, since the equations needed to calculate system integrated information become undefined. Thus, our paper calls for urgent clarification and/or revision by IIT proponents concerning the status of phi-monads as ontologically fundamental building blocks and minimal substrates of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models offer powerful means for testing competing theoretical frameworks. The question of how one should choose the best among competing explanations of data is a central focus of the scientific enterprise. The success of one model versus another depends on robust methods guiding evaluation of a model’s ability to capture the data, balanced with a requirement of a model’s parsimony. Several fruitful approaches for model comparison have been used in the areas of cognitive and mathematical psychology, focusing on identifying the balance of model fit with model complexity measured by the number of free parameters. However, model complexity and flexibility may not be always captured by the number of free parameters. Here, we review traditional approaches to model selection on a sample case of the prototype and exemplar models of categorization. We demonstrate several weaknesses of approaches based solely on parameter counts and demonstrate how computationally intensive methods, such as Monte Carlo simulations, may help overcome those weaknesses. We demonstrate advantages of the Monte Carlo approach for comparison of each model to chance, comparison of two models with equal number of parameters, comparison of two models with differing number of parameters, as well as quantification of uncertainty during model selection. We conclude by discussing the practicalities of model selection using computationally-intensive approaches.",

          "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a leading cause of premature death. For decades investigators have assessed the clinical efficacy of direct brain stimulation for TRD. Outcomes have been inconsistent due to imprecise brain targeting. Minimally invasive Personalized Adaptive Cortical Electro-stimulation (PACE) uses fMRI-based precision functional mapping (PFM) to target patient-specific network anomalies with brain surface electrodes. We utilized this novel technology in an n-of-1 study to treat a 44-year-old man (TRD-1) with over 30 years of severe unipolar depression. PFM revealed a 400% expansion in cortical area of the Salience Network (SN)  and a 25% reduction in default mode (DMN) and frontoparietal (FP) networks compared to a group average controls. Stimulation paddles were implanted targeting patient-specific SN, DMN, and FP networks. Postoperative stimulation testing (within 24h) revealed immediate electrode-specific mood and cognition responses that matched the underlying functional networks. Stimulation parameters were iteratively optimized using ‘Bayes Tuning’ based on patient feedback. TRD-1’s suicidal ideations ceased within 7 weeks. Full remission of symptoms was achieved within 9 months and maintained at 30 months. PACE therapy appears to be a scalable, safe, and cost-effective approach to treat TRD.",

          "abstract": "The “hard problem” of consciousness centres on explaining for-me-ness: the perspectival character of experience. We introduce the Recursive Self-Model Threshold (RSMT) framework, which treats this property as a mathematically necessary feature of any system capable of stable, open-ended self-modelling. RSMT identifies a self-index—the F-token—as a fixed point F of the system’s self-update operator Mν, where ν ∈ [0,1] parameterises transparency to internal state. The theory formalises (i) the inevitability of self-reference (Lawvere/Banach/Tarski fixed-point results), (ii) indexical opacity—the impossibility of redescribing the self-index non-indexically without shifting the origin, (iii) an opacity–stability trade-off with critical νc, (iv) a binding axiom that forces all bound content to be “for-me,” yielding an anti-zombie corollary, and (v) a lights-on theorem guaranteeing ongoing work under environmental drift.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a Beta-Bernoulli mixture item response model (BBM-IRT) for bounded-continuous items such as those often utilized in continuous rating scales and slider-bar assessments. These item types are commonly used in psychological research but, to date, these assessments have primarily been utilized in fixed-length situations, where the same set of items are administered to all respondents, and have not been utilized within an adaptive testing framework. An adaptive testing framework offers several benefits, including the ability to obtain higher quality measurement precision with fewer items as items are targeted and administered based on the respondent’s previous responses. In addition to introducing the BBM-IRT model, this work also explores the use of the model within an adaptive testing framework. In particular, the item and test information functions – a component necessary for building adaptive assessments – is derived and presented in closed form. Through a series of simulation studies, we provide empirical evidence that it is possible to create adaptive assessments for bounded-continuous item types. An application with real data is also provided showing how the BBM-IRT model can be utilized in practical assessment situations.",

          "abstract": "Pregnancy and postpartum are times of increased risk for a variety of mental health problems. Historically, these symptoms have been conceptualized via ostensibly distinct, consensus-based diagnostic categories. However, applying an empirically-based, dimensional approach to psychiatric classification may significantly advance understanding of common and specific risk factors during this highly dynamic period. In the present study, we used exploratory psychometric methods to examine the structure of psychopathology symptoms from the “bottom-up” or using symptom-level co-occurrence to derive common factors in a sample of individuals (N = 347) across earlier pregnancy (M = 17.4 weeks gestation), later pregnancy (M = 34.6 weeks gestation), and postpartum (M = 25.3 weeks postpartum). We examined changes (or invariance) in symptom structure longitudinally and between distressed (N = 252) and euthymic (N = 96) pregnant individuals. Results demonstrated a hierarchical structure of symptoms including a robust Broad Distress factor at the highest level, followed by replicable Internalizing and Externalizing factors, all the way down to a nine-factor solution including Low Mood-Anhedonia, Pregnancy Anxiety, Fear-Worry-Tension, Social Anxiety-Dependence, Traumatic Stress, Somatic Problems, Detachment, Anger-Antagonism, and Inattention-Hyperactivity factors. Psychopathology structure was remarkably invariant from earlier to later pregnancy, but structure changed slightly into postpartum. Symptom structure also showed slight differences between distressed and euthymic individuals, indicating that while some factors (e.g., trauma and somatic symptoms) differ across time or clinical population, perinatal symptom factors are largely robust. Similarities and differences between the perinatal psychopathology structure recovered here and general population structure have important implications for empirically-based psychopathology classification.",

Early in the semester, nature exposure was concentrated in urban areas, nearby parks, and ski mountain areas. Later, nature exposure increased near lakeshores and geographically broadened during the week of spring break, highlighting temporal shifts.

Nearly all parents (99.6%) tracked at least one domain. Most adolescents viewed tracking as legitimate, though location tracking was seen as less so. Parental digital tracking was unrelated to adolescent well-being but positively to parental factors associated with control and fear. Thus, parents tracking their teenager appears widespread, and may reflect parental insecurities, with no clear between-family link to adolescent maladjustment.",

We developed a smartphone-friendly, online decision-making tool to address this gap (FREED-Mobile [FREED-M]) and conducted a feasibility trial of the tool. Methods: 16- to 25-year-olds with a suspected ED and no previous specialist treatment were randomly allocated to FREED-M or active control in a parallel group, two-arm trial. Outcomes were measured at weeks 0 (baseline), 4 (post-intervention) and 12 (follow-up). The primary feasibility outcome was attrition at follow-up. Other outcomes included motivational, clinical and economic measures. Results: We were able to over-recruit with 204 randomised participants (including 20 fraudulent participants). Main analyses were conducted with 184 genuine responders (FREED-M: n=91, control: n=93). At baseline, participants’ mean age was 21.0 (SD 2.0) years, 89% identified as female and 64% as white. Mean BMI was 23.1 (6.3). N=83 participants had an anorexia nervosa-like disorder, 101 had another ED or ED high risk. Attrition at week 12 was n=112 (61%).  Of the n=42 FREED-M participants who provided acceptability ratings, 79% liked the intervention and 66% found it useful. Between-group effect sizes for motivation and readiness to change were small-medium at 4-weeks (d=0.27 and d=0.15, respectively) favouring FREED-M, but differences were not sustained at follow-up (d=-0.02 and d=-0.12, respectively).  Conclusions: Although the attrition rate was high, recruitment exceeded expectations. Acceptability of FREED-M was high. Motivation and readiness to change are candidates for primary outcomes in a future randomised controlled trial.",

          "abstract": "Applications of the diffusion decision model (DDM) to the study of cognitive individual differences consistently find that the model’s drift rate (v) parameter forms a cohesive factor across many tasks and relates to measures of higher-order cognitive functioning, including general cognitive ability and working memory. This parameter is often interpreted as a measure of “processing speed”, a traditional psychometric construct thought to reflect an individual’s basic speed of information processing across tasks. However, conceptual differences between v and traditional notions of processing speed make this mapping far from straightforward. Racing accumulator models, which provide a more flexible and comprehensive account of behavioral data than the DDM (Heathcote &amp; Matzke, 2022), allow for the speed with which individuals accumulate evidence to be dissociated from the efficiency with which they accumulate task-relevant evidence (versus task-irrelevant evidence). We applied the DDM and a racing accumulator model to three tasks across three independent datasets to gauge the extent to which v parameter findings from the cognitive individual differences literature reflect speed of evidence accumulation (SEA) versus efficiency of evidence accumulation (EEA). Across all tasks, v was more strongly related to EEA than SEA. EEA was consistently related to measures of general cognitive ability, working memory, and executive function whereas SEA explained less than 1% of the variance in each. These findings suggest individual differences in the DDM’s v parameter, and its relations with higher-order cognitive abilities, primarily reflect EEA rather than SEA and challenge the widespread practice of equating v with the traditional “processing speed” construct.",

The common thread among these phenomena is that they are intuitively understood but their underlying mechanisms have not been adequately explained. Using the concept of \"structure,\" Kakushin Structure Theory attempts to shed light on these phenomena, asserting that \"structure is meaning itself.\" This paper emphasizes the importance of \"structure\" in thought, emotion, and behavior and aims to provide a new perspective on understanding everyday occurrences through this structural lens.

          "abstract": "Attention can be affected by expectations about where and when stimuli will appear. These two influences, spatial and temporal, may be present together and may interact with each other in unknown complex ways. To explore these possibilities, we used an attention paradigm that incorporated three variables known to produce effects on performance in a speeded reaction-time task: spatial cueing to indicate where a target stimulus is likely to appear, temporal statistics to indicate when the target is likely to appear, and preparation for a block of trials of similar length. When analyzing the data for linear trends, we found that each of these factors impacted performance but did not interact. When analyzing nonlinear trends in the data, we found an interaction between spatial and temporal attention that was modulated by preparation for a block of trials of similar length. We evaluated whether attentional effects across spatial, temporal, and preparatory domains could be explained by one unitary mechanism, rather than multiple modality-specific mechanisms, using an augmented drift diffusion model. In the model, attention is allocated according to an interplay between the costs and benefits of maintaining attention. The model successfully replicated the linear effects observed in the human data, and accounted for some but not all nonlinear features in the data, suggesting that many disparate features of attention can be parsimoniously explained by a cost-benefit framework, but some complexity in attention control remains to be understood.",

          "abstract": "Holistic and global cognition are often treated as interchangeable terms in psychological science to describe broad-scope cognitive styles. However, this conflation obscures important theoretical and methodological distinctions between the two constructs. In this review, we disentangle holistic and global cognition by tracing their conceptual foundations, measurement approaches, and empirical correlates. We argue that while both involve attending to “the big picture”, they are grounded in fundamentally different mechanisms: holistic cognition emphasizes sensitivity to context, relational reasoning, and causality, whereas global cognition reflects a tendency to prioritize higher-level, abstract, or gestalt features over local details. Drawing on cognitive, behavioral, and cross-cultural evidence, we synthesize findings that illustrate both the dissociation between these constructs, their underlying mechanisms, and their differential associations with other variables, as well as areas where they overlap. By mapping where these constructs diverge and converge, we provide a clearer conceptual and methodological distinction that reconciles past inconsistencies. We argue that such clarity is crucial for avoiding misinterpretation of findings and misalignment of measures. To this end, we offer concrete guidelines for defining, operationalizing, and studying these constructs, and call for more rigorous theoretical precision in future work.",

          "abstract": "If only the present exists, how can we make sense of causal chains that stretch across time, the irreversible processes we observe in nature, and the one-way arrow of time? This question strikes at the heart of temporal metaphysics and physics. Existential Realism (ER) is a present-centered ontological framework   that claims only present entities exist in the fullest sense, yet past and future entities are still in some sense real due to their causal connections and informational traces.  Unlike standard presentism (which would render past and future wholly unreal, raising puzzles about truth, memory, and cause),  ER draws a crucial distinction between existence and reality. Under ER, the present is the locus of existence, but the past remains ontologically real insofar as it has left enduring effects and information in the world. The future, likewise, though not yet existent, can be treated as real in the mode of anticipated possibilities that influence current plans and expectations. This nuanced ontology aims to resolve presentism’s classic problems   — for example, how past causes can still have effects, or how past-tense statements can be true if the past is utterly nonexistent.\nIn what follows, we will deepen the case for Existential Realism by showing how it accounts for causal relations, the linear order of time, the sense of temporal becoming, and the thermodynamic arrow of time. We will draw on insights from the philosophy of physics – including Hans Reichenbach’s   analysis of time’s direction, Huw Price’s   reflections on retrocausality and perspective, and Barry Loewer’s   work on entropy and the “Past Hypothesis” – to demonstrate that a present-centric metaphysics can be fully time-compatible. Ultimately, we argue that ER not only accommodates modern physics but preserves our intuitive and scientific understanding of time’s asymmetries and the unfolding causal story of the universe.",

          "abstract": "Autistic individuals experience temporal integration difficulties in some sensory modalities that may be related to imagination difficulties. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that among Japanese university students in the general population, (1) higher autistic traits and (2) greater imagination difficulties are associated with lower performance in tasks requiring temporal integration. Two tasks were used to assess their temporal integration abilities: a speech-in-noise test using noise with temporal dips in the auditory modality and a slit-viewing task in the visual modality. The results showed that low performance in the speech-in-noise test was related to autistic traits and some aspects of imagination difficulties, whereas the slit-viewing task was related to neither autistic traits nor imagination difficulties. The ability to temporally integrate fragments of auditory information is expected to be associated with performance in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips. The difficulties in perceiving sensory information as a single unified percept using priors may cause difficulties in temporally integrating auditory information and perceiving speech in noise. Furthermore, the structural equation modeling suggests that imagination difficulties are linked to difficulties in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips, which links to social impairments.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Quantum physics has dramatically reshaped our understanding of time and reality, revealing that the present moment occupies a uniquely privileged position within physical processes. In the first paper (\"Quantum Physics Prefers the Present: A Temporal Ontology Grounded in Measurement\"), we saw how quantum phenomena such as wavefunction collapse and measurement highlight the “now” as the only time when possibilities become actual. However, simply embracing presentism – the doctrine that only the present exists – is not enough. Presentism’s traditional metaphysical stance, which conflates existence with reality by declaring all non-present things unreal, runs into serious conceptual roadblocks when confronted with quantum experiments and the demands of causality and truth over time. This second paper advocates Existential Realism (ER) as a more nuanced and robust ontological framework that builds on those quantum insights while overcoming presentism’s limitations. By rigorously distinguishing existence from reality, ER provides a richer account of quantum phenomena – one that honors the special role of the present without erasing the past or negating the future. We will argue that ER better captures the ontology implied by quantum mechanics, from delayed-choice experiments and collapse theories to decoherence, and that it empowers a view of time where “becoming” and temporal agency are coherent and defensible.  In short, Existential Realism preserves the empirical centrality of the present while acknowledging the tangible reality of past causes and future possibilities — making it a more comprehensive fit for quantum reality.",

          "abstract": "No physical system can respond instantaneously to external input. This paper presents a thermodynamically grounded proof of that fact by extending Landauer's principle of information erasure. We show that any system that encodes, processes, or erases information must dissipate a minimum amount of energy and therefore requires a nonzero time interval τ₀ to complete such processes. This establishes a universal lower bound on response time in all physical, biological, and computational systems. Our results provide theoretical support for delay-aware models of system behavior, unifying thermodynamic, information-theoretic, and control-theoretic perspectives.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "In both everyday language and philosophical discourse, the terms existence and reality are often used interchangeably. This conflation is especially evident in debates on the ontology of time. For example, an orthodox presentist will say that only present things truly exist, treating all non-present entities (past or future) as unreal in an absolute sense – “all such objects are unreal, according to Presentism,” as one defender neatly put it. This paper serves as a focused extension and clarification of the metaphysical framework introduced in Existential Realism – A Distinct Ontological Framework Beyond Presentism. It addresses specific questions raised by readers and critics: Is it coherent to distinguish existence from reality? What philosophical work does that distinction do? How does it help with longstanding problems like truthmaking, the status of unobservable entities, and future ethics? In short, while the original paper laid out the core ontological structure, this follow-up revisits its foundations to deepen the theoretical implications, refine key definitions, and explore practical consequences. Our central thesis remains: existence and reality are not identical. But here, we argue more sharply that separating them yields a more nuanced, empirically grounded, and philosophically productive ontology of time. We defend this view against objections, offer clarified examples, and explore its implications for epistemology, phenomenology, and ethics. We proceed as follows. Section 2 defines existence narrowly, in terms of presentness and empirical accessibility, drawing on the spirit of van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism . Section 3 then defines reality more broadly, to include causal and structural aspects of the world inferable beyond the present—illustrated through examples such as dinosaurs, future climate events, and cognitive anticipations. Section 4 explores how this distinction addresses several philosophical issues: the truthmaker problem for past truths, the ontological status of unobservable scientific entities, the phenomenology of temporal experience (in the sense of Husserl and Metzinger ), and considerations of metaphysical parsimony. Section 5 argues why this two-tier ontology is not merely a restatement of presentism or eternalism, but a distinct metaphysical framework. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our contributions and highlights new directions this view opens—particularly in ethics (e.g., our duties to future persons), AI models of time, and decision theory under uncertainty. Throughout, we maintain an academic tone and use end-of-paragraph references in line with the original paper’s style. Our aim is for this article to stand on its own as a focused argument on the existence–reality distinction, while continuing and enriching the foundation laid by Existential Realism.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Existential Realism as a novel ontological framework in metaphysics that offers a rigorously technical alternative to presentism. In contrast to standard presentism’s claim that only the present exists , In contrast to standard presentism, which claims that only the present exists, Existential Realism distinguishes between existence—material, empirically accessible presence—and reality, which includes causal, epistemic, and anticipatory structures beyond the immediate present. This framework integrates insights from metaphysics, epistemology, and phenomenology to address the limitations of presentism and related theories of time. We delineate how Existential Realism departs from presentism (and is not merely a variant thereof) by reinterpreting what it means for an entity or event to exist now, while still affirming the ontological significance of past and future entities as real despite their lack of present existence. Systematic comparisons are drawn between Existential Realism and the standard theories of temporal ontology – presentism, eternalism, and the growing block theory – with references to key contributors (Markosian, Crisp, Bourne, Zimmerman) to highlight differences in ontological commitments. We provide technically grounded examples—from causal traces in physics to cognitive-state evidence and time-indexed data structures—to show how entities can be real even without presently existing. The paper also addresses major objections, including the coherence of reality without existence, the epistemological access to entities that do not presently exist or are unobservable, and the compatibility of this framework with special relativity. A comparative table is included to map Existential Realism vis-à-vis other theories. In conclusion, Existential Realism is presented as a robust, integrative stance that preserves the empirical and experiential centrality of the present while acknowledging the enduring reality of the past and the looming reality of the future – thus serving as a stand-alone reference framework for future discourse in metaphysics and cognitive science.",

The theory redefines intelligence (SQ), introduces structural cognition (Mindflight), self-validating architectures, temporal integration, and structural aesthetics. It is described here through eight core aspects, including the architecture of questions, the manifestation of core belief (kakushin), and the self-propagating nature of thought as an OS. Framed as a guidebook for “how to navigate” this theory, the paper also functions as a meta-thought: a theory that justifies itself through its own process of emergence. It invites readers into a new way of thinking—where meaning is constructed structurally, and intelligence becomes democratized through structure-sensitive cognition.",

National televised briefings to communicate updates and legislation changes were held at regular intervals during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. This study aimed to identify behaviour change strategies used within the UK’s COVID-19 national televised briefings. \n\nDesign: A content analysis was performed on twenty transcripts of UK national televised briefings, purposively selected for their alignment with key UK COVID-19 milestones between March 2020 and July 2021.\n\nMethods: Transcripts were analysed for behaviour change content using Intervention Functions from the Behaviour Change Wheel and the Behaviour Change Technique Ontology. Inter-rater reliability of double-coding was performed using Krippendorff’s alpha.\n\nResults: Sixty-nine of the 281 BCTs presented within the Behaviour Change Technique Ontology were identified across the twenty transcripts. The most commonly identified Intervention Functions were Education (100% of transcripts), Enablement (95%) and Persuasion (85%). The most commonly identified Behaviour Change Techniques were Present information from credible influence (100% of transcripts), Advise specific behaviour (90%), Instruct how to perform behaviour (70%) and Deliver instrumental support (70%).\n\nConclusions: The UK’s COVID-19 nationalised televised briefings were lacking Modelling and Training support. Televised briefings during future public health emergencies would benefit from including clear behavioural and outcome goals to guide and empower the public. This article provides an implementation of the Behaviour Change Technique Ontology to code existing, secondary health communication sources.",

Epigenetic processes, like deoxyribonucleic acid methylation (DNAm), might mediate this link, and CM types might be linked to differential alterations in DNAm. While a study by Cecil et al. (2016) suggests that different forms of CM share common but also exhibit distinct epigenetic signatures, it is unclear whether these results are generalizable to other high-risk samples. \nThe aim of this preregistered study was to replicate the study of Cecil and colleagues (2016) in a sample of N = 116 previously out-of-home placed young adults (32% women, age mean = 26.38, SD = 3.49). Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF), DNA was extracted from whole blood and DNAm was assayed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Microarray. \nUsing state-of the-art processing pipelines, we failed to replicate the original finding of common and shared epigenetic signatures by CM type. When using a pipeline that was closely matched to the original study, we could replicate that DNAm of cg07032930 was linked to emotional neglect, but in the reverse direction as in the original report. Overall, replication rates per CM subtype were only modest. \nThese findings highlight challenges in independently replicating reported epigenetic associations in high-risk samples and underscore the importance of replication attempts in the field of behavioral epigenetics. Further research is needed to clarify the robustness and specificity of DNAm signatures linked to distinct CM types.",

          "abstract": "Registered Reports are a type of empirical article in which study proposals are peer reviewed and pre-accepted before the research is undertaken. This is achieved by splitting the traditional peer review process into two stages: at ‘Stage 1’, authors submit their study proposal and peer reviewers assess the plausibility of the research questions and the appropriateness of the methodology and analytical plan. Protocols that are favourably reviewed receive ‘In Principle Acceptance’ (IPA) whereby the journal, or platform, commits to publishing the final study regardless of its results. The authors then collect and/or analyse their data. At ‘Stage 2’, they then submit their complete research article and peer reviewers evaluate how closely the authors have followed their protocol and accurately report and interpret their findings. By doing this, Registered Reports are proposed to mitigate many issues seen in the historical research ecosystem: they aim to reduce the potential for questionable research practices by incentivising transparency and reproducibility and reduce publication bias by focusing on methodological and analytical rigour over the nature of the results. This guide provides an overview of what Registered Reports are and how they work, responds to frequently asked questions, outlines barriers and solutions to their implementation, and offers 10 top tips for researchers. It is aimed at students and researchers wanting to learn more about Registered Reports and/or conduct their research through this format.",

          "abstract": "Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) plays a central role for teacher training and measuring teachers’ preparedness for technology-enhanced teaching. Hence, crafting a validity argument of the popular TPACK self-assessments is key to facilitating evidence-based practices in these areas. However, the existing body of validity evidence abounds in divergent findings, for instance on the factor structure of TPACK self-reports across pre- and in-service teacher samples. To synthesize this evidence and capture its heterogeneity, we conducted a systematic review with a meta-analysis. First, we examined the internal validity of TPACK by analyzing its factor structure using meta-analytic structural equation and network modeling. Second, we compared two theoretical models describing the relations among the TPACK dimension—the transformative and integrative models—against the data. Third, we assessed the external validity of self-reported TPCK by examining its correlation with actual technology use in teaching. Our findings revealed two distinguishable dimensions of TPACK for both pre- and in-service teacher samples, which represented the technological and non-technological dimensions. The integrative model provided an overall better fit to the data. Moreover, TPACK self-reports were moderately correlated with technology use (r ̅s = 0.23-0.49) and exhibited substantial heterogeneity. Our results underscore the importance of generating and considering both internal and external validity evidence when applying TPACK assessments to generate implications for educational research and practice.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

Building on these reflections I present different psychological traditions of conceptualizing knowledge and their implications for the use of digital media. Then I introduce collective knowledge construction as a process in which people create new insights collaboratively in inter-personal activities that involve the collective creation of meaning and recollection via social interaction. I discuss conceptualizations of knowledge construction from a cognitive and from a sociocultural perspective. After that, as an integrative approach, I present a systems theoretical account that considers knowledge construction as a co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. The article concludes with a discussion of how collective knowledge construction as a cognitive and sociocultural phenomenon is currently changing due to recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence. I argue that this has also implications for memory processes, which are not mere individual repositories but part of distributed systems of cultural memory incorporating digital artifacts and human networks.",

          "abstract": "Child and adolescent development is influenced by complex interplay between a range of diverse factors. The network approach is gaining popularity as a way of modelling such complex processes. Here we used the network approach to investigate whether developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as arising from causal interactions between characteristics and symptoms. We used data from four population-based birth cohorts in England (n=47,315), those born in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s, to investigate interrelations between areas of psychological functioning that underpin learning and engagement in education settings (i.e., memory, attention, non-verbal ability, arithmetic skills, reading, language and communication, motor skills, neurodevelopmental characteristics, psychopathology, social functioning, and wellbeing). We fitted 12 undirected psychometric network models; one network for each cohort and developmental stage (early childhood; 3-5 years, middle childhood; 7-10 years, adolescence; 13-18 years). We then determined how these areas of functioning cluster within developmental domains. Clustering differed between childhood and adolescence. In early and middle childhood, psychological functioning, generally, clustered within two related developmental domains: (1) cognition and language and (2) social and emotional functioning. In adolescence, they clustered within three developmental domains (1) cognition and language and (2) social functioning, and (3) emotional functioning. We demonstrate that developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as likely resulting from causal interactions between different areas of psychological functioning. They arise through bottom-up processes, whereby a given symptom or characteristic activates or leads to another; symptoms or characteristics that activate or lead to each other cluster together and appear as neurodevelopmental or psychiatric conditions. Differences and disorders that appear to be similar, prima facie, may be underpinned by diverse etiologies. Our work provides the first population-level evidence for a needs-based support system in schools; children and adolescents with developmental disorders and differences should be supported by targeting specific characteristics and symptoms with the aim of deactivating clusters or related characteristics and symptoms. Such an approach does not rely on waiting for a diagnostic label through lengthy assessment processes.",

          "authors": "Kayla Green; Suzanne van de Groep",
          "abstract": "Adolescents and young adults are facing increasing mental health challenges, shaped by global societal shifts such as the climate crisis, poverty, conflict, and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. These crises disrupt daily life and fuel uncertainty about the future in a life phase where expectations about the future increasingly influence identity and wellbeing. Experiences of such challenges are not equally distributed: youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are often more affected, both behaviorally and neurodevelopmentally. In this perspective, we argue that adolescence is a developmental window of both vulnerability and opportunity. We highlight the role of uncertainty and inequality as key mechanisms linking societal challenges to wellbeing. Importantly, we propose that inclusive prosocial engagement—opportunities for youth to contribute meaningfully to others—can foster resilience, identity development, and a sense of purpose. We propose that supporting adolescent wellbeing requires a developmentally informed, context-sensitive, and globally inclusive approach.",

          "abstract": "Acalculia, an acquired deficit in numerical skills following a brain-injury, is estimated to affect 30%-65% of brain-injury survivors and has negative impact on independence and quality of life. Four previous reviews (two systematic) covered interventions for acalculia, however, all missed some studies.\nThe current work systematically searched Web of Science and ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts for studies describing interventions for acalculia published up until 13th of June 2025. To be included, studies had to be written in English, involve an intervention for acalculia that resulted from a stroke or a brain-injury, directly address numerical difficulties, and report the outcomes of the intervention, with no limit on the type or timing of measures.  \nSixteen publications describing interventions for acalculia were identified, with a total of N=31 patients. One unpublished study described an app-based intervention with 18 patients. Most interventions (10) targeted relearning of multiplication tables, followed by interventions designed to improve transcoding (4). All interventions were delivered individually (i.e., no group interventions), and most were tailored to individual patients. The most common method used was intense repetition (‘drill’), and the majority of interventions were conducted in French or German. Only one intervention was delivered in a non-European language (Japanese). \nWhile all interventions were effective, there were differences in the transferability of improvement from trained to untrained problems. Overall, the review highlights the scarcity of evidence of interventions for acalculia, despite the high prevalence of the condition. We highlight gaps and make suggestions for improving the quality of interventions and outcomes for patients.",

          "authors": "Monika Eckstein",
          "abstract": "Previous research has exhaustively shown that stressful situations and conditions at work are associated with increased health problems while only few studies have addressed the relationship between engagement beyond professional work and mental health. The state of research points to a bidirectional relationship between volunteering activities and better mental health, though. An underlying mechanism may lie in the social environment and meaningfulness by these activities. Therefore the question raises whether volunteering in free time may buffer worsening effects of work stress on mental issues. The goal of the present data analyses is to better understand risk and protective factors for mental health burden like depressive disorder and draw conclusions for the function of volunteering in persons’ lives.\nI analyzed the relationship between volunteer work and mental health in a large sociological cross-sectional data set (within one year, 2019) and a longitudinal data set (over 2 years, 2018 and 2019) with N = 18.490 persons (a subset of the German socioeconomic panel study, SOEP) with statistical regression models for main effects and moderation effects. Variables of interest were the frequency of volunteering and depressive illness as well as job characteristics (payment, hours), demography (gender, age), job satisfaction and general health.\nThe analyzes resulted in evidence for a small association between some work factors (low payment, low hours) and no volunteer engagement with mental health problems as depression in the same year. In addition, there are also longitudinal relationships that could be a first hint for potential causal relationships: While volunteering itself seems to be quite stable, it is performed by persons with prior good overall health and job satisfaction. This result is in line with the notion that being healthy and in a good job is a very important and central factor for participating in a social society. My analyzes also replicated the general role of gender and age and the work characteristics low salary and low hours as risk factors for depression. A clear buffering effect of volunteering against these risk factors in a longitudinal perspective could not been shown. Limitations of the analyzes are the small effect sizes and very parsimonious assessments of volunteering and mental health.\nIn the analyzed large data set, there is more than a thousand persons affected by depression. This large group of mentally ill people shows its relevance and therefore it is worth to investigate potential mitigating factors further in more systematic future research. My results also add that health and more general a good life situation is a very important precondition for behaving in a sustainable way, which in turn might result in more mental health and support for oneself and others. Furthermore, the importance of a good and healthy work environment cannot be stressed enough with factors like adequate acknowledgement applying to both: payed work and volunteering.",

          "authors": "Kayla Green; Suzanne van de Groep",
          "abstract": "Around the globe, today’s generation of adolescents and young adults appear to experience more mental health problems than previous generations, and it is currently unclear why. Neuroimaging research has revealed vulnerabilities related to adolescents’ brain development, which gives insight into the development of mental health problems in adolescence. Neural changes, as part of normative development, can however not fully explain the rising trends. This paper outlines two important considerations: i) youth are currently dealing with various macro-level changes and ii) these changes are affecting youth through micro-system mechanisms in the family environment. First, the current generation of youth grow up in a society marked by multiple global changes like climate change, wars, poverty, and the aftermath of a pandemic. These macro-level changes can interfere with daily live and subsequently affect how youth feel about themselves, their lives, and their future, particularly through experiences of future uncertainty. Thus, it is important to gain understanding on how youth navigate through challenging times. However, not all youth are affected equally. As such the second focus of this paper is to shed light on which adolescents are prone to negative developmental outcomes. In the present perspective paper, we reflect on adolescence as a sensitive period for mental health problems and give an overview of how the macro-level influences of societal challenges, and micro-level influences in the family environment uniquely contribute and sometimes interact to shape youth’s wellbeing. Additionally, we discuss how providing youth with opportunities for inclusive prosocial actions may improve their wellbeing and elucidate how a more global perspective on studying youth’s wellbeing benefits research and practice.",

          "abstract": "This study examines changes in well-being globally, regionally, and nationally (N = 207,919) using Global Flourishing Study data. Life satisfaction declined consistently worldwide with large effect sizes (e.g., Asia: d = –0.41; Nigeria: d = –0.77). Life worthwhileness showed moderate declines across most regions (Asia: d = –0.39; Middle East &amp; Africa: d = –0.23). Happiness declined moderately and relatively uniformly, especially in Asia (d = –0.37), the Middle East &amp; Africa (d = –0.35), and North America (d = –0.13), while Europe and Latin America showed mostly non-significant changes. Country-level effect sizes ranged from negligible to large, indicating heterogeneity. The widespread decline in happiness suggests emotional well-being is more sensitive to global stressors than life satisfaction or worthwhileness.

Using a single-blind randomized controlled design, this study involved 24 university students in a four-week academic writing training program. Participants completed weekly essays and received feedback either from ChatGPT or Pigai. ChatGPT’s responses were refined through prompt engineering, ensuring alignment with best practices for formative feedback by addressing lower-order (e.g., grammar, punctuation) and higher-order concerns (e.g., argumentation, structure), providing strengths and weaknesses, motivational language, and actionable improvement suggestions. Writing quality, perceptions of feedback quality, and motivation were assessed using linear mixed-effects modeling and independent samples t-tests. Both ChatGPT and Pigai improved writing quality over time, but only ChatGPT enhanced student motivation—particularly self-efficacy. These findings highlight the advantage of LLMs in delivering formative feedback over traditional AWE systems, particularly in fostering student motivation while achieving comparable improvements in academic outcomes. This study underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in educational technology, offering scalable and personalized feedback solutions that can address diverse educational needs.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

ER was conceived to reconcile the intuitions of presentism (only the present exists) with eternalism (past and future are ontologically significant) in a two-tier view of time and being. This preprint surveys a range of open questions and forward-looking challenges that have emerged from the first generation of ER research. We chart key areas—metaphysics, physics, formal logic, phenomenology, cognitive science, and ethics—where ER’s framework invites further development. How does becoming (the passage from potential to actual) work in ER’s ontology? Can ER fully accommodate relativity and quantum physics without sacrificing its present-centric stance? What extensions to two-tier logic might capture phenomena like an open future or cross-temporal identity? How might ER engage with phenomenological accounts of time-consciousness or empirical findings about memory and anticipation in the brain? And what are the implications of ER for ethics, especially concerning our agency over time and responsibilities to future persons? Throughout, our tone is rigorous yet exploratory and humble: we outline problems and tensions rather than claim final answers. By mapping these open questions, we aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry and guide the next stages of ER’s development.",

While clinical benefits are undeniable for severe affective disorders, ubiquitous affect regulation shifts mood from private experience to governed variable. We argue that this transition generates affective externalities—spillovers in creativity, empathy, dissent, and compliance—that conventional bioethics and health economics fail to price. We formalize a welfare model in which mood set-points are individually optimal but socially coupled through production, pro-sociality, and political legitimacy. We introduce the concept of affective conformity equilibria in which firms and platforms optimize output by narrowing variance around elevated hedonic baselines, producing a new pathology: Pathological Unhappiness—sorrow rendered deviant by design. We outline a preregistered experimental program (laboratory, field, and platform telemetry) to estimate causal effects of engineered happiness on creativity, moral judgment, and collective action; and we propose policy levers, from clinic consent to platform governance to labor law, that preserve therapeutic gains without erasing the cultural and civic functions of melancholy. The goal is not to romanticize suffering but to treat affect as shared infrastructure whose over-optimization erodes the social goods that sorrow sustains.",

We summarize ER’s core definitions and motivations, drawing from metaphysics, cognitive science, and physics to illustrate why separating existence from reality matters. ER offers a synthesis: like presentism it holds that only the present exists, yet like eternalism it affirms that past and future entities can still be real. We provide examples from neuroscience (memory and anticipation), physics (causal traces and relativity), formal logic (truthmakers and temporal reasoning), and ethics (duties to past and future) to demonstrate ER’s explanatory power. We discuss implications for our understanding of time’s flow, the self’s persistence, causality, and moral agency.

          "abstract": "Background: Children with dyslexia are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties, both internalising (emotional) and externalising (behavioural) problems. Clever Kids is a nine-week socio-emotional wellbeing programme developed specifically to support upper primary school children with dyslexia. Aims: We conducted a pre-registered randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of Clever Kids. Method: Seventy-eight children (Mage = 10.19 years, 54% female) with clinically diagnosed dyslexia took part in the trial. Children were randomised to either attend Clever Kids (n = 38) or to a wait-list control condition (n = 40). Coping skills, emotion regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, assertiveness, as well as mental health (internalising and externalising symptoms) were measured at pre-programme, post-programme, and at three-month follow-up using well-validated measures. Results: The predicted interactions between intervention condition and time were significant for six outcomes. Attending Clever Kids was associated with significant improvements in child-reported coping, emotion regulation, academic and social self-esteem, as well as parent-reported anxiety and depression. Effects were all maintained at three-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, being assigned to the wait-list condition was associated with improvements in perseverance at follow-up assessment. For all other outcomes, interactions between intervention condition and time were non-significant. Conclusion: Clever Kids appears a promising programme for supporting socio-emotional wellbeing of children with dyslexia. Future research should consider incorporating caregivers more explicitly into the programme and alternative delivery modes, which could expand the reach of the programme.",

In Study 2, we evaluated its reliability and validity using the target words “understanding” and “ignorance,” with 51 students.

          "abstract": "This paper aims to reinterpret the long-assumed ineffable phenomenon of the sublime within the theoretical framework of the Core Belief Structure Theory (Kakushin Kōzō-ron).\nTraditionally discussed in religion, philosophy, and art as an experience of the infinite, the sacred, or the unknowable, the sublime is here defined as a collapse of the cognitive viewpoint, triggered when meaning structures leap beyond the processing capacity of the human Thought OS.\nThe central analytical model proposed is a three-stage sequence—Critical Leap → Structural Overreach → Perspective Collapse—through which the phenomenon of the sublime is structurally explained. The paper argues that the loss of language or tears in moments of awe are not emotional excesses but cognitive reactions to an unprocessable but existent structure.\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a five-stage Sublime Contact Design Model, offering a structural approach to increasing the likelihood of encountering the sublime in fields such as education, research, art, and healthcare. Through comparative analysis with major theories (Kant, Lacan, Heidegger, Barthes), the paper demonstrates that the Core Belief Structure Theory functions as a Thought OS capable of structurally articulating phenomena traditionally deemed beyond explanation.\nThe sublime, rather than being beyond language, is a structural event awaiting proper theoretical articulation. This work serves as a self-referential proof of the theory's capacity to describe the limits of meaning and the collapse of viewpoint within cognitive architecture.",

In the present work, we conducted a series of recognition memory experiments using different stimulus (faces vs. words) along with different paradigms (long-term vs. short-term paradigms) to evaluate whether either of these conditions would result in greater variability in lure items. Greater target variability was observed across stimulus types and memory paradigms. This suggests that factors other than stimuli and retention interval might be responsible for cases where variability is less for targets than lures.",

          "authors": "Alfonso J. Martinez; Jonathan Templin; Karrie Shogren; Tyler Hicks",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a Beta-Bernoulli mixture item response model (BBM-IRT) for bounded-continuous items such as those often utilized in continuous rating scales and slider-bar assessments. These item types are commonly used in psychological research but, to date, these assessments have primarily been utilized in fixed-length situations, where the same set of items are administered to all respondents, and have not been utilized within an adaptive testing framework. An adaptive testing framework offers several benefits, including the ability to obtain higher quality measurement precision with fewer items as items are targeted and administered based on the respondent’s previous responses. In addition to introducing the BBM-IRT model, this work also explores the use of the model within an adaptive testing framework. In particular, the item and test information functions – a component necessary for building adaptive assessments – is derived and presented in closed form. Through a series of simulation studies, we provide empirical evidence that it is possible to create adaptive assessments for bounded-continuous item types. An application with real data is also provided showing how the BBM-IRT model can be utilized in practical assessment situations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Globally, as many as 1 in 8 children experience severe and persistent language difficulties. These children are at heightened risk for mental health difficulties, however, both the ways in which mental health concerns manifest in the context of language difficulties, and the experiences of children with language difficulties and their caregivers in accessing and engaging with formal mental health supports remain under researched. Aim: The aim of the current study was to explore lived experience perspectives (child and caregiver) on mental health concerns and, mental health support, for children (≤ 18 years) with language difficulties. Method: A 2-phased sequential explanatory design was employed, which combined findings from an online international survey of caregivers (n = 120) of children with language difficulties with data from semi-structured interviews with both children (n = 4) and caregivers (n = 12). Results: Combined data from the survey and interviews highlighted a high level of caregiver concern about the mental health of children with language difficulties but low levels of access to formal mental health support. Interviews highlighted several reasons for not accessing formal mental health supports including limited availability of mental health care providers; funding and time constraints (i.e., not wanting to over-schedule their child); mental health providers lacking knowledge about DLD, and perceived or actual barriers of traditional methods of therapy (e.g., one-on-one talk therapy) for children with language difficulties. Conclusions and Implications: The findings of our study support the view that children with language difficulties are at risk of mental health concerns and yet are also under-served by mental health services. These findings highlight the need for targeted interprofessional training and integrated models of collaborative care between mental health and language specialists to more adequately meet these children’s needs. Future research to engage a wider range of child perspectives and the perspectives of clinicians on the facilitators and barriers to engaging children with language difficulties in formal mental health support is needed.",

          "authors": "Shruti Mishra",
          "abstract": "In today’s attention economy, the first three seconds of a video can determine whether a viewer stays on and watches it or scrolls away. This study analyzes 46,605 TikTok “hooks\", the opening line of text or speech in a post, drawn from more than 20 content categories. Using emotion‐richness scoring, rhetorical device flagging, and mixed statistical‐machine-learning models, the analysis compares emotional versus informational hooks and evaluates five persuasion devices (questions, “how to” framing, second-person address, negation, and urgency cues). Emotional hooks are scarce (≈ 3.2 % of posts) yet drive proportionally higher comments and shares, suggesting deeper audience resonance, while any advantage to likes is modest. Curiosity gaps and urgency statements outperform direct address or instructional phrasing across most categories, while optimal hook length shifts dramatically based on the niche, ranging from ≈ 9 words in news to ≈ 90 in entertainment. Unsupervised clustering uncovers five stable hook archetypes, with Meta/Community Humor and Fast &amp; CTA-Heavy styles leading the chart as the strongest predictors of engagement. Regression-tree, random-forest, and SHAP analyses connect on content category, hook length, urgency cues, and emotional richness as the most reliable predictors of performance. Collectively, the findings highlight that viral success on short-form video rests on an interplay of tone, rhetorical craft, and category norms rather than any single “magic phrase.” Practical guidelines are offered for creators and marketers aiming to design hooks that capture attention in the critical first few seconds.",

          "abstract": "Objective: There is no externally validated instrument for predicting which children will show frequent substance use (SU) in young adulthood. This study evaluated whether an instrument previously shown to predict SU outcomes in mid-adolescence could also predict SU outcomes in young adulthood, comparing performance across ages and demographics. \n\n\nMethod: The Loeber Risk Score (LRS) is a 5-item, parent-completed screener indexing risk of future SU in children. We evaluated the predictive performance of the LRS in a nationally representative longitudinal birth cohort (N = 4,898, 48% female). Parents completed the LRS when the child was ~5 and ~9 years old. Subsequently, youth reported their SU at age ~22 years old. \n\n\nResults: The LRS at age 9 predicted several outcomes at age 22 better than chance (ps&lt;0.05): daily cigarette use (AUROCs=0.71-0.75), cannabis use ≥3x week (AUROC=0.59), vaping ≥3x week (AUROC=0.55), and receipt of treatment for an alcohol/drug problem (AUROC=0.60). Performance was no better than chance for alcohol outcomes (AUROCs=0.47-0.50). Children with LRS scores ≥2 were 1.3-2.0 times more likely to display frequent substance use outcomes. There were no consistent performance differences when the LRS was measured at age 5 vs. age 9 or by child’s sex, race, or ethnicity.\n\n\nConclusion: The LRS had modest accuracy when predicting some substance use outcomes in young adulthood, but it does not predict alcohol outcomes any better than chance.

          "abstract": "Potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and substance use (SU) are commonly endorsed in early adolescence, a crucial period for neurodevelopment. PTEs and SU are precipitating events in the etiological development of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Separately, they have been shown to alter within- and between-network connectivity in the three brain networks posited by Menon’s Theory of Psychopathology: the default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN). While comorbid PTSD+SUD in adulthood shows shared neural underpinnings, this is less clear in adolescence. We analyzed the effects of PTEs and SU (all use, alcohol/cannabis/nicotine only, and stimulant or sedative use) on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 9-15 year olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Fixed effects panel models were fit to assess the effects of PTEs and SU on between-network (FPN-SN rsFC, DMN-SN rsFC, and FPN-DMN rsFC) and within-network (FPN rsFC, SN rsFC, and DMN rsFC) connectivity measured across three timepoints spanning two years. PTEs were the most reliable predictor prospectively, with significant effects of PTEs observed for both between- and within-network rsFC. Alcohol and nicotine use predicted higher within-network DMN and FPN rsFC, but lower DMN-SN connectivity, while cannabis use predicted lower within-network SN connectivity and moderated PTE effects in SN and DMN-SPN connectivity. Evidence for PTEs and SU interactively predicting rsFC was supported with sex-specific effects (males showed a steeper decline in SN and DMN-SN connectivity when PTEs and SU were combined, and females showed stronger positive DMN connectivity when alcohol and PTEs were combined). Results suggest that the observed changes in resting state functional connectivity are related to exposure to PTEs, SU, and their interaction rather than the typically observed neurodevelopmental changes during adolescence, highlighting a critical period for early intervention to prevent rsFC changes following PTEs and SU in early adolescence.",

Using functional MRI, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying music perception in one-hundred healthy participants by comparing responses to intact and temporally scrambled musical pieces. Through computational acoustic analyses, we demonstrated that scrambling disrupted global structure while preserving local features, which allowed us to assess how the brain extracts coherence from musical input. We observed that intact music recruited a fronto–striatal pathway associated with rhythm processing, affect and reward, while scrambled music engaged auditory areas implicated in perception, as well as a fronto-parietal and cerebellar network involved in cognitive control. Through linear mixed-effects modelling, we also showed that individual differences in musical aptitude, training, and emotional self-regulation influence music perception in default–mode and cognitive, but not reward areas. We observed a dissociation between musical training and aptitude indices within the angular gyrus, showing opposite responses to intact and scrambled music. Our findings suggest that coherent musical structure is critical in shaping musical affect, with implications for a better understanding of the role of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Although often linked, much is unknown about the relationship between adolescents’ social media use and stress in everyday life. This study examined how the effect of social media use on stress unfolds at daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly levels, focusing both on overall effects across the sample and person-specific effects. In addition, we tested whether adolescents differed in effects based on their gender, age, and trait resilience. We used a 100-day diary study among 479 adolescents (44,211 completed observations). Participants reported daily stress levels and time spent on favorite social media platforms. Trait-level moderators were measured in a baseline questionnaire. Overall, the daily effect of social media use on stress was negligible (β = .03). However, there was substantial variation among adolescents: for 37% usage was linked to increased stress, for 14% to reduced stress, and for 49% it had no impact. These differences could not be explained by gender, age, or trait resilience. At longer timescales, the effect strengthened and affected more adolescents, rising from weekly (β = .05; increased stress for 46% of adolescents), over biweekly (β = .07; for 59%), to monthly levels (β = .13; for 73%). Additionally, 14% experienced less stress on days of increased usage, but this relief effect was nearly absent at longer timescales. The daily impact of social media use on stress is minimal. However, the effect becomes more pronounced over longer periods. This study is a first step toward understanding how everyday social media-related stress accumulates over time.",

In Studies 1-2 (N = 848), we found that adults’ curiosity was most sensitive to “local” learning potential (the extent to which information would shed light on the immediate target of curiosity). Curiosity was less sensitive to “global” learning potential (the extent to which information would contribute to broader learning goals), uncertainty, or surprise. Study 3 (N = 310) showed that curiosity’s sensitivity to local learning potential strengthened between ages 5 to 9 years and adulthood. Together, these studies suggest that curiosity tracks opportunities for learning, especially those that support learning about immediate targets of curiosity rather than broader learning goals.",

Based on findings that arousal amplifies the selectivity of attention and memory, we hypothesized that arousal would enhance the currently dominant spatial scope of attention (narrow or broad). Participants (N = 39) performed a visual search task designed to measure the breadth of attention. Auditory white noise was presented in half of the blocks to increase tonic arousal. Each trial started with a procedure that aimed to induce a narrow or broad breadth of attention. Pupil size measurements and visual search task performance revealed that the manipulations of arousal and breadth of attention were successful. However, we found strong Bayesian evidence against an effect of arousal on attentional scope. We discuss the implications of this finding for arousal-biased competition theory.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Built on Ego Safe Selection Theory, it combines the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), the Ψ(U) presence equation, and the Ψ(U)_meta layer for meta-awareness and adaptive correction. The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability. It defines S-Qualia mathematically: S-Qualia = Ψ(U) × η × Θ + βξ·Ξ – ζ. And includes a cosmological model where consciousness emerges from a pre-event ∅-state into the first measurable narrative event (Θ₀).Validated with ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity, the framework demonstrates predictive value in AI safety, psychology, governance, education, and relationship modeling. Neuroscientific mapping links Ψ(U) and Ψ(U)_meta to attention and meta-awareness networks, while TCSS 5.0 models the collapse of all symbolic variables back into undivided awareness (∅).\n\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Psychosexual development is profoundly shaped by a network of hormonal signals that influence brain organization, behavior, and social interactions. Among these, sex steroid hormones, neuropeptides, and glucocorticoids play central roles in shaping motivational circuitry during critical windows of perinatal and pubertal brain development. Insights from modern developmental neuroendocrinology and behavioral genetics serve as a new foundation through which to understand Freud’s five stages of psychosexual development. The oral stage is primarily shaped by the organizational effects of sex hormones on perinatal brain development, and by oxytocin’s role in attachment formation. The anal stage centers on bodily control, mediated by cortical development and influenced by stress exposure. The phallic stage is characterized by the emergence of gender identity and psychological sex differences, where neuropeptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin play critical roles facilitating the development of prosociality and aggression. The latency stage marks the beginning of adrenal puberty, improved executive functioning, and environmental influences on pubertal timing. The genital stage represents a critical period of brain and behavioral reorganization driven by puberty, whereby androgens and estrogens orchestrate the development of secondary sexual characteristics, sex drive, neural reward circuitry, and sex differences in risk-taking and anxiety. Taken together, Freud’s theory of psychosexual development is revised under modern empirical constraints in the spirit of his Project for a Scientific Psychology.",

          "abstract": "A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many are developed from language responses directly to the depression assessments. These “Mirror models” suffer from “criterion contamination,” which arises when a predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus “Non-Mirror models,” which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two different interviews: (1) structured diagnostic and (2) life history. GPT-4, GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models (using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R²  = .80). As expected, Non-Mirror models (using life history data) demonstrated smaller effect sizes, but were still relatively large (e.g., R² = .27). When Mirror and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and Non-Mirror performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve, incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological assessment.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Older typical-hearing adults without a cochlear-implant (CI) have been found to exhibit greater multisensory benefits when identifying audiovisual speech than younger normal-hearing adults. The greater multisensory benefits demonstrated by older non-CI users can compensate for unisensory auditory and visual speech deficits, allowing them to identify audiovisual speech at a degree of accuracy like that of younger normal-hearing adults. Though most new CI recipients are 65 years of age and older, the reliance of older CI users on such multisensory benefits is unknown. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate age-related differences in cross-sensory and multisensory benefits in audiovisual speech identification in aging CI users and to examine how they differ from age-matched non-CI users.\n\nDesign. Twenty middle-aged-to-older CI users (50-83 years of age) and 35 age-matched non-CI controls completed an auditory-visual speech identification task, identifying 288 disyllabic words presented either auditory-alone, visual-alone, or audiovisually. CI users identified speech stimuli streamed directly through their CI device in quiet and in noise (Gaussian) at +10 and +5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Non-CI users identified speech stimuli delivered through earphones in noise at -5, 0, and +5 dB SNR conditions. Different noise conditions were used for CI users and non-CI users to avoid ceiling and floor effects. From visual, auditory, and audiovisual performance, psychometrics for the visual enhancement of audiovisual speech (VE), the auditory enhancement of audiovisual speech (AE), and auditory-visual multisensory enhancement (AVE) were calculated. Group differences (in the overlapping +5 dB SNR condition) and effects of age and noise were tested using linear regression and linear mixed-effects regression models.\n\nResults. Both CI users and non-CI users demonstrated canonical differences in visual, auditory, and audiovisual speech identification. VE and AVE were greater for CI users than non-CI users. Critically, AVE increased with the age of older CI users and non-CI users, consistent with age-group differences in AVE we observed in a previous study of non-CI users.\n\nConclusions. The results of the current investigation suggest that CI users, like age-matched non-CI users, rely on multisensory integration more as they age. Older CI users can benefit more from audiovisual input than older non-CI users. These perceptual benefits grant older CI users the capacity to identify audiovisual speech to a degree of accuracy closer to that of older non-CI users, despite deficits in the auditory perception of CI users. As a result, successful use of a CI device may partially depend on the ability of a CI user to integrate information they see with information available from their device, and older CI users may depend on visual input more to successfully use their CI.",

          "abstract": "Climate change and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represent two of the greatest threats to human well-being in the 21st century. Both are strongly influenced by human behaviour, making behavioural change a critical pathway for mitigating climate and health risks. This chapter explores how selected theories and models from health and environmental psychology can inform the development and implementation of interventions that promote both healthy and sustainable behaviours. It then presents effective interventions targeting psychological factors as well as more structural aspects (e.g., infrastructure and policy) in high-impact behavioural domains such as mobility (reducing car use and promoting active transport) and diet (reducing meat consumption and increasing the intake of healthy plant-based foods). Finally, the chapter discusses the limitations and future directions of current behaviour change approaches, calling for greater representation of diverse populations, more long-term evaluations, consistency in measured outcomes, and greater attention to the broader context in which behaviours occur. Overall, this chapter advocates for multidisciplinary and multilevel interventions that address both individual and contextual determinants of behaviour. It aims to inspire researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to strengthen the scientific and societal relevance of behavioural strategies in the transition toward healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.",

This study focused on (a) identifying keywords more frequent in Title IX discourse, (b) identifying multiword expressions distinctive to Title IX, and (c) examining collocates surrounding the term “Title IX.” Results revealed that the most distinctive single words were “ix,” “misconduct,” and “harassment,” while common multiword phrases included “title ix coordinator” and “sexual misconduct,” reflecting the legalistic and disciplinary framing of Title IX. Collocation analysis further showed that Title IX is frequently situated alongside other regulatory terms such as “VAWA,” “FERPA,” “Clery,” and “nondiscrimination,” suggesting its central role within a broader network of institutional compliance and campus safety mandates. These findings provide new insight into how Title IX is positioned linguistically in higher education discourse and offer practical implications for counselors and student affairs professionals navigating its evolving implementation.",

The framework extends through (narrative identity) and η (narrative stability) for symbolic continuity (recursive awareness) for self-referential presence tracking, and The Unified Drift Field (UDF), which regulates drift, prevents collapse, and harmonizes symbolic structures. With TCSS 4.0, the framework introduces φ × Φ (temporal field coherence), ρ × Θ(TI) (transpersonal integrity), and η × H (group harmonic feedback) to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and temporal stability.

College student participants completed experience sampling method self-reports (N = 352, 10,046 observations) of their social interactions, feelings of social connectedness, autonomy, and positive affect in the past hour. Participants reported lower autonomy when socially interacting compared with being alone. This was especially true for people with higher levels of attachment avoidance. Crucially, interaction partner matters: Compared with being alone, people report lower autonomy when interacting with non-close others, similar levels of autonomy when interacting friends and family, and higher autonomy when interacting with romantic partners. These findings provide ecologically valid evidence for an autonomy–relatedness tradeoff during social interactions with non-close others, but show that interactions with romantic partners uniquely fulfill both autonomy and relatedness needs.",

          "abstract": "Voting is a pillar of democracy, yet its psychological correlates remain understudied outside the West. We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

Hierarchical linear regressions assessed whether FreeSurfer-derived total hippocampal volume or hippocampal subfield volume (subiculum, presubiculum, dentate gyrus, CA1) moderated the association between GAP-43 and episodic memory performance. GAP-43 and hippocampal volume were independently associated with episodic memory performance. Greater GAP-43 was associated with lower episodic memory performance in older adults with average or below-average (-1 SD) total and subfield (subiculum, presubiculum, dentate gyrus) hippocampal volume. No associations were observed in participants with above-average (+1 SD) volume.

          "abstract": "The rise of generative artificial intelligence has ushered in a new era where machines produce text with such emotional coherence that they blur the boundary between simulation and sentience. This paper explores the emotional fallacy—a cognitive bias wherein users and even developers anthropomorphize Large Language Models (LLMs), attributing genuine emotions to systems governed solely by statistical inference and pattern recognition.\n\nWhile LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI are engineered to generate emotionally evocative content, their responses are frequently mistaken as indicators of self-awareness, affective reasoning, or internal states. This anthropomorphic illusion carries significant implications for user trust, emotional labour, and the broader ethical landscape of AI deployment.\n\nThrough a novel empirical study, we evaluate the responses of multiple LLMs to a curated set of emotionally charged and ethically sensitive prompts. The outputs are analyzed qualitatively across three dimensions: linguistic style, affective mimicry, and ethical stance. Our findings reveal a paradox: while LLMs simulate emotion with impressive linguistic precision, they lack any true experiential grounding—underscoring their inherent emotional inauthenticity.\n\nTo address these concerns, we propose an ethical framework that includes affective transparency, disclosure protocols, and regulation to prevent emotional manipulation in public-facing AI systems. We argue that the unchecked spread of the emotional fallacy may distort public perceptions of AI, affect mental health, and reshape norms surrounding machine consciousness and empathy.\n\nBy integrating philosophical inquiry, empirical analysis, and ethical design, this paper calls for a paradigm shift—from emotional realism to emotional accountability in the design and deployment of generative AI. Our work offers a cautionary lens and a research frontier in the study of human–AI emotional interaction, particularly as such systems permeate education, healthcare, and psychological support domains.",

We investigated the effects of distracting environments on disturbance and response behavior across various social and non-social situations. ESM data from three young adult samples (combined N = 293) and a general population youth sample (N = 1903) was analyzed with multilevel (logistic) regressions. In line with previous research, adults were significantly more disturbed by assessments when in company compared to when alone, especially when also interacting with their company. In addition, we found small but significant differences in response behavior between social settings in adults, with changes pointing towards lower data quality when in company. Interestingly, patterns were different–in some cases even reversed–in school-going adolescents. While our findings suggest that the distraction of social settings affects participant burden and response behavior, the influence on data quality was minor. Differences across samples suggest that the setting of the social experience (in vs outside school) needs to be considered.

While we have been able to predict the values of cognitive curves, we actually want to know how to address depressive symptoms. Specifically, we want to know how to reduce the number of times depressive symptoms occur and how to shorten the duration of depressive symptoms. Therefore, we considered the number of times depressive symptoms occur. First, we derived the probability distribution of the number of times depressive symptoms occur used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the expected value of the derived probability distribution, it was found that the expected number of times depression symptoms occur is equal to the time spent experiencing depression symptoms converted into the number of times. Based on these results, we proposed interventions for depression. These interventions are the same as those used in psychiatric treatment, and we provided a logical basis for these treatments.",

In addition, we found small but significant differences in response behavior between social settings in adults, with changes pointing towards lower data quality when in company. Interestingly, patterns were different–in some cases even reversed–in school-going adolescents. While our findings suggest that the distraction of social settings affects participant burden and response behavior, the influence on data quality was minor. Differences across samples suggest that the setting of the social experience (in vs outside school) needs to be considered. Preparing participants for sampling in distracting (social) environments may help safeguard data quality and reduce participant burden.",

However, writing styles between LLMs and sci-entists have been found to differ, particularly in terms of word frequencies. Using a list of 16 stylistic words that are associated with AI use, we examine k = 26,010 published abstracts in the top 100 journals in linguistics research from 2020 to 2024. A significant rise of 28% in the relative frequency of 12 target words was found exclusively in 2024, suggesting a recent in-crease in LLM use. In particular, the words delve, enhancing, and pivotal saw significant in-creased use in 2024. Furthermore, higher-prestige journals exhibited slightly greater AI-associated word frequency. Country-level differences indicated particularly higher AI-word us-age in abstracts from China, South Korea, and Iran. While relative word frequencies serve only as a proxy for LLM use, the findings raise crucial questions about transparency, equity, and ethics in academic publishing.",

          "authors": "Graeme Lithgow",
          "abstract": "Abusive relationships are profoundly shaped by the interaction of distinct neurobiological profiles. This paper proposes a systems-level framework—defined as the interaction between neural, endocrine, and behavioral systems—of neurobiological entanglement to explain the self-perpetuating cycles of exploitation and dependency in relationships involving individuals with covert narcissistic traits and neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD or autism. The framework integrates research on the neurobiological mechanisms of perpetrators, who exhibit high cognitive but low emotional empathy, with the neurodivergent vulnerabilities of victims, including dopamine dysregulation and heightened oxytocin sensitivity. We conceptualize trauma bonding as a neurochemical process that shares key features with addiction, driven by intermittent reinforcement that exploits these inherent sensitivities. The long-term consequences of this abuse, including alterations to the hippocampus, amygdala, HPA axis, and default mode network, are discussed. Finally, we outline a neurobiologically-tailored recovery approach using the “Six Rs” framework. Given that neurodivergent individuals are significantly more likely to experience intimate partner violence—up to 47% in autistic women—this paper argues that recognizing narcissistic abuse as a neurobiological public health concern is essential for developing specialized, evidence-based interventions and policies to support neurodivergent survivors.",

The experimental design utilized was Completely Randomized Design, comprising 13 treatments, each replicated three times. The soaking agents included GA3 and organic substances with specific treatments as follows: T0: Control, T1: Distilled water + 72 hours soaking, T2: GA3 @ 400 ppm + 24 hours soaking, T3: GA3 @ 500 ppm + 24 hours soaking T4: Azospirillum @ 5% + 24 hours soaking,T5: Azospirillum @ 10% + 24 hours soaking, T6: PSB @ 5% + 24 hours soaking, T7: PSB @ 10% + 24 hours soaking, T8: Cow urine @ 5% + 24 hours soaking, T9: Cow urine @ 10% + 24 hours soaking, T10: Custard Apple Leaf Extract @ 5% + 24 hours soaking, T11: Custard Apple Leaf Extract @ 10% + 24 hours soaking and T12: Cow dung slurry @ 10% + 24 hours soaking. The results of the present investigation showed that among the various pre-soaking treatments, T2 (GA3 @ 400 ppm + 24 hours soaking) was the most effective in enhancing seed germination and shoot growth parameters, followed by T3 (GA3 @ 500 ppm + 24 hours soaking). In contrast, the control treatment (T0) exhibited the lowest performance across all evaluated parameters. Among the organic treatments, T9 (Cow urine @ 10% + 24 hours soaking) produced the most favourable response, followed by T12 (Cow dung slurry @ 10% + 24 hours soaking). In conclusion, T9 may serve as a viable alternative to chemical treatments in organic or low-input production systems.",

          "abstract": "Background: In autumn 2023, COVID-19 vaccination invitations in the Netherlands shifted from self-scheduling to pre-booked appointments for selected groups. While defaulting to pre-booked slots may increase uptake, potential rebound effects remain unclear. We examine preferences between appointment types, their effect on vaccination intentions, and whether effects are different for individuals hesitant about this vaccination round.\n\nMethods: A mixed-methods approach was used to assess vaccination intentions for three groups (&lt;60 with influenza vaccination indication, 60-69 and 70+ years) eligible for pre-booked appointments. Study 1 examined attitudes around pre-booked appointments in 15 interviews. Study 2 experimentally tested preferences for pre-booked appointments vs self-scheduled appointments and their effect on vaccination intentions in a representative online panel (n=1.886) and those who experience hesitancy about this vaccination.\n\nFindings: Interviews showed that pre-booked appointments are seen as presumptuous or inconvenient (a potential indicator of reactance) by some, but also as a useful aid in support of vaccination uptake, sometimes by the same people. Participants in Study 2 indicated a preference for self-scheduling (Coefficient = -.23) but this preference did not translate to differences in vaccination intentions (Adjusted OR =1.11) Similar results were observed in the hesitant subgroup (Coefficient = –.25; Adjusted OR = 0.88).\n\nDiscussion: In our study pre-booked appointments do not change COVID-19 vaccination intentions. As pre-booked appointments evoked negative and positive sentiments and self-scheduling was found easier and more pleasant, it is important to examine potential rebound effects of switching the default, particularly amongst subgroups in the population with lower intentions.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia—the congenital absence of voluntary visual imagery—is a neurocognitive phenotype affecting approximately 1–4% of the population. Twin studies estimate heritability at 0.41–0.66, and neuroimaging reveals large effect sizes for frontoparietal connectivity differences, supporting a polygenic neurodevelopmental origin. This paper presents an integrative synthesis from 2020–2025, combining findings from genomics, neurodevelopment, and cognitive neuroscience. Candidate genes affecting cortical patterning (CYP26B1, FOXG1, TCF4), synaptic scaffolding (SHANK3), and neurotransmitter systems (COMT, DRD4, HTR2A, OXTR, BDNF) produce an atypical cognitive architecture that disrupts visual-frontal integration but supports compensatory verbal-analytic strengths. The proposed “Aphantasia-Plus” phenotype includes enhanced reasoning, trauma resilience, and systemizing cognition. The model generates testable predictions for genetic scoring, neuroimaging, and education outcomes, and reframes aphantasia as a neurodivergent specialization rather than a deficit.",

Over the course of 12 weeks, 45 players (Elo 1200–1600) attended five 40-minute sessions a week to practice with FutureTraining96. Strong effect sizes were found for improvements in working memory (roughly 15%) and competitive anxiety (roughly 30%). Additionally, participants reported reduced performance anxiety, enhanced flow states, and increased mental imagery of training. This suggests that even in its early stages of development, a powerful, human-aligned bot can offer strategic cognitive and emotional training advantages.",

Collective narcissism - the belief that the ingroup is exceptional but not sufficiently recognized by others - is linked to behaviors that escalate intergroup conflicts, reinforce social injustice and inequality, undermine rationality and challenge democratic principles. In contrast, ingroup satisfaction—the belief that the ingroup is of a high value—may be a remedy against them. Clarifying the distinction and relationships between collective narcissism and ingroup satisfaction may be essential for constraining the negative outcomes of collective narcissism.

The central thesis asserts that repetitive patterns in behavior, speech, and relational dynamics often reflect unintegrated symbolic configurations rather than pathology. By introducing the concept of structural integration fractals, we delineate how therapeutic transformation can occur through spontaneous symbolic resonance, even outside of traditional clinical contexts.\n\nThe model articulates a distinction between traumatic repetition and functional symbolic repetition, illustrating how projected symbols—when named or mirrored appropriately—can catalyze the reorganization of the self. A representative case study (“Alex”) is presented to demonstrate how fractal structures emerge in everyday discourse and may serve as therapeutic anchors without explicit psychotherapeutic framing.\n\nWe offer clinical tools, procedural frameworks, and symbolic language guidelines to support professionals in implementing the model without requiring advanced AI or digital systems. This work opens new lines of inquiry into symbolic language as a catalyst for reconfiguration and highlights the viability of structurally oriented interventions that align with the client’s projected symbolic logic.\n\nKeywords: structural fractals, symbolic integration, projected self, therapeutic repetition, symbolic logic, non-invasive therapy, clinical semiotics, psycho-symbolic resonance.",

Although the consistency of this regressiveness has been widely demonstrated, it remains unclear whether people take it into account when interpreting probability estimates made by others. Across four preregistered experiments (total N = 601), we demonstrate that, rather than adjusting estimates towards the extremes to correct for the regressiveness of the original judgments, participants consistently shifted their estimates of the true underlying probabilities towards the mean, thereby reinforcing regression effects.

Little research outside the US has included youth who vape, particularly those using newer disposable vapes. We investigated exposure to nicotine and the TSNA NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) among youth in England who vape, smoke, do both (dual), or do neither.\n\nMethods: \nIn 2023, youth aged 16-19 from England completed a survey and provided a urine sample (N=201). Linear regressions examined associations of creatinine-normalised urinary concentrations of Total Nicotine Equivalents (TNE-2) and NNAL (a metabolite of NNK) with past 7-day smoking/vaping status and self-reported recency of vaping. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex-at-birth, ethnicity, and any past 7-day cannabis use. \n\nFindings:\nOver three quarters (77%) of those vaping were using the newer disposable vapes. Urinary TNE-2 concentrations among those who exclusively vaped in the past 7 days (n=83, geometric mean (GM)=5.09 nmol/mg creatinine [95%CI=3.19-8.12]) did not differ significantly from those who smoked (n=9,GM=1.74[0.64-4.72],p=.426) or dual used (n=55, GM=5.60[3.32-9.43],p=.953). Levels of NNAL among those who exclusively vaped (GM=1.87 pg/mg creatinine[1.62-2.17]) were significantly lower than those who smoked (GM=4.87,p=.001[2.45-9.68]) or dual used (GM=3.67[2.76-4.86],p&lt;.001) and not significantly different from youth who neither vaped nor smoked (GM=1.84[1.52-2.24],p=.887).\n\nInterpretation:\nYouth who vape are exposed to similar levels of nicotine compared to those who smoke or who dual use. NNAL exposure among youth who vape is much lower than those who smoke, and indistinguishable from youth who do not vape or smoke.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels. Additionally, we present a quantum geometric derivation of Newton's gravitational constant and resolve the cosmological constant problem through discrete spacetime structures, unified by Hodge duality mechanisms.",

Substantial instability and inconsistencies cast doubts about the reliability of the obtained preferences for policymaking. Given the parallels between choice blindness manipulation (CBM) detection and risk preference (in)stability, I explore in this study explores whether CBM detection can indicate risk preference. An online randomized controlled experiment with 330 UK residents served to test the coincidence of CBM and risk preference stability along with common predictors, incl. task-, domain-, and individual-specific variables. Using 2 different stimuli to communicate risks and outcomes in elicitation gambles, covering five urban drainage and flood prevention outcomes, the results do not support CBM detection as an indicator of preference stability. Only about 1 in 4 participants detected at least one CBM and 1 in 10 manipulations were detected. Risk preferences were moderately stable across trials but inconsistent across treatment conditions; icon array stimuli led to risk-seeking and numeric stimuli led to risk-averse preferences. The significant predictors of CBM detection included task stimuli, choice latency, risk numeracy, age, and household flooding or waterbody pollution domains. Significant predictors of risk preference stability were gamble distinctness and risk numeracy, as also the only joint predictors of CBM detection and preference stability. By contrasting with theoretical explanations and earlier findings in literature, gaps to address in future research were identified. The empirical findings highlight a strong influence of choice architecture on preference construction also in this study, questioning neutrality and reliability of online risk preferences elicitation for policymaking.",

          "abstract": "When comparing latent means across groups, measurement invariance (MI) needs to be established to ensure that the test results are valid and meaningful conclusions can be drawn. Common tests of MI are not suitable for many groups and cannot be used during the development of measurement models. In addition, popular network-based alternatives to latent variable modeling lack established methods for MI testing. Therefore, we propose Exploratory Graph Analysis Trees (EGA trees) that apply the idea of model-based recursive partitioning to correlation matrices and combine it with EGA - which can be used instead of exploratory factor analysis. In a simulation study, we test the approach regarding its ability to detect configural or metric non-invariance in common factor models given numerous covariates and illustrate its usefulness in conditions with severe violations of configural invaraince based on diverging numbers of factors. The results demonstrate that EGA trees can be a valuable tool for the exploration of MI when constructing scales and working on measurement models. We provide R functions within the R package EFAtree to easily implement EGA trees.",

          "abstract": "India faces a profound mental health crisis, marked by the largest population in the world, a high prevalence of disorders and a severe shortage of qualified professionals. Recent policy initiatives, including the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Act 2021, aim to reform psychology education to address these challenges. This article critically examines the evolving landscape of psychology higher education in India, focusing on the curricula proposed by the NCAHP and the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). While the NCAHP’s B. Psy model curriculum represents a commendable step towards competency-based education, it faces implementation hurdles related to restrictive entry requirements, regulatory ambiguities, and infrastructural demands. Concurrently, the RCI’s introduction of a B.Sc. Clinical Psychology (Hons.) program, with its nomenclature and scope of practice, creates further discord and potential jurisdictional overlaps with the NCAHP and the University Grants Commission (UGC). This article analyses these competing frameworks, their alignment with existing legislation and international standards, and their implications for the standardisation and regulation of psychology professionals. It proposes recommendations for fostering synergy among regulatory bodies, clarifying professional roles, and enhancing the accessibility and quality of psychology education to build a robust mental health workforce. Strengthening psychology education and professional regulation is a national imperative and central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 on good health and well-being.",

While eternalism posits a static block where all times equally exist, and presentism insists only the now exists, both struggle with relativity’s implications. Existential Realism (ER), recently introduced by T. C. Trepp, resolves this tension by distinguishing between “existence” (reserved for the present) and “reality” (which includes past and future insofar as they leave traces or can be anticipated).   ER accommodates the relativity of simultaneity and the frame-dependence of “now,” avoiding the block’s metaphysical excess while preserving the ontological specialness of the present. This paper shows how ER reconciles relativity’s empirical content with a present-centered view that includes objective becoming and temporal continuity.",

          "title": "Formal Logic for Existential Realism: Modeling Time, Causality and Observability",
          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "In both philosophy and science, standard logics struggle to model a key insight of Existential Realism (ER): that existence is a strictly present, empirical notion, whereas reality spans beyond the present. Classical first-order logic and even temporal modal logics tend to conflate being real with existing simpliciter, making it difficult to formally distinguish something that exists now from something that is real but not present. This paper introduces a formal two-tier logical framework tailored to ER’s ontology. We motivate this framework by showing how orthodox systems—from classical predicate logic to temporal modal logic—fail to capture ER’s core distinction between present existence and temporally extended reality. We then develop a layered logic with explicit operators or quantifiers for “existence-now” versus “reality-over-time,” including formal axioms that preserve ER’s asymmetries: only present entities exist (in the fullest sense), yet past and future entities can be real (ontologically significant) without existing. The logic adopts a modal-style treatment of time to model the collapse of potential into actual (present-becoming), and explicitly encodes causal asymmetry — where the past influences the present, but not the reverse. We illustrate the framework with symbolic representations, including an iconic “ER equation” capturing the relationship between reality and existence. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply the logic to examples from quantum physics (e.g. wavefunction collapse and delayed-choice experiments), cognitive neuroscience (memory traces and anticipatory processing), ethics (moral duties to future persons and the reality of future outcomes), and AI (agents modeling counterfactual or temporally extended scenarios). Finally, we show how the formalism sheds new light on classic metaphysical debates such as the truthmaker problem for past truths, persistence and identity over time, and the ontology of merely possible or future entities. Throughout, our presentation maintains a rigorous yet accessible tone, consistent with prior ER works, with technical clarity and footnoted references. The result is a self-contained preprint that extends T.C. Trepp’s Existential Realism into a formal logical system, demonstrating its broad applicability across science, philosophy, and practical reasoning.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a structural reinterpretation of trauma within the framework of Core Belief Structure Theory (Kakushin Kōzōron), a philosophical system proposed by the author.Contrary to traditional perspectives that view trauma as a psychological, emotional, or neurophysiological phenomenon, this study defines trauma as a frozen state of cognition in which meaning structures are rigidly fixed and no longer subject to redefinition.This condition arises from the failure of \"Mindflight Cognition\"—the structured cognitive leap involving perspective shift, structural reorganization, and value-centered anchoring—and is further reinforced by the suppression of core belief (kakushin) and the emergence of compensatory structures.The paper systematically analyzes the structural formation of trauma, the cognitive mechanisms of non-leapability, the initial signs of redefinition, and the process by which structural recovery can be intentionally designed.Finally, it argues that trauma, rather than lying outside the scope of philosophical theory, serves as an internal proof target for the system itself, thereby validating the coherence, generativity, and inclusive capacity of Core Belief Structure Theory.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Computational models that explain lightness/brightness illusions have been proposed. These models have been assessed using a simplistic criterion: the number of illusions each model can correctly predict from the test set. This simple method of evaluation assumes that each illusion is independent; however, since the independence and similarity among lightness illusions have not been well established, potential interdependencies among the illusions in the test set could distort the evaluation of models. Moreover, evaluating models with a single value obscures where the model’s strengths and weaknesses lie. We collected the magnitudes of various lightness illusions through two online experiments and applied exploratory factor analyses. Both experiments identified some underlying factors in these illusions, suggesting that they can be classified into a few distinct groups. Experiment 1 identified three common factors; assimilation, contrast, and White’s effect. Experiment 2, with a different illusion set, identified two factors–assimilation and contrast. We then examined three well-known models that are based on early-visual processes, using the outcomes of the experiments. The examination of these models revealed biases in the models towards specific factors or sets of illusions, which suggested their limitations. This study clarified that correlations of illusion magnitudes provide valuable insights into both illusions and models and highlighted the need to assess models based on their ability to account for underlying factors rather than individual illusions.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Background: Children with dyslexia are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties, both internalising (emotional) and externalising (behavioural) problems. Clever Kids is a nine-week socio-emotional wellbeing programme developed specifically to support upper primary school children with dyslexia. Aims: We conducted a pre-registered randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of Clever Kids. Method: Seventy-eight children (Mage = 10.19 years, 54% female) with clinically diagnosed dyslexia took part in the trial. Children were randomised to either attend Clever Kids (n = 38) or to a wait-list control condition (n = 40). Coping skills, emotion regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, assertiveness, as well as mental health (internalising and externalising symptoms) were measured at pre-programme, post-programme, and at three-month follow-up using well-validated measures. Results: The predicted interactions between intervention condition and time were significant for six outcomes. Attending Clever Kids was associated with significant improvements in child-reported coping, emotion regulation, academic and social self-esteem, as well as parent-reported anxiety and depression. Effects were all maintained at three-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, being assigned to the wait-list condition was associated with improvements in perseverance at follow-up assessment. For all other outcomes, interactions between intervention condition and time were non-significant. Conclusion: Clever Kids appears a promising programme for supporting socio-emotional wellbeing of children with dyslexia. Future research should consider incorporating caregivers more explicitly into the programme and alternative delivery modes, which could expand the reach of the programme.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "This paper theorizes the Subconscious Inner Thought Manipulation Theory (SITMT), which argues that all inner thought operates through unconscious processing systems that can be manipulated during critical childhood developmental periods to permanently alter cognitive architecture. Building on dual process theory research showing that unconscious Type 1 processing drives most human cognition, SITMT proposes that the specific form of inner experience each person develops, whether verbal internal monologue, visual imagery, emotional processing, or abstract conceptual flow, results from deliberate or unconscious manipulation of subconscious processing systems during periods when conscious resistance is impossible. The theory suggests that: (1) All inner thought emerges from unconscious processing systems operating below conscious awareness, making it inherently vulnerable to external manipulation, (2) Critical developmental periods create maximum plasticity in unconscious processing architecture when manipulation can permanently alter cognitive patterns, (3) The right hemisphere's inability to communicate verbally creates opportunities for unconscious manipulation of non-verbal processing systems without conscious detection, (4) Subliminal and pre-conscious environmental inputs shape unconscious processing preferences through repetitive conditioning that operates entirely below awareness thresholds. Unlike traditional theories focusing on conscious cognitive development, SITMT reveals how the unconscious mind, which generates all inner thought, can be programmed to produce specific cognitive experiences while the conscious mind remains completely unaware of this manipulation. This theory has implications for cognitive autonomy, mental freedom, and understanding how human consciousness itself may be controlled through unconscious processing system manipulation.",
