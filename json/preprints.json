          "abstract": "Transparent and reproducible science requires that data and code underlying published results be made available to allow regeneration and verification of the results. But how easy is it to reproduce computational analyses using these materials? This technical report describes efforts to computationally reproduce results at one established repository as part of a routine internal pre-publication review. We conduct a structured content analysis of twenty-six “author reports'' generated through a standard review process and categorize identified issues. We find that four in five studies include code errors that prevent execution or produce inconsistent results. Although these errors are generally minor, we interpret our findings to indicate that review and correction can help resolve many of the errors and facilitate computational reproducibility.",

          "authors": "Nancy Pearl Solomon; Gail B. Kempster; Kathleen F. Nagle",
          "abstract": "Rationale: The Consensus Auditory Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) has been in circulation for more than 20 years. Over the course of time, issues have arisen that have had an impact on the intended administration and interpretation of this common clinical tool. \nPurpose: Based on published literature, clinical experience, recent survey data, and practical considerations, and while maintaining the original purpose of the instrument, the authors developed a revised protocol, new rating form, and updated instructions for the CAPE-V, now called the CAPE-V – Revised (CAPE-Vr).\nSummary of Modifications: Revisions to the CAPE-V include the following: removal of textual labels indicating severity on the response form; modification of several of the stimuli; revised rating options for pitch, loudness, and resonance, and an added category for nasality; added space to describe inconsistencies according to task; modified options for vocal instabilities and other features; and added space for comments about overall impression. The form also includes sections for documenting recording and rating conditions. Updated instructions are provided to clarify the CAPE-Vr protocol and correspond closely to the rating form. \nConclusion. The CAPE-Vr is constructed to avoid common errors and problems identified from previous use of the original CAPE-V. This paper provides a rationale for each modification to the original CAPE-V, an updated form, and an example of a completed form. The CAPE-Vr is intended as a clear and useful assessment tool for documenting the auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice.",

          "authors": "Mel Stiller",
          "abstract": "Drawing on an extension of terror management theory, this study examines whether positive death valence might faciliate radical, intersectional interventions in homophobic prejudice. Prior research showed that a more positive view on one's own mortality in wave 1 was associated with less stereotypes about sex, gender and desire in wave 2. The present online study explores whether positive death valence reduces homonegativity. Using reaction time tests and surveys, 77 out of 191 US participants continued from wave 1, assessing death attitudes, to wave 2, assessing homonegativity. Consistent with the prediction, participants who viewed death more positively exhibited significantly less homophobic prejudice. By contrast, survey measures revealed no association between death valence and homonegativity. Future research should incorporate further assesment methods, cross-cultural samples and additional dimensions of prejudice to better understand the role of positive death valence for anti-discriminatory interventions.",

          "abstract": "Long-term memory for images of natural scenes is known to be very good. However visual working memory (VWM) for natural scene stimuli is less well understood. We investigated VWM for natural scene stimuli by measuring VWM performance as a function of both encoding time and cognitive load level, employing a method that approximates everyday natural vision.  VWM performance was compared between (a) scenes containing either full chromatic and luminance information, (b) luminance-only (isochromatic) information and (c) chromatic-only (isoluminant) information.  VWM performance was also measured for scenes in which the scene’s structure had been destroyed by Fourier phase scrambling, or following removal of either the high or low spatial frequencies.  It was found that recall ability for isoluminance scenes was relatively poor, as it was also for the phase scrambled scenes with high cognitive load or short encoding time. However, recall ability was similar for the full colour (i.e., chromatic and luminance information combined) and luminance-only scenes, except for very brief presentation times where performance for the luminance-only scenes was worse.  These findings suggest that spatial scene structure is important for good VWM performance, and for very brief presentations there is a particular reliance on chromatic information.",

          "authors": "Shir Genzer; Yonat Rum; Ulrike M. Krämer; Anat Perry",
          "abstract": "In our digitally connected world, interpersonal interactions increasingly occur through online platforms offering varied information channels. This research investigates the unique contribution of visual cues to emotional communication, examining both cognitive and affective aspects. We categorize affective experiences into three domains and explore how visual feedback enhances each and promotes prosocial behavior. Across three ecological dyadic studies on Zoom (N = 710), findings show that while visual information does not significantly enhance emotion-assessment accuracy, it shapes the affective experience of communication. Visual cues increased perceptions of listening, togetherness, and empathy, primarily influencing storytellers' perceptions. Active engagement through body gestures and eye gaze proved crucial in fostering positive interactions, even in online settings. Visual feedback also enhanced prosocial behavior, suggesting that visual elements not only enhance the experience of “being seen,” but motivate altruistic actions as well. The results reveal a complex interplay between visual and auditory cues, with vocal responsiveness only partially compensating for absent visual feedback. These findings have significant implications for social relations in a digital world, as the absence or presence of visual cues can profoundly shape the outcomes of our social interactions.",

          "authors": "Julia Jankowski; Christopher Mlynski; Tina Prinz; Veronika Job",
          "abstract": "Many people see climate change as a major problem that needs to be addressed. However, many still do not engage in the necessary pro-environmental behavior. One possible problem is that pro-environmental behavior may require self-control given that being non-environmental is usually less effortful or otherwise less costly. In the present research, we examine whether lay beliefs about willpower (i.e., people’s beliefs about the nature of self-control) predict pro-environmental behavior. Study 1 (N = 165) tested the correlational relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and performance and effort exertion (as assessed by cardiovascular reactivity) on an environmental task. The results showed an association of a nonlimited willpower belief with better performance and more effort exertion (as measured by pre-ejection period, but not systolic blood pressure). Study 2 (N = 208) assessed the causal effect on the same outcomes by experimentally manipulating participants’ willpower beliefs. However, there was no support for a causal effect. There was only a marginally significant effect on performance, no significant difference in effort exertion as measured by pre-ejection period, and merely a trending difference in systolic blood pressure (which was exploratorily analyzed). Thus, while the results from Study 1 indicate a correlational relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and effortful exertion on pro-environmental behavior, Study 2 did not provide evidence of a causal effect. These results allow first insights into the relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and effortful pro-environmental behavior, but further research is needed to test the robustness and underlying causality of this relationship.",

          "abstract": "The present study contributes to research on the effects of color terminology on perceptual tasks. More specifically, we report the results of a color discrimination study testing a possible effect of multiple basic color terms (BCTs) for the blue color spectrum in Italian. To that end, the performance of speakers of Italian is contrasted with the performance of speakers of English, as these languages differ with regard to their basic color vocabulary. Unlike English, Italian is assumed to have two basic color terms for the blue color spectrum, dividing it along the lightness dimension. The results are discussed in context with results for Russian speakers from previous research. The results obtained by the present study do not provide evidence for an effect in Italian. This null-effect supports a view of weak effects of color terminology on discrimination tasks. We also discuss whether the complex\ncolor terminology for blues in Italian with divergent findings for basic color terms for the blue color space may be an additional factor in explaining the results.",

Fifty naive adult listeners will complete an online listening experiment, containing a baseline, training, and follow-up blocks. During the training block participants will be asked to orthographically transcribe the utterances of children with idiopathic, or cleft-related SSD (n=5, aged 6;0 to 10;1), producing single word utterances. During this block participants will be randomised to a group where they are either shown, or not shown the intended word said by the child. Changes in accuracy and/or ease of understanding will be measured by comparing the listeners’ transcription accuracy and ease ratings enter via a visual analogue scale in the baseline and follow-up block.  \nResults: To be completed at Stage 2.\nConclusion: To be completed at Stage 2.",

          "abstract": "Higher education students are a vulnerable group with respect to mental health issues, and healthy romantic relationships have shown to be a key influencing factor; however, the mechanisms are not fully understood. This study used a multi-method design to investigate the proposed mediating mechanisms of intra- and inter-personal emotion-regulation strategies. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and questionnaires, completed by 259 students (124 single, 135 in a relationship), were used to capture both trait emotion regulation tendencies and strategy utilisation on a day-to-day basis. Data were analysed using path mediation in a structural equation model. Results suggested some significant effects of emotion-regulation strategies on depression, anxiety and stress, but with   conflicting findings across methods. Findings suggest that fostering positive emotion-regulation strategies among students could be a relevant intervention target for supporting their mental health. Understanding variations in findings across methods, emotion regulation strategies, and mental health outcomes deserves further research attention.\n\nKeywords: mental health, students, romantic relationships",

          "authors": "Beatriz Domínguez-Álvarez",
          "abstract": "Background: Although overlap between depression and anxiety scales has been investigated separately, research examining shared and unique symptom profiles across both domains is limited. Given that comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders can reach up to 65%, understanding symptom-level overlap could provide valuable insights for improving diagnostic accuracy and developing targeted transdiagnostic assessments. Methods: We conducted a content analysis of 18 widely used clinical scales, assessing both depression and anxiety domains individually and together. Using the Jaccard Index (0 = no overlap; 1 = complete overlap), we quantified overlap across individual depression scales, individual anxiety scales, and combined depression and anxiety scales to capture symptom-level intersections. Results: Our findings indicated low mean overlap within each domain (0.29 and 0.26 for depression and anxiety, respectively) and even lower mean overlap (0.13) when depression and anxiety scales were analyzed together, underscoring significant heterogeneity among scales. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRDS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) displayed the highest cross-domain overlap (0.41), suggesting these scales may assess overlapping symptom dimensions. Conclusion: Results reveal distinct symptom structures in depression and anxiety scales, with only a limited degree of shared content. This suggests that many current scales may inadequately capture the mixed symptoms often present in clinical populations. Our findings underscore the importance of developing transdiagnostic measures capable of assessing both shared and distinct symptom dimensions across affective disorders, which may ultimately enhance clinical precision in assessing comorbid presentations and inform future revisions of existing assessment tools",

          "abstract": "How teams “divvy” up or distribute task labour amongst agents can influence\nteaming performance – for better or for worse. Human-Human (HH) teams have\ntypically demonstrated equal Division of Labour (DoL) strategies which benefit\nteam outcomes. However, the current understanding of DoL strategies Hybrid\nHuman-Machine (HM) teams adopt is not well understood. We aimed to explore\nthe DoL of HH and HM teams and understand how the DoL impacted team\nperformance. We used an experimental platform, in which two agents work con-\ncurrently by each controlling a moving paddle to deflect falling balls. Participants\nwere placed into either a HH team or HM team Alongside team performance,\nwe measured DoL using sophisticated time-sensitive analyses. With these measures, we found the DoL of HH teams was more equal than HM teams and that\na more equal DoL was also predictive of better team performance. Addition-\nally, HH teams showed less redundancy in their DoL than all other conditions\nand less redundant DoL behaviour resulted in better team performance. These\nfindings highlight that there are differences in how humans Divide Labour\nwith Machine agents. These differences are likely due to the underlying transactive nature human agents can engage in and the lack of transactive nature and\ncoordination of HM teams.

          "abstract": "The proactive gain control hypothesis suggests that the global language context regulates lexical access to the bilinguals’ languages during reading. Specifically, with increasing exposure to non-target language cues, bilinguals adjust the lexical activation to allow non-target language access from the earliest word recognition stages. Using the invisible boundary paradigm, we examined the flow of lexical activation in fifty proficient Russian-English bilinguals reading in their native Russian while the language context shifted from a monolingual to a bilingual environment. We gradually introduced non-target language cues (the language of experimenter and fillers) while also manipulating the type of word previews (identical, code-switches, unrelated code-switches, pseudowords). The results revealed the facilitatory reading effects of code switches but only in the later lexical processing stages and these effects were independent of the global language context manipulation. The results are discussed from the perspective of limitations imposed by script differences on bilingual language control flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Background: Mounting research indicates that observing others experience side effects can induce negative expectations and exacerbate side effects via the nocebo effect. However, most research on these socially-induced nocebo effects has focused on model-observer dyads, which may not map on to many real world settings in which people are exposed to many different models (e.g., social media).\n\nPurpose: To address this, we tested nocebo effects following observation of many models and whether the order of observing a ‘severe’ model (i.e., highly negative experience) moderated this effect.\n\nMethod : One hundred and seventy participants observed five social models undergo a virtual reality (VR) rollercoaster in Zoom, with four reporting mild cybersickness and one reporting severe cybersickness. The position of the model reporting severe cybersickness was manipulated between groups as either first (primacy), middle, or last\n(recency).\n\nResults: Participants who observed the cybersickness modelling reported greater cybersickness when they underwent the VR rollercoaster relative to a control group who observed non-symptomatic models. This social modelling effect was mediated by the participants’ expectancy of cybersickness symptoms. However, the position of the severe model within the sequence did not impact the participants’ cybersickness levels.\n\nConclusions: These findings demonstrate that socially-induced nocebo effects can occur in response to exposure to many models but the order of exposure does not moderate this effect. The results also indicate that developing interventions that target expectancy is critical for reducing the burden of socially-induced nocebo effects.",

          "abstract": "Reading is a complex process shaped by neurobiological traits and environmental factors, with reading disabilities imposing profound impacts on educational and socioeconomic outcomes worldwide. Early intervention is key, but identifying reliable, early-age predictors of future reading development remains a significant challenge, particularly in linguistically and socioeconomically diverse populations. While language-based precursors to reading ability (e.g., phonological awareness) have excellent predictive validity in homogeneous populations (e.g., English monolinguals), performance on these measures can be biased by language and early life experience. Here, we investigate whether visual processing measures could predict reading outcomes without biases of language background and socioeconomic status as early as kindergarten. Across a large and diverse sample of children (N ~ 1400) from California public schools, we administered measures of rapid visual processing (multi-element processing and visual motion perception tasks). Measures of language proficiency, socioeconomic status, and reading ability were also collected. We show that performance on the visual-processing measures did not differ by home language (Spanish versus English) or socioeconomic factors. Visual-processing measures accounted for ~12–18% of variance in year-end reading scores. Feature importance analysis suggests that visual-processing measures are important predictors of risk in kindergarten with equivalent performance to some of the conventional screening measures. Our findings show that visual-processing measures may provide a window into reading development that is agnostic to spoken language proficiency and socioeconomics. Incorporating these visual measures into early screening batteries could enable more equitable identification of children at risk for reading difficulties across diverse populations.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) equipped with general learning algorithms, but no linguistic knowledge, can learn to associate words with objects in naturalistic scenes when trained on head-mounted video recordings from a single child’s first-person experience. Similarly, ANNs can master syntax when trained on a similar amount of linguistic data a child experiences in a few years. These findings have been taken to challenge the view that innate linguistic priors play a role in child language acquisition. Here I show that the training environments and learning resources of ANN and humans are poorly matched, and accordingly, conclusions regarding human language priors are not merited. I also review three sets of findings that strongly suggest ANNs are missing human inductive biases: (1) children (but not ANNs) create new well-structured languages when only exposed to degraded ones; (2) ANN (but not humans) learn impossible and possible human languages in similar ways with similar facility; and (3) humans (but not ANNs) show a critical period for language learning. In this last case, adding an “innate” inductive prior to the ANN results in better ANN-human alignment. Just as is the case regarding claims of ANN-human alignment in the domain of vision, conclusions regarding ANN-human alignment in the domain of language is characterized by a lack of severe testing of hypotheses.",

It is unclear, however, whether such measures are actually useful indices of on-platform sharing. To shed light on this question, we recruited N=532 users from X (formerly Twitter) who had shared links to either high- or low-quality news outlets and invited them to complete an online survey where they indicated their likelihood of sharing true and false headlines. We find that, relative to participants who shared high-quality news on X, those who shared lower-quality news on X were also more likely to say that they would share false headlines in the survey, and a greater fraction of the headlines they said they would share were false. This suggests that self-reported sharing intentions do provide useful insight into the quality of news actually shared on social media.",

          "abstract": "We examine the joint roles of type frequency and token frequency in three artificial language learning experiments involving lexicalized plural allomorphy. The primary role of type frequency in productivity is well-established, but debates about the precise relationship between type frequency and productivity continue. The effect of token frequency on productivity is even more controversial: some lines of research suggest that token frequency and productivity are inversely related, other results indicate that they are positively related, and yet others argue that token frequency plays no role in productivity.  We take up both of these questions. Our learning framework makes it possible to examine the effects of these variables on generalization to novel forms as well as to examine how sensitivity to these factors affects the time-course of learning. The first two experiments differentiate predictions for generalization of three distinct hypotheses about the role of type frequency, while the third experiment investigates the independent role of token frequency. We find that both type and token frequency independently and positively contribute to learning rates and generalization across the three experiments, with type frequency playing a dominant role. We also apply two computational learning theories - implementing two prominent theoretical linguistic frameworks - to the learning of the lexically-conditioned allomorphy patterns in our experiments. Neither of these models is designed to encode a particular relationship between token frequency, type frequency, and productivity, but we show that both models correctly predict the general trends in generalization rates, learning curves, and the influence of token frequency observed across the experimental conditions.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes a rigorous method for controlling visual stimulus size in online psychological experiments. Our method employs ruler-based calibration to estimate the millimeter-to-pixel ratio by applying the least squares method to participants’ repeated measurements of randomly generated line segment lengths. Importantly, the success of the calibration can be objectively verified by assessing the measurement error of a test line segment and the residual variance in a linear regression model. Our simulation demonstrated that, with the recommended calibration criteria, an upper bound of the standard deviation for estimation errors was 0.007 mm/px. Implementation results showed that the majority of 100 participants completed the calibration within a few minutes, demonstrating the method’s feasibility. Our method may facilitate rigorous studies of psychological phenomena sensitive to visual stimulus size, such as visual perception and cognition, in online environments.

          "abstract": "To better understand how inconsistent beliefs persist and whether the tendency to endorse them (labeled doublethink) is malleable, we conducted four preregistered studies and a qualitative follow-up (total N = 1320 Serbian participants). We first found that doublethink was independently predicted by both superficial information processing style and lack of ability to spot contradictions. We next tested three progressively more direct interventions to reduce doublethink, all unsuccessful - first one increased sensitivity to contradictions in irrelevant material, second pushed respondents to reconcile pairs of provided inconsistent beliefs; third made them cross-reference their own inconsistent beliefs. When asked to elaborate their inconsistencies in semi-structured interviews, respondents did not evaluate them negatively, instead they employed circumvention strategies - attributing incompatibility to the response format or diluting content of the claims (e.g., adding logical conditions). Although these strategies are not irrational per se, they might enable moral relativization, double standards or incompatible expectations from others.",

          "abstract": "This study evaluated the ability of ChatGPT-4, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, to generate psychological reports using mock data. Two hundred forty-nine licensed psychologists in the United States, rated the quality of AI-generated and human-generated psychological reports across six dimensions: overall quality, readability, writing style, organizational structure, summary quality, and recommendation quality. The study used a counterbalanced design with eight conditions, presenting human or AI-generated reports for ADHD, intellectual disability, depression, and anxiety. Participants then provided ratings of quality through an online survey. Human-generated reports were preferred for their writing style (p = 0.026), organization (p = 0.042), and overall quality (p = 0.036), while the recommendations in AI-generated reports were favored (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found in readability. Participants were more likely to prefer and approve human-generated reports for clinical use (p = 0.042), though the majority expressed discomfort with both types. While AI shows promise in augmenting psychological report writing, particularly in generating recommendations, human expertise remains crucial, especially in summarizing information. These findings highlight the need for professional guidelines on AI use in psychological practice and updated educational curricula to prepare future psychologists for an evolving technological landscape in mental health care.",

AI has the potential to enhance educational and mental health services by facilitating data-driven decision-making, streamlining administrative tasks, and offering personalized interventions for students. However, biases inherent in AI systems—reflecting the prejudices of developers and historical data—pose significant risks of exacerbating systemic inequalities. This paper examines AI’s historical context, current applications in education, and specific uses within school psychology. It also discusses the socio-political factors contributing to algorithmic biases, data privacy concerns, and language/cultural inequities in AI systems. Recommendations are offered to mitigate AI biases, emphasizing the importance of diverse representation in AI development, comprehensive policy formation, transparency, and community involvement. Addressing these concerns is crucial for ensuring that AI contributes equitably to student success.",

We asked whether phonological similarity also impacts the dynamics of free recall. Analyzing data from a large delayed free recall experiment, we find that participants cluster their recalls based on alliterative and rhyming patterns in the encoded words, and such organization predicts recall performance. We also discover that phonological features induce false memories, and that phonological similarity interacts with temporal and semantic features to accelerate recall transitions.

          "abstract": "Most theories of suicide suggest that it occurs as a result of negative affect, but surprisingly few studies test nuanced associations between negative affect and suicidal thoughts. We hypothesized that negative affect would be especially likely to predict suicidal thoughts among those with strong emotion reactivity: that is, those with greater sensitivity, intensity, and persistence of negative affect when it is experienced. We used ecological momentary assessment to examine the real-time process of how emotion reactivity interacts with affect to predict suicidal thinking. As hypothesized, across two samples (n=43 college students reporting suicidal ideation; n=52 individuals with a history of suicide attempt recruited online), results revealed that the association between momentary negative affect and suicidal thinking was stronger among those with greater trait emotion reactivity. Regarding individual facets of emotion reactivity, the interaction with intensity was significant in Study 1, whereas the interactions with persistence and sensitivity were significant in Study 2. These findings support the real-world components of the emotion reactivity model, suggesting trait-level patterns of emotional responses are important to consider in modeling and analyzing momentary mood states. Between-sample inconsistencies between which facets drove this relationship may speak to individual differences in emotional processing.",

          "abstract": "Theoretical models of repetitive negative thinking suggest that multiple factors contribute to rumination, placing one at risk for depression. However, temporal dynamics of rumination and related cognitive  risk factors remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to model the time-varying associations between depressed mood, metacognitive beliefs, promotion focus, attentional control, and rumination in daily life using an ecological momentary assessment approach (EMA). Participants at risk for depression (n = 95) completed an intensive EMA procedure (6 times a day for 21 days). We relied on multi-level vector autoregressive modelling (mlVAR) to obtain temporal, contemporaneous and between-subjects networks. The temporal network showed that fluctuations in rumination were predicted by prior ruminative state, attentional control, positive beliefs about rumination, self-consciousness, promotion focus, and depressed mood. The contemporaneous and between subjects networks demonstrated a co-activation of multiple nodes. Each of these analyses provided novel insights into the main cognitive factors and their temporal interplay in relation to rumination.  Overall, the results converge with integrative theoretical models suggesting bidirectional temporal associations and highlight potential direct and indirect targets for interventions to modify rumination.",

          "abstract": "Giving people more time between encoding items into working memory (WM) improves performance. In complex span tasks performance depends on the cognitive load imposed by a secondary task carried out between encoding items; free time is one variable determining cognitive load. Explanations of the effects of time and of cognitive load on working memory often build on the assumption that time is used for maintenance processes such as rehearsal or refreshing. This leads to the prediction that a manipulation of time has a retroactive effect on items encoded before. In contrast, the encoding resource account suggests that free time has a proactive benefit by replenishing encoding resources between items, thereby improving encoding of subsequent items. In two studies, we examined whether giving additional free time resulted in a proactive or retroactive benefit in a modified complex-span task. We found that, whereas the secondary task led to a retroactive detriment, the free time benefit was proactive. These findings call for a new\nway of thinking about the effect of cognitive load in WM.",

High worry and low self-efficacy may be rather prominent among parents with adolescents with depression, but how this may in turn have an effect on parenting behaviors, such as warmth and criticism, is not well known. In a healthy control (i.e, 80 adolescents, M_age = 15.90, SD_age = 1.35; 151 parents, M_age = 49.04, SD_age = 5.87) and depression sample (i.e., 34 adolescents with depression, M_age = 15.65, SD_age = 1.54; 58 parents, M_age = 50.10, SD_age = 5.30), we estimated Gaussian graphical network models on adolescent-reported affect states (i.e., happy, relaxed, sad, &amp; irritated), adolescent- and parent-reported parenting behaviors (i.e., warmth, understanding, listening, criticism, dominance), and parent-reported parental worry and self-efficacy. Parents of adolescents with depression reported higher levels of worry, but not less self-efficacy. In both samples, parent-reported worry was positively related to adolescent-reported sadness and parent-reported parental criticism. Moreover, parent-reported self-efficacy was positively related to adolescent- and parent-reported parental warmth. Only in the depression sample, parent-reported worry was positively related to adolescent-reported parental warmth. Parental worry, self-efficacy, parenting behaviors and adolescent affect were interrelated with considerable differences between the control and depression sample. As a next step, studies with more intensive daily assessments may yield individual family analyses, while also accounting for contextual factors, to further increase our understanding of the relation between parental worry, self-efficacy and parenting behaviors in the context of adolescent depression.",

In Study 1 we observed that people who endorsed scientistic beliefs supported discriminatory policies against people who ignore scientific knowledge or promote anti-scientific views, ranging from restrictions on their media appearance to imprisonment and denial of healthcare. Study 2 replicated the effect and tested its potential mechanism: the tendency to moralize rationality mediated the relationship between scientism and support for penalizing measures.

A large amount of studies have underlined the sensorimotor grounding of the different processes at play in language comprehension, in particular action verb processing and sentence comprehension (see Fischer &amp; Zwaan, 2008 and Franken et al., 2022 for reviews). One aspect of language processing, phoneme perception, has been less extensively studied in light of embodied cognition, yet the motor involvement in decoding sounds pertaining to a linguistic code seems to play a crucial contribution. The focus of the current review is to provide an updated overview of the findings in this domain on both native (Sections I and II) and foreign (i.e. non-native) phoneme perception (Section III), and to further examine if and how motor training may enhance phonological processing and learning of foreign language speech sounds (Section IV and V).",

Computational modelling represents a new avenue to uncover the finegrained cognitive processes driving social media behaviour. Here, we develop a novel computational model of real-world social media posting data, adapted from the animal reward learning literature. Across a Twitter dataset (n= 2,696 users), including a preregistered confirmatory sample, we separate the contribution of different cognitive processes and show that a hybrid goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking process underlies social media posting behaviour. Further, younger people and women are more goal-directed – updating their strategy more purposefully to maximise social media rewards – while older users and men tend to be more habitual. Our model paves the way for large-scale investigation into the cross-species cognitive processes motivating social media behaviours, and their downstream impacts on individuals and society.",

The present meta-analysis and narrative synthesis examined the relationship between FaW with work engagement and job burnout. The results of the meta-analysis showed a substantial overlap between Work Engagement and FaW and a smaller overlap with emotional exhaustion. Meta-regression indicated that the relationship between FaW and work engagement was stronger in Non-WEIRD countries and studies with samples including a higher proportion of men. The narrative review revealed two primary and bidirectional categories that capture the essence of workplace fun: Organization-Driven Fun (ODF) and Employee-Driven Fun (EDF). ODF and EDF provided the basis for a new conceptual approach to FaW outlined in the paper.

Behaviourally, automatic imitation is measured using the stimulus response compatibility (SRC) task, in which participants produce vocal responses whilst perceiving compatible or incompatible speech distractors. Automatic imitation is measured as the difference in response times (RT) between incompatible and compatible trials. It is unclear if and how social group membership, such as the speaker’s sex, affects automatic imitation. Two theoretical accounts make conflicting predictions regarding effects of group membership: the first predicts that automatic imitation can be modulated by group membership, while the second predicts that automatic imitation remains unaffected. We tested these predictions for participant sex and distractor sex in an online vocal SRC task. Female and male participants completed an SRC task presenting female or male distractor stimuli. The results show that automatic imitation is not modulated by group membership. Implications of these results regarding the nature of automatic imitation are considered.",

          "abstract": "Since learning to read involves associating letter shapes with how they sound, it is widely believed that children become familiar with letter shapes when they start learning their sounds or start writing them down. However, since printed letters are often available in the environment, it is possible that children are already familiar with letter shapes. Here, we provide evidence for this intriguing possibility. We tested 300 children at the beginning of formal reading instruction of the Indian language Kannada. Each child performed four tasks: (1) a letter familiarity task in which they saw upright and inverted versions of each letter, and had to identify the more familiar orientation; (2) a letter recognition task where they had to name letters shown sequentially; (3) a visual search task where they had to find an oddball letter among identical other letters, with letters either all upright or inverted; and (4) a rapid automatized naming task where they had to name digits. Our main finding is that, despite showing wide variation in letter naming, children were highly familiar with letter orientation. This effect was present even on letters that children did not recognize at all. This familiarity with letter orientation also gave them a letter processing advantage: children searched faster when letters were upright than when they were inverted. Our findings reveal a far deeper knowledge of print among early readers than previously observed, and provide empirical support for early exposure to print as a strategy to jump-start reading acquisition.",

Is it also considered morally wrong to violate an inferred joint plan?  In five preregistered experiments (n = 1,506), we show that deviating from an inferred joint plan is perceived as morally problematic, even without prior communication or agreement.

In Aotearoa (New Zealand), the enduring impacts of colonisation on Māori include the suppression of Indigenous wisdom, even as research affirming the knowledge and practice of traditional Māori healing is on the rise. \n\nThe Tū Wairua project will explore the integration of rongoā Māori (traditional Māori healing practices) with psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) for addressing problematic methamphetamine use (PMU) in Māori communities. This Māori-led project is driven by kaupapa Māori methodology and rongoā Māori conceptualisations of health and informed by biomedical psychedelic science. Based at Rangiwaho Marae in Te Tairāwhiti, a community with a high Māori population and a significant burden of PMU, the project aims to develop a culturally-appropriate PAT to explore the efficacy of psilocybin in treating PMU. \n\nThis research represents a shift toward health interventions that respect and extend Indigenous wisdom, addressing the unique needs of Māori communities. It also seeks to develop a skilled Māori workforce to continue these healing practices, and challenge current legislation that restricts the use of Indigenous psychedelics.

But are politicians who rely on one strategy versus another any more likely to win actual elections? We constructed a novel dataset documenting Representatives’ public remarks in response the 1992 House Bank Scandal, during which 266 U.S. Representatives from both major political parties were accused of misusing House Bank funds. We observed three key results. First, contrary to predictions, mitigating strategies were not associated with electoral failure among more frequent House Bank “offenders” (whose mitigating strategies were presumably less credible). Second, some aggravating strategies (refusals) were associated with electoral failure—unless incumbents’ party had a secure majority in their district. Finally, this tendency for refusals to predict failure in “safe” partisan districts obtained only in general (not primary) elections, reducing the number of unobserved variables that might be confounded with district partisanship and still incline voters to tolerate aggravating accounts. Results suggest that politicians’ responses to scandals predict real-world election outcomes—depending on district-level characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Trust serves as a fundamental cornerstone in close relationships, often considered as the essential bond that maintains partner connections. While tools for measuring dyadic trust in close relationships exist in Western contexts, there has been a lack of validated instruments for measuring trust in close relationship within Chinese cultural contexts. This study sought to adapt and validate the Dyadic Trust Scale (DTS) for Chinese populations using two independent samples (n = 204; n = 377). Through item analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, Item 1 was removed from the original DTS and a two-factor model comprising 7 items was emerged for the Chinese version, contrasting with the previous one-factor models. We labeled the two factors as Trustworthiness (ordinal α = 0.88) and Security (ordinal α = 0.73) respectively. The adapted DTS also demonstrated very good convergent and discriminant validity, along with very good criterion validity, as evident by correlations with relationship satisfaction assessed by the Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS). Our findings support the Chinese DTS as a psychometrically reliable and valid tool for assessing dyadic trust in close relationships in China, paving the way for further research in this area.",

          "abstract": "The quality of early interactions between parents and their children is essential for fostering healthy development. This study investigates the relationship between parent-infant interaction, language development and infant regulation, as well as the distinct roles of mothers and fathers.\nA total of 40 mother-child dyads were examined at six months postpartum. Self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate maternal depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), parental attachment-related attitudes (Revised Adult Attachment Scale), and infant regulation (Questionnaire for Crying, Feeding and Sleeping). Mother-infant interactions were recorded on video and subsequently evaluated using the Infant CARE-Index, with an additional assessment of father-infant interaction in a smaller subsample of 20 dyads.\nThe findings indicate that higher maternal depressive symptoms were linked to an increased prevalence of infant regulatory challenges, such as crying and sleep difficulties. Notably, fathers demonstrated significantly higher interaction quality than mothers, despite similar co-regulatory behaviors between parents. These results underscore the impact of maternal mental health on infant regulation and emphasize the importance of father involvement in early child development.",

Day-to-day behaviours contribute to poor air quality (AQ) but limited public understanding of AQ warrants effective communication strategies to promote awareness and empower positive behavioural change.\n\n\nObjective:\nThrough the integration of behavioural, science communication, and socio-ecological frameworks, this rapid review mapped existing AQ-related communication interventions and their influence on AQ awareness, on protective and/or mitigating behaviours (i.e., avoiding exposure; reducing polluting activities), and on boosting civic engagement.\n\n\nMethods:\nBuilding on previous evidence syntheses, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed and grey literature, including 79 studies for analysis. Findings were synthesised narratively and assessed for quality with the QuADS tool. We followed the Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study designs (PICOS) criteria and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\n\nResults:\nDespite high heterogeneity in intervention types, most served a persuasion or enablement function, often utilising dissemination modes such as websites or web applications, and most assessed awareness and/or engagement in protective behaviours. While most interventions focused on individual/household-level actions and interindividual dynamics, only some considered policy-level actions, and very few embedded infrastructural considerations in their communication. Overall, 47 studies reported positive impacts on awareness and/or behaviours, particularly through participatory approaches, although we noted issues associated with promoting meaningful participation and identified influencing psychosocial factors. Evidence of effectiveness for behaviours was often limited by observational designs and the focus on awareness only or self-reported behaviours/intentions.\n\n\nSignificance:\nOur findings highlight that top-down communication intervention can have a positive influence on AQ awareness, while findings on behavioural impact are mixed. We highlight growing attempts to communicate AQ-related risks and behavioural solutions through empowering approaches that are sensitive to individual and local circumstances, but note the need for further work to foster mitigating behaviours and civic engagement.",

          "authors": "Henk Kiers",
          "abstract": "A well-known problem of null hypothesis significance testing is that it cannot be used to find support for the null hypothesis. A common solution for this is to replace the exact 0 value by an interval associated with values that are close to zero. This approach is denoted as equivalence testing and is a special case of procedures that test intervals of values against each other. Smiley et al. (2023) recently published a unified framework of statistical inference and suggested a straightforward method of testing all sorts of interval-based hypotheses in a unified way. The present paper discusses three alternative general approaches, based on Bayesian analysis, which have the advantage that the ensuing probabilities can be interpreted as probabilities of the population parameters, rather than probabilities of the data (as is the case with frequentist methods). These methods (in some form) have been previously suggested, but here we bring them together and show how they can be used for Smiley et al.’s full unified framework of statistical inference, now complementing it with three Bayesian counterparts. In particular, it is shown how each of the methods work in the analysis of a leading example data set involving a test on proportions. Subsequently, their relative pros and cons are discussed, and it is explained how the methods can be used for many statistical analysis questions in practice, using R and/or JASP. This is illustrated on an empirical data set for comparing means of two groups.",

          "abstract": "We present two meta-analyses examining the effectiveness of digital tools on reading outcomes for children and adolescents under 15. We differentiate between poor readers and general school readers, considering intervention type, syllabic complexity, and the type of reading outcomes as moderators. Our search encompassed randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials that assessed digital interventions targeting cognitive or specifically reading-related skills, including a control group, published between 2000 and 2022. We included 41 studies (k = 194) for poor readers and 15 studies (k = 69) for general readers. Our findings from multilevel meta-analyses with robust variance estimation show positive impacts on reading performance for both poor (medium effect size: g = 0.433, CI = [0.3; 0.56], p &lt; 0.001) and general readers (small effect size: g = 0.256, CI = [.08; 0.43], p = 0.009). Notably, domain-specific interventions aided both reader types, while domain-general interventions were effective only for poor readers. The impact of syllabic complexity was limited, with only numerically stronger effects in languages with simpler syllabic structures. Effect sizes did not differ significantly between decoding and comprehension outcomes. These findings highlight the potential of tailored digital interventions to enhance reading skills, especially for those facing reading challenges, and underscore the need for considering additional characteristics in intervention design.",

          "abstract": "Minority stress theory poses that distal and proximal stressors cause sexual minority groups to experience excess stress, which can lead to poor mental health outcomes. Szymanski and Mikorski (2016) found that proximal internalised heterosexism mediated the relationship between distal heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress in a sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Meaning in life also moderated some of these pathways. Whilst this mediating relationship is established, research in this area typically examines all sexual minority people together. It is important, however, to explore the unique experiences of lesbian women independent of other sexual minority groups. Therefore, the present study aimed to conceptually replicate Szymanski and Mikorski’s (2016) findings in a sample of lesbian women. We examined the mediating role of internalised heterosexism in the heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress relationship in 363 UK lesbians. The moderating role of meaning in life, both search for and presence of, were also investigated. This was a cross-sectional self-report study with data collected from May 2024 to August 2024. In line with the original research, a moderated mediation analysis showed that internalised heterosexism significantly mediated the heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress link. However, no moderating role of search for meaning, nor presence of meaning was found, which did not replicate the results of the original study. This difference could be due to specific sample characteristics. Therefore, these results highlight the need for sexual minority women to be centralised in research in order to produce interventions tailored to specific sexual minority groups.",

          "abstract": "The key educational transition from primary to secondary school occurs during the sensitive developmental period of early adolescence, when students are developing self-regulatory abilities and facing a new array of challenges. Of concern, a decline in wellbeing has been observed following this educational transition. However, little is known about how the self-regulation of cognitions (metacognition) and emotions (emotion regulation) are related to adolescent students’ wellbeing following this transition. Here, we investigate whether metacognition and emotion regulation are related to student’s subjective academic and personal wellbeing, in a sample of 134 students (59 male, 75 female) aged 12-14 years (M = 12.88 years, SD = 0.67 years) in the early years of Australian secondary school. This study was cross-sectional, and data were collected in 2022/2023.  Participants completed a series of computer-based tasks and questionnaires designed to capture metacognition, emotion regulation, executive functions (working memory, attention control and cognitive flexibility) and wellbeing (academic wellbeing and personal wellbeing). Both metacognition and emotion regulation made significant and distinct contributions to adolescents’ academic and personal wellbeing, with metacognition playing a larger role in academic wellbeing and emotion regulation making larger contributions to personal wellbeing. Of import, the contributions of metacognition and emotion regulation to wellbeing were observed after accounting for underlying individual differences in executive functions. These findings suggest that improving both metacognition and emotion regulation during early adolescence could have positive impacts on student wellbeing, regardless of differences in students’ underlying abilities.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Alcohol expectancy theory proposes that beliefs about drinking motivate or deter drinking. Although expectancies influence drinking, less is known about how the consequences of drinking influence expectancies. We modeled a feedback conceptualization of how the experience of specific consequences influenced people’s beliefs about how likely a consequence will occur (i.e., likelihoods) and how positive the consequence will be (i.e., valences). Method: We re-analyzed cross-sectional data from college drinkers (n = 504), using Bayesian cross-classified multilevel ordinal regressions to estimate associations between consequences, likelihoods, and valences. We performed a preregistered replication in new data (n = 362). Results: Participants had higher likelihoods (95% CIStudy 1 = [2.06, 2.43], 95% CIStudy 2 = [1.75, 2.12]) and valences (95% CIStudy 1 = [0.28, 0.52], 95% CIStudy 2 = [0.33, 0.60]) when they had experienced consequences more often, but these associations leveled off at higher consequence frequencies. Participants also believed consequences to be more likely when they viewed them as more positive, and vice versa, and again, these associations leveled off at higher levels of the predictor. Critically, the strength of these associations varied across both people and consequences. Conclusions: Experiencing specific consequences more often was related to people judging them to be more likely and more positive in the future, aligning with alcohol expectancy theory. This may lead to experiencing negative consequences repeatedly because people are not being demotivated from drinking in the same fashion. Given the person and consequence level variability, clinicians should consider an individualized approach when targeting drinking consequences.  \n\nKeywords: alcohol, college drinking, expectancies, consequences",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood maltreatment is associated with a higher risk for developing psychological disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Dysfunctional emotion regulation (ER) has been implicated as a neurocognitive mechanism linking adverse childhood experiences to an increased risk for psychopathological outcomes. \nObjective: This preregistered study investigated the relation between childhood maltreatment and different aspects of ER, including implementation capacity and effort as well as tendency and flexibility in strategy selection.\nMethods: In a non-clinical adult sample (N = 227), childhood maltreatment was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. In two experimental ER tasks, participants viewed pictures of varying emotional intensity while applying one of three ER strategies (distraction, reappraisal, suppression) or without any active regulation. The ER implementation task allowed to assess emotion reactivity, implementation capacity, and subjective effort for ER. The ER selection task allowed to assess tendency and flexibility in strategy selection. \nResults: Childhood maltreatment was associated with a lower capacity to implement reappraisal (r = -.12), a stronger tendency to choose suppression (r = .15), and lower flexibility in ER strategy selection (r = -.12). Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant association to experimentally assessed emotion reactivity or subjective effort exerted on ER.\nConclusions: We show that people with childhood maltreatment experiences do not only choose suppression more frequently but seem to have a deficit in flexibly adjusting strategy selection to context factors, e.g., stimulus intensity. This can be interpreted as an important factor rendering emotion regulation less adaptive in a clinical sense.",

This study examined the influence of model type on the effectiveness of AOMI training for novices learning an Ankle Pick takedown. Twenty-eight novice participants were randomly assigned to AOMI training that displayed footage of a self-model (AOMISELF) or an other-model (AOMIOTHER). A motor learning design incorporating pre-test (Day 1), acquisition (Days 2-6), post-test (Day 7), and retention-test (Day 14) was utilised). Motor skill performance, self-efficacy and mental representation structures were recorded as measures of learning. There were no significant differences between the training conditions across all twelve kinematics measures of motor skill performance. Self-efficacy scores increased for all training conditions over time. Both the AOMIOTHER and Control conditions led to improved functional changes in mental representation structures while the structures for the AOMISELF condition moved further away from the reference structure over time. Collectively, the largely null findings suggest that physical practice is the main driver of motor adaptations for this complex motor skill at these early stages of learning. However, the findings also suggest model type may be an important factor for novices using AOMI training. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to explore different modeling approaches, such as mixed-modeling, when designing AOMI interventions for sport.",

This paper introduces the concept of \"naïve pacifism\" to describe underlying assumptions in PCP that hinder its ability to address complex modern conflicts effectively. Three pillars of naïve pacifism are identified: (1) the homeostatic view of peace as the natural state and violence as a dysfunction, (2) the belief in the reactive nature of violence, and (3) a perspectivist approach that overlooks objective features of conflicts. These assumptions lead PCP researchers to oversimplify, perpetuate pseudoscientific views of and promote ineffective interventions to solve violent conflicts. By challenging these pillars and proposing a more nuanced framework, this paper aims to advance PCP toward a true science of peace-making that is better equipped to address contemporary global conflicts.",

Children (N = 223; Mage = 7.24, SDage = 2.51; 132 girls, 90 boys; 50.26% racially minoritized; 49.74% White) were primed with gender-relevant, race-relevant, or neutral words and then gender-categorized racially diverse faces under a time constraint. Priming concepts of social categories delayed categorization for White children 6 years and younger. By 12 years, priming categories facilitated White children’s automatic categorizations. Conceptual priming did not affect the efficiency of racially minoritized children’s social categorizations. Top-down information then contributes to how social categorization becomes efficient, but children’s identity influences what information they use to inform categorizations.",

          "abstract": "This reply to Conway et al. (2024) illustrates how points of contention in the evaluation of mindreading (or Theory of Mind) measures can arise from the use of divergent validity concepts. The construct validity model used in Wendt and colleagues’ (2024) empirical study contrasts with the perspective implicit in Conway and colleagues' commentary, which is more consistent with Lennon's content validity model. This is reflected in the authors' conception of the nature of what is to be measured (i.e., the measurand), the criterion for what makes a measure superior (i.e., validity), and the proposed methods for judging this (i.e., validation). The mismatch between the validity concepts adopted by the respective authors has three major implications: First, Conway and colleagues' critique does not fully address the specific goals, assumptions, and intricacies of construct validation methodology. Second, their approach to measuring mindreading should not be confused with, or considered as an alternative to, construct validation, but is valuable in its own right. Third, the two validity frameworks mentioned offer unique opportunities for different phases of the research process. While a content validity approach can be valuable for describing an empirical phenomenon that seems worthy of explanation (e.g., real-world mindreading), a construct validity approach helps identify the theoretical constructs that might help explain it (e.g., mindreading ability).",

          "abstract": "Construal level has been shown to influence economic decisions, affecting both risk perception and risk-taking. However, there has been some inconsistency as to the exact effects of high/low construal on economic decisions, with some findings suggesting that construal might interact with cognitive load and self-control in a risk-taking context. In two experiments, the current paper examines behavioural and neurological (using functional near-infrared spectroscopy) responses to high and low construal manipulations during and economic decision task, under experimentally-induced cognitive load. We also examine the how construal interacts with self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy to predict lateral pre-frontal cortex (LPFC) activation during these decisions. Some of the behavioural results supported previous findings that under cognitive load, high construal prompts risk aversion. Neurological data supported the theory that construal promotes risk sensitivity. Self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy were all found to interact with construal in predicting LPFC activation during decision-making. These findings extend our understanding of how construal effects economic decisions under cognitive load while also providing new insights into how self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy might interact with construal in this context.",

          "abstract": "Objectivity has long been touted as a virtue in science, and certain statistical (e.g., null hypothesis significance testing) and scientific methods have been championed as means for obtaining objectivity. One way in which objectivity has been championed is through the use of universal statistical significance tests, where researchers conclude results are statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. While such objective criteria may improve communication and increase consensus, it does so at a cost. Specifically, objective criteria (such as p value threshholds) provide a means whereby poor quality studies can pass publication filters, they stifle creativity, and they thwart the self-correcting mechanisms of the scientific process. In this paper, I argue in favor of embracing ambiguity, either by allowing scientists to define their own criteria for statistical significance or by allowing researchers to refrain from making any decisions of statistical significance entirely. While allowing researchers to set their own decision criteria will inevitably lead to disagreements and a lack of consensus, it will only do so when evidence is weak. This is exactly as it should be, as disagreement should be welcomed in cases of interpretive ambiguity.. I conclude this paper by giving practical recommendations about how researchers might develop their own decision criteria using metrics relevant to their variables of interest.",

          "abstract": "Engaging in fluent conversation is a surprisingly complex task that requires interactants\nto promptly respond to each other in a way that is appropriate to the social context. In\nthis study, we disentangled different dimensions of turn-taking by investigating how the\ndynamics of child-adult interactions changed according to the activity (task-oriented versus\nfreer conversation) and the familiarity of the interlocutor (familiar versus unfamiliar).\nTwenty-eight autistic children (16 male; Mage = 10.8 years) and 20 age-matched typically\ndeveloping children (8 male; Mage = 9.6) participated in seven task-orientated face-to-face\nconversations with their caregivers (336 total conversations) and seven more telephone\nconversations alternately with their caregivers (144 total conversations, 60 with typical\ndevelopment group) and an experimenter (191 total conversations, 112 with autism\ngroup). By modelling inter-turn response latencies in multi-level Bayesian location-\nscale models to include long tails, we found good test-rest reliability across sessions and\ncontexts, and showed that context strongly shaped group differences in response latencies.\nAutistic children exhibited more overlaps, produced faster response latencies and shorter\npauses than than typically developing children – and these group differences were stronger\nwhen conversing with the unfamiliar experimenter. Unfamiliarity also made the relation\nbetween individual differences and latencies evident: only in conversations with the\nexperimenter were higher socio-cognitive skills, lower social motivation and lower social\nawareness associated with faster responses. Information flow and shared tempo were also\ninfluenced by familiarity: children adapted their response latencies to the predictability\nand tempo of their interlocutor’s turn, but only when interacting with their caregivers\nand not the experimenter. These results highlight the need to construe turn-taking as\na multicomponential construct that is shaped by individual differences, interpersonal\ndynamics, and the affordances of the context.",

          "abstract": "Although Assessment Center (AC) role-play assessments have received ample attention in past research, their reliance on actual behavioral information is still unclear. Uncovering the behavioral basis of AC role-play assessments is, however, a prerequisite for the optimization of existing and the development of novel automated AC procedures. This work provides a first data-driven benchmark for the behavioral prediction and explanation of AC performance judgments. We used machine learning models trained on behavioral cues (C = 36) to predict performance judgments in three interpersonal AC exercises from a real-life high-stakes AC (selection of medical students, N = 199). Three main findings emerged: First, behavioral prediction models showed substantial predictive performance and outperformed prediction models representing potential judgment biases. Comparisons with in-sample results revealed overfitting of traditional approaches, highlighting the importance of out-of-sample evaluations. Second, we demonstrate that linear combinations of behavioral cues can be strong predictors of assessors’ judgments. Third, we identified consistent exercise-specific patterns of individual cues and cross-exercise consistent behavioral patterns of behavioral dimensions and interpersonal strategies that were especially predictive of the assessors’ judgments. We discuss implications for future research and practice.",

          "abstract": "In Eastern Europe, collective victim beliefs have become integral elements of national ideologies, especially amid rising geopolitical polarisation. In this study, we investigated how exclusive victimhood was related to geopolitical attitudes in Hungary and Serbia. The study involved Serbian (N = 630) and Hungarian (N = 471) adult national samples stratified by gender, age, political orientation, and place of residence. As expected, exclusive victimhood predicted higher support for a geopolitical shift from the West (i.e., EU and US) to the East (i.e., Russia and China) via Euroscepticism in both samples. In Serbia, the strongest indirect effect was observed among participants with neutral attitudes towards the war in Ukraine. In Hungary, there was no expected moderated mediation while the direct effect of exclusive victimhood on the West-to-East geopolitical shift was largest for pro-Russian participants and non-significant for pro-Ukrainian participants. Different measures of ethnic identity showed no expected moderation effect, but an exploratory analysis revealed that exclusive victimhood partially mediated the relationship between identity measures (superiority and attachment) and support for a pro-Eastern (vs. pro-Western) geopolitical orientation. We discuss how the construals of the past based on exclusive victimhood shape future geopolitical preferences of the public in Hungary and Serbia.",

          "abstract": "Confidence is increasingly viewed as a barrier to recognizing misinformation, as people who are more confident tend to be more likely to believe and share false news. Here, we challenge this view by distinguishing between two types of confidence: general confidence in one’s abilities, and specific confidence in a particular judgment. Using a large, pre-registered study in which participants judge the accuracy of news posts, we demonstrate a striking dissociation between these two forms of confidence. While higher general confidence is associated with worse discernment of true versus false headlines (in line with past work), we find that higher confidence in specific judgments is associated with better truth discernment - a finding that we observe among both Democrats and Republicans. These results call for a reevaluation of the role of confidence in the detection of misinformation. Focusing on confidence in specific judgments, rather than general abilities, could play an important role in helping to mitigate belief in misinformation.",

Using multilevel response surface analysis and ecological momentary assessment, we investigated relations between affective congruence and empathy during social interactions in a large sample of adults (N=526; total interactions=21,521; median=38 interactions per person). We found that while empathy is generally higher when there is affective congruence, empathy is highest when there is congruence in high positive affect. Further, people are least empathetic when they feel emotionally worse than they perceive the other person is feeling. These findings provide novel insights into the empathic processes.",

          "abstract": "Background: Young adults in the United States are heavy users of social media which has been identified as a possible risk factor for depression. However, it is unclear whether social media use is associated with internalizing disorder symptom vulnerability beyond depression or whether it is related to other relevant symptom dimensions like externalizing symptoms (e.g., substance use). Moreover, it is unclear what aspects of social media use beyond frequency are associated to symptoms. Methods: A large cohort of undergraduate students from a Midwest university (N= 7123) participated in a screening of transdiagnostic symptoms of psychopathology. Data collected included: time spent on social media, social media platforms used, and aspects of problematic social media use (i.e., use for emotion regulation, compulsive use, or social-media-related impairment). We also collected sociodemographics and self-reported symptoms: depression, panic, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, alcohol use, drug use, insomnia, and pain. We correlated depression scores to time spent on social media to confirm prior findings of an association between social media use and depression. We then used a principal components analysis to identify shared dimensions of psychopathology across these symptoms and explored the correlations between symptom dimensions and elements of social media use. Results: Participants who reported higher social media usage exhibited significantly higher self-reported depression. Our PCA suggested two dimensions of psychopathology consistent with the HiTOP model which we dubbed “emotional” and “externalizing” symptoms. Time spent on social media was correlated with emotional symptoms and with externalizing symptoms, albeit to a lesser extent. However, these associations were not significant after controlling for problematic social media use. Moreover, problematic social media use had differential relations to dimensions of psychopathology. For example, using social media for emotion regulation was associated with more severe internalizing symptoms but less severe externalizing symptoms. E-value analysis suggested that unmeasured confounds could potentially explain these associations. Discussion: Our results suggest that the association between time spent on social media and psychopathology could be accounted for by the way in which social media is used, which in turn is differentially associated to emotional and externalizing symptoms. However, unmeasured confounding remains a threat to these inferences.",

How do young learners come to develop a sense of belief in religion and the supernatural? We take a social-interactionist perspective to this question and argue that children’s belief is dependent on the particular cultural input to which they are exposed in their environment. We highlight research showing the impact of learning via interaction with family, peers, and the larger environment. Within these contexts, children learn both via the verbal testimonial information to which they are exposed, as well as through participating in rituals, and imitating other cultural group members. We indicate specific mechanisms that aid in the transmission of belief such as the credibility of the informant, the quality of the explanation posed to the child, and the saliency of the ritual. Such mechanisms can shed light on important ways in which to present novel information to learners across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "This study uses unique auction data to study loss aversion in sellers. Our analysis of TV shows including 512 auctions and 3,940 offers reveals that sellers perceive the appraised market value as the reference price. Consistent with the predictions of prospect theory, the likelihood to bargain for higher offers as well as the willingness to sell then reflects loss aversion. Specifically, we find that most bargaining happens in the loss domain and that sellers are 6% more likely to bargain for higher offers when the current offer is below the appraised market value. Conversely, the median value of accepted offers falls precisely on the reference price and willingness to sell is 11% higher for offers in the gain domain. We also investigate reference point formation and find that sellers’ initial expectations affect the outcomes of auctions. Consistent with the application of a MinMax heuristic, sellers who initially underestimate the value of their item sell below the reference price while sellers who initially overestimate the value of their item sell above the reference price. Finally, we find that duration of ownership can positively influence sellers’ price expectations, but neither duration of ownership nor emotional attachment affect seller behavior.",

          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that statistical power reaches the conventionally accepted level of 80% in the overall analysis and also in the subset of studies using binomial tasks, whereas it is less concinvingly high in reaction time studies. Moreover, the file drawer rate is low. All in all, the literature about space-valence body-specificity appears reasonably solid, with room for improvement in reaction time tasks.",

Central values of open science, including openness, integrity, and rigor, have long been espoused by qualitative researchers and enacted in practice. However, we argue that there is even more potential for qualitative researchers to participate in open science by enacting practices that have been appropriately designed or modified for qualitative methodologies. We present seven open science practices that we suggest that qualitative researchers adopt to further the openness, integrity, and rigor of our scholarship. We close by discussing the implications of these practices for researchers across methodologies and communities of practice.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between the theme of interdependence in the narratives of American adults with disabilities during the first three years of the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological well-being.  In contrast to independence, interdependence has emerged as a focus of research about people with disabilities in both the humanistic discipline of disability studies and in prior psychological research.  In the present study, 108 participants completed questionnaires assessing well-being and responded to three narrative prompts once a year between 2020 and 2022, resulting in a total of 952 narratives.  Narratives were reliably coded for the new narrative variable of interdependence.  In addition, narratives were also reliably coded for the narrative themes of independence, dependence, agency, submissiveness, communion, and disconnection.  The results of multi-level modeling analyses indicated that the themes of interdependence and disconnection were most strongly associated with psychological well-being over time.  Within-person analyses indicated that higher levels of interdependence were associated with lower levels of well-being in 2020 and with higher levels of well-being in 2022.  These results (along with a qualitative case study) suggest that the associations between narrative themes and well-being are contextualized and may demonstrate unusual associations during periods of extreme events, like the COVID-19 pandemic.  This study quantitatively establishes interdependence as an important narrative theme, one especially salient for people with disabilities.  It also suggests that people with disabilities may offer alternative ways of narrating contemporary American identity that might serve as an example for non-disabled and disabled people alike.",

          "abstract": "Twenty-five years ago, the publication of an article by Pallier, Colomé and Sebastián-Gallés (2001) launched a new and rapidly evolving research program on how second language (L2) learners represent the phonological forms of words in their mental lexicons. Many insights are starting to form an overall picture of the unique difficulties for establishing functional and precise phonolexical representations in L2; however, in order for the field to move forward it is pertinent to outline its major emerging research questions and existing challenges. Among significant obstacles for further research, the paper explores the current lack of theoretical agreement on the concept of phonolexical representations and the underlying mechanism involved in establishing them, as well as the variable use of the related terminology (e.g. fuzziness and target-like). Methodological challenges involved in investigating phonological processing and phonolexical representations as well as their theoretical implications are also discussed. To conclude, we explore the significance of L2-specific phonological representations for bottom-up lexical access during casual, conversational speech, and how our emerging knowledge of L2 lexical representations can be applied in an instructional setting as two potentially fruitful research avenues at the forefront of the current research agenda.",

Here, we asked whether the experience with written language, a human cultural invention, predicts the speed of spoken word recognition beyond any (potential) influence of spoken language experience. Previous research had obtained inconsistent and contradictory results using a variety of experimental methods. Using a large dataset (Hintz et al., 2024a) that is unprecedented in size (number of participants) and depth (number of skills assessed), 613 typically developed native Dutch adults between 18 and 30 years carried out a lexical decision task (ALDT), a standard spoken word recognition task. The task neither involved pictorial input nor sentential processing. Participants listened to Dutch words and nonwords and judged their lexical status as quickly as possible. We performed drift diffusion modelling on the lexical decision response times and focused on drift rate as an indicator for the amount of auditory information that individuals accumulate before deciding on non/words’ lexical status. We hypothesized that participants differed in the quality of their lexical representations due to their spoken and written language experience and thus in how quickly and efficiently these representations can be accessed. Hierarchical regression analyses on participants’ drift rate parameters revealed that written rather than spoken language experience predicts speed of spoken word recognition. Further research could be directed at elucidating the exact mechanisms of these cultural (reading) influences on spoken word recognition.",

In this preregistered study, we presented the CRT for aggression either with or without premises (N = 778). In line with the method’s rationale, results revealed that CRT-A scores were affected by the omission of premises. On the item level, for six out of 22 items, the frequency of choosing illogical responses did not differ when the premises were removed. Correlations with self-reported aggression were similar for both versions of the CRT-A.

          "abstract": "Exposure to musical rhythms has been shown to influence the perception of subsequently presented speech. Until now, this effect has only been studied in native language (L1) processing. The present study investigated whether rhythmic priming could also benefit second language (L2) processing. A musical rhythmic priming experiment was designed based on previous studies in L1 children. Over two experiments, 66 L2 adult speakers of French were asked to detect grammatical errors in naturally spoken French sentences. Sentences were either preceded by a regular or an irregular musical rhythmic prime. We also assessed participants’ French language level, rhythmic perception abilities, and musical training. In Experiment 1, participants from various L1 backgrounds were recruited. In Experiment 2, only participants with a Latin native language were recruited. For both experiments, grammaticality judgments did not differ after regular versus irregular rhythmic primes. However, grammaticality judgments correlated significantly with rhythmic abilities, suggesting that participants with better rhythm perception were better at grammaticality judgment tasks. Moreover, musicians were better at detecting grammatical errors than those who had not received music training. We also found that the rhythmic priming effect (better grammatical judgments after regular than after irregular rhythms) increased with the number of years of musical training, suggesting that regular rhythmic primes may improve L2 perception in particular for musically trained participants. The results offer promising perspectives on the use of musical rhythmic primes as a means of improving language skills in second language acquisition, and on the potential impact of musical training on language processing.",

          "abstract": "The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its corresponding (partial) area under the curve ([p-]AUC) are frequently used statistical tools in psychological research to assess the discriminability of a test, method, intervention, or procedure. In this paper, we provide a tutorial on how to conduct simulation-based power analyses for ROC curve and (p-)AUC analyses in R. We also created a ShinyApp to perform such power analyses. In our tutorial, we highlight the importance of setting a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) for which researchers want to conduct their power analysis. The SESOI is the smallest effect that is practically or theoretically relevant for a specific field of research or study. We provide how such a SESOI can be established and how it changes hypotheses from simply establishing whether there is a statistically significant effect (i.e., null-hypothesis significance testing) to whether the effects are practically or theoretically important (i.e., minimum-effect testing) or whether the effect is too small to care about (i.e., equivalence testing). We show how power analyses for these different hypothesis tests can be conducted via a confidence interval focused approach. This confidence interval focused simulation-based power analysis can be adapted to different research designs and questions and improves the reproducibility of power analyses.",

          "authors": "Michał Obidziński; Nina Bażela; Mateusz Hohol",
          "abstract": "Despite extensive research on the cognitive basis for mathematical activity, the associations between long-term memory and math skills remain relatively understudied. In our fuzzy-trace theory-driven study, we addressed this issue by investigating the relationships between long-term memory for numbers and prominent math skills, namely approximate number processing, arithmetic fluency, and math reasoning, along with math self-concept. Individuals who performed better in the numerical memory task demonstrated better math reasoning, a higher math self-concept, and were more arithmetically fluent at the general level and in multiplication and division when analyzed separately, but not in addition, subtraction, or approximate number processing. Crucially, our memory task, based on the conjoint recognition model, allowed us to go beyond merely measuring overall performance and, as a result, to test fine-grained memory processes related to two memory traces: verbatim (remembering exact numbers) and gist (remembering a general intuition about a number’s magnitude). While both gist and verbatim processes were associated with different math skills, the associations with gist-based processes were more prominent. On the other hand, even though math self-concept was positively associated with overall numerical memory performance, it correlated significantly only with verbatim-based processes. We discuss our results in relation to the findings of a few previous fuzzy-trace theory-driven studies on mathematical cognition, highlighting discrepancies between them and their possible origins. Overall, our study shows the nuanced role of long-term memory in mathematical skills and demonstrates the power of fuzzy-trace theory in the fine-grained investigation of mathematical cognition.",

Despite their similarity, only half-modulating board produces perceptual change on a test patch. The phenomena are consistent with a network approach, in which color is mediated by a task-dependent selection of spatial scale.",

          "abstract": "Peer review serves to evaluate the scientific validity and quality of research by other researchers within the same field. Psychology, like many other disciplines, uses peer review to determine whether researchers’ work is published, where it is published, and in what form. However, the peer review system is imperfect, often perpetuating harm, exclusion, and inequities. We believe these problems hinder psychology from becoming a truly representative and valid science. In this paper, we uncover the historical roots of the peer review system in psychology and describe how these roots persist today. Then, using personality psychology as an exemplar, we leverage a social justice lens to: (1) document key contemporary problems in the peer review system; (2) identify global challenges in peer review; and (3) provide recommendations and guiding questions that might help the field become more equitable, diverse, just, and inclusive. To do so, we draw upon three sources of information: our personal experiences, qualitative and quantitative data from 104 self-identifying personality psychologists, and the prior literature. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to give voice to those who have been harmed in peer review, and to inform how we might reimagine peer review in personality psychology and beyond.",

Or is this capacity specialized for inferring certain mental states, while struggling with others? Using a novel paradigm, we tested people’s capacity to infer another person’s desires, beliefs, or visual experience across three logically equivalent tasks. Despite the logical equivalence, people were less accurate, slower, and reported expending more effort when inferring the content of others’ visual experience compared to inferring others' beliefs and desires (Experiments 1 and 2; N = 120 U.S. adults and N = 60 U.S. adults). However, additional training rapidly improved people’s capacity to infer others’ visual experience (Experiment 3; N = 60 U.S. adults).

          "authors": "Dustin Fife; Joseph Lee Rodgers",
          "abstract": "The standard undergraduate statistics curriculum, which focuses on testing hypotheses, was first developed a century ago when hand-calculations dominated statistical analysis. While graduate training has advanced somewhat, the undergraduate curriculum has remained relatively unchanged for the last 50-100 years. This situation is particularly troubling when one considers how it fails to prepare students for advanced statistical methods, perpetuates misunderstandings, and masks the underlying logic of statistics. It also is highly limited in its application, leading researchers to shoehorn their analyses into a hypothesis-testing framework. An alternative to the hypothesis-testing framework is one that focuses on building, evaluating, and comparing models. In this paper, we argue that a modeling framework (and an extension of modeling called ‘model comparisons’) highlights the underlying logic of statistics, deepens understanding of the language of statistics, prepares students for advanced procedures, and promotes sound statistical reasoning. We argue for a pedagogical shift away from the hypothesis testing status quo and toward a modeling framework, all while discussing obstacles to such a change and how such obstacles might be (fairly) easily overcome.",

          "authors": "Junsong Lu; Chujun Lin",
          "abstract": "People make a variety of social inferences about others in daily life. Long-standing research suggests that these inferences are captured by a few latent dimensions (e.g., warmth and competence). However, prior work relied on constrained designs (e.g., face images, forced ratings), limiting ecological validity. Others suggest that social inferences are more complex than just a few dimensions could summarize but lack empirical support. Here, we conducted two pre-registered studies to test the high-dimensional properties of social inferences. To maximize generalizability, we computationally sampled diverse naturalistic videos and recruited U.S. representative participants (N = 1,598). Participants freely described people in videos using their own words. Cross-validation identified 25 latent dimensions which explained only 15% of the variance in the data. Alternatively, a sparse network model representing the unique correlations between inferences unreducible to shared latent constructs better represented the data. The network models informed the dynamics of naturalistic inferences, revealing what inferences people tended to make for the same individual and how inferences shifted from concrete to abstract over time (Study 1). The network models also indicated cultural differences in how one social inference was related to another between samples (Study 2, Asian N = 651, European N = 792). Together, these findings show that the high-dimensional network approach provides an alternative, non-mutually exclusive model for understanding the mental representation of social inferences in naturalistic contexts, which provides new insights into the dynamics and diversities of social inferences beyond the static, universal structure found with the low-dimensional latent construct approach.",

          "authors": "Colin Maxwell Bosma",
          "abstract": "Background: The majority of research on emotion regulation processes has been restricted to controlled laboratory settings that use experimental paradigms to investigate short-term outcomes. A true understanding of emotion regulation requires an unobtrusive, ecologically valid assessment of the construct as it occurs in the environment. Digital phenotyping is a novel method for evaluating human behavior in naturalistic settings. \nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate whether smartphone-based digital phenotyping data predicts individual differences in emotion regulation in both in-lab and naturalistic settings.\nMethods: During an in-lab session, unselected university student participants (N = 69) completed self-report questionnaires measuring trait emotion regulation as well as state emotion regulation and state affect following a baseline period, a negative mood induction, and a recovery period. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping data were then collected over the course of a 7-day follow-up. Variation in global positioning system (GPS) distance and mobile power state level were examined as predictors of longitudinal variation in negative affect, emotion regulation, and depression. \nResults: Results showed that variation in GPS distance was significantly associated with variation in state cognitive reappraisal (b = -0.0004, SE = 0.0002, p = .02) and negative state affect (b = 0. 005, SE = 0.002, p = .01) over time. Variation in power state level was also significantly associated with variation in cognitive reappraisal over time (b = -4.98, SE = 1.72, p = .005) and marginally associated with variation in negative state affect (b = -29.58, SE = 16.73, p = .08) over time. Cluster and classification analyses showed both power state level and GPS distance accurately classified two trait emotion regulation clusters with high sensitivity (.95 and .96 respectively) and specificity (.86 and .97 respectively). Variation in power state level and GPS distance together with trait and state emotion regulation did not predict current depressive symptoms (ps &gt; .05).\nConclusions: Overall, the findings provide initial and foundational data on the use of digital phenotyping data in predicting individual differences in state and trait emotion regulation in both in-lab and naturalistic settings. The results suggest that operationalizations of digital phenotyping data and modeling approaches are particularly important factors to consider when implementing digital phenotyping methodology in the study of mental health processes such as emotion regulation.",

A compelling case examined in detail using probability theory concerns the presidencies of Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) and John F. Kennedy (1917–1963).

          "authors": "Isabella Stallworthy; Meriah Lee DeJoseph; Marion I. van den Heuvel; Daniel Berry; Willem Frankenhuis",
          "abstract": "Frameworks are widespread in developmental psychology. They offer general ideas about what to study in human development: which concepts to focus on (e.g., systems, trade-offs), which processes to test (e.g., micro-macro, bidirectional), and which methods to use (e.g., interview, equations). However, despite their prominence, there exists very little consensus or guidance on how to use them in research. As such, frameworks have an obscure role: they influence our research questions, methods, and theory, but often in ways we cannot articulate for ourselves, let alone for others. This paper presents a practical guide for leveraging frameworks to improve developmental research. We suggest that frameworks can guide us through a research project’s “map of conceptual terrain”: which questions to ask and how to study them. We first classify these considerations into topic areas (i.e., “regions”), including assumptions and ideas about timescales and processes of developmental change. We then offer a strategy for charting a “path” through these regions, creating chains of logic to make increasingly specific claims and choices, from framework to research practice. As an illustrative example, we use Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological framework to study parent-child relationships, highlighting its affordances and limitations. We also draw contrast with other prominent frameworks, showcasing how different frameworks can alter a researcher’s path. Our proposed explicit and systematic use of frameworks can serve as a powerful navigation system for building and refining research programs. Thus, our paper provides a guide for developmental scientists to more explicitly use and capitalize on frameworks in their empirical research.",

We propose future research to incorporate placebo controls to examine the efficacy of PM4M and dismantling designs to identify the specific treatment components responsible for its benefits, as well as explore the potential for digital, self-help versions of PM4M to enhance scalability. Additionally, we recommend examining the moderating effects of sociodemographic factors on intervention outcomes to better tailor PM4M for diverse populations. These advancements could improve the scalability, sustainability, and efficacy of PM4M in low-resource settings.",

Ethnographies of 90 historical societies show that group-based dislike (horizontal prejudice) and superiority beliefs (vertical prejudice) were most common in historical state societies. A text analysis of Chinese historical records from 206 BCE to 1911 CE finds that both forms of prejudice towards ethnic minorities intensified when China was unified under a single state compared to when it was divided into smaller regimes.",

          "abstract": "Post-error slowing, described as an error-corrective index of response binding during motor sequence learning, has only been demonstrated in the serial reaction time task under conditions where extrinsic error feedback is presented. The present experiment investigated whether post-error slowing is dependent on, or is influenced by, extrinsic error feedback. Thirty participants (14 females, Mage = 21.9  1.8 years) completed the serial reaction time task with or without presentation of extrinsic error feedback.  Post-error slowing was observed following response error whether feedback was presented or not. However, presentation of extrinsic error feedback increased post-error slowing across practice and extended the number of responses that were slowed following an error.  There was no evidence of feedback effects on motor sequence learning or explicit awareness.  Instead, feedback appeared to function as a performance factor that reduced response error rates relative to no feedback conditions.  These findings illustrate that post-error slowing in motor sequence learning is not reliant on or a result of presentation of extrinsic error information.  More specific to the serial reaction time task paradigm, the present findings demonstrate that the common practice of presenting error feedback is not necessary for investigating motor sequence learning unless the aim is to maintain low error rate. However, doing so might inflate reaction time in latter training blocks.",

          "abstract": "Theories of cognitive development rely on implicit or explicit causal assumptions from developmental data. While powerful in their attempt to account for within-individual developmental change, causally testing such theories is difficult. One method for enhancing our knowledge might be to look for exogenous changes affecting mainly some cognitive abilities and to observe the developmental outcomes over further abilities. Focal cortical lesions sustained in childhood represent one informative instance of such changes. Here we test the implications of theories of cognitive development by studying a sample of 464 individuals who suffered focal cortical lesion in childhood to either the right frontal or right temporal lobes. Children had follow-up cognitive assessments done 8.5 years later. The key findings showed sustained long-term deficits in fluid abilities, but no developmental cascade of a reduction in abilities over time. Suffering a lesion to the right frontal cortex, despite causing a drop in fluid or abstract intelligence, does not transfer over to crystallized or knowledge-based abilities over development. The implication is that there is no transfer between these abilities when an exogeneous change affects early fluid ability. These results can be seen as powerful for testing developmental theories of cognition against their causal assumptions.",

          "abstract": "Recent years have seen growing interest in field research using randomized designs to evaluate the impacts of diverse interventions on early child development and education. Measuring these impacts requires assessments that can track development prior to school entry. We propose a novel approach using research from developmental cognitive science: targeting five areas of core knowledge—language, numeracy, spatial reasoning, mental state reasoning, and executive function—that have been found to emerge across cultures in infancy and predict later performance on related skills in adulthood. Using tasks based on experimental paradigms developed in lab settings, we tested 1256 Ghanaian children (centering on four age groups at 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5 years), whose parent previously took part in a randomized controlled field experiment on secondary education. Here we investigate the sensitivity and specificity of these tasks. We ask whether these core knowledge tasks 1) produce responses from Ghanaian children that are internally consistent and above chance, 2) relate to performance on other similar tasks within the same cognitive domain, and 3) are stable over time and predict future performance. We find that the assessment battery captures individual differences in the older tested age groups (3.5 years and above), in the domains of language, numeracy, spatial reasoning, and executive functioning, but not for infants or for tests of mental state reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that experimental methods designed to study core knowledge in infancy can be used track individual differences in children’s cognitive development.",

This paper introduces mlmpower, an R package designed to simplify Monte Carlo power analysis for multilevel models. The package accommodates various model specifications, including cross-level interactions, random slopes, and within-cluster and between-cluster predictors. Unlike other methods, which often require a pilot study or extensive prior data, mlmpower uses intuitive effect size metrics to simulate data and estimate power with confidence intervals. Inspired by ggplot2, the package's syntax allows for modular model building, making it accessible even to researchers with minimal simulation experience. Additionally, mlmpower supports including missing data mechanisms, offering more realistic power estimates for longitudinal and cross-sectional studies.",

          "authors": "Haena Kim; Alicia Liu; Yuan Chang Leong",
          "abstract": "Perceptual judgments are often influenced by goals and preferences, resulting in biased judgements that deviate from objective reality. When presented with ambiguous images, observers are biased to report seeing images associated with rewards. However, it remains unclear whether this is driven by a bias toward stimuli that people are motivated to see (i.e., desirability) or stimuli that are motivationally significant (i.e., relevance). As rewards are both desirable and motivationally relevant, these effects are not easily dissociated in a reward context. This study investigates the effects of desirability and relevance on perceptual judgments in an aversive context involving financial losses. Across two experiments conducted between 2023-2024, participants completed a visual categorization task where ambiguous stimuli were associated with a large financial loss. Participants’ perceptual judgments were biased away from stimuli associated with the loss, indicating a desirability bias. Drift diffusion model analyses revealed that this bias was due to a shift in the starting point of evidence accumulation, such that participants required more evidence to commit to a response associated with an undesirable outcome. The bias in starting point correlated with individual differences in punishment sensitivity but not reward sensitivity, highlighting how individual traits shape motivational effects on perceptual decisions. Results replicated across an in-lab sample and a larger online sample. Altogether, our study provides robust evidence of a desirability bias in perceptual decisions involving financial losses, identifying both the computational mechanisms and trait-level differences that influence how people decide what they see when faced with the prospect of undesirable outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Long COVID remains a pressing health concern among Americans, with current data suggesting that 45% of those infected by COVID-19 experience at least one symptom of Long COVID. Veterans are a particularly at-risk population due to their unique demographic characteristics and lived experiences. Despite this, there has been a lack of treatment development for Long COVID that targets mental health symptoms and is veteran-specific. There is a need for effective treatments to help veterans cope with a Long COVID diagnosis and recovery. This quality improvement project aims to gain insight into the lived experiences and mental health needs of veterans with Long COVID to help inform future treatment development. A sample of 21 veterans (57% Male, 67% Black, 43% Hispanic) participated in qualitative interviews where they were asked 23 questions about their experiences living with Long COVID and seeking medical treatment, as well as their ongoing mental health needs. Qualitative data was extracted from these interviews and analyzed. Four main themes were identified: interpersonal concerns and challenges with social interaction; difficulties with day-to-day living; barriers and facilitators to accessing medical treatment; and mental health effects and attitudes towards psychotherapy. Veterans described significant impairments in functioning, as well as feelings of isolation and loneliness. These findings demonstrate the need for a psychotherapeutic intervention that can facilitate interpersonal connection, improve functioning, and decrease psychiatric symptoms.",

While clinical expertise could offer a valuable perspective on this theory and its applications, little is known about mental health professionals´ attitudes. In an online survey, mental health professionals rated their agreement with propositions of the network theory and evaluated the acceptability and appropriateness of possible applications. The 257 participating mental health professionals largely agreed with the network theory’s proposition regarding the phenomenology of mental disorders and regarding treatment effects. Appraisal of the network theory regarding the aetiology, regarding important treatment targets and regarding acceptability and appropriateness of possible applications was mixed. A background in cognitive behavioural therapy, and previous knowledge of the network theory were positively associated with agreement. The core assumptions of the network approach seem to resonate with mental health professionals, while consequences for the diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders were questioned.",

          "abstract": "Prior knowledge has long been known to influence retention of newly learned information. In particular, known semantic associations across items facilitate subsequent retrieval for these items. However, whether distinct forms of semantic relations vary in the influence they exert on memory remains unclear. We took inspiration from the field of concepts and categories and compared two major types of semantic relations between concepts: taxonomic (e.g., dog-bird) and thematic (e.g., dog-leash) relations. In Experiment 1, we show that cued recall for word pairs with thematic relations was faster and more accurate, followed by pairs with taxonomic relations and finally unrelated pairs. We hypothesized that thematically related words are more quickly and more accurately retrieved because they are more accessible in one’s semantic memory. To test this, we designed a second experiment where participants encoded word pairs of the same relations as in Experiment 1 and completed a forced-choice associative memory test with options sharing different semantic relations to the cue. In addition to corroborating the findings of Experiment 1, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants were more prone to incorrectly guessing a thematic alternative. We conclude that thematic relations outperform taxonomic relations in driving memory performance and speculate that this may result from their dominance in organizing episodic memory.",

Less well understood is how temperament traits co-develop from adolescence to young adulthood. We characterized how trajectories of effortful control, frustration, affiliation, and shyness in adolescence to formed multi-trajectory groups. As these groups could provide novel information about pathways to psychopathology, we examined their associations with adulthood psychopathology and polygenic risk scores (PRS). Participants were drawn from a larger longitudinal cohort (N=1412). Effortful control, frustration, affiliation, and shyness were measured four times from ages 10-23. Adulthood internalizing, externalizing, and alcohol problems were measured at ages 24-27. PRS with continuous shrinkage priors were calculated. Group-based multi-trajectory analyses showed a five-group model fit best, including high-risk, undercontrolled, low-risk, overcontrolled, and low affiliation groups that differed on both the levels and slopes of temperament traits over time. We found specific linkages between the low affiliation group and problematic alcohol use, the high-risk group and depression symptoms, and the high-risk and undercontrolled groups with externalizing problems. The undercontrolled group showed the highest, and overcontrolled the lowest, externalizing PRS scores. Findings shed light on developmental patterns of temperament in adolescence-to-adulthood and unique combinations of temperament trajectories with specific linkages to etiologic factors and psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Despite the last decade’s development of optogenetic methods for artificially manipulating engrams, and subsequent claims that there is a consensus that memories are stored in ensembles of synaptic connections, it remains unclear to what degree there truly is unanimity within the neuroscientific community about the neurophysiological basis of long-term memory. We surveyed 312 neuroscientists, comprising one cohort of experts on engram research and another of general neuroscientists, to assess this community’s views on how memories are stored. While 70.5% of participants agreed that long-term memories are primarily maintained by neuronal connectivity patterns and synaptic strengths, there was no clear consensus on which specific neurophysiological features or scales are critical for memory storage. Despite this, the median probability estimate that any long-term memories could potentially be extracted from a static snapshot of brain structure was around 40%, which was also the estimate for whether a successful whole brain emulation could theoretically be created from the structure of a preserved brain. When predicting the future feasibility of whole brain emulation, the median participant estimated this would be achieved for C. elegans around 2045, mice around 2065, and humans around 2125. Notably, neither research background nor expertise level significantly influenced views on whether memories could be extracted from brain structure alone. Our findings suggest that while most neuroscientists believe memories are stored in structural features of the brain, fundamental questions about the precise physical basis of memory storage remain unresolved. These findings have important implications for both theoretical neuroscience and the development of technologies aimed at preserving or extracting memory-related information.",

Two relevant forms of such thinking are Theory of Mind (ToM) that enables us to represent others’ perspectives, and Mental Time Travel (MTT) that enables us to represent other points in time. The present studies investigate how these capacities are related in development. Do they build on the same cognitive foundations and thus emerge together? Do higher-order forms of the two abilities rely on analogous recursive embedding and thus progress in parallel and coordinated ways? We addressed these questions in four studies with 3- to 9-year-old children (N = 395). ToM was operationalized as first-, second-, and third-order false belief understanding. MTT was operationalized as reasoning about future possibilities (first-order), counterfactual reasoning (second-order) and anticipating counterfactual emotions (third-order). Study 1 shows a stepwise development of both ToM and MTT and a moderate consistency of performance patterns. However, across all four studies, we did not find robust correlations between first-, second- and third-order tasks of ToM and MTT, respectively. Overall, these results show stepwise and parallel trajectories in ToM and MTT, but do not provide stringent evidence for a joint cognitive foundation of the two capacities.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study aims at improving dropout and treatment non-response prevention by optimizing the performance of models for their prediction through the integration of item-level data. Method: Routine data from 1277 patients (M = 36.95, SD = 13.64; 64.77% female) treated at [masked version] was used to train and evaluate 20 machine-learning algorithms. Measures included sociodemographic information, Outcome Questionnaire-30 (OQ-30), Questionnaire for the Evaluation of Psychotherapy (FEP–2), Emotional Well-Being Questionnaire (EMO), Symptom Checklist (SCL–90–R), and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32). Model training was conducted using nested cross-validation, and five ensemble models were formed to enhance predictions by combining algorithms based on performance and correlation metrics. Final predictions were evaluated in a holdout sample, with predictor scores at total, item, and combined levels. Results: A model using item-level data achieved the highest performance for dropout prediction (F1-score = 0.87, Brier score = 0.0529, balanced accuracy = 0.88) in a holdout sample. For treatment non-response, an ensemble model trained on item-level data provided the best results (F1-score = 0.60, Brier score = 0.1646, balanced accuracy = 0.72). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the clinical value of using item-level data to enhance predictive modeling for dropout and treatment non-response. Integrating such models into clinical feedback systems could help identify at-risk patients and reduce dropout and non–response rates.\nKeywords: dropout, treatment non-response, prevention, machine learning, prediction.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception remains challenging for cochlear-implant recipients in conditions containing background noise. Modifications to the sound processing strategy could improve the transmission of information by the cochlear implant, alleviating speech perception difficulties in noise. One such modification, the temporal integrator processing strategy (TIPS), uses a model of temporal masking to identify and remove stimulation pulses that are unlikely to be perceived. In a previous investigation, TIPS significantly improved the perception of CIS-processed speech in the presence of speech-shaped noise (Lamping et al. 2020). This study extends the previous investigation to include conditions that better reflect everyday listening through two pre-registered double-blind within-participant experiments. The first experiment tested speech perception with CIS and TIPS and found that speech intelligibility in speech-shaped and multi-talker noise was unaffected by TIPS processing, although TIPS-processed stimuli achieved slightly lower quality ratings than their CIS counterparts in quiet (p = 0.044). The second experiment compared TIPS to ACE and found that both speech intelligibility in a multi-talker noise and speech quality ratings in quiet were unaffected by TIPS processing. Given that TIPS removes a substantial number of stimulation pulses, TIPS was estimated to result in net power savings between 22% and 42%, without compromising speech perception in the presence of background noise.",

Social interaction is, thus, both an antecedent and a consequence of empowerment. In Western societies, an emerging awareness that aging has become associated with  a loss of empowerment has motivated efforts to better address this necessity in older adults. In this context, we created an innovative cognitive stimulation tool, where exercises are created by the users themselves as an alternative form of stimulation. After a period of intense dissemination in geriatric institutions, we encountered lower-than-expected levels of engagement. To understand whether this could be due to lack of material and human resources and/or lack of awareness regarding empowerment needs, we carried out semi-structured interviews with older adults and coordinating technicians in institutions. We found evidence that supported both a scenario of scarce institutional resources (“no time”) and a lack of awareness of empowerment needs, especially among older adults (“no need”).

          "abstract": "In studies of event-related brain potentials (ERPs), it is common practice to exclude participants for having too few trials for analysis to ensure adequate score reliability (i.e., internal consistency). However, in research involving clinical samples, the impact of increasingly rigorous reliability standards on factors such as sample generalizability, patient vs. control effect sizes, and effect sizes for within-group correlations with external variables is unclear. This study systematically evaluated whether different ERP reliability cutoffs impacted these factors in psychosis. Error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) were assessed during a modified flanker task in 97 patients with psychosis and 104 healthy comparison participants, who also completed measures of cognition and psychiatric symptoms. ERP reliability cutoffs had notably different effects on the factors considered. A recommended reliability cutoff of .80 resulted in sample bias due to systematic exclusion of patients with relatively few task errors, lower reported psychiatric symptoms, and higher levels of cognitive functioning. ERP score reliability lower than .80 resulted in generally smaller between- and within-group effect sizes, likely misrepresenting effect sizes. Imposing rigorous ERP reliability standards in studies of psychotic disorders might exclude high-functioning patients, which raises important considerations for the generalizability of clinical ERP research.",

Although individuals can monitor and report their own attentional state, it remains unclear whether these self-reports are primarily driven by estimation of performance or external cues. In this study, sixty-one participants completed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task in which they made binary choices to maximize monetary rewards. Due to the probabilistic nature of the task, participants could make accurate choices, such as selecting the option most likely to yield a reward, yet still observe a negative outcome. During task performance, participants rated their attentiveness at random intervals using a visual analogue scale. Using Bayesian regression analysis and computational reinforcement learning model, we found that self-reported attention was more strongly influenced by external outcomes (reward delivery) than by task performance estimates. Furthermore, we examined the causal association between task performance and the experience of attentiveness. Time-lagged analysis suggested that attentiveness ratings did not predict future performance, and rather were only influenced by reward history.  These findings suggest that individuals may rely more on external cues, such as rewards, rather than internal assessments of performance when reporting their level of attention.",

Another geometrical figure imposed on another background image was also repeatedly presented but never paired with the shock, making it a safety stimulus (a CS-). After a ~three-hour delay interval containing either a two-hour nap opportunity or an equivalent amount of time spent awake, participants performed a fear memory and generalization test. Here, participants viewed four different stimuli: the CS+ and CS- seen before, as well as two novel stimuli composed of the same two geometrical figures seen before imposed on novel background images. This design allowed us to examine a) whether sleep consolidates the original fear memory and b) whether sleep affects the degree of generalization of fear learning to when the originally fear-eliciting stimulus is presented in a novel context. Results revealed no group differences for either the consolidation or generalization of fear learning in either of our outcome measures (skin conductance responses, subjective ratings of unpleasantness, shock expectancy ratings, or explicit memory performance). Previous work on the effect of sleep on consolidation and generalization of fear learning has revealed mixed findings and there is currently limited evidence for sleep having an effect in either direction.",

          "abstract": "Accurate assessment of societal change relies on robust metrics, yet the reliability of commonly used indicators is uncertain. We conducted an expert-elicitation-guided (n = 24) comprehensive audit of 99 indicators—including 37 pre-selected and 62 expert-nominated markers—across key domains such as climate, economy, public health, and peace/war. Each indicator was evaluated based on definability, quantifiability, data availability, global representativeness, transparency, and temporal resolution. Our audit revealed that only 29.7% of pre-selected indicators and 32.3% of expert-suggested indicators met all quality criteria. Furthermore, the perceived importance of a domain was inversely related to the quality of its available indicators. Moreover, direct measures tended to score higher in quality than composite indices. These findings highlight significant gaps in the metrics used to track societal change, raising concerns about the data informing policy and public understanding. We underscore the need to develop more precise, transparent, globally representative, temporally precise indicators to effectively assess human progress.",

          "abstract": "Background: Reliable and specific biomarkers that can distinguish Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from commonly co-occurring Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are lacking, causing misses and delays in diagnosis, and reducing access to interventions and quality of life. Aims: To examine whether an innovative, brief (one-minute), videogame method called Computerised Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) can identify ASD-specific imitation differences compared to neurotypical and ADHD children. Method: This cross-sectional study used CAMI alongside standardised parent-report (SRS-2) and observational measures of autism (ADOS-2), ADHD (Conners), and motor ability (PANESS). Sample included a total of 183 children aged 7-13 years who had ADHD (without ASD), had ASD (with ADHD: ASD+ADHD, and without ADHD: ASD-only), and were neurotypical. Results: Regardless of co-occurring ADHD, ASD children showed poorer CAMI performance than neurotypical children (p&lt;.0001, Adjusted R2=.28), whereas ADHD and neurotypical children showed similar CAMI performance. Receiver Operating Curve and Support Vector Machine analyses showed that CAMI distinguishes ASD from both NT (80% true positive rate) and ADHD children (70% true positive rate) with a high success rate significantly above chance. Among autistic children, poor CAMI performance was associated with increased autism traits, particularly ADOS measures of social affect and restricted and repetitive behaviours (Adjusted R2=.23), but not with ADHD traits or motor ability. Conclusions: Four levels of analyses – diagnostic group comparisons, dimensional associations, and classification metrics based on Receiver Operating Curve and Support Vector Machine – confirm that poor imitation measured by the low-cost and scalable CAMI method specifically distinguishes ASD not only from neurotypical development but also from commonly co-occurring ADHD.",

Currently, there are no studies in the establishment of reliability and validity, and factor of measures of conduct disorder among adolescents in India.Objective/Aim: The present study aimed to develop the CDS-CSR and validate the reliability and validity of the scale on the given sample.Method: A Scale of 50 items in the self-report and 12 items in the clinician report scale was developed wherein the items of the scale were decided based on the symptoms &amp; behavioral problems covered under diagnostic guidelines of CD. Subsequently, purposive sampling of 250 juvenile offenders, 84% boys and 16% girls (10–18 years old), with a range of conduct associated with the problem, were administered by a Clinical Psychologist. Result:The internal consistency and inter-rater reliability was found to be significant for clinician and self report subscale of CDS- CSR. In addition, the content correctness index and the face validity of 0.83 &amp; 0.87 was established respectively. The findings suggest that the measures are useful instruments for assessing sexual behavior, disruptive behavior, the environment's effect, and personality problems in children and adolescents. Conclusion:With positive and reversed scoring, the CDS-CSR is a 5-point Likert scale that includes 50 self-report items and 12 clinician report items in a diagnostic index.

          "authors": "Peter Haehner; Amanda Jo Wright; Michael Dominik Krämer; Wiebke Bleidorn",
          "abstract": "Life events have been theorized to cause personality trait changes. However, people differ in their personality trait trajectories after experiencing important life events. Although several studies have examined the sources of these individual differences, a replicable set of variables explaining individual differences in the reaction to major life events has yet to be identified. In a systematic literature review (Study 1), we integrated existing evidence on potentially important moderators of event-related changes in the Big Five personality traits (23 studies, Ntotal = 82,374). This review showed that (1) only a limited set of moderators has been linked to individual differences in event-related personality trait changes so far, and (2) that there are vast differences in the methods used to examine these effects across studies, complicating meta-analytical integration. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a coordinated data analysis (Study 2), generating novel and robust evidence for associations between a broad set of psychological, demographic, event-related, and contextual characteristics and event-related personality trait changes. Across eight large-scale panel studies (Ntotal = 90,934, Nobs = 391,024), we found several replicable moderators of event-related personality changes. For example, age and psychological variables such as life satisfaction moderated personality trait changes across datasets. Even though the effect sizes of the moderators were (very) small (bMedian = 0.007, ΔR2Median = 0.16%), the findings of the coordinated data analysis contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of event-related personality change, critical for the advancement of contemporary personality development theories.",

          "authors": "Zijian Yang",
          "abstract": "The relationship between the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and individual mental health remains debated. To address this, the present study introduces CAR variability across multiple days as a novel indicator, aiming to resolve inconsistencies in prior findings often caused by situational factors affecting the traditional mean CAR measure. We investigate the association between CAR variability and both trait anxiety and psychological resilience. In Experiment 1, we reduced CAR variability by minimizing sleep efficiency variation under natural sleep conditions, finding a significant positive correlation between CAR variability and trait anxiety scores. This suggests that lower CAR variability in stable conditions correlates with lower trait anxiety. In Experiment 2, CAR variability was increased through total sleep deprivation, revealing a significant positive correlation between CAR variability and psychological resilience. This indicates that greater CAR variability in dynamic conditions corresponds with higher psychological resilience. In contrast, CAR mean levels across both experiments showed no significant associations with either trait anxiety or psychological resilience. These findings suggest that, beyond mean CAR levels, CAR variability may serve as a more effective physiological indicator of mental health. Considering CAR variability across multiple days is crucial for understanding how individuals adapt to daily life stressors and challenges, providing new perspectives and potential avenues for promoting mental health and developing effective intervention strategies.",

          "abstract": "Decisions made by millions of refugees about where to go, how to make a living and how to secure a future are fundamental drivers of secondary movements. While a substantial body of literature addresses factors contributing to migrants’ decision-making, a comprehensive understanding of the central role of refugees in secondary mobility decision-making, including agency and strategies employed, remains underexplored. This is partly due to the belief that refugees are constrained by external and structural factors and cannot exercise agency, which we challenge. This article provides a systematic analysis of the literature on refugees’ secondary mobility decision-making processes. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, it presents an in-depth analysis of 40 peer?reviewed, English-language research articles selected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases published before September 2022. The article critically examines the drivers, prevailing dichotomies and conceptual frameworks surrounding refugee categorization, agency, and mobility. By synthesizing a wide range of literature, our paper presents emerging alternative concepts and \nframeworks that shed light on the complex dynamics of decision-making",

This article explains why political and societal elites\nacross world regions have confidence or lack confidence in the ICC. We present the results from\na unique survey of 722 elite respondents conducted from 2017 to 2019 across six countries:\nBrazil, Germany, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, and the United States. We furthermore\nenrich our analysis by using public opinion data to draw comparisons between elites and the\ngeneral public. The analyses reveal that the views of elites are most consistently related to\ntheir perceptions of other, more well-known international organizations and their country’s\nrelationship with the ICC.

          "authors": "Matthew J. A. Craig",
          "abstract": "Many social media platforms today are driven by content filtering algorithms that personalize their recommendations based on the individual user. Through nuanced interactions with the platform, such as human-algorithm interplay, the end user effortlessly cultivates a social media feed. While this level of personalization can greatly benefit the user, recommended ads and content sometimes resemble aspects of the user's private lives that they may not have wanted the algorithm or platform to know. Moreover, though users show to dislike these experiences of privacy violations, they still engage in disclosure of private information with the system due to fatigue in managing online privacy altogether. This current study integrates Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002) into the human-algorithm interaction context to examine to what extent social media users (N = 1,305) allow co-ownership of private information with their algorithm depending on their felt privacy fatigue. Results from using latent moderated structural equations (LMS) suggest that individuals’ algorithmic literacy significantly predicts their willingness to allow co-ownership of private information with social media algorithms. Additionally, contrary to previous literature, greater algorithmic awareness leads to less co-ownership for those most fatigued. Considering these findings, implications for future research for human-machine communication privacy management are discussed.",

We develop a game-theoretic model where an interest group can lobby a politician while learning about their ideological alignment. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tradeoff: interest groups must balance gathering information against exerting immediate influence, while politicians strategically manage their reputations to shape future interactions. These strategic forces generate systematic dynamics: policies and transfers shift in tandem, with early-career politicians showing greater policy variance and extracting larger rents through reputation management than veterans. Uncertainty about alignment increases policy volatility as groups experiment with offers, while institutional features like committee power and revolving-door incentives systematically alter both learning incentives and influence strategies. Our results shed new light on how interest group influence evolves across political careers and varies with institutional context.",

Fifty-one participants (70.37% female; Mean Age = 24.6) took part in six online focus groups, viewing two randomly selected deepfakes of deceased artists. Thematic analysis, using a phenomenological approach, identified primarily intellectual reactions, with two key layers: first-order evaluations of realism and second-order societal impact assessments. These impacts spanned micro (individuals), meso (content creators/distributors), and macro (society-wide) levels. While cognitive and ethical concerns were prominent, emotional responses were fewer, often expressing discomfort or surprise.

          "abstract": "This research applies Uses and Gratifications theory to examine individual motivations for sharing or not sharing deepfakes. After characterizing popular deepfakes in five genres (two examples each), 1035 US participants (42% female; Age: M = 42.8, SD = 14.1, Mdn = 41, Range = 18–93) watched one of the ten deepfakes and completed a questionnaire in Prolific. Results show that most participants would not share the deepfakes due to a lack of personal relevance. However, those who did intend to share them had hedonistic motivations, mostly enjoyment and the desire to share entertainment with others. The genre of these deepfakes also influenced motivations to share, with political deepfakes being a particularly specific case, and one where gender also had a greater impact. Women avoid sharing inaccurate information to a greater extent and men are more inclined to protect their image in social circles. Overall, this research highlights how audiences dynamically relate to deepfakes and offers insights into the psychological aspects of their relationships with this emerging media form. It also underscores the significance of the perceived entertainment value of deepfakes in their virality.",

An unsupervised machine learning algorithm and a theoretical framework jointly identified abnormal behaviour, revealing that 11.25% of users exhibited confirmed inorganic behaviour. This indicates coordinated inauthentic behaviour, a common feature of disinformation campaigns, though the study does not explore any direct connection to RT or the Russian government.

It provides an overview of recent advancements, outlines possible future scenarios, and examines the opportunities and challenges that AI introduces to the field. Opportunities include substantial gains in productivity across the research process: notably in data analysis, visualisation, and dissemination. Researchers could thus spend more time focusing on research and less time on administrative or repetitive tasks. Other opportunities include using AI algorithms to analyse the increasing vastness of data obtained in surveys; using AI to improve prediction; and efficiency gains in survey or experimental design/deployment. Challenges include the potential for a vast increase in low-quality publications, especially if academic incentives remain misaligned toward quantity rather than quality of research outputs, as well as the broader existential risks AI may pose. We also include a list of resources and additional reading. This brief was written jointly by the authors; readers can compare with briefs entirely written by Generative AI (GenAI) systems, and listen to an AI generated podcast based on this brief here: https://osf.io/ew6z8/.

          "abstract": "A four-phase Hackathon of Educational Materials was constructed to enable instructors to take existing course materials and integrate, rather than concatenate, new content and activities. The \"integrate, not concatenate\" (InC) approach was pilot tested utilizing the Hackathon, with ethical reasoning content and activities to be integrated into courses in degree programs for mathematics, statistics, operations research, and data science in one undergraduate department. The InC Hackathon of Educational Materials phases for ethical reasoning coverage were: Hack 1 (H1): Take published learning outcomes about ethical reasoning and choose one or more that would be feasible in your course; Hack 2 (H2): Utilizing the learning outcomes of your specific course, determine if any can be revised to include “ethics” ideas, and whether the syllabus communicates value for/importance of ethical practice; Hack 3 (H3): Determine where in the course (syllabus) the learning outcomes created in H1–H2 fit best; and Hack 4 (H4): Design or revise assignments that will inform learners and instructors about whether the new/hacked learning outcomes (H1-H3) were achieved. The InC Hackathon of Educational Materials was scheduled over 1- and 2-hour blocks over three days totaling 8 hours during one week. Real-time feedback was collected in terms of clarity and feasibility of each Hack, and after the end of the Hackathon. Originally planned for 4-5 instructors working on one course, 14 instructors participated in some or all portions of the Hackathon, working on integrating ethical reasoning content into seven courses within three academic programs. All participants identified ethical content to integrate and worked to ensure that their courses would integrate different material and activities. Courses in sequence within an academic program were also hacked to introduce ethical content early, and develop more sophistication in later courses. Each program was able to develop achievable learning objectives for ethics content in each of the courses, and these were sequenced to support student growth throughout their program. After the Hackathon, participants deemed it feasible and clear, and all participants achieved the objectives of Hacks 1-3, but there was insufficient time to complete the work in Hack 4. More time was felt and demonstrated to be needed, as well as orientation by leadership at the start.  Additional time at the end of the Hackathon should be dedicated to curriculum-wide alignment of the results of the hacks. This InC pilot was an empirical demonstration of a coherent, reproducible framework for making systemic and systematic changes to higher education curricula.",

          "authors": "Zofia C. Stanley; Chad M. Topaz",
          "abstract": "Opportunity youth—individuals aged 16 to 24 who are disconnected from education and employment due to significant barriers—constitute a sizable yet underserved demographic whose marginalization leads to substantial social and economic costs. This paper demonstrates how data science can be harnessed for social good by mapping the distribution of opportunity youth across different regions. We develop an Opportunity Youth Index by integrating fragmented data from sources such as the American Community Survey, the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, FBI Crime Data, and Bureau of Justice Statistics incarceration reports. Focusing on four key indicators—disconnected youth, youth in foster care, justice-impacted youth, and children with an incarcerated parent—we employ statistical methods and computational techniques to estimate local concentrations of opportunity youth. The resulting index provides insights for policymakers and community organizations, highlighting areas where targeted interventions can make the most impact. This work illustrates the potential of data science to address complex social issues and is presented in an accessible manner to engage a younger audience.",

          "abstract": "Passport inequality is more than a simple logistical inconvenience; it is a fundamental injustice that \nundermines the principles of equality and fairness upon which academia should be built. Scholars from the Global South often face daunting challenges when obtaining visas for research and conference travel.  Lengthy and arduous visa application processes, exorbitant fees, and arbitrary rejection decisions are just a few hurdles they must navigate simply to participate in academic conferences or conduct research abroad. These barriers not only impede individual academic endeavors but also perpetuate systemic inequalities within the global academic community. Drawing from our own personal experiences, we discuss mobility barriers, exposing their structural, institutional, and personal dimensions. We call for a reflexive approach in IR to counteract apathy and the illusory sense of equality in academic practices and offer policy solutions to promote a more inclusive and equitable academic community.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Sanni Välimäki",
          "abstract": "Over the past decades, attitudes toward mothers’ roles have become more gender-egalitarian. There has been a concurrent increase in early childhood education and care (ECEC) participation rates across Europe. However, inequality in ECEC usage has remained. The main reason for the inequality has been found to be problems with accessing the service but it is argued that attitudes toward mother’s role possible also play a role in it. This article examines the relationship between attitudes and ECEC usage at two points in time: 2008 and 2017. The article uses two data, EU-SILC and EVS, and the method multilevel logistic regression. The analysis considers both country-level and individual-level connections, reflecting on ECEC usage. The findings indicate an association between increasingly egalitarian attitudes and rising ECEC participation rates. As attitudes among less educated individuals change more slowly, their impact on ECEC usage could become more significant, particularly concerning inequality in ECEC usage. This is evident in the cross-level interaction between overall attitudes and mothers’ education in predicting ECEC participation among children under three years old. The disparity in ECEC usage between the less educated and those with higher levels of education is growing.",

          "authors": "MOBILE - Center of Excellence for Global Mobility Law; Amalie Ravn Weinrich",
          "abstract": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has established one of the most \ncomprehensive free movement regimes. By declaring West Africa a borderless region, the \norganisation affirms the right of free movement for all citizens of member states. Nevertheless, \nsignificant obstacles to securing this right persist, resulting in difficulties moving across the region. \nThese challenges are particularly prevalent for female migrants. Studies on free movement within \nWest Africa reveal that widespread corruption, border harassment, and bureaucratic inefficiencies \nseverely restrict female migration opportunities. However, current scholarship inadequately \naddresses the interrelation between regional mobility law, infrastructures, and female migration. This \narticle argues that a fundamental issue within the ECOWAS free movement regime is ensuring access \nto mobility infrastructures. It examines the gendered dimensions of access to mobility infrastructures \nfrom the perspective of ECOWAS officials. Mobility infrastructures are conceptualised as comprising \nlegal, physical, and technological components that collectively facilitate or restrict movement. The \nanalysis draws on documentary evidence and insights from 19 semi-structured interviews with \nECOWAS Commission officials. It shows that access to mobility infrastructures is predominantly \ndetermined by embedded gender norms, laws, and practices. By analysing accounts from officials \ninvolved in constructing the free movement regime, the article provides unique insights into the \ndisparities between institutional intentions, legal frameworks, and mobility trajectories. In doing so, \nit contributes to research on free movement in West Africa, mobility infrastructures, and the emerging scholarship on legal infrastructures.",

Through semi-structured interviews, this study explores the dynamics of the digital divide and the perceptions and experiences of undergraduate students in Bangladesh in ICT education and learning. The findings indicate that, despite the significant impact of the digital divide, caused by multifaceted socioeconomic inequality, ICT education has largely failed to provide students with essential digital skills. This article emphasizes the need for an effective learning environment that prioritizes three interconnected dimensions: equal access, resources, and digital literacy. By examining the interplay between digital divides and the imperative of integrating e-learning into pedagogical strategies, this study contributes to the field of educational policy and technology. Ultimately, this article advocates a digitally inclusive and student-centred digital learning environment in the technology-poor setting of higher education in Bangladesh.",

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of all WoS-indexed journals (N=21,886), focusing on the type of organisations that are officially attached to publishing the journals, either alone or together. We also investigate the disciplinary, geographical and linguistic diversity, and the key bibliometric characteristics, of journals (co)published by different types of organisations. By augmenting WoS metadata with a custom classification concerning organisational information about the journals publishing and governing organisations available through the International ISSN Centre, this study provides a larger and more detailed analysis than has been available so far. Our results show that 66% of journals are published by a sole organisation type (professional, research organisation, society), and 34% respectively are published through combinations of these different organisation types. The most common form of collaboration was a professional publisher with a scholarly society as the collaborative organisation.",

          "abstract": "Our starting point is to challenge the often-made assumption that large cities are so complex that they have become ungovernable or that globalization pressures make political and policy choices irrelevant. By going beyond rational or positivist views of governance, it argues that the process of governing a city is never fully complete, nor linear. The paper refers to a systematic review of the academic literature. Urban societies are more or less governed and that may change from one city to the next, from one period to the next. Processes of government and governance are always work in progress, but make crucial differences over time. Case studies show that modes of governance have long-term consequences for their inhabitants and governing failures may have severe negative effects (e.g. housing shortages, low levels of educational attainment, crime, low productivity, health). The systematic analysis of the literature shows the need to describe and document at the same time (1) how processes of governance operate in relation to major urban development projects, the implementation of public policies and (2) the implications of such practices for inequalities; so to say articulating an analysis of the governance processes and their outcomes. The paper suggests that the link between metropolitan governance and inequalities allow considering inequalities not only as the outcomes of policy choices, but also as part of the way in which metropolitan policies are implemented.",

          "authors": "Sho Miyazaki",
          "abstract": "Do voters ``signal'' their decisions by voting early, or do they ``snipe'' by casting their votes at the last minute?  In transparent sequential roll call voting, such as in the U.S. House of Representatives, voters can strategically choose when to cast their votes. This contrasts with the U.S. Senate's sequential voting, where the order is exogenously determined, or private simultaneous voting, as typically seen in elections. Despite the significance of these roll call votes in high-stakes decision-making, the potential for strategic behavior based on vote timing remains underexplored. This paper examines the causal effect of transparent sequential voting on voter decision timing, leveraging a natural experiment from roll call votes in a crypto startup (DAO), which transitioned from private one-stage voting to transparent sequential voting. I collected a dataset of individual-level voting records, delegated voting power, and precise vote timing. First, the fixed-effect regression analysis reveals that introducing a public tally in transparent sequential voting increases the likelihood of early voting (signaling) or last-minute voting (sniping) compared to the baseline of private simultaneous voting. This finding is consistent with game-theoretic predictions. Additionally, interaction models show that more pivotal voters, measured by the Shapley-Shubik index, are more likely to vote early rather than snipe at the last minute. These results suggest that a public tally may adversely affect welfare regarding information aggregation, as signaling strategies can intensify the influence of pivotal voters.",

No longer are race (American Indian/Alaska Native/Indigenous, Asian/Asian American, Black/African American/African, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, White) and Hispanic/Latina/e/o ethnicity recorded separately. Instead, they are all options from which one or more may be claimed as an ethnoracial identity, and they include an additional Middle Eastern/North African category among the list of options. It is no longer necessary to claim or reject a racial category for oneself to claim a solely Hispanic/Latina/e/o ethnic identity, which means that the current and prior schemes for ethnoracial identity are neither equivalent nor directly comparable.",

          "authors": "Lingkai Kong",
          "abstract": "Current federalism research is dominated by the successful American model, focusing on a territorialized, mono-national constitutional federalism, where individuals of different nations within a specific territorial scope are jointly subject to and protected by the state. However, this is not the only way federalism can address the coexistence of multiple nations. By reviewing historical figures and theoretical narratives, as well as incorporating contemporary federal theorists on plurality and multiracial coexistence, this study seeks to shed light on a non-territorialized alternative arrangement. Once, facing the complex national coexistence within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austrian Marxist Karl Renner proposed the personal principle and cultural autonomy, attempting to reshape the federal structure of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through a non-territorial arrangement. Renner reorganizes national communities as legal entities to act as intermediaries between individuals and the state, and to implement non-territorial economic, political, and cultural management for individuals of their own nations. This study also explores the model's non-territorial character, its treaty-based character, and its embodiment of federalism as norm. In Renner's view, this attempt could achieve a balance, avoiding both the oppression of minorities by the majority within territorial structures and the centrifugal tendencies of minority groups within specific territorial scopes. Although Renner's federalist reforms ultimately failed, they still provide valuable guidance for dealing with the political reality of multinational coexistence today, demonstrating the inherent potential of a non-territorial, pluralistic, treaty-based federalism.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, white fundamentalist Christians became disproportionately affiliated with the Republican Party in the U.S. and some advocate Christian Nationalism. This study examines the association of religious commitment with an index of humanitarian progress and Republican vote percentage in 2012 and 2016 among U.S. states. The percentage of people who say they pray daily in a state strongly correlates with a lower humanitarian progress score and a higher percentage of votes for Trump. The correlations remained strong when other factors (gun ownership, ethnic segregation, and income per cost of living) were controlled statistically in a multiple regression analysis. The results suggest that reliance on the supernatural leads to neglect of the natural. Support of Trump whose dishonesty is legion and who employs the fascist tactic of blaming social problems on minorities seems anomalous with Christian ideology. Although many establishment Republicans warned against Trump, the strong correlation between the Trump vote in 2016 with the vote for the establishment Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 suggests that party members are enmeshed in mutually reinforcing social arrangements that are not conducive to support of humanitarian policies and resistance to fascist tactics.",

          "authors": "Christopher Blattman",
          "abstract": "International drug trafficking dominates the conversation on organized crime, but equally common and serious are urban systems of organized crime—criminal groups focused not on exports or transshipment, but on dominating local markets, neighborhoods, and politics. When policymakers do pay attention to this problem, they consistently make the same mistake—believing there are best practices. But systems of organized crime are not all alike. There is no one blueprint or general solution, and so following the latest fad is unlikely to deliver the desired result. Instead of trying to copy the quasi-mythological success of a Giuliani or Bukele, policymakers need to understand what kind of organized crime problem they have, what capabilities their city possesses, and what tools are appropriate to the circumstances. This paper looks in-depth at how organized crime is organized in three cities: Chicago, Medellín, and San Salvador. It also considers New York, Bogotá, and Port-au-Prince. I argue that the primary driver of their organization and incentives is their source of criminal revenues. A second major driver of behavior is the degree of criminal political organization, which broadly-speaking takes three forms: atomized individuals, fragmented groups, and competing confederations. These forms are not just the product of their revenues, but are also the result of decades of competition with the state and one another. What policy tools will work hinges on this diagnosis. I look at the evidence for a range of standard policies—from crackdowns to street outreach—and explain why we can expect them to have wildly different impacts depending on the context.",

          "authors": "Joshua Midha",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel transaction-function model for valuing emerging markets, integrating machine learning, agent-based modeling, and multi-method valuation techniques. Traditional valuation models often rely on aggregated economic indicators such as GDP growth and inflation, which lack the granularity needed to capture the transactional dynamics and unique risk factors inherent to emerging markets. In contrast, the proposed model treats each market as a multi-dimensional function of individual transactions, analyzing these interactions through a multi-method framework that includes Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), comparables, precedent transaction, and multiples analysis. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, the model iteratively improves predictive accuracy, dynamically adjusting to new data in volatile and data-sparse environments. Additionally, agent-based simulations provide insights into behavioral responses to policy changes, regulatory shifts, and other market-specific conditions, offering a behavioral layer often missing from traditional approaches. Validation of this model demonstrates a marked improvement in predictive accuracy and adaptability compared to conventional models. This transaction-function approach provides investors and policymakers with a granular, data-driven tool for assessing the true growth potential of emerging markets, paving the way for more informed, context-sensitive investment decisions.",

The latter disproportionately impacts developing nations and vulnerable communities. While the law of the sea was originally designed to ensure peace, security, and legal order for the ocean, its facilitation of industrialized ocean exploitation has inadvertently contributed to widening inequality gaps. \nThis paper leverages infrastructure studies to discuss the \"infrastructural work of law\" and explore how law’s distributional effects perpetuate injustices in ocean governance. By analyzing case studies such as marine resource conservation and shipping regulations, the study illustrates how thinking of law through an infrastructural lens reveals its agency and its potential for harm in the global ocean polity. This perspective advances an understanding of ocean justice that accounts for the complex and multi-scalar dynamics required to address the unequal burdens of the Anthropocene.",

Beyond providing a leisurely – and often competitive – activity to the bulk of its user base, online video games provide cybercriminals with an environment that is free from the reigns of legal enforcement. More specifically, with the growing popularity and uptake of the microtransaction business model, money launderers are provided with novel channels to move their illicitly gained funds. A continuously expanding body of evidence underscores that money laundering is occurring through online video games. Foremost, cybercriminals are attracted to the anonymity and global reach offered by online video games with few to no controls currently in place to disrupt laundering processes. Furthermore, regulations are struggling to keep pace with the latest money laundering strategies employed by cybercriminals. This paper explores and discusses money laundering in the context of online video games. Core vulnerabilities enabling money laundering to occur through online video games are identified. Security controls to reduce the scale of laundering are proposed.",

          "title": "Local and Spillover Effects of Trade on Structural Transformation: Evidence from Brazil",
          "authors": "Mateo Hoyos; José Alejandro Coronado; Guilherme Klein Martins",
          "abstract": "This paper presents novel empirical evidence on the impact of trade on structural transformation. Leveraging quasi-experimental tariff variation from Brazil's trade liberalization in the 1990s, we examine its effects on regional sectoral employment shares. Building on recent cross-regional macroeconomic literature, we approximate the aggregate effects of trade on structural change by extending the traditional shift-share analysis to include estimates of spatial spillover effects, beyond the commonly reported local or direct impacts. Our findings reveal that Brazilian regions directly exposed to larger tariff reductions experienced a significant decrease in manufacturing employment shares, an increase in the primary sector, and a decline in non-tradables. Spatial spillover effects—whether based on migration or gravity links—are positive for manufacturing and the primary sector but negative for non-tradables. While positive spillovers in manufacturing partially offset local deindustrialization, the net effects remain negative and economically significant. These effects persisted for at least twenty years post-liberalization and are independent of potential confounders, including alternative structural change hypotheses and other shocks to Brazil's economy during the study period. Our results are consistent with the theoretical literature on trade and structural transformation which emphasizes the significance of comparative advantage.",

          "title": "Bail out the money printer?  The impact of fiscal indemnity on central bank profitability",
          "authors": "Dianyi Yang",
          "abstract": "Since 2022, central bank losses have been prevalent in advanced economies due to previous quantitative easing and recent inflationary pressures. This paper focuses on the unique case of the United Kingdom, where the government promised in advance to cover any central bank losses arising from quantitative easing. This promise is known as the indemnity. A game-theoretical model is proposed to explain the causes and effects of such indemnity. The model's predictions about the indemnity's effect on central bank profitability are empirically examined. Using the novel Dynamic Multilevel Latent Factor Model (DM-LFM), the indemnity is found to have significantly boosted the Bank of England's profits in the deflationary environment after 2008, but exacerbated its losses under the recent inflationary pressure since 2022. The theoretical model suggests the pronounced effects are due to the Bank of England's high sensitivity to losses and the UK government's moderate fiscal liberalism. Therefore, the British experience should not be generalised. Nevertheless, the theoretical and empirical lessons can inform policy-makers about future institutional designs concerning the fiscal-monetary interactions and the public finance-price stability trade-off.",

          "title": "An integrated formal demographic fertility framework",
          "authors": "Annette Baudisch; Antonino Polizzi",
          "abstract": "The traditional framework of fertility research conceptualizes childbirth from the mother's perspective. From her perspective, birth is an uncertain and potentially recurring event. In contrast, the Born once, die once (B1D1) framework conceptualizes birth as an event experienced by the child. From its perspective, birth is certain and, like death, occurs only once. As an advantage over the traditional approach, the child's perspective allows for the use of density, survival, and hazard functions to study fertility age patterns at the macro level using birth counts for all parities by maternal age. Here, we reformulate the B1D1 framework using fertility rate notation and extend the traditional fertility framework by analogous density, survival, and hazard functions. We compare this extended traditional framework with the B1D1 framework using data on Swedish cohorts born in the 19th and 20th centuries. Large historical differences between the density, survival, and hazard functions in the two frameworks have diminished for more recent cohorts, suggesting converging conclusions about fertility age patterns. The new density, survival, and hazard functions can shed new light on differences in fertility age patterns across populations and advance traditional fertility research, including by capturing fertility and mortality age patterns with common concepts and measures.",

          "authors": "Andrew Heiss; Suparna Chaudhry",
          "abstract": "This chapter examines donor responses to the global crackdown on civil society, where governments use legal measures to repress NGOs. Donors, including bilateral and multilateral agencies, respond variably; bilateral aid often decreases following anti-NGO laws, while multilateral aid remains stable. Private donors' responses depend on factors like social trust and NGO transparency. NGOs adapt by diversifying funding, forming affiliates, or shifting to community-based support. As the space for civil society continues to shrink, coordinated international efforts are essential to counteract these repressive trends and uphold civil society's role in democratic governance.",

          "title": "Seeds of Transformation: A History of Seeds of a Good Anthropocene (2014-2024)",
          "authors": "Garry Peterson; Elena M Bennett; Reinette Biggs",
          "abstract": "The predominance of catastrophic and dystopian visions about the future makes it difficult to envision and articulate pathways for sustainability transformations towards more positive futures. To address this challenge, the \"Seeds of a Good Anthropocene” (SoGA) project began over a decade ago, in 2014. The project seeks to identify and amplify existing, innovative, non-mainstream sustainability initiatives, which we call “seeds”, that have the potential to contribute to new development pathways and create positive futures. These “seeds” offer tangible examples of how positive change is already happening out of the mainstream, and imagining how they could grow provides a useful way of describing different plausible, desirable futures and articulating pathways to move towards those futures. This paper reviews the history of the SoGA project, its theoretical underpinnings, and its ongoing impact on futures thinking, scenario development, and sustainability science. Combining personal reflections of the project's founders with a bibliometric analysis of over 30 peer-reviewed papers connected to the SoGA project, the paper identifies key people, places, and ideas that have contributed to the project. It also highlights the project’s diverse activities, such as a mobile app to identify urban ‘seeds’ and assisting in the development of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Nature Futures Framework. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions for the next decade of the SoGA project.",
