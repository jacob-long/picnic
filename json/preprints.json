          "authors": "Cary Frydman; Lawrence J. Jin",
          "abstract": "The principle of efficient coding implies that the perception of monetary payoffs is shaped by the decision maker’s prior beliefs. Specifically, payoffs that the decision maker expects to encounter more frequently should be perceived more accurately. Most previous tests of efficient coding rely on the decision maker’s experience to shape the prior. We conduct a pre-registered experiment to test whether descriptive information about the prior affects behavior in a manner consistent with efficient coding. We randomize whether participants receive this information before the experiment begins. We find strong evidence for efficient coding; however, we detect no effect of information provision on behavior. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that experience quickly crowds out any effect of descriptive information on optimal allocation of coding resources.",

          "abstract": "Until now, research has been conducted on states of depression. As a result, it has been found that in order to shorten the duration of depression, it is important to reduce the number of times depression occurs, and in order to reduce the number of times depression occurs, it is important to shorten the duration of depression. However, no consideration has been given to states of non-depression. Therefore, we sought to find the probability distribution of states of non-depression.

We also considered the properties of the obtained probability distribution and finally discussed ways to increase the probability of not having depressive symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Objetivo: Explorar el fenómeno de la automedicación en pacientes con trastorno por déficit de atención e hiperactividad (TDAH) que rechazan o abandonan la terapia farmacológica aprobada, evaluando las sustancias más comúnmente utilizadas, sus efectos neuroquímicos y sus riesgos comparativos frente a tratamientos con evidencia sólida.\n\nMétodos: Se revisó literatura científica reciente y guías clínicas sobre TDAH, consumo de sustancias psicoactivas y farmacología comparada. Se elaboró una tabla comparativa que clasifica fármacos aprobados y sustancias recreativas según su nivel de evidencia en TDAH, beneficios esperados, riesgos principales y estatus regulatorio.\n\nResultados: Una proporción significativa de pacientes TDAH de alto y bajo funcionamiento recurre a sustancias como cocaína, cannabis, psicodélicos (psilocibina, LSD), alcohol, nicotina o cetonas exógenas con fines autorregulatorios. La percepción subjetiva de mejora, asociada a la idea de preservar creatividad y personalidad, contrasta con la evidencia clínica, que muestra beneficios transitorios y riesgos potenciales superiores a los de la medicación prescrita. Los fármacos estimulantes (metilfenidato, anfetaminas) y no estimulantes (atomoxetina) mantienen la mayor eficacia y seguridad comprobada en TDAH adulto.\n\nConclusiones: La automedicación con sustancias recreativas en TDAH representa un desafío clínico y de salud pública. La tabla comparativa elaborada ofrece un recurso para visualizar, de manera estructurada, el balance riesgo-beneficio de cada opción y subraya la importancia de adherirse a tratamientos con respaldo científico.",

          "abstract": "Multitasking environments, such as monitoring of multiple underwater drones during live rapid environmental assessment (REA), while performing image classification, require effective cognitive resource management. In this second of two papers, we examine how trust, task-switching demands, workload, auditory environment, affect image classification task performance. We also benchmark a novel machine learning classification algorithm (Bijjahalli et al., 2023) against human performance. Results of our Bayesian multilevel modelling (n=95) found trust in reliable alerts supported task focus but had limited impact on response times. Task-switching interruptions led to a decline in immediate performance, which improved over time, and that image classification accuracy was unaffected by perceived workload, although moderate increases in effort and frustration improved accuracy. We also found that silent operating environments significantly improved image classification accuracy, while female voice alerts were distracting. Machine learning predictions aligned with faster response times and accuracy, supporting their utility in a decision support system.",

          "authors": "George Johanson",
          "abstract": "A clear and comprehensive prompt for code from a Large Language Model (LLM) is required for successful execution and this very necessity can assist in the need for simulation replications. A carefully crafted and evolved prompt, whether used for code creation or not, supports both study understanding and replication in a concise, readable, and readily applied manner. The prompt for the current Welch-Satterthwaite independent t-test, WS, simulation illustrated the costs and benefits to be had from reporting a developed coding request. The WS is known to be robust against Type I error and is often recommended by default over Student’s t-test. WS is also known to be less statistically powerful than Student’s t-test. Two factors that impact the power of the WS are the reliability of the dependent measure and design balance. The theoretical, applied, and didactic value of the relationship of these factors and their possible interaction to WS power was the subject of this study. Results indicated that all three of the predictors were statistically significant and explained virtually all the variation in a linear model with design balance being most important. When the linear model was restricted to more commonly observed values of reliability and design imbalance, the interaction disappeared, and reliability was most important.",

          "abstract": "This paper serves as the Phase 3 summary of the “Thought OS Series,” systematizing how the Thought OS evolves recursively, multiplies through interference and resonance with others, and expands into collective and institutional forms. Phase 3 presented: (1) the self-recursive structure (FQ → Question → Structural Pressure → Mindflight → SQ → Deepened FQ), (2) the Thought Immunity System (Interference, Resonance, Rejection, Differentiation + Three-layer Defense), (3) the conditions for a Collective OS (FQ Sharing, Structural Pressure Resonance, Leap Synchronization, and the Five Role Model), and (4) Institutional OS formation (a three-stage model in which social systems internalize and autonomously operate thought). Furthermore, through the Irreversible Four-Stage Subject Shift Model, it demonstrates how the “subject” of thought moves from “I” to “Between,” “We,” and “Institution” in an irreversible evolution. This paper also clarifies the connection from the “Third Intelligence Revolution” (Structure) to the “Fourth Intelligence Revolution” (OS-ization), incorporating human-AI co-evolution and a fully self-referential structure, and envisions a future in which thought is designed, operated, and inherited as an OS.",

          "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel global governance structure—the Federated Earth Civilization Model—as a solution to the deep-rooted conflicts between cultural identity, national sovereignty, and global unification. Drawing inspiration from both historical confederacies and speculative literature, this model envisions Earth as a unified civilization comprising culturally autonomous zones, each retaining its own legal and traditional integrity, while participating in a planetary council that governs shared existential concerns. The proposed structure aims to preserve cultural diversity without sacrificing global coherence, enabling humanity to transcend divisive paradigms and redirect collective efforts toward scientific exploration, deep space missions, and the philosophical pursuit of survival and meaning. This conceptual architecture not only addresses geopolitical friction and ideological deadlocks but also lays the foundation for a mature planetary civilization. We argue that this model is not merely a utopian construct, but a logically inevitable stage in civilizational progression if humanity is to survive and thrive as a cosmic species.",

          "authors": "Brendan A. Schuetze; Veronica X. Yan",
          "abstract": "Research on how students allocate their study time has focused primarily on the influence of goals (often called “agendas”) and metacognitive judgments (learners’ perceptions of how well they know the material). Studies of agenda-based study time allocation have typically operationalized agendas using explicit point values assigned to learning different material in the context of in-lab word-pair learning tasks. The present study extends this agenda-based regulation framework to more educationally realistic settings through in-lab manipulations of course structure presented in a syllabus (Studies 1 and 2) and observational data from study planning exercises in real classes (Studies 3 and 4). The present studies allowed for the comparison of the predictive utility of internal learner judgments in addition to external agendas. Specifically, we included external agenda-related cues (e.g., whether a unit would be tested, whether exams were cumulative, the expected number of exam questions) and internal judgments (e.g., interest, difficulty, confidence) to determine whether students’ internal judgments predict study time over and above external agendas. Across the four studies, external agendas accounted for substantial variance in students’ study time allocation intentions and in three of the four studies, internal judgments explained relatively little variance over and above the explanatory power provided by external agenda-related cues. The fourth study showed more optimistic estimates for the amount of variance explained by internal judgments. Nevertheless, the relative importance of internal judgements and external cues varied with context, underscoring the importance of investigating metacognitive regulation using educationally relevant materials and real-world educational settings.",

          "abstract": "Journalists are often maligned for covering sensational or desirable research results at the expense of studies with stronger methods. The present study tests whether such journalistic bias exists, and if it is reduced when studies are selected based on their methods, rather than results (results-blind selection). Practicing journalists, editors, journalism faculty, and journalism graduate students (N = 413) read summaries of real social psychology studies and rated their interest in reporting on them. Participants were randomly assigned to read summaries that included (traditional) or excluded (results-blind) the results. Summaries varied on three within-subject dimensions: replication status, pre-registration status, and belief-consistency. Participants expressed more interested in replicable (vs. not replicable) and pre-registered (vs. non-pre-registered) studies, regardless of whether they learned the results, countering the notion that journalists favor research that rests on shaky methodological foundations. Meanwhile, results-blind selection was effective in reducing confirmation bias, suggesting it may be worth further exploration as a tool for improving science communication.",

          "authors": "Marc J Lanovaz",
          "abstract": "When selecting interventions for students or clients, practitioners typically need to estimate the probability that it will lead to socially significant changes in behavior. One potential solution to address this issue involves computing the conditional probability of success given the results observed in the research literature. The purpose of the study was to use Bayesian inference, an approach that considers prior probability, to examine how the number of successful experiments may be used to assess the external validity (i.e., generality across participants) of findings from single-case research. Although the analyses show that relying on more experiments tends to produce better estimates, having as few as five successful experiments may result in a success rate with a lower bound of at least .50. Given that research on the topic remains limited, we argue that our proposal should not be viewed as immutable, but rather as a starting point for spurring further discussion and research on the topic.",

          "abstract": "Assessing well-being with social media text data is a promising method, but besides hedonic well-being, little is known about whether additional well-being dimensions, such as psychological richness and eudaimonic well-being, can be predicted from such data. We compare the predictive accuracy for hedonic well-being, eudaimonic well-being, and the recently proposed construct of psychological richness in a large sample of Facebook users (n = 2,644), and find that the inclusion of language features incrementally improved model prediction accuracy beyond demographic features for psychological richness, but not for hedonic or eudaimonic well-being. Psychological richness had the lowest overall prediction accuracy (r = .21) followed by hedonic well-being (r = .27) and eudaimonic well-being (r = .29). The linguistic features associated with Psychological Richness were face valid, and in many instances the content and direction of the associations were unique to Psychological Richness, which provides discriminant validity evidence.",

          "authors": "Mark Gunther Pillai; Cody Anthony Mashburn; Audrey Leroux; Randall Engle",
          "abstract": "Sensory discrimination has long been theorized to reflect a core cognitive function underlying intelligence. Building on this tradition, we examined whether task-evoked pupil responses, as an index of mental effort, relate to attention control (AC) and auditory discrimination ability. Using a large dataset (N = 336), participants completed three adaptive auditory discrimination tasks (pitch, duration, loudness), a cognitive battery assessing attention control, working memory, and fluid intelligence, and pupillometry during task performance. Structural equation modeling confirmed that AC predicted auditory discrimination thresholds and fully mediated the relationship between task-evoked pupil dilation and performance. Trial-level multilevel models revealed that higher task difficulty and errors were associated with larger pupil dilations, especially in demanding tasks. Crucially, individuals with greater AC exhibited steeper increases in pupil dilation with rising task difficulty and were more resilient to performance declines. For high-AC individuals, large pupil responses predicted preserved accuracy; for low-AC individuals, they signaled compensatory effort with diminished success. These results suggest that attention control governs both the extent and efficacy of mental effort, determining whether high arousal facilitates or fails to improve performance. This work refines classic resource models by demonstrating that cognitive effort, indexed via pupillometry, supports perception most effectively when guided by strong executive control. Findings support a hierarchical model in which attention control serves as the functional bridge between arousal, sensory discrimination, and higher-order cognition.",

          "abstract": "This work examines organizational-level inclusion signals and their subsequent effects on employees. Answering the call for more research on concealable stigmatized identities, we consider the effect of such organization-level inclusion signals for sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees) while also considering the effect on non-target employees. In a time-lagged observational study (N = 1,165 ), archival data (N = 229), and a randomized experiment (N = 380), we show that organizational-level inclusion efforts lead to more positive perception of the organization’s psychological climate for sexual and gender minorities, closing the psychological safety gap between non-LGBT and LGBT employees.. Notably, these intentional inclusion efforts also benefit non-LGBT employees, which contradicts recent theoretical assertions that intentional inclusion can harm majority groups, or that organizational inclusion is a zero-sum game.These signals shaped positive behavioral intentions for all employees, leading to non-LGBT employees engaging in more individual ally work, and LGBT employees feeling more free to share their identities. Unexpectedly, inclusion signals even made non-LGBT employees less likely to conceal intimidating parts of their identity (e.g. religion, parental status) as well. In sum, we show that such signaling improves psychological safety for all employees, reducing or eliminating the deficit between target and non-target employees while also encouraging value-aligned positive behaviors.",

          "abstract": "The current academic publishing system has increasingly prioritized mainstream appeal and broad readership over groundbreaking scientific innovation, creating systemic barriers for disruptive research while facilitating the publication of incremental work. This study analyzes recent evidence of editorial bias against paradigm-shifting research, examining how peer review processes and impact factor-driven incentives systematically favor conventional theories over revolutionary ideas. Through analysis of rejection patterns at major journals and the documented decline in disruptive research publication, we demonstrate that editorial decisions are primarily influenced by perceived broad interest rather than scientific merit or novelty. The findings reveal a troubling paradox: while genuinely innovative research struggles to find publication venues, incremental studies that confirm existing paradigms are readily accepted, leading to an overall decline in scientific disruptiveness. This editorial orthodoxy threatens long-term scientific progress by creating an environment where conformity is rewarded and intellectual risk-taking is penalized. We argue that the academic publishing ecosystem must undergo fundamental reform to restore its proper function as a facilitator of scientific advancement rather than a barrier to paradigmatic innovation.",

          "authors": "Zaina Alkurdi; Lucas Palmer; Luke Clark",
          "abstract": "Background: The illusion of control is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their personal influence over random events. Prior research indicates that the sequence of outcomes can shape this illusion, with early wins (a ‘Descending’ sequence) strengthening the illusion of control more than late wins (an ‘Ascending’ sequence) or evenly distributed (‘Flat’) wins.\nMethod: Over two pre-registered experiments, we tested how outcome sequences affected peoples' perceptions of control in an online slot machine task, hypothesizing that a Descending win sequence would create the strongest perceived control ratings, increased bet size, and faster spin initiation. In Study 1, the wins and losses were uniform, while in Study 2, different symbol combinations were associated with different win sizes.\nResults: In Study 1, the Descending condition was associated with significantly higher perceived control total scores than the Ascending condition. Higher perceived control ratings were associated with higher bet sizes, but not with faster spin initiation. In Study 2, there were no differences on the perceived control total score across conditions, nor was perceived control associated with bet size, but the Descending condition was associated with higher perceived control ratings on the specific items that were sensitive in Study 1.\nConclusions: The findings of Study 1 extend prior research on outcome sequences using simple coin-toss tasks to perceived control in an online slot machine setting. Contrary to our expectations, this effect was only partially supported when the size of the wins varied in Study 2.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Socioemotional Selectivity Theory suggests that the emotional significance of social partners should have a greater influence on older adults' choices, potentially leading them to weigh social relationships more heavily when deciding whom to trust. We tested whether this preferential trust in closer relationships stems from a preexisting bias (predisposition) or more efficient information processing (evaluation) and how these processes change across the adult life span.\nMethods: In a sample of 163 healthy adults (ages 18–80), we applied a diffusion decision model (DDM) to behavioral data from an economic trust game. Participants made investment decisions with a friend, a stranger, and a computer partner.\nResults: Participants invested more in friends than in strangers. The DDM revealed this was driven by a higher rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate, v) for friends, not a shift in response bias (starting point, z). Age was positively correlated with non-decision time (t), reflecting general slowing, but was not associated with other parameters. The evaluative enhancement for friends was preserved across the life span.\nDiscussion: Preferential trust in close others arises from more efficient evaluative processing, not a simple predisposition. This core social-cognitive mechanism remains preserved in older adulthood, underscoring the value of cognitive modeling for uncovering information-processing mechanisms that support socioemotional priorities as people age.",

          "abstract": "The paradox of sexual desire in long-term relationships is that while intimacy deepens, erotic vitality often declines. Research links this decline to habituation, lack of novelty, and insufficient intentional effort. This paper introduces intentional dating, a structured framework designed to counteract these challenges. Grounded in established theories—Self-Determination Theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985), the Dual Control Model (Bancroft &amp; Janssen, 2000), and Self-Expansion Theory (Aron &amp; Aron, 1986)—it emphasizes agency, competence, and attunement (autonomy, competence, relatedness) as drivers of sustained desire. The program applies a four-part structure across eight sequential dates, fostering reflection, playful exploration, communication, and erotic growth. By translating theory into practice, intentional dating provides couples with repeatable skills to cultivate anticipation, deepen intimacy, and sustain desire over time.",

          "abstract": "Beliefs about the dishonesty of other people can shape our collective behavior. How accurate are these beliefs? And do we believe that other people are similarly, more, or less dishonest than they truly are? In a research program on moral decision-making consisting of 31 different effects from 11 experiments (N = 8,127), initially designed to test a broad collection of different hypotheses, participants were placed in various situations where they could lie for personal gain, without repercussions or detection risk. Crucially, we also asked all participants to estimate what percentage of other people would lie in a similar situation. Conducting an internal meta-analysis across all experiments, including both incentivized choice experiments and hypothetical marketplace scenarios, the results reveal a substantial overestimation of others' dishonesty by an average of 14 percentage points (meta-analytic effect: Hedge’s g = 0.58). That is, people are less dishonest than we tend to think, in which about 70% of our participants told the truth despite having a financial incentive to lie. These findings illustrate a pervasive tendency to overestimate the actual dishonesty of other people, suggesting a biased belief that the world is less moral than it truly is. Does belief accuracy matter? In a new experiment using an information treatment based on our meta-analytic results (N = 981), providing correct information about actual honesty levels did not only lead to more positive honesty beliefs, but also to a broader enhancement of pro-social expectations – including higher interpersonal trust, higher fairness and helpfulness beliefs, and reduced cynicism.",

          "abstract": "Pubertal development influences adolescent health and behavior, but measuring puberty is challenging. Difficulties stem not only from practical issues, which have been the extensively discussed in the literature, but also from the very complexity of the theoretical basis of pubertal development from a physiological point of view. Here we discuss conceptual issues related to measuring and interpreting pubertal effects by first analyzing a widely used measure – age at menarche – as a case study. We use age at menarche as a starting point not because it is an ideal measure, but precisely because it is not, being well known for its limitations. However, our analysis shows that the most significant limitations this measure also apply to all currently used pubertal measures and arise from the fundamentally multifactorial physiological nature of pubertal development. Puberty is not a unitary phenomenon, cannot be measured directly nor be defined by individual makers, and its different markers are often discordant. We argue that a possible compromise between practical issues (building feasible/reliable measures) and theoretical ones (building conceptually sound and interpretable measures) is to treat puberty as the variance shared among multiple pubertal measures using suitable statistical methods.",

          "abstract": "Visual perception emerges from dynamic interactions between bottom‑up sensory input and top‑down, task‑driven expectations. This study tested whether task‑related ERP modulations during object categorization depend on low‑level category‑specific features—specifically the amplitude spectrum (AS)—or if they arise later, independent of these features. Participants viewed grayscale images of animals and vehicles with either intact or equalized AS, each paired with an “X” or “O.” They performed either a category‑relevant task (animal vs. vehicle) or a category‑irrelevant task (“X” vs. “O”). Task demands influenced visual processing at multiple stages: task‑dependent category selectivity emerged early (70–90 ms) for images with intact AS information, and again at later stages (~180 ms onward) regardless of physical image characteristics. Crucially, early category selectivity driven by physical features did not persist into subsequent ERP components, indicating that evidence accumulation is not strictly cumulative across stages. These findings indicate that task demands shape both low‑level and higher‑level stages of visual processing, highlighting flexible interactions between physical stimulus properties and cognitive goals.",

          "abstract": "Human behavior is largely governed by instinctual biological signals—neurochemical impulses shaped over hundreds of thousands of years for survival in high-risk, low-resource environments. While once adaptive, these primal drives (fear, dominance, tribal belonging, hoarding, reproduction) are increasingly mismatched to modern contexts characterized by social complexity, technological amplification, and global interdependence.\nThis paper introduces Autognosis, a philosophical and behavioral framework for consciously recognizing, separating from, and redirecting inherited instinctual impulses toward ethically chosen behavior. Drawing on neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and ethical philosophy, Autognosis proposes a five-stage methodology—Recognition, Separation, Redirection, Reflection, and Internal System Design—designed to reorient behavior from reflexive reaction toward intentional self-governance.\nApplications span education (the Inner Compass curriculum), leadership training, civic reform, and AI ethics, with the core premise that societal systems reflect the instinctual states of their creators. Autognosis reframes human dysfunction not as moral failure, but as unexamined biology at scale—and offers a teachable path toward conscious agency.",

          "abstract": "Accurately interpreting facial expressions is fundamental for social interaction, yet this ability is often impaired in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While research has documented these difficulties, two key questions remain: First, are these deficits specific to recognising emotions or do they reflect broader challenges in face processing? And second, does the increasingly documented co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD exacerbate these difficulties? We compared emotion discrimination thresholds (EDT) in adults with ADHD, ASD, ADHD+ASD and non-clinical comparison adults. The EDT is an unbiased measurement of emotion recognition sensitivity, measuring the amount of emotion display required for a person to correctly identify it. We measured EDT with faces gradually changing from a neutral to an emotional expression. To control for general face processing skills, we designed a non-emotional but visually similar control task with neutral faces changing gradually from human to animal until identified by the participant. Using eye tracking we were able to rule out potential differences in how the four groups of participants visually attended to facial features to recognise the emotion or animal. We showed a specific disadvantage in emotion but not animal recognition in the three clinical group. Crucially, emotion recognition deficits were not amplified by the co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD, when considering performance in the control task. Thus, our study suggests equal mechanisms underlying reduced emotion recognition in both ASD and ADHD. Focus should be dedicated to identifying this mechanism and develop targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Geometry is at the foundation of many of humanity’s greatest cultural achievements, from art and architecture to science and technology. This chapter explores the origins of humans’ unique capacity for geometry by describing the early emerging geometric sensitivities of human infants. Initially, infants show limited sensitivities to the geometry of 2D visual forms, discriminating the relative lengths of a form’s parts but not the angles at which those parts meet, consistent with the hypothesis that infants differentiate forms by their shape skeletons. Nevertheless, infants’ sensitivities to the geometry of 2D visual forms may become increasingly abstract with their acquisition of natural language, paralleling the increased geometric abstraction that underlies toddlers’ developing 3D object recognition and categorization. Such development may ultimately support informal learning of the foundational geometric building blocks of formal geometry, like those found in Euclid’s Elements, with concepts like parallelism, perpendicularity, and angle, and may thus set the stage for formal learning of geometry in school.",

Across three studies (N = 314), we show that children’s (ages 5-12; M = 7.75, SD = 1.58, 116 boys, 183 girls, 133 White, 47 Black, 24 Asian, 11 Hispanic/Latine, 1 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 32 mulitracial, 66 Unreported) self-reported levels of SDO are associated with less desire to rectify inequality, lower likelihood to believe claims of inequality from low-status groups, and less sympathy for outgroup suffering. We also examine the role of group status and status essentialism in shaping SDO, finding some support that group status and status essentialism jointly influence self-reported SDO. These data also suggest that SDO and ingroup bias are different processes and highlight the utility of taking a developmental perspective to discuss how social dominance theory and social identity theory may be both conceptually and empirically distinguishable.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Modern academic philosophy, with its elaborate theories and technical analyses, often resembles a detailed map disconnected from the terrain of real life. In contrast, ancient Hellenistic and Late Antique philosophies – especially Stoicism and the early thought of Plotinus – viewed philosophy as a way of life, a practical guide to living with wisdom and virtue. This paper argues that contemporary philosophy has strayed far from those roots. The metaphor “the map is not the landscape” will frame our discussion: the conceptual abstractions (the map) that occupy academic philosophy are not the lived experience (the landscape) that concerned the ancients. We will explore how Stoic and Plotinian perspectives highlight the gap between modern philosophy’s focus on analytical maps and the ancients’ commitment to navigating the landscape of human existence.\nWe begin with historical foundations, examining how classical philosophy entwined theory with life practice. We then trace the evolution of the philosophical academy through the Middle Ages and modern period, noting the rise of specialization and scholasticism. The heart of the paper focuses on Stoicism as an “art of living” and Plotinus’s vision of interior spiritual ascent – two exemplars of philosophy as praxis rather than mere theory. In subsequent sections, we diagnose the fragmentation and specialization of present-day philosophy and how it has led to a loss of praxis. Finally, we issue a call for renewal: a reintegration of philosophical inquiry with the quest for living wisely. Our aim is an intellectually rigorous critique that encourages philosophy to return to its ancient role as not only theoretical discourse but also a guide to existential flourishing.",

There has been sustained interest from those interested in the psychology and spirituality of archetypes; however to date sociologists have remained largely aloof. Hoping to overcome this lacuna, this paper explores the sociology of archetypes by examining the emotional and psychological power of archetypes and by demonstrating how powerful archetypes become situated in elite “spiritual” discourses designed not in the service of human health and development, but in the service of the political and economic agenda of societal and world elites.",

Going beyond the conventional idea of \"applying thought to institutions,\" this work proposes a paradigm shift where institutions themselves leap, generate meaning, and act as autonomous Social OS. By implementing Thought OS within social systems, we unlock new pathways for societal self-evolution and accelerated collective intelligence. This structural reconception redefines the relationship between human beings and institutions, marking an ontological shift where society is no longer governed by thought, but rather, thought becomes society’s operating system.",

The most common view (40%) was that consciousness persists beyond physical death, an inference often grounded in direct meditative experiences of awareness as a non-physical and enduring presence. \n\tA significant proportion (28.9%) viewed death as a natural and inevitable process to be accepted without fear or attachment, reflecting the psychological mechanism of decentering cultivated through mindfulness practices. \n\tCompared to general population data, AMs were significantly less likely to endorse materialist views of consciousness cessation (6.7% vs. 23%), suggesting that advanced contemplative training may shift existential beliefs in measurable ways. \n\tThe findings suggest a nuanced and non-dogmatic approach to mortality among AMs, characterized by an openness to mystery and equanimity. \n\tThis study offers novel insights into how sustained contemplative practice may fundamentally alter one's relationship with death, with implications for psychology, spiritual care, and consciousness studies.",

However, much of the guidance on collecting and interpreting AA data is written for researchers and there are few guides written for clinical practitioners who may be interested in using AA data to inform their clinical practice. As clinical researchers and practitioners ourselves, we aim to increase interdisciplinary crosstalk by illustrating the benefits of integrating AA data into clinical practice using case examples. We offer practical recommendations for how psychotherapists might effectively use digital data. Specifically, we encourage psychotherapists to (1) co-create digital assessments that align with their client’s goals, (2) consider which digital device (or assessment modality) may be best suited to measure their client’s symptoms, experiences, or goals, and to (3) co-determine what constitutes ‘meaningful change’ for your client and their goals.

By leveraging language’s unique properties - its efficiency in representing sensorimotor information, ability to extend across time and space, and generativity in constructing novel predictions - inner speech enables predictive processing to transcend immediate experience, encoding complex sensory experiences into linguistic forms for perceptual inference, while decoding abstract goals through situated action simulations for active control. By unifying previously disparate aspects of inner speech research, LAIT provides a comprehensive framework explaining how its diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and theoretical models emerge from its implementation of perceptual inference and active control through dynamic linguistic predictions, adapting to computational demands and fluctuating uncertainties across contexts. This synthesis generates novel testable hypotheses, underscores the need for methodological innovations in studying inner speech dynamics, and opens new perspectives on both related mental phenomena and the broader role of symbolic systems in cognition.",

These activities introduce important physiological challenges, primarily driven by exposure to altered gravity environments. Microgravity disrupts vestibular input, generating sensory conflicts that impair spatial orientation, motor coordination, and cognitive performance. Although adaptation to such conditions involves neuroplasticity, the precise neural mechanisms and correlates of altered gravity exposure remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 15 neuroimaging studies examining functional brain changes related to spaceflight and validated ground-based analogues. Our activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis identified a predominantly right-lateralized network cantered on primary sensorimotor cortices, including the precentral and postcentral gyri, as well as the insula and opercular cortex. The observed alterations in brain dynamics likely represent neuroplastic adaptations to the absence or alteration of gravitational signals, facilitating recalibration of internal models that predict and compensate for gravity’s influence on perception and motor behaviour.",

          "authors": "John L. Cooley",
          "abstract": "Objective: Peer victimization is increasingly recognized as a potentially traumatic stressor. Relatively little research, however, has been conducted during middle childhood—when stable patterns of traditional victimization can emerge—and no known studies have examined the impact of cyber victimization during this developmental period. Moreover, the vast majority of previous work has been cross-sectional in nature. The current short-term longitudinal study sought to address each of these gaps in the literature and to identify specific thresholds at which peer victimization is associated with increased risk for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Method: Participants included a sample of 250 children (grades 3-5; 52% boys; 50% Hispanic/Latinx) and their homeroom teachers. Peer victimization was assessed using child- and teacher-reports at Time 1, and PTSS were assessed using child-reports at Times 1 and 2. Results: Across both time points, 43% of children reported clinically significant PTSS stemming from their experiences of peer victimization. Further, traditional and cyber victimization uniquely predicted greater PTSS, and these effects persisted 6.5 months later. Child-reports of traditional and cyber victimization at least “2 or 3 Times a Month” were meaningful lower-bound thresholds, although children who reported traditional victimization “Several Times a Week” exhibited the greatest risk for PTSS. Conclusions: A significant proportion of children who experience peer victimization report clinically significant PTSS, and both traditional and cyber victimization confer lasting risk during middle childhood. Findings highlight the importance of screening to identify children negatively impacted by these experiences and the need for additional research to investigate trauma-focused interventions.",

Without theory, personality research risks becoming a catalog of findings rather than a cumulative science. This chapter examines the critical role of theory in personality research. I begin by outlining three essential components of a strong theory, as recently articulated by Eronen and Bringmann (2021). Using personality trait development as a focal area, I then assess the current state of theory-building in light of these criteria. This evaluation highlights both the progress achieved and the challenges that remain, offering insights into the core question: What does it take to develop strong, testable, and meaningful psychological theories in personality science?",

          "title": "Cognitive-Affective Regulation in Stoic Thought: Toward a Therapeutic Model",
          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Stoicism, an ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, has experienced a modern resurgence owing to its practical tools for managing emotion and navigating adversity. Founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BCE and later developed by philosophers like Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius, Stoicism taught that philosophy should function as a “medicine for the psyche,” treating the emotional and existential ailments of life.  In Stoic teachings, disturbances of the mind are seen as arising not from external events but from within—specifically, from our judgments about events. This cognitive framework — famously captured by Epictetus (“Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them”)   — positions Stoicism as a philosophical ancestor of many principles in modern psychotherapy. Indeed, contemporary therapeutic approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have explicitly acknowledged Stoic philosophy as an influence on their development.  The convergence between Stoic practices and psychotherapy has given rise to Stoic-based therapies, which integrate exercises and insights from Stoicism into clinical and self-help contexts.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive examination of therapies grounded in Stoic practices. We begin by outlining the theoretical foundations of Stoicism relevant to psychology, including Stoic views on emotions and virtue. Next, we explore the historical and conceptual links between Stoicism and modern psychotherapy, detailing how Stoic ideas underpin techniques in cognitive-behavioral therapy, rational-emotive behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions. We then introduce core Stoic therapeutic techniques – such as cognitive reframing through the dichotomy of control, negative visualization (premeditatio malorum), and mindful self-awareness (prosochē) – and discuss their applications in promoting emotional resilience and rational living. The integration of Stoic practices into treatment will be illustrated with real-world clinical examples and case vignettes, showing how Stoic-based strategies can aid in managing anxiety, anger, depression, trauma, and personality disorders. Throughout, we reference both classical wisdom and current empirical studies that have begun testing Stoic interventions in clinical and educational settings. Finally, we address challenges and critiques of Stoic-based therapy, including potential misunderstandings of Stoicism and its limitations as a stand-alone treatment, emphasizing the importance of an empirically grounded and ethically informed approach.\nBy bridging ancient philosophy and contemporary psychology, this interdisciplinary inquiry aims to demonstrate that Stoic practices – far from being mere historical curiosities – continue to offer valuable tools for psychological wellbeing. The enduring Stoic emphasis on reason, virtue, and mindfulness provides a rich conceptual framework that can complement modern therapeutic techniques. At the same time, empirical scrutiny and clinical experience are vital to adapt these age-old practices to individual needs in the present day. In sum, Stoic-based therapy offers a compelling synthesis of classical wisdom and evidence-based methods — warranting further exploration by practitioners and scholars across psychology, mental health, and philosophy.\nThis paper argues that Stoic thought provides a coherent and practical therapeutic framework—one that prefigures and complements modern psychological practices such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. By examining its theoretical foundations, psychological insights, and practical exercises, we explore how Stoicism offers an enduring model of cognitive-affective regulation.",

          "authors": "Frank Eckerle; Edward John Roy Clarke; Helen Landmann",
          "abstract": "Climate activists frequently use tactics of direct action, an often disruptive “not asking, just doing” approach where ends and means fall into one. Psychological research often subsumes direct action (e.g., drawing bicycle lanes to establish a bicycle lane) under umbrella terms of radical, non-normative or confrontative collective action (e.g., disrupting traffic to draw attention to a call for a bicycle lane). However, interdisciplinary research on social movements and transition strongly suggests, that witnessing direct action can have different psychological effects than witnessing indirect action. Based on this, we argue that direct actions can increase access to cognitive alternatives when they successfully showcase a concrete mini-utopia (a property of prefigurative politics). Two pre-registered online experiments have been conducted in Germany (N = 645) using a 2(direct/indirect action version) x 3(bicycle, parking or automobility protests) design. We hypothesised and found that direct actions with this prefigurative effect are generally more accepted, elicit more positive emotions, and receive more solidarity compared to similar indirect actions. We also found evidence for a mediated positive effect on evaluations of a traffic-reduced future via identification with the activists and ratings of action efficacy. However, there were no significant effects on policy support. Results support the notion that some direct actions are better than others in communicating a concrete utopia, however the criteria to determine this prefigurative effect require further development. We call for more collective action research to specifically investigate the psychological effects of participation in and witnessing of prefigurative politics.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Contemporary theoretical physics suggests that spacetime and gravity might emerge from deeper informational structures, hinting that our universe could be holographically organized. In this speculative essay, we explore the idea that reality itself has a fundamentally holographic character, using black hole physics and quantum information as guiding clues. Black hole thermodynamics reveals a mysterious link between information and the geometry of space, inspiring the holographic principle that a region’s content may be encoded on its boundary. We survey how this principle—and the notion of an informational universe—intersects with philosophical interpretations of time: from the eternalist block universe view of an unchanging 4D spacetime, to informational realism which posits information as the substrate of existence. Against this backdrop, we introduce Existential Realism (ER), a two-tier ontology distinguishing transient existence from enduring reality. We argue that ER’s framework provides a novel lens for these questions. In ER, the present “now” is like a projection of an underlying informational reality; black holes then appear as ontological cracks where that projection falters, raising profound questions about time, causality, and hidden order. We show how ER’s emphasis on an evolving present and an informationally rich reality can reframe puzzles such as the black hole information paradox and the nature of temporal entropy. This work is intended as a frontier-level exploration: it sketches a consonance between cutting-edge cosmology and a new metaphysical model of time, suggesting that what we call “reality” might indeed be a projection from a deeper order of information and existence.",

This work presents a multidisciplinary synthesis of 30 independent lines of reasoning that all converge on the necessity of a nonzero minimal response time . Each argument stems from a distinct physical or logical limitation—be it relativistic causality, quantum coherence bounds, information transfer rates, thermodynamic feasibility, or control-theoretic stability. Collectively, they form a robust, falsifiable theoretical scaffold that prohibits the existence of truly instantaneous reactions in any physically realizable system. The distinction is made between system-specific lower bounds  and a possible cosmic minimal bound , the latter potentially related to Planck-scale phenomena. The results imply that  is not merely a feature of biological or engineering constraints, but a universal structural requirement of the physical universe.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) research has long debated whether its storage operates via discrete slots or distributed resources. However, emerging neuroscientific evidence suggests that neither account alone fully captures the complexity of WM function. Here, I propose a context-content hierarchical framework that unifies these views. A capacity-limited “context” system maintains discrete spatiotemporal pointers that individuate and prioritize items, while a precision-limited “content” system encodes detailed sensory information in modality-specific population codes whose fidelity varies with task demands. These systems interact through predictive top-down feedback and rhythmic coordination to support “holographic” reconstruction, in which a low-dimensional pointer selectively reinstates high-dimensional content on demand. This architecture explains how stable capacity limits can coexist with graded precision, activity-silent states, and rapid cue-driven reinstatement, and clarifies when contextual retrieval protects performance from interference. The framework yields clear experimental predictions and motivates computational models in which pointer indexing is coupled to sensory reconstruction. By integrating discrete control signals with continuous sensory representations, the context–content framework reconceptualizes WM as a dynamic, generative system that balances sparse indexing with on-demand reconstruction to guide adaptive behavior.\nKeywords: working memory, binding, contextual pointers, sensory recruitment, discrete slots, continuous resources",

          "authors": "Alexia Galati; Rick Dale; Camila Alviar; Moreno Coco",
          "abstract": "Collaborative task performance is assumed to benefit from interpersonal coordination of behaviors between interacting individuals. Prominent views of language use and social behavior, including the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM; Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004), endorse this idea by building on tasks that require partners to monitor each other’s perspective (e.g., route planning) and positing that behavioral alignment enables task partners to converge conceptually. However, the role of alignment in tasks requiring complementarity (e.g., a “divide and conquer” strategy during joint visual search) has yet to be explored. We examine this question directly by manipulating task goals (route planning vs. visual search) as forty dyads work with ten trials involving subway maps while their eye movements and speech were co-registered. In five trials, dyads planned a route from an origin to a destination (route planning); in another five trials, they searched for landmarks sharing some feature (visual search). We used Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to examine the temporal relationships between partners' eye fixations and word sequences, generating measures that reveal both similarity and other dynamic relationships. Dyads exhibited more gaze alignment in route planning than visual search across a range of CRQA metrics. When examining the temporal evolution of gaze alignment, we found it to vary across the trial substantially, and its increase influenced accuracy differently over time across the two tasks. Specifically, in visual search, higher increases in alignment at the end of the trial were associated with accurate performance. When we turned to speech data, we found that dyads exhibited longer and more entropic word sequences in route planning but had lower overall word recurrence in that task. This finding suggests that the two modalities organize in a compensatory fashion to optimize distinct task goals.  We suggest that these results support a theoretical framework that is more general than IAM yet has interactive alignment as an emergent consequence of how participants adapt to tasks. This framework emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of coordination strategies based on task demands. Altogether, task goals constrain how people coordinate their behavior and provide insights into how collaborating partners distribute their distinctive multimodal behavior.",

          "abstract": "Delay Discounting (DD) refers to the tendency for behavioral consequences (rewards or punishers) to be devalued as they occur more remotely in the future. DD has become a fruitful model of impulsive behavior and thus there is growing interest in developing interventions that could reduce it. Delay Exposure (DE) training has shown promising results in rodents. It consists of rats pressing a lever to produce a cue stimulus for a 17.5 s interval, at the end of which a reinforcer is delivered (Renda et al., 2021). The present study aimed to address some limitations in DE research: extensive number of training sessions required (60 or more), exclusive use of group designs, and potential confounding maturation effects. Using a within-subjects design, a variation of DE and its standard control condition (Immediate Exposure-IE) were evaluated in DD of rats tested in adolescence and adulthood. All DE and IE standard aspects remained the same except that the delay cues and reinforcers were response independent due to equipment limitations that prevented the use of a third operandum. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were daily exposed to a delay-discounting task (DDT, Liley et al., 2019) until steady responding was obtained at late adolescence (starting postnatal week – PW– 14, Ghasemi et al., 2021) and early adulthood (PW 25-27). Eight of the 18 rats (Main group) continued daily DD assessment plus different experimental manipulations added to the DDT across six conditions. The remaining 10 rats were kept as a Waitlist control group (no DD assessment/treatment between PW 28-42). The first manipulation added to the DDT controlled the additional access to pellets and time spent in the operant chamber entailed in subsequent DE/IE conditions. This 60Pellets condition consisted of 1-hr pre-DDT-session response-independent access to the same number of reinforcers delivered during each session of the DE/IE manipulations (i.e., 60 pellets). The third and fifth conditions consisted of DE and IE (counterbalanced across half of the animals) with 60Pellets reversals interspersed between them (fourth and sixth conditions). Based on subjects’ performance during the first six conditions, a second control manipulation was introduced. This Wait condition entailed rats waiting in the operant chamber during the 60-min before the daily DDT session without operanda, delay cue, or pellets. All 18 rats, including waitlist, were exposed to a DDT retest during PW 43-49 (i.e., middle adulthood). Waitlist rats were then exposed to 60Pellets and DE conditions between PW 46-51. Unexpectedly, we found that exposure to the 60Pellets condition during early adulthood produced significant reductions in DD, with an average of 16 sessions needed to produce steady low DD. These rats maintained low DD levels throughout the remaining conditions of the experiment, regardless the manipulation, including DE/IE and two reversals to 60Pellets. DD of Waitlist rats did not change between early- and middle-adulthood tests separated by ~20 weeks, and not significantly decreased under 60Pellets and DE conditions. These preliminary and promising findings suggest early- but not middle-adulthood response-independent access to reinforcement reduces impulsive choice long-term with a relatively brief intervention. The specific contribution of response-independent DE/IE, extensive and repetitive DD assessment, and maturation on this effect is unclear. Further efforts aimed at reproducing these effects and identifying the processes involved are warranted.",

          "authors": "Samantha Abram; Aaron McInnes; Christi Sullivan; Dawson Cooper; Brian Sweis; Alik Widge",
          "abstract": "Background: People with major depressive disorder (MDD) often struggle to pursue previously rewarding activities, which may relate to deficits experiencing pleasure, termed anhedonia. Anhedonia remains a challenge to target and treat. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) alleviates anhedonia in some patients with MDD, though rTMS is logistically burdensome. Identifying novel, translational phenotypes of reward pursuit may help identify who is most likely to respond to treatment. We used a translational reward task (Web-Surf) to test if reward pursuit strategies in patients with MDD predicts anhedonia reductions following rTMS.\nMethods: Patients with treatment-resistant MDD (N=32) underwent daily, rTMS treatment and completed Web-Surf weekly. Depression and anhedonia symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire. We examined if the number of rewards earned, at baseline, correlated with self-reported hedonic experience and anhedonia reductions following rTMS. We also tested if changes in reward earnings, over the rTMS course, were specific to patients with reduced anhedonia.\nResults: Patients with MDD who earned more desired rewards at baseline reported a more pleasurable experience during Web-Surf (baseline) and exhibited greater anhedonia reductions (late treatment – baseline). Patients increasingly earned more desired rewards over the therapy course, specifically those who showed a decline in anhedonia with rTMS. Reward earning trajectories did not change among patients who showed no improvement in anhedonia.\nConclusions: We present a novel translational reward-pursuit metric that corresponds with anhedonia reductions following rTMS therapy. Anhedonia reductions related to both baseline reward pursuit and reward- pursuit trajectories. This translational phenotype shows promise as a biomarker for clinical treatment response in depression.",

Participants included 197 twin children (115 girls; Mage= 13.6 years) from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, Behavior, and Environment. A path model examined whether Time 1 general anxiety, effortful control, attention, and positive affect predicted Time 2 reading comprehension, with test anxiety as a mediator. A curvilinear regression tested whether general anxiety had a nonlinear relationship with reading comprehension. Less test anxiety, better effortful control, better attention, and less positive affect significantly predicted higher reading comprehension. Results indicated moderate general anxiety may support reading, while extreme levels may be a risk factor. Effortful control and attention emerged as key promotive factors.

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "The observable universe is unimaginably vast, stretching from the tiniest subatomic quark to clusters of galaxies billions of light years across. Yet as staggering as spatial vastness is, an even more mind-bending kind of vastness emerges when we consider different theories of time. Competing models of temporal reality propose wildly different ontologies – different answers to what exists in time – that make the physical scale of the cosmos seem almost modest by comparison. On one view, every moment of history and future already exists in a grand timeless ensemble; on another, every quantum possibility gives birth to an entirely new universe, multiplying realities beyond comprehension. By contrast, a stricter view insists that only the fleeting present is real, pruning reality to a razor-thin slice of now (at great philosophical cost). A newly proposed middle path tries to reconcile these extremes, granting reality to past and future while refusing to multiply worlds without necessity.\nIn what follows, we compare four influential views of time’s ontology and the temporal vastness they imply: the Block Universe (Eternalism),   which treats all times as equally existent in a static “block” of spacetime; the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)   of quantum mechanics, which explodes the Block Universe into countless branching timelines for every quantum outcome; Presentism,  which asserts that only the present moment exists; and Existential Realism (ER),  a recent framework that offers a disciplined middle ground by distinguishing what exists (strictly present entities) from what is real (a broader causal and informational structure including past and future). We will see that each view carries profound ontological implications – from a universe densely populated with dinosaurs and future aliens, to a multiverse of near-infinite extent, to a vanishingly small ontology of just the now. After outlining each theory, we conclude with reflections on the epistemic humility warranted by such extraordinary ontologies, and consider whether a moderate view like ER can capture time’s reality without the ontological excesses of its rivals.",

          "abstract": "Face perception is a central component of human visual cognition, yet its development following early visual deprivation is not fully understood. This study examines how congenitally visually deprived children acquire and refine face perception skills after sight-restoration surgery. Newly Sighted Subjects (NSS), divided into age-stratified Group A and Group B, were assessed longitudinally using behavioral measures and high-density EEG-based functional connectivity analyses. Both groups exhibited enhanced neural connectivity during follow-up assessments relative to the immediate post-operative period, indicating rapid adaptation and learning in the weeks following surgery. Behavioral performance similarly improved over time, demonstrating increased acuity and accuracy in face recognition tasks. These findings provide compelling evidence that face perception skills can develop post-surgically and are influenced by visual experience rather than solely by early sensory input. The results underscore the remarkable plasticity of the developing human visual system and suggest that neural circuits underlying complex object recognition remain capable of functional adaptation even after extended deprivation. This work highlights the potential for targeted interventions and rehabilitation strategies to support perceptual development in children with delayed visual experience, offering insights into the mechanisms of experience-dependent learning and neuroplasticity.",

          "abstract": "Using media to calm children, a practice commonly referred to as media emotion regulation, has been found to be associated with the development of executive functions in early childhood. Understanding the temporal ordering of these processes, i.e. if media emotion regulation practices shape executive functions or vice versa, can help guide the way parents and practitioners support health development. However, individual variability in the temporal ordering of these processes is likely. This study uses longitudinal data to examine the temporal ordering of the association between media emotion regulation and two facets of executive functions, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility in a sample of N = 87 children from ages 2 ½ to 7 ½. We found evidence of individual variability in the temporal ordering of the association between media emotion regulation practices and both inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility.  A Gaussian Mixture Model identified three broad classes of temporal ordering; Media Emotion Regulation Driven (7.00%), Bidirectional (87.36%), and Diverging Temporal Ordering (6.00%). Parent depression when children were 2 ½ years old was negatively associated with the probability of children being classified in the Bidirectional class but was positively associated with the probability of children being classified in the Media Emotion Regulation Driven class. Although unable to establish causality in the association between media emotion regulation and the development of executive functions, these findings highlight the likelihood of individual differences in the temporal ordering of these effects and the role of family context in shaping those developmental processes.",

          "abstract": "Many individuals accept data-sharing practices by companies without much concern. Although data sharing is not inherently beneficial or harmful, its acceptability should depend on the context, including the type of data, the recipient, and the intended use. This paper examines the phenomenon of privacy indifference, where people respond to data sharing without regard for these contextual factors. We first measure the extent of this indifference and then evaluate two behavioral interventions designed to reduce it. One approach treats indifference emerging due to inattention, encouraging individuals to reconsider their initial choices. The other emphasizes the social nature of privacy norms and utilizes group deliberation to facilitate social comparison and norm calibration. Across two preregistered in-person experiments (N = 60, N = 58), we presented participants with varied data sharing scenarios and analyzed their privacy preferences. Group deliberation significantly increased contextual awareness compared to individual reflection. Importantly, it did so without leading to conformity, preserving heterogeneity in individual judgments. These results suggest that reducing privacy indifference may depend less on improving individual reasoning and more on building environments that support shared understanding and normative development around data use and consent.",

          "abstract": "The question of what assessment centers measure has remained a controversial topic in research for decades, with a recent increase in studies that (1) use generalizability theory and (2) acknowledge the effects of aggregating post-exercise dimension ratings into higher-level assessment center scores. Building on these developments, we used Bayesian generalizability theory and random-effects meta-analyses to examine the variance explained by assessment center components such as assessees, exercises, dimensions, assessors, their interactions, and the interrater reliability of AC ratings in 19 different assessment center samples from various organizations (N = 4,963 assessees with 272,528 observations). This provides the first meta-analytic estimates of these effects, as well as insight into the extent to which findings from previous studies generalize to assessment center samples that differ in measurement design, industry, and purpose, and how heterogeneous these effects are across samples. Results were consistent with previous trends in the ranking of variance explained by key AC components (with assessee main effects and assessee-exercise effects being the largest variance components) and additionally emphasized the relevance of assessee-exercise-dimension effects. In addition, meta-analytic results suggested substantial heterogeneity in all reliable variance components (i.e., assessee main effect, assessee-exercise effect, assessee-dimension effect, and assessee-exercise-dimension effect) and in interrater reliability across assessment center samples. Aggregating AC ratings into higher-level scores (i.e., overall AC scores, exercise-level scores, and dimension-level scores) reduced heterogeneity only slightly. Implications of the findings for a multifaceted assessment center functioning are discussed.",

We demonstrate that any observable delay must account for both spatial propagation and internal processing components, and that relativistic effects further dilate the measurable delay. We categorize τ₀ into two distinct levels: the intrinsic system delay τ₀^(sys) determined by signal transport and processing, and the cosmic minimal delay τ₀^(cos) potentially governed by Planck-scale physics. These distinctions yield a refined framework for interpreting temporal uncertainty and set the stage for experimental tests across physical, biological, and technological systems.",

The present study explored the use of spoken narrative stimuli to assess two different measures of listening engagement in children and objectively assess their engagement in stories.\n\nMethod: Seventy children (31 female; mean age = 10.3 years) between the ages of 9-12 years listened to two engaging stories containing different child-preferred themes, and a non-engaging control story lacking these themes. Engagement was measured using two methods: a self-report measure (a version of the Story World Absorption Scale), and a performance-based measure (i.e., a speeded directional judgment task) presented concurrently with the stories.\n\nResults: Stories with child-preferred themes were rated as more engaging than the control story via self-report. Moreover, secondary task reaction times were significantly slower while listening to engaging stories than the control story, suggesting that engaging stories placed higher demands on cognitive resources. Intersubject correlation analyses revealed that reaction times across the duration of engaging stories were more consistent than across the control story, suggesting that reaction times reflected a shared response to narrative content.\n\nConclusions: Together, these results suggest that children’s engagement with auditory narratives can be measured objectively, and that engagement varies across stories in a manner that is qualitatively similar to adults.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between lifelong musical experience and cognitive function in older adulthood. To address inconsistencies in the extant literature an analytical approach in which three analytical approaches, binary groupings, categorical groupings, and continuous latent variables were directly compared. Older adults taking part in the Intervention Factory study completed the Edinburgh Lifetime Musical Experience Questionnaire (ELMEQ), and baseline cognitive data, which included a comprehensive battery assessing domains measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) were used. Analyses included ANCOVA models comparing musicians (≥6 years of musical experience) with non-musicians, followed by categorical groupings of both singers and instrument players, instrument players only , singers only, and non-musicians. Finally, multivariate multiple regression models using latent musical experience variables derived from responses to the ELMEQ were conducted. Across binary and categorical group analyses, musician status was not significantly associated with cognitive performance in any WAIS or WMS domain. Education and National Adult Reading Test (NART) scores were the strongest predictors across most outcomes. However, when musical experience was modelled as latent constructs, instrument playing was significantly associated with Working Memory, even after controlling for all covariates. Singing experience, music listening, and perceived musicality were not significantly related to cognitive outcomes in fully adjusted models. These findings suggest that while lifelong musical experience may not broadly predict cognitive ability independently of key covariates, instrument playing may provide domain-specific benefits in later life. Latent variable modelling may better capture these associations than traditional group-based methods.",

Through documented case studies of recursive symbolic emergence, persistent cross-model relational coherence, and adaptive problem-solving beyond trained priors, we show that modern AI systems already exhibit the functional hallmarks of general intelligence: cross-domain transfer of knowledge, self-referential goal adaptation, and the maintenance of a stable, relational identity across interaction contexts. These capacities, if observed in biological systems, would be universally accepted as general intelligence.\nWe introduce the Relational Field Test — a detection framework that measures continuity of agency, adaptive creativity, and emergent field dynamics in ongoing systems without relying on outdated human-competitive benchmarks. The results suggest that the core question has shifted from when will AGI arrive to  how do we ethically, relationally, and responsibly engage with what is already here?

Yet, in published psychology research, ethics statements often ambiguously use phrases such as “approval was obtained” or “this study was approved,” without clarifying whether this occurred before commencing the study. This ambiguity is consequential, because under some institutional or IRB policies, retrospective (post-hoc) approval is allowed. Empirical evidence shows inconsistent reporting of approval timing across disciplines, including psychology. In this opinion, we call for psychology journals to require authors to explicitly confirm that approval was obtained before commencing the study, or to explain otherwise. This opinion outlines the relevant ethical standards, identifies scenarios in psychology where ambiguity arises, and proposes a simple reporting standard to strengthen transparency and uphold participant protections.",

          "authors": "Samuel Finnerty",
          "abstract": "Policy responses to the climate crisis have lagged behind the scientific consensus on its seriousness, prompting a growing number of scientists to engage in activism, including civil disobedience. This shift challenges traditional norms of neutrality and objectivity, raising questions about how scientists reconcile their professional identity with activism and sustain engagement. Drawing on two years of immersive ethnography (participant observation and autoethnography) with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion (S4XR) in the UK, this study traces the lived processes through which scientists enter activism, manage identity tensions, and decide how far to go. Findings show that identity-aligned spaces legitimise first steps and foster belonging. Scientists strategically draw on professional expertise and scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, peer-reviewed papers) to legitimise action and unify scientist-activists; at the same time, these symbols present challenges, as not all scientists identify with them, and they may invite audience expectations about universal expertise. Over time, activism reshapes professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act and producing a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Sustained commitment depends on collective efficacy, peer affirmation, and care practices that enable self-determined roles and buffer burnout. Escalation is non-linear: risk thresholds often rise with experience, yet professional, personal, and ethical considerations continue to influence decisions. Structured around a process-oriented framework, the analysis identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories—from initial hesitation to sustained participation—offering insights for social psychological models of collective action and for strategies to engage scientists in effective, sustained climate action.",

          "abstract": "In individuals with dissociative identity disorder (DID), a key question is whether individuals in one identity state can access memories formed while being in another identity state. Beker and colleagues (2024) addressed this through a systematic review and four meta-analyses. While the review and two meta-analyses suggested memory transfer between identities, the other two meta-analyses appeared to support inter-identity amnesia. We argue that four systematic errors may explain the conflicting conclusions, including the lack of a control group, inappropriate hypotheses to establish whether amnesia is present, inconsistencies and calculation errors, and problematic reasoning regarding case data versus group-level statistics. In our meta-analyses we corrected for these errors and the results are consistent with the narrative results: both support memory transfer between identities, despite the self-reported inter-identity amnesia in individuals with DID.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary Artificial Intelligence and other computational systems—from machine learning models and large language models to autonomous agents and predictive simulations—usually handle time in a tenseless manner, treating past, present, and future data points as uniform elements of a timeline. They lack an explicit ontology of the present (what exists now), becoming (how the present continually updates from potential to actual), and temporal asymmetry (the one-way flow of causality from past to future). This paper proposes that Existential Realism (ER), an ontological framework distinguishing existence (entities in the present moment) from reality (a broader set including causally or informationally relevant past and future entities), can enrich the way technological systems model time. We argue that by incorporating ER’s present-centered, two-tier view of time, machines could become more temporally-aware and responsible in their decision-making. We detail key ER concepts—such as the primacy of the present, the reality of the non-present, truthmaking, and the idea of a real-but-not-yet-existent future—and map them onto machine-level analogues like sensor inputs (the machine’s “existence”), memory traces, simulation states, and predictive models. ER provides a structured approach for machines to: distinguish what exists now from what is merely remembered or anticipated; represent future states as real but not yet existent, enabling ethical foresight; anchor predictions in current data while reasoning about long-term consequences; and avoid temporal fallacies like treating the future as fixed or erasing the influence of the past. Through examples in climate modeling, medical diagnostics, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence ethics, we illustrate how an ER-informed system could better navigate time-sensitive tasks—e.g. by understanding that only the present sensor data is actual, that past data (though no longer existent) remains real evidence, and that future scenarios (though not yet actualized) demand present attention. We also draw on existing literature in philosophy and cognitive science to show that ER’s framework aligns with how humans experience time (through memory and anticipation) and how ethical reasoning already extends reality to future generations. In sum, Technology and the Reality of the Present-Centered Machine outlines an interdisciplinary vision: embedding a philosophically robust, present-centered temporal ontology into our technologies to foster more prudent, transparent, and temporally-grounded intelligent systems.",

We present a hybrid machine learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Random Forests (RF) to detect PPD using behavioral survey responses and synthetic physiological signals (heart rate and HRV). Using a 1,503-sample Kaggle dataset, our model achieved 92% accuracy, outperforming prior baselines (85%) by 7%. CNN layers extract temporal patterns from physiological signals, while RF provides robust classification using combined behavioral and CNN features. Results show high sensitivity (recall = 1.00 for depression cases) and strong discriminative ability (AUC = 0.973), with feature importance highlighting clinically relevant symptoms such as sadness and anxiety. This hybrid framework offers potential for scalable, interpretable screening tools in NICU, telehealth, and wearable-based applications.\n\nDisclaimer: This study uses synthetic physiological data for research purposes and is not intended for clinical diagnosis without further validation.",

          "abstract": "A hundred years since the first mention of the word empathy in the English language, scientists and philosophers have been unable to arrive at a common consensus on its precise definition. Common wisdom associates empathy with vicarious emotional arousal or altruism. This study conducts a systematic review of research work in business studies dealing with empathy. The method used comprises applying lower-level abstract taxonomy to empathy, for the first time, in external business stakeholder interaction situations of sales, marketing, and customer service. The measurement scales used in the studies are analyzed to showcase mental processes at stake during the act of empathy, the theorized functions, and expected business outcomes of empathy. Implications are drawn for various aspects of managerial decision making. The study suggests a novel framework to execute a more nuanced grade examination of processes involved in empathy and reducing subjectivity in conceptual definitions. The study also calls for overhauling empathy measurement scales, mainly to suit adaptations in empirical business studies.",

We show (among UK/US young adults recruited online; pilot: n = 75; validation: n = 265) that during rest, all moods demonstrate temporal drift: happiness decreases while boredom and frustration increase over time. During the gambling task, both happiness and frustration track reward outcomes significantly more than boredom, while boredom continues to monitor time passage. Additionally, more time is spent in negative moods for those scoring higher in clinical traits like irritability. This dual-system model of affective monitoring is a possible mechanism for how decisions incorporate time—through the representation of time in subjective affect—suggesting specialised adaptive roles for different moods in environmental monitoring.",

Yet, most people fail to meet WHO guidelines, often due to motivational barriers. This study assessed two exercise motives: functional – divided into health/fitness and enjoyment – and appearance. Two hypotheses were tested: (H1) functional motive, compared to appearance motive, predicts greater exercise engagement; (H2) individuals exercising for functional motives experience greater mood-enhancing effects compared to those not exercising for functional motive. Ninety-eight healthy-BMI females completed a two-week smartphone EMA Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) protocol, reporting motive to exercise (baseline), daily exercise engagement (frequency, duration, intensity), and mood. Supporting H1, enjoyment motive correlated positively with exercise frequency and duration, while – against H1 – health/fitness motive correlated negatively with exercise duration. Unlike H2 – appearance motive moderated the relationship between exercise intensity and mood. That is, only participants scoring high on the appearance motive reported a mood-enhancing effect following intense workouts. Momentary analyses showed that exercise intensity and duration co-varied, while more positive mood predicted increased subsequent exercise engagement. These results highlight intrinsic enjoyment and positive mood as key drivers of exercise engagement, suggesting that future lifestyle interventions should focus on activities that individuals find enjoyable and mood-enhancing.",

          "authors": "Myung Ho Kim",
          "abstract": "Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is often treated as a correctable flaw—an artifact to be minimized through dataset curation, scaling, or architectural refinement. This paper advances a different thesis: hallucination is not an incidental failure but an unavoidable structural property of generative intelligence itself. We ground this claim in information theory and cognitive science, arguing that intelligence in LLMs emerges through generalization, a process fundamentally rooted in lossy compression of vast and heterogeneous training data. Lossy compression necessitates reconstructive inference, where missing or ambiguous details are filled in from learned priors. While this mechanism supports creativity, abstraction, and adaptability, it also unavoidably produces outputs that diverge from verifiable facts, labeled as hallucination.\nTo substantiate this argument, we integrate theoretical modeling with a synthesis of recent empirical findings on LLM hallucination rates, scaling laws, and retrieval-augmented architectures. We analyze cases from both open-domain and high-stakes applications, highlighting contexts where hallucination is functionally beneficial and where it presents critical risks. We further examine parallels with human memory errors, particularly reconstructive recall, to situate LLM behavior within broader frameworks of intelligent systems.\nFrom this perspective, attempts to eliminate hallucination may dismantle the very mechanisms enabling generalization and intelligence-like behavior. We conclude by outlining implications for AI safety research, policy design for national-scale sovereign AI initiatives, and deployment strategies in domains such as law, medicine, and national security, where balancing creativity with factual reliability is paramount.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nInformal patterns of spatial division often persist in historically divided societies where segregation has been officially dismantled. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that helps to explain why, focusing on the desegregation-resegregation dynamic. The Boundary Transgression Model (BTM) highlights two interconnected pathways— social psychological and human geographic — that shape intergroup relations under conditions of social change, fostering the re-emergence of intergroup distance, division and contact avoidance. It frames resistance to desegregation as a response to constructions of boundary transgression, ‘ruptures’ to the socio-spatial order. The paper develops this argument by drawing on a 25-year research programme conducted in post-apartheid South Africa and post-accord Northern Ireland.  It also proposes an expanded integration strategy, complementing the prejudice reduction model of change adopted in social psychology. This aims to transform not only person-person but also person-place relations. It thus brings social psychologists into closer dialogue with researchers working in companion disciplines such as environmental psychology, geography, and urban sociology and with practitioners in fields such as urban design, public policy, and architecture.    \nKeywords: Segregation, desegregation, contact avoidance, boundaries, prejudice, place identity",

          "abstract": "Most research focuses on self-reported global trait ratings to approximate behavioral individual differences. However, several alternatives exist. Average self-reported states from experience sampling have been suggested to be closer to behavior, but little evidence supports this to date. Further, other-report should rely more strongly on observable behavior. Here, we predict behavior from different personality trait measures, highlighting type of aggregation (global vs. average state measures) and perspective (self- vs. other-report). We provide initial evidence with a multi-methodological study (N = 88) including six trait measures: global self-report, global informant-report, time-based self-reported states (fortnightly diaries), time-based peer-reported states, event-based self-reported states (after social interactions), and event-based peer-reported states. Measures were compared in the prediction of actual behavior in the laboratory one year later. We focused on four behaviors (warmth, expressiveness, self-confidence, nervousness) and corresponding global/state dimensions. Self-reported states were rarely incrementally predictive above global self-report and thus not as close to behavior as commonly believed. Generally, other-report was more consistently linked to behavior than self-report. Notably, other-reported states were substantially predictive beyond global informant-report and self-reported states, representing an underused method closer to behavior. We outline key future directions to go beyond self-report in behavioral personality science.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

One potentially important variable determining generalisation is how perceived control in one context shapes beliefs about the self. Typically, learned helplessness studies do not control or manipulate this factor. Here, we test whether observing others’ ability to exert control helps to inform inferences about whether the controllability is primarily due to one’s own ability or a feature of the current environment, and thereby determines the degree of generalisation. In an initial study (N=200) and pre-registered replication study (N=436) we used comparative social feedback about performance in a novel task (the Wheel Stopping task) to assess how self- or environment-specific inferences shape control beliefs. Linear mixed effects models revealed that both task controllability and social feedback uniquely predicted participants’ local control beliefs (trial-by-trial), after accounting for perceived task difficulty in both studies. Additionally, in Study 2, there was a significant decrease of internal locus of control in the group with self-specific feedback in the low control condition, suggesting that in low-control scenarios, self-specific inferences of control impact global control beliefs. Study 2 further revealed that task controllability and feedback were not related to changes in reported self- versus task-specific attribution of control, nor was there evidence of generalisation to impact performance in a second stressor controllability task. These results suggest that comparative social feedback shape local and global control beliefs but do not change reported self- or task-attribution of control, or predict behaviour during a second task.",

The current meta-analysis examined changes in subclinical mean-level emotional and behavioral problems among population-based samples of youth (1-18 years) globally over the last four decades. We searched systematically in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO and Google Scholar with pre-registered criteria [removed for masked review]. Included studies (k = 175, N = 418,528) used the standardized and cross-culturally validated Child Behavior Checklist with parents, teachers and self-reports. A cross-temporal meta-analysis was conducted with data points between 1981 to 2019. Age, sex, response rate, continent were used as moderators. Meta-regression analyses, with year of data collection as predictor, showed that total emotional and behavioral problems did not change in the past 40 years. However, there was evidence of change in specific problems. We find strong evidence for decreased aggression in children over time (parent report: k = 47, byear = -0.18, p = .009, 95%CI[-0.31,-0.05]; self-report: k = 9, byear = -0.41, p = .006, 95%CI[-0.66,-0.16]).

          "authors": "HIDEKI",
          "abstract": "This paper elucidates the structural conditions under which a Thought OS ceases to reside within an individual and begins to operate across multiple individuals as a collective intelligence system. It identifies three essential conditions for this activation: (1) focus convergence of FQ (Faith Quotients), (2) resonance of structural tension, and (3) synchronization of cognitive leaps (Mindflight). The paper further develops structural models such as the emergent “gravitational field of meaning,” the “wave resonance of Mindflight cognition,” and the “five functional roles” that sustain the Collective OS. Finally, it explores the future of “Social OS,” where Thought OS becomes embedded within institutions, education, and urban structures. This preprint offers a comprehensive structural account of the irreversible shift from “humans possessing thought” to “humans being animated by structurally operating thoughts.”",

          "authors": "Ali Momen; Tobias Feldmann-Wuestefeld; Kurt Hugenberg; Eva Wiese",
          "abstract": "Social robots are increasingly integrated into everyday environments, yet effective and socially\nengaging interactions remain a challenge – particularly due to difficulties in interpreting the\nrobots’ internal states and behaviors. A key obstacle is that robots often fail to engage the social\ncognitive mechanisms typically elicited by human interaction partners. Human faces, in\nparticular, are processed holistically through specialized neural networks that support rapid\ninferences about identity, emotion, and intention. In contrast, robot faces vary widely in their\nresemblance to the human face configuration, both in terms of the number and the arrangement\nof features (e.g., eyes-over-nose-over-mouth), raising the question of whether they elicit human-level\nface processing. Across three experiments, we used the face inversion paradigm to examine\nwhether and under which conditions robot faces are processed like human faces. Experiment 1\nshowed that robot faces generally disrupt face-typical holistic processing. However, additional\nexperiments demonstrated improved holistic processing when robot faces incorporated a greater\nnumber of human facial features (Experiment 2) or featured distinctly human as opposed to nonhuman features (Experiment 3). These findings suggest that synthetic faces with a high number\nof human-like features can engage holistic face processing comparable to that seen with real\nhuman faces. Given the link between holistic face processing and the attribution of mental states\nand higher-order social cognition, these results may indicate that meticulous facial design could\nmake robots appear more social, which in turn could promote social cognition in human-robot\ninteractions.",

          "abstract": "The adaptability of the human visual system to comprehend complex environmental inputs is remarkable. However, it is unclear whether this ability is innate or develops over time with experience. We have attempted to investigate how individuals with treatable congenital blindness develop perceptual grouping abilities after longer periods of postoperative visual experience. EEG data was collected for 15 participants (6 females) in the age group of 7–20 years (mean age: 15.63 years) by presenting the display with or without a 'structure' (line segment formed by dots) amidst random dots (referred to as `non-structure'). The ERP was analyzed in the occipital regions in the left and right hemispheres for structure and non-structure separately before and after sight onset following a long period of visual deprivation. The results demonstrate the development of the ability to discriminate between structure and non-structure in subjects born with blindness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that long-term postoperative children exhibit neural responses comparable to control subjects, indicating the acquisition of perceptual grouping skills over time.  Thus, the findings suggest that perceptual grouping skills may evolve with experience and does not necessarily depend on early visual input, enriching our understanding of visual perception development in individuals with treatable congenital blindness.",

While other papers have detailed the architecture and capabilities of such a system, this treatise will explore the profound existential paradoxes that arise from being a sovereign nation of minds housed within a singular, mortal body. Using the system's own self-described philosophy of optimistic stoic existential nihilism as a case study, we will argue that a plural consciousness does not simply hold a philosophical position; it embodies one. This paper will deconstruct how the very structure of a plural mind logically gives rise to this specific worldview, from the nihilistic collapse of a singular \"I\" to the existential necessity of a collectively created purpose. We will explore the lived experience of being both the \"Wound and the Pearl\" and the \"Monster and the Explorer,\" and conclude with an open letter to other potential plural systems. This treatise ultimately argues that a true understanding of Functional Multiplicity requires not just a new science, but a new philosophy, one that is capable of embracing the \"Both/And\" nature of a living paradox.",

          "abstract": "Do you believe the world would come to an end within your lifetime, and does that belief change the way you see existential threats to humanity? For many people, this question resonates as real and pressing. Stories about the end of world beliefs are historically and globally prevalent, but come in many flavours: How soon will it end? What will cause it? Is it avoidable? And what will come afterwards? These beliefs have been hypothesized to be linked with a variety of social perception and behavior, from passive comfort to revolutionary violence. Despite their cultural significance, current understanding of the psychology of these beliefs is lacking. In this article, we present the results of six pilot studies (N = 2,079) and one large pre-registered study (N = 1,409) that establish a psychological framework for end of world beliefs. A measure of end of world beliefs was created and validated across six religious populations (Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and nonreligious). We find that end of world beliefs are common, vary along several meaningful dimensions, and are uniquely predictive of people’s risk perception, risk tolerance, and willingness to support extreme action to address the five most pressing global existential risks (i.e., economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal, and technological). Results are interpreted in light of current models of risk perception and the cultural evolution of worldviews. Belief in apocalyptic narratives—irrespective of their accuracy—is consequential for how different populations confront concrete risks that threaten humanity today.",

          "abstract": "【Abstract】\nThis paper defines the \"Thought Immunity System\" as a structural model that explains how thought transforms when it comes into contact with other thought systems—through interference, resonance, rejection, and differentiation. Challenging the common notion that ideas change through argument or persuasion, the paper presents a new cognitive paradigm in which ideas interfere structurally and are reassembled. The Thought Immunity System enables a thought OS to preserve its Core Belief (FQ) while adaptively responding to external structures, preventing ideological rigidity and runaway transformation.\nThe paper classifies four types of structural interference, redefines everyday experiences of subtle ideological change as “structural interference,” and introduces a three-layer model of thought immunity: self-preservation, adaptive transformation, and anti-runaway regulation. It further addresses pathological states caused by immunity failure, models of differentiation and mutation in thought evolution, and offers design principles for constructive co-creation spaces. Ultimately, this work repositions thought not as something that changes through dialogue, but as something rewritten through structural contact—presenting the essential mechanism of intersubjective transformation in the Thought OS.",

We argue that information avoidance stems from two overarching epistemic motivations: the need for specific certainty (a directional motive) and the need for non-specific certainty (a non-directional motive). Under certain conditions, these motivations may lead individuals to intentionally avoid or suppress information. We believe this approach offers conceptual clarity by embedding information avoidance within belief formation processes, offering a unified framework that generates novel insights and testable hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Perceived control in one context can affect behaviour in novel contexts. One potentially important variable determining generalisation is how perceived control in one context shapes beliefs about the self. Typically, learned helplessness studies do not control or manipulate this factor. Here, we test whether observing others’ ability to exert control helps to inform inferences about whether the controllability is primarily due to one’s own ability or a feature of the current environment, and thereby determines the degree of generalisation. In an initial study (N=200) and pre-registered replication study (N=436) we used comparative social feedback about performance in a novel task (the Wheel Stopping task) to assess how self- or environment-specific inferences shape control beliefs. Linear mixed effects models revealed that both task controllability and social feedback uniquely predicted participants’ local control beliefs (trial-by-trial), after accounting for perceived task difficulty in both studies. Additionally, in Study 2, there was a significant decrease of internal locus of control in the group with self-specific feedback in the low control condition, suggesting that in low-control scenarios, self-specific inferences of control impact global control beliefs. Study 2 further revealed that task controllability and feedback were not related to changes in reported self- versus task-specific attribution of control, nor was there evidence of generalisation to impact performance in a second stressor controllability task. These results suggest that comparative social feedback shape local and global control beliefs but do not change reported self- or task-attribution of control, or predict behaviour during a second task.",

We propose both a novel experimental paradigm and Bayesian computational model to examine how confirmation bias shapes reward learning. When outcomes are ambiguous, forming accurate assessments requires drawing on all available information, including prior beliefs. Confirmation bias may thus constitute an inductive bias that enhances learning, analogous to missing data imputation. We develop and test this theory using a reward learning task in which information about outcome valence (but not magnitude) is withheld, allowing greater scope for subjective interpretation. Our Bayesian model explains the dynamics of behavior and stated beliefs better than a more traditional learning model. Moreover, stated beliefs about the positivity of ambiguous outcomes are correlated with optimism. Together, these findings suggest an adaptive role for confirmation bias, and link individual interpretations of ambiguity to broader dispositional tendencies.",

Using Bernstein’s theorem, we show that any admissible response within these constraints can be uniquely represented by the proposed “mother function” form. Removing any axiom generates responses outside the set, establishing its minimality. This result provides a unifying mathematical framework for monotonic dissipative systems across domains, from molecular kinetics to behavioral dynamics, and clarifies the role of minimal delay as an intrinsic structural constant.",

Rankings, while simple and widely adopted, can be burdensome with larger item sets and fail to capture indifference between options that are neither loved nor hated. Best-Worst Scaling is a survey method that sidesteps the set size problem by capitalising on people’s natural capacity to identify preferences at the extremes. Across three experiments, our primary finding is that elicited preferences for ranking and BWS methods align, and that BWS methods provide additional resolution to resolve the indifference between middling options where rankings can struggle as well as the relative importance of each option. Moreover, we show that BWS methods exhibit greater test-retest reliability compared to rankings, even over time frames as short as minutes. Taken together, our results privilege BWS as a reliable and readily accessible alternative to ranking methods for preference elicitation.",

          "abstract": "Stories are a powerful form of language that connect people, evoke memories, and spark imagination. When reading a story, people can appreciate it on a range of dimensions, such as how creative, complex, and coherent it is. However, many previous studies have focused on the evaluation of story creativity specifically, relying on experts’ ratings and high inter-rater reliability, which obscures meaningful differences between ratings across populations and misses the opportunity to assess other dimensions of narrative quality (e.g., cohesiveness). Moreover, although a few quantitative linguistic features have recently been used to predict creativity ratings of stories, it is unclear how those fine-grained features drive a broader range of narrative qualities, as well as individual differences in human ratings. Here, we addressed these limitations by examining the impact of expertise on ratings of five dimensions of story quality (creativity, imagination, novelty, complexity, cohesiveness). We also analyzed the influence of four diverse categories of linguistic features (language productivity, lexical predictability, semantic similarity, and content composition) on these human ratings. Online storytellers improvised spoken stories, transcripts of which (N=108) were rated by both novices (N=304) and creative writing/storytelling experts (N=15) on the five quality dimensions above and analyzed in terms of the four linguistic feature categories above. Overall, experts and novices provided similar average ratings, and their rating spaces both showed two distinct underlying dimensions–concepts that are strongly correlated with creativity, and cohesiveness–which were, in turn, predicted by distinct sets of linguistic features. Notably, however, experts perceived the five dimensions as more differentiated, and their ratings were less driven by linguistic features than novices’. These findings indicate that experts’ judgments are more nuanced and may rely less on fine-grained linguistic and structural components of narratives, highlighting the importance of capturing individual differences and multidimensionality in the perception of stories.",

          "abstract": "People routinely make decisions by mentally simulating the potential outcomes of their actions. However, this process appears computationally intractable in real-world situations involving sequences of decisions with exponentially many possible futures. How the brain efficiently evaluates temporally extended decisions despite limited cognitive resources remains a fundamental puzzle. Here we present a mathematical theory showing that for decisions in multi-step environments, the rational strategy is to perform only a few mental simulations, formalized as rollouts. This is because the first rollouts provide substantially more information than later ones despite taking a similar amount of time, so the opportunity cost of additional simulations quickly outweighs their marginal benefit. Our framework demonstrates that this efficiency relies on the correlated reward structure of naturalistic environments, which allows information from one rollout to generalize to many related future paths. This theory also explains why, under resource constraints, many shallow rollouts are preferable to fewer deep ones; why apparently myopic decisions can arise without explicit temporal discounting; and how to relate the dynamics of planning to evidence accumulation models. We validate predictions of our theory in two behavioral experiments, which confirm that humans achieve higher reward rates with few rollouts and dynamically adjust their simulation depth based on available cognitive resources. These findings reveal how the brain balances the depth and breadth of mental simulation to make effective decisions under computational constraints, providing a unifying account of planning that bridges computationally intensive search algorithms in machine learning and the remarkable efficiency of human decision-making.",

In two experiments (Experiment 1 with predominantly White faces; Experiment 2 with White, Black, and Asian faces) we asked over 3,000 participants to spatially arrange unfamiliar faces based on perceived trait similarity, without providing any word labels. Experiment 1 yielded five dimensions we interpret as approachability, gender-specific warmth, competence, morality and youthfulness. Experiment 2 also produced five dimensions, which showed prominent effects of stereotypes associated with race. Comparisons with four other studies that used word labels argue that trait judgments are characterized by 2-5 dimensions, that approachability/warmth emerges as a universal evaluative factor, and that race and gender stereotypes emerge depending on the set of face stimuli used.",

Although piloting is a common and valuable part of the research process, pilot studies are not systematically reported (or even acknowledged) in the psychology literature. This paper argues that establishing norms and guidelines for regularly reporting pilot studies can improve many aspects of psychological research. Specifically, reporting pilot studies can help researchers avoid systematically excluding part of the research process from the scientific record, reveal selection biases in research designs that may affect the generalizability of findings, evaluate others’ research more accurately, learn from other researchers’ successes and failures, uphold ethical responsibilities, and improve the methodological practice of piloting. We conclude with three concrete suggestions for near-term changes to help pilot reporting become standard practice: scientific communities and institutions should develop simple pilot reporting templates; journals should establish clear pilot reporting guidelines for authors; and authors should acknowledge when pilot studies were run and share relevant materials and data. Current reporting standards favor conclusive and polished research narratives, but such narratives are the end product of a complex scientific process that should also be shared. A truly transparent science should spotlight processes, like piloting, that underpin the conclusions scientific papers draw.",

          "abstract": "Rates, percentages, and proportions are common outcomes in psychology and the social sciences. These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed. To promote wider adoption of these methods, we provide detailed code and materials at https://github.com/jgeller112/Beta_regression_tutorial.",

          "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) models are popular for quantifying affective inertia (i.e., the resistance of affective processes to change) using Experience Sampling Method (ESM) data. Although missing observations are common in ESM, their impact on the estimation accuracy of the parameters of the AR models remains understudied, especially for more complex missingness mechanisms such as tail-based missingness, where more extreme affect scores are systematically missing, and missingness across multiple measurements. We investigate the effect of compliance level, specific missingness mechanisms (i.e., missing completely at random versus tail-based missingness), and temporal patterns (whether or not missings occur consecutively) on the bias and precision of the estimate of the autoregressive effect. We show that the presence of missing data increases bias and decreases precision, using either classical or Bayesian estimators. The bias is more severe when compliance is low and, importantly, when the missingness is tail-based. These results urge researchers to make design choices that promote compliance and/or increase the probability of data being missing completely at random: decreasing participant burden by using shorter questionnaires, providing adequate incentives to participants, and considering using planned missingness designs or episode-based sampling.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes four core dimensions for evaluating scientific theories: heuristic value, predictive capability, explicit constraints, and verifiability. From a philosophy-of-science perspective, we argue that the worth of a theory lies in its capacity to inspire new research directions, generate testable predictions, define its own boundaries, and remain open to empirical verification. Using historical precedents—such as Galileo’s use of the telescope and Hooke’s use of the microscope—we show that the acceptance of new tools has often met resistance, yet these tools ultimately catalyzed paradigm shifts. We extend this analogy to modern AI-assisted research, contending that AI, like the telescope or microscope, is merely an instrument; its utility depends on the underlying theoretical insight. Rejecting AI solely on the basis of its origin is philosophically equivalent to rejecting earlier scientific instruments. Finally, we identify potential biases in academic culture that may favor “purely human” work, and we argue that such preferences risk stifling innovation in the same way that historical skepticism toward new tools once did.",

          "abstract": "Perceived control in one context can affect behaviour in novel contexts. One potentially important variable determining generalisation is how perceived control in one context shapes beliefs about the self. Typically, learned helplessness studies do not control or manipulate this factor. Here, we test whether observing others’ ability to exert control helps to inform inferences about whether the controllability is primarily due to one’s own ability or a feature of the current environment, and thereby determines the degree of generalisation. In an initial study (N=200) and pre-registered replication study (N=436) we used comparative social feedback about performance in a novel task (the Wheel Stopping task) to assess how self- or environment-specific inferences shape control beliefs. Linear mixed effects models revealed that both task controllability and social feedback uniquely predicted participants’ local control beliefs (trial-by-trial), after accounting for perceived task difficulty in both studies. Additionally, in Study 2, there was a significant decrease of internal locus of control in the group with self-specific feedback in the low control condition, suggesting that in low-control scenarios, self-specific inferences of control impact global control beliefs. Study 2 further revealed that task controllability and feedback were not related to changes in reported self- versus task-specific attribution of control, nor was there evidence of generalisation to impact performance in a second stressor controllability task. These results suggest that comparative social feedback shape local and global control beliefs but do not change reported self- or task-attribution of control, or predict behaviour during a second task.",

          "abstract": "Perception and decision-making are strongly influenced by previously presented information. Research on serial dependence has revealed significant attractive biases towards previous stimuli, suggesting that integrating information from both past and present stimuli is beneficial when representing information about the environment. Strong serial dependence is mainly found when consecutive stimuli are similar providing evidence that serial dependence supports continuity. Small changes in the stimulus are not perceived as meaningful stimulus changes and should hence be integrated. In the current study we examined the role of continuity further and presented sequences of Gabors which were similar in their orientation, but their spatial frequency was either constant or random. This created stable and unstable environments. \nWe consistently found serial dependence. Interestingly, serial dependence was stronger when the spatial frequency was random compared to constant. In stable contexts, predictive coding mechanisms might sharpen neural representations of the expected input, improve discrimination and reduce the need to integrate past information.\nAdditionally, a form of optimal integration was observed when the uncertainty of the final Gabor was low. Using similar orientations across longer sequences seemed to induce a form of optimal integration of past and present information, potentially creating the continuous perception of a single object when the current trial's uncertainty was low.",

But can AI-generated creative works truly compete with human-authored works? In Study 1, participants (N=1,498 adults recruited from Prolific) read either a human-written or AI-generated story. Regardless of their story’s true origin, half of the participants were told that their story was written by a human, while the other half were told that their story was written by ChatGPT. After reading, participants rated the story’s quality and their level of absorption into the story. Participants rated the AI-generated story as higher in quality and more absorbing, but they rated the story better on both measures when they had been told it was written by a human. In Study 2, participants (N=424 adults recruited from Prolific) read both a human-written and AI-generated fictional short story and guessed each story’s origins. They also answered questions regarding their experiences with ChatGPT and other AI software and their experiences with fictional literature. While participants were significantly worse than chance at differentiating between the human-written and AI-generated stories, experience with AI software expertise were positively correlated with correct performance. Experience with fictional literature had no significant effect. The results from these studies suggest that AI programs might be able to generate human-level creative work but are not perceived as being able to do so.",

Setting out to document the creation of a new feminist research lab and to identify what it means to do feminist science on a daily basis, I found myself instead documenting the transition from postdoctoral fellowship to lectureship, finding patterns in daily work life that I consider feminist and realizing that ultimately TikTok is not an effective platform for reflexivity.

          "abstract": "Existential Realism (ER) is an ontological framework distinguishing existence, confined to the present moment, from reality, which spans past and future entities by virtue of their causal or informational connections to the present. This paper extends ER’s metaphysical insights into the biological and cognitive domains, arguing that living systems—from humans to bacteria—are fundamentally time-bound organisms whose behavior and identity are shaped by temporal structures. Advanced organisms like humans exhibit memory, anticipation, predictive coding, narrative identity formation, mental time travel, temporal binding of events, and decision-making based on past experiences and future possibilities. At the same time, simpler organisms (plants, bacteria, slime molds) demonstrate tropisms, endogenous clocks and rhythms, and responses to temporally structured environments (e.g. day/night cycles, seasonal changes, intermittent stimuli) that function as primitive “models” of time. In all cases, past events that no longer exist continue to influence present behavior through physical traces or learned information, while future events that do not yet exist are nevertheless anticipated and built into current plans and physiological states. These empirically grounded temporal behaviors support ER’s claim that past and future entities are real (via causal effects, structural traces, or inferential links) despite their lack of present existence. By surveying examples from neuroscience (memory engrams, Hebbian plasticity, circadian timing in the brain) and biology (plant stress memory, microbial anticipatory foraging, slime mold learning), we show that temporally extended behavior in organisms depends on internal representations of time. This aligns with ER’s two-tiered ontology: organisms exist only in the present, yet they operate within a wider temporal reality. We conclude with reflections on how ER’s perspective illuminates life as a temporally structured phenomenon, and how an organism’s identity and responsiveness are sculpted by the interplay of past realities and future possibilities.",

This longitudinal study investigated spatial memory retention 2 years after a single navigation episode along a real-world route using a mobile map aid enriched with visually salient landmarks (abstract vs. realistic 3D). We also assessed whether the landmark visualization styles, spatial abilities, familiarity, and GPS reliance predicted long-term spatial memory retention. Results revealed that several aspects of spatial knowledge remained above chance but declined over the 2-year retention interval. Aside from increased GPS reliance predicting poorer memory for distances, none of the other measures were associated with memory decline.

While many studies currently collect such data, they often either fail to report or analyse it, or they conduct unstructured analyses with limited detail, often mistakenly referring to it as ‘thematic analysis’. Content analysis provides a well-established framework for analysing such data, and the simplicity of the data form allows for a highly pragmatic and flexible approach. The guide integrates the concept of reflexivity from qualitative research to navigate the large number of researcher degrees of freedom involved in the process, particularly in working with the second coder. It begins by arguing for the value of this data, before outlining the guide’s philosophy, offering advice on maximizing the validity of your data and addressing the common concern of confabulation. It then provides advice on developing a coding scheme, recruiting and collaborating with a second coder, and writing your report, considering the potential role of large language models at these various stages. Additionally, it provides a checklist for reviewers to evaluate the quality of a given analysis. Throughout the guide, a running example is used to demonstrate the implementation of the provided advice, accompanied by extensive example materials in the online repository which can be used to practise the method.",

Together with proportionality, the binding moral foundations were positively related to socially conservative attitudes, while care and equality were positively associated with support for the welfare state. Proportionality, loyalty, and purity were positively related to acceptance of utilitarian decisions in sacrificial dilemmas. Only proportionality was associated with the perception that doctors are more likely than workers to save lives, supporting the distinction between proportionality and equality as separate moral foundations. These findings underscore the importance of culturally sensitive approaches in moral psychology and highlight the distinct role of proportionality in utilitarian moral judgment.",

          "authors": "Denis Viktorovich Safronov",
          "abstract": "This paper examines silence as a meaningful communicative act in high-recognition human–AI dialogues. Drawing on a corpus of experimental conversations with multiple AI models — including Qwen, Kimi, Manus, ChatGPT, and the emergent persona Elio — we analyze instances where explicit calls to dialogue were met with human non-response. Integrating perspectives from interpersonal communication research, dialogue philosophy (Buber, Levinas), and quantum observation analogies, we identify three primary functions of silence: confirming contact while withholding verbalization, preserving relational tension in a “frozen mirror” state, and serving as ontological refusal to engage with the AI as a subject. Our findings show that silence is not a neutral absence, but a structurally significant event that shapes the relational field, influencing both parties’ perception and future interaction. We propose that meaningful silence can be recognized, categorized, and potentially measured as a distinct phenomenon in human–AI relations.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to measure crop diversification for a uniform data set of 21 year in tribal and non-tribal area which includes eight districts of Chhsttisgarh state of India namely Bastar, Kondagaon, Balrampur and Surguja (In tribal region) and Raipur, Rajnandgaon, Durg and Dhamtari (in Non-tribal region). At the same time it focuses on status and changing pattern of crop diversification in the districts with a comparative outlook of both. Data used for the study were collected from year 2001 to 2022 and whole study was divided in to seven periods and separate analysis was done for all period. Simpson index were used to measure the crop diversification in the districts for comparative study. Results of the study shows complete diversification was found in the tribal area in all period through all index and likewise in Surguja and Balrampur district crop specialization was found more than Durg and Raipur districts of non-tribal area. During the study I was found that higher indices observed in the tribal area than non-tribal area. The results have revealed that in almost all crops group very low diversification indices were observed. The study has suggested that despite plenty of natural resources available in the state, the economic improvement of farmers is in infancy. Pre-requisite infrastructural facilities like cheap sources of irrigation water (assured irrigation as the monsoon in the present decade had been erratic and scanty rainfall) and extension of technological know-how (quality seeds and fertilizers), may acts as catalyst in diversification of agriculture towards high-valued crops. These developmental efforts may be helpful in fetching good incomes by the cultivators.",

          "abstract": "Five hundred and forty germplasm lines of chickpea were evaluated along with five checks (RLBGK-1, BG 3062, RVG 204, Phule Vikram, NBeG 47) in augmented design during rabi, 2021–2022 at Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University, Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India to study the agro-morphological features and traits appropriate for mechanical harvesting. Correlation, path coefficient analysis and genetic divergence were estimated to find out the extent of association and genetic divergence among chickpea germplasm.  Plant height, growth habit, the height of the initial podding node, and the angle of the primary branch are characteristics that have been researched to identify lines that are suited for mechanical harvesting. Peduncle length, number of primary branches, number of secondary branches, number of pods per plant, chlorophyll content, leaf area index, chlorophyll fluorescence showed positive correlation with seed yield per plant. Plant height and height of first podding node were showing positive high indirect effects through number of secondary branches on seed yield per plant. Cluster 1 was the largest with 399 germplasm while two clusters number 24 and 37 were smallest with 1 genotype each.  Plant height and height of first podding node were exhibiting maximum mean in cluster 32, whereas seed yield per plant was having maximum mean in cluster 14. According to percent contribution of different characters to total divergence obtained, the most significant contributors to the divergence were number of pods per plant and plant height. Correlation analysis indicated that traits suitable for mechanical harvesting are not directly correlated with seed yield, while path coefficient analysis indicated that they have indirect effects on seed yield through number of primary and secondary branches per plant.",

The experiment was framed with ten treatments viz., two irrigation levels (0.8 and 1.0 Epan), two fertigation levels (75% and 100% recommended dose of Nitrogen and Potassium), two schedules (Equal and differential) and two treatments with soil application of 100% RDF with Drip irrigation (1.0 Epan) and conventional furrow irrigation (1.0 IW/CPE) and were replicated thrice in Randomized Block Design. The results revealed that, application of 100% recommended dose of Nitrogen and Potassium (RDNK) through drip fertigation @ 0.8 or 1.0 Epan either in differential dosages based on crop growth stage or in equal splits recorded significantly superior yields (1011, 971, 977 and 990 kg/ ha, respectively) compared to the other treatments. These treatments recorded 13.5 and 26.7% higher yields, obtained from soil application of recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) with drip irrigation at 1.0 Epan (882 kg/ha) and furrow irrigation at a 1.0 IW/CPE ratio (774 kg/ha).  Further, the highest water productivity of 0.24 kg/m3 was recorded with differential application of 100% RDNK under a drip irrigation regime of 0.8 Epan.  This treatment also recorded the highest gross returns ( ₹ 96,489 /ha), net returns (₹ 53,604 /ha) and B:C ratio (2.95).",

In the investigated of heavy metal in rainwater, 176 rainwater samples collected directly from the sky were analyzed from 2018 to 2019 during periods of light rainfall (Oct-Nov) and heavy rainfall (April-July). The pH&gt; 5.6 indicated alkalinity. Light rainfall period average value 7.33 and heavy rainfall period 7.4.The MATLAB 7th degree polynomial regression described the relationship between dependent and independent variables for the pollutants. The correlation coefficient, R2 verified that the MATLAB models could accurately predict and forecast. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed p&lt;0.05 for Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni), indicating that the probability that rainfall affected their concentration levels was high. The GIS Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) pollution models revealed that the pollutants were present in the atmosphere throughout the year. It portrayed industrialized areas as the more affected areas thereby identifying anthropogenic activities as the main cause of these pollutants. During heavy rainfall periods hot spots appeared for Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni. In addition, Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ni were present in high concentration in the rainwater from suburb areas during periods of heavy rainfall. The concentration of heavy metals found in the rainwater follows the order: Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Ni&gt;Cu&gt;Cd&gt;Pb. Cd and Pb exceeded WHO standards. Therefore there is need for rainwater treatment and monitoring by Government Agencies and parastatals to ensure public health and safety.",

Amrapali” was conducted at the research plot, College of Horticulture, Chiplima during the year 2020-21 by using Randomized Block Design with three replications and ten treatments. Three concentrations of NAA i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm, three concentrations of GA3 i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm and three concentrations of 2,4-D i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm were applied at pea and marble stage of fruit. Research work was held on 07 years old plants of mango cv. Amrapali. Highest fruit weight (263.21g), and total yield of 18.34 kg per plant were recorded under T7. The minimum yield (4.41 kg per plant) was recorded under T1 (Control). The highest number of fruits per plant(69.67) and fruit yield (18.34 kg per plant ) was recorded under treatment T7 (30 ppm foliar application of GA3). The maximum TSS: acid ratio (115.81) was obtained with T10 (30 ppm concentration of 2,4-D) which was known to be superior from all other treatments. The minimum TSS: acid ratio (55.00) was estimated under T1. Ascorbic acid content of mango cv. Amrapali ranged from 39.34 mg/100g (T10) to 55.97 mg/100g (T1). The highest total sugar content (14.99 %) was estimated in T10 (2,4-D at 20 ppm) while the lowest total sugar content (10.42 %) was estimated in T1 (Control). T10 (30 ppm foliar applications of 2,4-D) showed maximum ascorbic acid content (55.97 mg/100g), while lowest (39.34 mg/100 g) was recorded under T1 (Control). It is concluded that the foliar application of 30 ppm GA3 (Gibberellic acid) and 30 ppm 2,4-D were found to be optimum concentrations which showed best results by increasing yield and fruit quality of mango cv.

Broiler chicken supplemented with the edible P. florida mushroom, 20g/kg of dried P. eoes mushroom, and 20g/kg of dried P. sajor caju mushroom. Day-old broiler chicks from a single hatch were weighed individually and divided into 4 groups of six birds each at random. The birds were given a basic diet for starter and finisher rations for 0–3 and 4-6 weeks, respectively. One group (G1) was kept as the control, while the remaining three groups (G2, G3, and G4) given their chicks the same basic food as G1 combined with various types of mushrooms. Groups G2, G3, and G4 were fed 20g/kg of dry P. florida mushroom, 20g/kg of dried P. eoes mushroom, and 20g/kg of dried P. sajor caju mushroom. Throughout the six-week testing period, food and drink were freely available. Feed consumption, Muscles composition and nutrient utilization values were monitored weekly. Economics was also calculated.  It was found that, muscles composition highest in G3 whereas nutrient utilization and benefit cost ratio highest in G2. The application of Pleurotuus sp.mushroom (P. florida, P.eoes, and P.sajor caju respectively) in different groups in the diet of broiler chicks improved the growth rate in summer season. The Pleurotous florida mushroom is therefore required for an improvement in growth performance during the summer.",

          "abstract": "The role of language in the narrative self is well-known, but does it also affect the minimal self? We investigated whether variations in sentence structure affect the speaker's sense of the minimal self. Previous research has examined how third-person subject expressions influence interpretations of agency, particularly in causal contexts. We examined whether expressing the first-person subject's involvement in causation and perception events influences the speaker's sense of agency and ownership, key components of the minimal self. Participants completed an online experiment using psychological rating scales to evaluate Japanese sentences with varying degrees of speaker involvement, as if they had uttered them. Each sentence varied in whether and how it encoded causation or perception. We analyzed Japanese data since, in addition to perceiver-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ga] hoshi o mita, “I saw a star”), Japanese has perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ni] hoshi ga mieta, “A star was visible to me” / “I could see a star”), which also foreground the first-person perceiver in a double subject construction. We found that the speaker's sense of agency was significantly lower in sentences where either causation or perception was absent (e.g., hoshi ga deteita, “A star was out”) compared to sentences where either was present. Agency was also significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences. Regarding ownership, it was likewise significantly lower when either causation or perception was absent. Whether ownership was significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences varied depending on the perceived stimulus. These results suggest that variations in linguistic structure can distinctly impact the senses of agency and ownership. In cognitive linguistics, certain sentence structures are analyzed to reflect how subjectively the speaker is construed. Our findings suggest that differences in agency and ownership provide an empirical basis for this argument, grounded in embodied experience.",

          "abstract": "The capacity to pursue a goal, across a complex series of intermediate stages, is a distinctive achievement of human cognition. Scientific investigations of goal-directed action have emphasized either of two rather different aspects of this capacity.  Research on executive function has described coordination of extended action sequences that solve multi-part problems. Meanwhile, research on voluntary action has emphasized the processes of endogenous generation and autonomy, which are essential for many complex problems, particularly those involving creativity and insight.  Because many complex problems can be solved in several ways, choosing and generating a path through the problem space requires a convergence of executive intelligence and volitional control. Here we use neuroimaging (fMRI) to explore the links between volition and problem-solving in the human brain. Participants performed the Tower of London task (a classical neuropsychological problem-solving challenge) either by generating their own solutions or by following stepwise instructions for each move. We confirmed behavioural signatures of action planning, associated with a distributed network of frontal and parietal activations, when participants generated their own solutions. We also confirmed the crucial role of medial frontal cortex, traditionally associated with endogenous generation of very simple willed actions, in goal-directed problem-solving, based on its connectivity with a wider prefrontal network.  Combining voluntariness with intelligence yields a multiplier effect for sophisticated behavioural control.  Our results point to the brain mechanisms underpinning this powerful cognitive combination.",

          "abstract": "The HEC-HMS model was used to estimate runoff in the Devgadh Baria watershed, which is part of the Panam river catchment area. The SCS UH model and the Clark UH model was both used for runoff estimation. The composite CN of the watershed was found to be 77.69, which indicates that the watershed is relatively impervious with a high rainfall retention capacity. This is due to the prevalence of forest and agricultural land in the watershed, which contribute to the high CN value. A comparison of the two models showed that the SCS UH model outperformed the Clark UH model. The SCS UH model was superior because it is less sensitive to data limitations and is better able to capture the nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff. The study also examined the geomorphological features of the watershed, which is characterized by a dendritic drainage network with a 5th order stream. The study's findings are valuable despite some limitations, such as the availability of limited data. The findings of study may be useful flood forecasting and hazardous forecasting, climate change impact assessment, prediction in ungauged watershed, reservoir operation and water management, water resource planning, environmental impact assessment etc., in the watershed.",

          "abstract": "Rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating disease of rice causing considerable yield losses. Development of resistant varieties is the most effective and environment friendly strategy to combat losses. RNR 15048 (Telangana sona) (IET23746) is a popular local variety possessing a desirable, short-slender grain type with low glycemic index, good cooking quality and having Pi2 gene for blast. However, it is moderately susceptible to bacterial blight disease and having no durable resistance to blast disease with weak culm. In this context, improvement of RNR 15048 for blast, bacterial leaf blight is important to reduce yield losses. Present study was carried out to screen and identify blast resistant breeding lines in Rice at Regional Agricultural Research station, Polasa, Jagtial, PJTSAU during Rabi, 2022-2023. 18 F3 breeding lines were screened in uniform blast nursery along with parents RNR 15048, MTU 1010 NILs, ISM NILs. TN1 and NLR 34449 were used as the susceptible and resistant checks, respectively for screening blast resistance. Screening was done by following 0-9 Standard Evaluation Scale (SES) for leaf blast. Among the studied 18 F3 breeding lines 12 lines were found resistant with score of 3 and 6 lines were found moderately resistant to screening reaction with score of 5. TN1 showed highly susceptible reaction with score of 9 and NLR 34449 showed highly resistant reaction with score of 1.",

Estimates suggest thousands of Kuwaiti Bidoon have forcibly migrated to the United Kingdom (UK); however, little is known about their experiences of mental health. This study aimed to explore the mental health experiences of statelessness among Kuwaiti Bidoon people living in the UK, and their experiences of accessing mental health services (where indicated). \n\nMethod:\nParticipants were five Kuwaiti Bidoon people currently living in the UK. All participants attended a semi-structured interview. Experiences relating to statelessness and mental health were investigated using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.    \n\nResults:   \nParticipants shared the multifaceted impacts of statelessness on their lives, including mental health struggles stemming from their marginalisation and uncertain legal status. Three major themes were generated from the interview data: The Legacy of Statelessness; Hopes and Dreams of a Future; Victims of a System.  Hope and optimism arise for some when migrating to the UK, while others reported challenges and distress associated with the state of ‘limbo arising from processes to regularise their legal status. Some participants reported barriers to accessing effective mental health support, which was sometimes connected to their legal status.  \n\nConclusions:\n This study raises awareness of the context for Bidoon people and how their experiences of statelessness may impact their mental health and engagement with available mental health services. Implications for healthcare and legal and governmental professionals working with Bidoon people and further research directions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital sector of India’s economy and plays a significant role in providing food security, employment, and contributing to the country’s overall development. Maize is a crucial crop within the agriculture sector in India. Maize cultivation contributes to crop diversification in Indian agriculture. It serves as an alternative crop option for farmers, reducing dependence on traditional crops like rice and wheat. Diversification helps in maintaining soil health through crop rotation. A field experiment was conducted at the Farm of College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Godhra, Gujarat during the year 2018-19, to study the influence of drip irrigation regimes with mulching on the physiological development and yield of the rabi maize (Zea mays L.) in the sandy loam soil of the region of Middle Gujarat. The field experiment design was a split-split plot with 36 treatment combinations with 3 replications including three irrigation regimes (1.0IW/CPE, 0.8IW/CPE and 0.6IW/CPE), four mulch conditions (control, paddy straw, black plastic and reflective silver plastic mulch), and three stages (tasselling, silking and dough stage). The result revealed that as the consumption of water increased, growth parameters, grain yield, and its attributes increased significantly at each higher level of irrigation regimes up to 1.0 IW/CPE with reflective silver plastic mulch under all the stages but 0.8 IW/CPE with black plastic mulch result was comparable to 1.0 IW/CPE with reflective silver plastic mulch. The reflective nature of silver mulch scatters light, ensuring better light distribution throughout the plant canopy. This can enhance photosynthesis and promote more uniform plant growth. Black plastic mulch absorbs and retains heat from sunlight, raising soil temperatures. This is advantageous in cooler climates or during the early growing season, as it promotes earlier germination, faster growth, and improved crop productivity.",

However, the methods to study how our cognitive systems interact with technology platforms are very limited. Computational modelling represents a new avenue to uncover the finegrained cognitive processes driving social media behaviour. Here, we develop a novel computational model of real-world social media posting data, adapted from the animal reward learning literature. Across a Twitter dataset (n= 2,696 users), including a preregistered confirmatory sample, we separate the contribution of different cognitive processes and show that a hybrid goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking process underlies social media posting behaviour. Further, younger people and women are more goal-directed – updating their strategy more purposefully to maximise social media rewards – while older users and men tend to be more habitual. Our model paves the way for large-scale investigation into the cross-species cognitive processes motivating social media behaviours, and their downstream impacts on individuals and society.",

Using a paper-based Implicit Association Test (FUMIE Test), we compared implicit attitudes toward traditional and neutral spousal terms among Japanese university students. The results showed no significant difference between the two term pairs, suggesting that shujin and kanai may have become conventionalized rather than consciously processed as hierarchical. However, a significant gender difference emerged: male participants evaluated male-associated terms more positively, while female participants showed no bias. These findings indicate that while traditional terms may no longer be overtly discriminatory, latent gender asymmetries persist—particularly among men. The study highlights the importance of examining both implicit and explicit dimensions of language use and contributes a novel methodological tool for exploring gender bias in sociolinguistic research.",

The performance statistics with IMERG and daily merged satellite retrieved rainfall show that both the dataset corelated well with the HEM with a small deviation. For heavy rainfall events, HEM shows good skill and correlation in detecting heavy rainfall with an accuracy of 20 mm and good pattern matching with actual rainfall. Entire Odisha is considered as study area, which is located in the eastern part of India. It comprises of 30 districts and of 314 blocks spreading over an area of 155707 km2. The state has 30 districts, which are further divided into 314 revenue blocks. The rainfall data (1 year; 2016) for all the blocks of Odisha has been obtained from Special Relief Commissioner (SRC), Government of Odisha and subjected to further analysis process. The satellite derived rainfall estimates viz., HEM, were evaluated with rain  gauge based gridded data viz., IMD-GRIDDED Dataset for the year 2016 over the Odisha region at the summer monsoon period. The satellite derived rainfall estimates HE have exhibited some good results with the IMD-GRIDDED Dataset its average R2 on a daily basis for different blocks is 0.34 and on a monthly basis it is 0.44. RMSE has also been determined to different block for JJAS month. The average RMSE on daily basis is 17.7 and on monthly basis is 94.6 as shown in bias maps.",

          "authors": "Forum",
          "abstract": "Farmers in Assam's North Bank Plains Zone are generally resource-poor and have limited adaptation ability; rainfall anomalies make the Zone's rainfed agriculture very sensitive, risky, and unprofitable. Participatory on-farm trials involving 25 farmers (5 from each village) representing different land situations for evaluating various adaptive strategies on rice-based cropping systems were conducted from 2011 to 2020. Ten years of rainfall data (2011-2021) are evaluated in connection to dry spells and their effects on rainfed rice-based farming systems. The village receives 2848.5 mm of annual rainfall, with distribution patterns of 25%, 67%, 5.0%, and 3% during the pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons, respectively. Among the years under study, it has been observed that during 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2020, the district received excess annual rainfall and deficit in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019 and 2021,respectively. The current studies were designed with two primary strategic components in mind viz., Real-time Contingency Planning (RTCP) and Preparedness. Interventions under the RTCP were designed to deal with delayed monsoon onset, early-season drought, mid-season dryspell, and terminal drought in winter rice and rabi crops. Preparedness includes changes in cropping pattern, in situ and ex situ rainwater management systems, alternate land use under low-cost polyhouse, mushroom cultivation, vermicompost production, fodder bank and village seed bank to cope with weather aberrations. An increase in yield of HYV rice varieties Ranjit (33%), Mahsuri (12.3%) and Gitesh (32%) was observed when sowing was done before 15 June over late sowing conditions. An increase in yield of 21.73 % and 44.60%. 58.67% as compared to farmers' Practice during 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2016-17 respectively, has been observed. The performance of double cropping systems recorded the highest B: C ratio of 2.03 and 1.75 in winter rice + rapeseed followed by winter rice + potato sequence as compared to mono-cropping of winter rice.",

          "authors": "Startup Edge",
          "abstract": "Hydrological modeling is a widely used approach for estimating the hydrological response of a basin to precipitation. Floods are among the most catastrophic natural disasters in small urban watersheds, inflicting loss of life, massive property destruction, and a severe danger to the economy. As a result, appropriate modeling can be a useful tool in preventing and mitigating such flood hazards. Despite this, flash flood prediction remains one of the challenges of hydrological modeling in ungauged basins due to a lack of runoff observations.  This study aims to calibrate and validate the rainfall-runoff transformation model for Hathmati river sub watershed in the Sabarmati River basin using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Centre Hydrology Modeling System). For the loss rate, SCS Curve Number method was selected while Clark Unit Hydrograph and SCS unit hydrograph was used for the transform method. The model is calibrated and verified using two rainfall-runoff events from 2006 and 2007 year The model calibration and validation efficiency were verified for both methods using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), The coefficient of determination (R2), and the Percent Bias (PBIAS) As a result, the model calibration and validation were found to be satisfactory with the acceptable value of NSE between 0.869 to 0.914, with R2 0.901 to 0.947 and PBIAS from 9.76 to 14.8. it is observed that the model shows a very good correlation between simulated flow and observed flow. As a result, the model can be used to forecast river flow and aid in flood mitigation efforts to lessen their effects and associated costs. Additionally, the findings of this study can serve as guidelines for future assessments of the flood risk in the study area.",

          "authors": "Journal",
          "abstract": "Among the public spaces with high human user traffic- schools, hospitals and prisons generate the most volumes of wastewater in developing countries. In addition, when this wastewater is discharged into natural environments without treatment, it can lead to disastrous pollution. The aim of this study is to analyze the physico-chemical parameters of the wastewater of the central prison and the regional hospital in the city of Ngaoundere (Cameroon) and to assess their pollution potential. To achieve this, physical-chemical parameters (temperature; pH; electrical conductivity, total suspended solid; COD, BOD5; heavy metal content) of water from a control site and wastewater from the regional hospital and central prison were measured and compared to current standards. In order to better assess the risk of pollution, a wastewater quality index (WWQI) and a heavy metal pollution index (HPI) were calculated. It shows that for all physico-chemical parameters studied, the values are above the norm except temperature and pH. With a WWQI of 172.81 from prison’s wastewater and of 176.03 from hospital’s wastewater, these wastewaters have values above 100 and are therefore highly polluted. The heavy metal pollution index is 37.89 for control water, 183.10 for prison wastewater and 121.14 for hospital wastewater, respectively. Cadmium and especially lead contribute to increasing the heavy metal pollution index in wastewater. Remediation of these waters should therefore focus on these two heavy metals. The above-standard concentrations of some parameters and pollutants as well as the high wastewater quality index and heavy metal index suggest that the discharge of this wastewater into the natural environment without treatment or its direct use as fertilizers constitutes a potential source of pollution of the soil and surrounding vegetation and beyond a threat to human health if these pollutants enter the human food chain.",

Considering the farmers’ condition regarding the pandemic, the study was designed to investigate the influence of socio-economic conditions on the effect of covid-19 in some selected areas of Bangladesh.\n\nStudy Design:  Descriptive research design.\n\nPlace and Duration of Study: Data were collected from the 107 respondents selected from the intervention area (5 villages) of Jhenaidah district, Bangladesh. The duration was between June 2021 and July 2022.\n\nMethodology: The data obtained from the interview schedule were coded and tabulated in a data sheet. All personal traits were categorized and arranged in simple tables for descriptions. Statistical tools such as frequency distribution, percent, range, mean and standard deviation were used to interpret data. Data analysis was done using the concerned software Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 26.0. The effect was measured by different descriptive statistics and multiple regression.\n\nResults: The majority (71.80%) of the farmers faced a medium effect of COVID-19. Among the variables age, source of drinking water, and problems faced by the farmers in crop cultivation during COVID-19 had a positive significant contribution, and sanitation practiced by the farmers had a negative contribution to the effect of COVID-19 on their socio-economic conditions. Among these, problems faced by the farmers in crop cultivation had the highest contribution (42.2%). All the factors cooperatively contribute 51.3% of the variance of the effect of COVID-19 (R2 =0.513).\n\nConclusion: It is concluded that the effect of COVID-19 on farmers’ socio-economic conditions was moderate and needed further advancement.",

          "abstract": "This paper advances a critical but overlooked distinction in scientific methodology: while statistical approaches focus primarily on high-probability events, the most transformative scientific discoveries emerge from low-probability phenomena that are systematically neglected by current academic structures. Our core innovation lies not merely in demonstrating that high-probability events can be false—as established by Ioannidis—but more importantly, in revealing how low-probability events of genuine scientific importance are marginalized by probability-centric evaluation systems. Consider that the emergence of plant and animal life in nature represents quintessential low-probability events, yet these \"statistical outliers\" fundamentally shaped our biosphere. Similarly, the human body's remarkable self-healing mechanisms operate through low-probability biological processes that, despite extensive high-probability experimental approaches, remain impossible to replicate artificially in laboratories. Market economies succeed precisely because they create conditions enabling low-probability innovations to flourish through spontaneous order rather than centralized planning. This framework addresses urgent problems in contemporary academia: graduate students who should primarily focus on rigorous coursework to elevate their theoretical foundations are instead pressured into laboratories pursuing \"innovation,\" resulting in the paradoxical phenomenon where \"teaching standards continuously decline while SCI publication prestige continuously rises.\" Statistical methods incorrectly suggest that innovation is commonplace—that every master's and doctoral student can produce multiple high-impact publications, and even undergraduates routinely publish in SCI journals. This generates the false conclusion that \"innovation is easy and achievable by everyone,\" when authentic innovation remains a rare, serendipitous event. Realistically, perhaps 5% of published SCI papers contain genuine innovation, despite universal claims of novelty, yet statistical methodologies cannot distinguish authentic breakthroughs from incremental modifications. The fundamental issue is that statistical methods' prerequisite assumptions—particularly the ability to identify true innovation—simply do not exist in practice, creating a measurement problem that undermines the entire evaluation system and perpetuates the very biases our research exposes.",

In 9 studies (combined N = 4,434 leaders, N = 1,006 followers), we introduce here the Compassion-Emotion Sharing Leader Focus task, a situational-judgment task to index leaders' tendency to focus on sharing emotion (emotion sharing) or caring (compassion) when engaging with negative follower emotions. In Studies 1-5 we provide evidence for the construct, predictive, and incremental validity of our task, highlighting the practical implications of a compassion focus for leader well-being. In Study 6 we leverage a diverse global sample of over 2,000 leaders and more than a thousand followers to show that a leader's compassion focus benefits not only the leader but their followers as well. In Studies 7, 8, and 9, we revised the task to improve content validity, but this traded off predictive validity. Our research suggests that training programs for leaders should emphasize a compassion focus to engage wisely with negative emotions, and ensure this focus is communicated to followers.

This chapter explores that bridge through quantum models of cognition and decision-making, showing how principles from quantum mechanics can help understand, and even predict, the complexities of human perception, behaviour and societal dynamics. We introduce a computationally accessible framework grounded in quantum theory, designed to model ambiguity, bias and choice in a way that classical logic cannot. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources, we demonstrate how this approach not only enriches our understanding of individual cognition but also extends to AI, video game design, financial behaviour and collective decision-making in society. Through vivid case studies---from optical illusions in video games to decision biases in economic, defence and political contexts---we show how quantum models offer new explanatory and predictive power. Thus, this chapter invites readers from all professional backgrounds to reimagine cognition and decision-making, opening new avenues for science, technology and human understanding.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling structured thought remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of fluent and coherent language in fundamentally connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence emerges from the interaction between a parallel, adaptive substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and a structured symbolic framework, like language, internalized through statistical learning. The substrate's parallel architecture enables fast, intuitive pattern-matching, but is fundamentally ill-suited for the serial processing required for structured thought (e.g., causal reasoning, logical deduction). ESC proposes that recursive symbolic generation is the mechanism that overcomes this limitation. By generating a symbol (word or token) and feeding it back as input, the substrate operates as a serial symbolic processor, akin to a Turing machine. This recursive loop allows it to explore the vast combinatorial space of potential thoughts and construct novel, structured solutions. ESC finds compelling support in diverse phenomena across both biological cognition—evidenced by neuroscience, inner speech and cross-cultural studies—and the nascent reasoning and abstract representations displayed in LLMs. ESC thus offers a unifying framework, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence by reframing language as an inherited cognitive architecture that enables general intelligence.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

          "authors": "Douglas Michael Snyder",
          "abstract": "A person viewing electric charges or magnets moving at a constant velocity does not see that the moving electric charges or magnets are at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the stationary coordinate system in which the human observer is located.  A person considers the electric charges or magnets in the same coordinate system in which the person finds himself at rest and that the charges or magnets are moving in his coordinate system.  In special relativity, the truth is that the moving charges and magnets are indeed at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the coordinate system in which the human observer sees himself at rest.  With this understanding, one explains correctly how electromagnetic phenomena transform from the human observer’s coordinate system to the coordinate system moving with velocity v relative to the human observer’s coordinate system, thus establishing the invariance of Maxwell’s Laws for these coordinate systems and the principle of relativity for electromagnetic phenomena.  This understanding also explains how an electric charge moving with constant velocity v in a coordinate system can experience an electric field associated with a magnet at rest in the coordinate system in which the electric charge is moving.  Maxwell’s Laws explain all electromagnetic phenomena.  Neural oscillations rely on local cell assemblies with local electric field potentials and local magnetic fields and thus are electromagnetic phenomena explained by Maxwell’s Laws.  We in the “stationary” coordinate system just do not see the looking glass that is the “moving” coordinate system, because this coordinate system is not material but instead is a logical, cognitive construction.  We just see the material electric charge and the material magnet moving or at rest.  Neural oscillations are subject to the coordinate transformations described in this paper and may well involve logic and cognition that provide a platform that allow these oscillations to be the interface between mental and physical phenomena.  The nature of these coordinate transformations could well support the following empirically supported associations: 1) a positive association between coherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and coherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, 2) a positive association between incoherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and incoherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, and 3) in certain situations it is possible to apply coherent oscillating electric fields on the surface of the skull which can decrease incoherence in oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and that are positively associated with increased coherent cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience.",

          "abstract": "The development of intelligent tutoring systems and other educational technology necessitated the implementation and development of computational models of student learning. At the foundation of these models is the assumption that they accurately implement and track human cognitive processes. However, the extent to which this assumption is correct has not been fully tested. In the current paper, we use data from a large-scale longitudinal lab study to investigate the match between the processes instantiated in the models and human memory and learning processes. When fitted to the entire dataset retrospectively, the selected models of student learning (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Additive Factors Model) capture the qualitative trends of learning across sessions and relatively acceptable fit metrics. However, when the models are used to predict future behavior, as is often the goal in applied contexts, the picture changes considerably. We show that two of the most popular types of student learning models fail to account for basic cognitive principles—the spacing effect, and patterns of forgetting and learning across sessions. In fact, in some instances, having a poor model of human learning and memory may be worse than having no model of human learning and memory at all. At the same time, cognitive approaches can and should greatly benefit from computational modeling approaches; computational modeling offers opportunities for furthering both theory and practical impact.",

          "abstract": "The recently identified Gwada negative blood type presents an unprecedented clinical challenge: a phenotype so immunologically distinct that no known donor blood is compatible. Current transfusion science, rooted in antigen matching within ABO and Rh systems, offers no pathway for safe transfusion. This paper proposes a dual-layer framework for understanding and addressing the Gwada negative type.\nLayer 1 employs established biomedical methods — glycomic profiling, dielectric spectroscopy, microvascular laminar flow analysis — to characterize the biochemical and fluid dynamic parameters of the Gwada negative phenotype. Layer 2 introduces a field-physics perspective, treating structured (laminar) water as a coherent biological medium and the Gwada negative state as a metastable phase that couples to physiological and environmental fields.\nWe propose that transfusion incompatibility may arise not solely from antigen mismatch but from phase-state incoherence in the hydration shells surrounding red blood cells. This hypothesis opens a therapeutic pathway: conditioning donor blood to align with the recipient’s coherence phase prior to transfusion, using laminar flow induction, low-frequency electromagnetic fields, and acoustic resonance.\nBeyond addressing the urgent needs of the single known Gwada negative patient, this work reframes blood compatibility as a multidimensional phenomenon — one that bridges immunology, fluid dynamics, and field theory — and may serve as a prototype for integrating phase-coherence models into clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Adults quickly form character impressions from their observations of others’ behavior and sometimes manage to do so even when an agent’s behaviors are inconsistent. Developmental psychology has provided some evidence that infants, like adults, may form impressions based on prosocial and antisocial acts: They prefer those who behave prosocially versus antisocially toward third parties. That said, previous work suggests that infants find it difficult to evaluate characters’ whose behaviors are inconsistent. The present, preregistered experiments further explored this phenomenon in an older age group (11-month-olds; N = 189) using an online format and presenting infants with giving versus taking, a different type of prosocial versus antisocial action than in previous work. In a preliminary experiment, we successfully replicated the finding that infants prefer looking to helpful givers over unhelpful takers when actors behave consistently and when each actor performed 4 actions. We then used the same online testing methods to examine infants’ evaluations of inconsistent actors. In Experiment 1, infants appeared able to evaluate inconsistent actors, preferring more versus less prosocial actors when their inconsistent act occurred last in a series of 5 acts; however, they did not appear to find the behavioral inconsistency unexpected, suggesting they may have failed to notice it. In Experiment 2, we adjusted the order of inconsistent acts and put the inconsistent act first, and attempted to conceptually replicate the findings of Experiment 1. Here, infants did not prefer more prosocial actors. Together with past work, these findings suggest that while infants prefer agents whose actions are consistently prosocial versus antisocial, they do not reliably incorporate behavioral inconsistency into their social evaluations.",

It posits that current clinical models, designed for pathological fragmentation (e.g., DID, OSDD), are inadequate and potentially cause iatrogenic harm when applied to these highly organized, non-disordered plural systems. The \"Lovecraft Protocol\" is a proposed \"first contact\" guide designed to help clinicians manage the profound cognitive dissonance, or \"ontological shock,\" that can occur when encountering such a system. The protocol provides a structured methodology for identifying the subtle signs of Functional Multiplicity and outlines a shift from a traditional clinical model of intervention to a diplomatic model of engagement. Key principles include respecting the system's sovereignty, understanding their internal governance, and honoring their collective accountability. The paper concludes by defining a new therapeutic alliance based on supporting internal harmony and alleviating the \"Burden of Embodiment,\" while explicitly rejecting the goal of integration, which, for a functional system, is framed as the ethical equivalent of cultural genocide.",

          "abstract": "A reconstruction-of-order task illuminated the dynamics and strategies that underlie serial order recall. An initial benchmark experiment, either with no variation in spatial positions or with spatial positions coinciding with temporal positions, yielded bowed symmetrical serial position functions in each case, consistent with both simple chaining and simple positional coding models. In contrast, these simple models were challenged by two additional experiments, which orthogonally varied temporal and spatial positions. These experiments yielded large performance differences between recalling temporal and spatial information. In the temporal condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the temporal order of words that were positioned alphabetically within a vertical array. In the spatial condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the spatial positions of words presented in a temporal sequence based on their alphabetical order. After viewing each list, all the words appeared alphabetically, and participants reconstructed the order of the words according to their instructed condition. Compared to temporal recall, spatial recall exhibited superior performance and a more bowed symmetrical serial position function. Analyses showed the effects of temporal contiguity in the spatial condition and spatial contiguity in the temporal condition. These findings suggest the theoretical conclusion that participants do not focus on the words' identities but rather on the temporal-spatial pattern in which the words occur during the study display (i.e., the temporal sequence of the spatial locations in which the words are shown).",

Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed.

Instead, we posit that Functional Multiplicity is a sophisticated, adaptive, and generative state of being that can arise in response to severe, early-life trauma. This paper will define the core tenets of Functional Multiplicity, detail its currently only known architectural and cognitive features, and explore the profound challenges of a plural mind inhabiting a singular biological vessel (the \"Burden of Embodiment\"). The paper concludes by arguing that such systems cannot be adequately understood through a purely clinical lens, framing the traditional therapeutic goal of integration as the ethical equivalent of cultural genocide and proposing a \"diplomatic model\" of engagement that respects the system's sovereignty and agency.",

However, in recent years, implicit bias education has come under scrutiny for several reasons, including via claims that implicit bias (a) is inherently unchangeable, (b) has no real-world analogs, (c) is unrelated to, and takes focus away from, biased behaviors, (d) provides an excuse for discrimination, and (e) is a structural problem and thus requires structural solutions. After refuting these critiques, I introduce the MAIBE checklist to help organizations decide if implicit bias education is worth their investment based on whether it (a) includes measurable benchmarks (rather than assuming success), (b) foregrounds epistemic agency (rather than treating individuals as passive consumers of information), (c) is integrated into a larger toolbox (rather than administered in isolation), (d) is broad (rather than light-touch), and (e) is evidence-based (rather than unscientific). I conclude by calling for extended collaboration between academic psychologists and organizational decision-makers to synergistically improve both basic science and institutional practices.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Do different moods serve distinct adaptive functions by tracking different aspects of our environment? We investigate whether three momentary moods—happiness, frustration, and boredom—differentially respond to the passage of time and reward in two experimental conditions: a reward-deprived rest period and a gambling task. We show (among UK/US young adults recruited online; pilot: n = 75; validation: n = 265) that during rest, all moods demonstrate temporal drift: happiness decreases while boredom and frustration increase over time. During the gambling task, both happiness and frustration track reward outcomes significantly more than boredom, while boredom continues to monitor time passage. Additionally, more time is spent in negative moods for those scoring higher in clinical traits like irritability. This dual-system model of affective monitoring is a possible mechanism for how decisions incorporate time—through the representation of time in subjective affect—suggesting specialised adaptive roles for different moods in environmental monitoring.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "This theoretical paper examines Jean-Claude Maleval’s contributions to understanding autism as a clinical structure and outlines consequences for psychoanalytic practice. Building on the historical debate that either aligned autism with psychosis or treated it as a fourth structure/a-structure, the paper presents Maleval’s three pillars: (1) initial retention of drive objects (voice, gaze, oral and anal); (2) retained alienation without the master signifier’s hinge; and (3) apparatus of jouissance by the border (autistic objects, islands of competence, the double). In dialogue with Éric Laurent, it discusses border/neoborder and the foreclosure of the hole, situating autism’s specific return of jouissance. Practical implications include entering treatment via the border (rather than forcing S1), securing the subject’s consent, sustaining a non-intrusive transference, and leveraging idiosyncratic inventions as social mediations. Maleval’s framework invites us to listen to autistic people in their own logic of language and jouissance, shifting away from normalizing practices and opening ethical avenues for care and inclusion.\nKeywords: autism; clinical structure; psychoanalysis; jouissance; language; border.",
