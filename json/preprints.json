          "authors": "Pekka Syrjanen",
          "abstract": "Predictive success is a central objective of science. However, compared to other important aims such as explanation and causal discovery, prediction remains an undertheorized aspect of science in the philosophy of science. Here, I offer an account of prediction that distinguishes between different forms of predictive success that theories and models achieve in science. I draw a distinction between logical and contingent dimensions of predictive success. Logical dimensions measure the theory‚Äôs predictive success with empirical data directly. These dimensions include accuracy, specificity, scope, and depth. Contingent dimensions encompass predictive successes that the theory or model achieves in relation to its context of discovery. These include forecasting, use-novelty, theoretical novelty, and temporal novelty. I analyse the connection of each dimension to theory confirmation and survey approaches to operationalizing the dimensions in scientific practice. I explore how understanding the dimensions of prediction can aid in theory evaluation and development and highlight further open issues and questions concerning prediction in science.",

          "title": "High vs Low Realism in VR Avatars and How Behavioral Realism Shapes Self-Disclosure",
          "authors": "Alan Fraser",
          "abstract": "In this study, we investigate how varying levels of behavioural realism in two distinct avatars affect social interactions involving self-disclosure in virtual reality (VR). These two avatars involved an avatar using full-body and facial motion capture for a high level of behavioural realism and the other using basic tracking of VR headsets and controllers for a more basic level of behavioural realism. Fifty-seven participants interacted with these avatars, sharing positive and negative experiences in a reciprocal social interaction. Results showed that full-body and facial motion tracking was more preferred and rated higher in enjoyment, realism, and eye contact duration. However, some participants preferred the avatar with more basic behavioural realism. These differences in avatar preferences could be tied to an uncanny valley effect, where realistic human avatars with movement imperfections may cause discomfort for some people. These findings suggest that allowing users to choose their level of preferred realism may help improve engagement with VR avatars. Although avatars with higher realism are generally preferred, the avatars with lower levels of realism were still acceptable for most participants. Thus, lower levels of avatar realism may still be effective for VR therapy when affordability and accessibility are crucial.",

          "authors": "Yang Xiang; Samuel J. Gershman; Tobias Gerstenberg",
          "abstract": "People use various strategies to bolster the perception of their competence. One strategy is self-handicapping, by which people deliberately impede their performance in order to protect or enhance perceived competence. Despite much prior research, it is unclear why, when, and how self-handicapping occurs. We develop a formal theory that chooses the optimal degree of self-handicapping based on its anticipated performance and signaling effects. We test the theory‚Äôs predictions in two experiments (ùëÅ = 400), showing that self-handicapping occurs more often when it is unlikely to affect the outcome and when it increases the perceived competence in the eyes of a naive observer. With sophisticated observers (who consider whether a person chooses to self-handicap), self-handicapping is less effective when followed by failure. We show that the theory also explains the findings of several past studies. By offering a systematic explanation of self-handicapping, the theory lays the groundwork for developing effective interventions.",

          "authors": "Zhang Chen; Pieter Van Dessel; Jordi Serverius; Daxun Zhu; Bernd Figner",
          "abstract": "Executing go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses toward objects can increase people's choices of go over no-go items, and of approach over avoidance items. Some theoretical accounts explain these effects as the results of merely executing these responses (i.e., action execution), while others propose that these choice effects stem from interpreting these motor responses as valenced actions (i.e., action interpretation). To test the role of action execution versus action interpretation in both go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses, we employed a recently developed training that combined both dimensions orthogonally. Participants either pressed a key or not (i.e., go/no-go) to control a shopping cart on screen, to either collect or not collect certain food items (i.e., approach/avoidance). After the training, they repeatedly chose between food items (i.e., candies) for real consumption. When the instructions framed the responses as approach/avoidance actions, participants (N = 98) preferred approach items over avoidance items, but did not show preferences between go and no-go items in their choices. In contrast, when the instructions framed the responses as go/no-go actions, participants (N = 98) preferred go items over no-go items, but did not show preferences between approach and avoidance items. Despite making the same actual responses in both instruction groups, action interpretation determined whether go/no-go or approach/avoidance actions influenced food choice. Disambiguating the interpretation of motor responses as clearly valenced and meaningful actions may therefore be a fruitful way to maximize the effectiveness of response-based behavioral interventions.",

          "title": "Behavioral Genetics on the Brink: A Review of Eric Turkheimer‚Äôs Understanding the Nature-Nurture Debate",
          "authors": "Jay Joseph",
          "abstract": "The author reviews University of Virginia psychology professor Eric Turkheimer‚Äôs 2024 book Understanding the Nature-Nurture Debate. Turkheimer has long been known for taking a critical position within the field of behavioral genetics. While mentioning several important limitations, Turkheimer upholds the validity of the heritability concept, twin studies, and adoption studies. The author notes that ‚Äúheritability‚Äù is a disputed concept, and briefly describes what he sees as the invalidating aspects of behavioral and psychiatric genetic twin and adoption studies. He then reviews Turkheimer‚Äôs analysis of DNA-based (molecular genetic) behavioral research methods such as linkage, candidate gene, genome-wide association (GWAS), and polygenetic score (PGS) studies. The first two methods ended in failure. Although GWAS and PGS researchers have claimed many ‚Äúgene-behavior associations,‚Äù Turkheimer shows that, after decades of attempts,  DNA-based research has failed to uncover genetic variants shown to cause human behavioral differences. Disagreements between Turkheimer and behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin are also examined. The author, though not Turkheimer, concludes that DNA-based research failure provides additional evidence that the critics of twin and adoption studies and accompanying heritability estimates were right all along and that the behavioral genetic paradigm is unraveling.  As behavioral genetics attempts to extricate itself from the failed causal gene discovery corner it has painted itself into, the social and behavioral sciences should begin work on a new environmentally focused post-behavioral genetics developmental paradigm. Understanding the Nature-Nurture Debate is worth a look, in part due to Turkheimer‚Äôs timely arguments against IQ hereditarianism and race science. At the same time, the author advises readers to be aware that the dual ‚Äúheritability‚Äù mirages of twin and adoption studies inspired the DNA-based ‚Äúgenes for behavior and psychiatric disorders‚Äù fiasco in the first place.",

          "authors": "Alwin de Rooij",
          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of many visual art practices. Audiences, however, may have a bias against AI in visual art: knowing that AI was used to create art can broadly diminish their aesthetic experience. Whether this bias occurs structurally and across the systems involved in an aesthetic experience remains an open question. To address this, a systematic search and meta-analysis were conducted, categorising data under the sensory-motor (6 studies, 16 effect sizes), knowledge-meaning (27 studies, 94 effect sizes), and emotion-valuation (26 studies, 49 effect sizes) systems. The meta-analysis showed evidence for bias against AI in all three systems but with varying magnitudes of effect. Significant negative but small pooled effect sizes were observed for the sensory-motor and emotion-valuation systems, while a significant moderate negative pooled effect size was found for the knowledge-meaning system. Significant moderator analyses and residual heterogeneity suggest that the bias against AI in visual art is likely sensitive to specific conditions, rather than being a structural phenomenon. Herewith, this meta-analysis contributes novel insights into the bias against AI in visual art.",

          "abstract": "Whereas recent research on the wisdom of the crowd effect questioned the importance of group interaction by showing that, in many cases, simple aggregations of independent judgments are already highly accurate, we present extensive meta-analytic evidence that interacting groups outperform such aggregations and, thereby, achieve synergy. In particular, we show that group judgments are more accurate than the average of a comparable number of individual judgments, and that group judgments can be as accurate as the judgments of the best individual member of the nominal groups (i.e., the person with the lowest judgment error). Additionally, our meta-analytic results substantiate two different mechanisms that lead to synergy in quantitative group judgment. On the one hand, group members can learn from each other and, thereby, increase their individual accuracy (G-I transfer). On the other hand, when controlling for G-I transfer, group members are also able to identify the more accurate judgments and assign more weight to them (differential weighting).",

          "authors": "Jamshid Faraji; Gerlinde A.S. Metz",
          "abstract": "The human brain functions as a highly integrated system. Interconnected cellular and molecular networks within this system adaptively process sensory information, cognitive functions, and motor responses. This system also exhibits a remarkable potential for plasticity-driven adaptive learning and memory. Importantly, neuroplasticity serves as a key mechanism of neuroprotection, enabling the brain to compensate for injury through adaptive structural remodeling. Understanding the brain as a dynamic system requires examining how its components interact to produce adaptive physiological responses and complex behaviours, such as social interactions. Key molecules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin (OT), play pivotal roles in maintaining the brain's dynamic complexity and integrative functioning. In this review, we introduce the concept of neurosocial plasticity, which refers to the brain‚Äôs ability to adapt both neural circuitry and social behaviour through the dynamic interaction between BDNF and OT. This concept highlights how BDNF-OT collaboration may support both neural plasticity and the capacity for adaptive social functioning. We then explore how their co-localisation, co-expression, and co-regulation may regulate neural and social plasticity, ultimately shaping the brain‚Äôs adaptability and the development of social behaviours across various contexts.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing need for independent, ecologically valid research on prosocial design interventions within online platforms. Platform design has a significant impact on user interactions, yet independent researchers often lack access to live platforms, limiting the ecological validity of studies that test the effectiveness of prosocial interventions. In response, thirty-one experts from academia, industry, and civil society gathered for a workshop focused on understanding methods that enable effective research on design interventions that result in prosocial outcomes, such as healthy interactions and individual safety, wellbeing, and dignity. This paper synthesizes the workshop findings to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing prosocial design and to provide stakeholders‚Äîplatforms, advocacy groups, and regulators‚Äîwith evidence-based tools to promote healthy online behavior. First, we present an in-depth review of the dominant research methods in the field as identified in the workshop. Second, we highlight challenges that workshop participants agreed were most prominent, such as the constant 'reinvention of the wheel' for intervention testing, and recommend how to deal with them. Finally, we propose specific future actions to address challenges in the areas of knowledge sharing, events, and supporting infrastructure that experts consider most worth pursuing, laying out an agenda for future online prosocial research and investment.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study explores the self-regulation strategies and Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs) employed by individuals who successfully quit smoking unassisted, aiming to understand the processes behind their cessation journeys. \nMethods: A qualitative content analysis was conducted on semi-structured interviews with 32 unassisted quitters. Data were analyzed inductively to identify themes related to the challenges faced, and deductively to map strategies used onto existing frameworks, including the Process Model of Self-Regulation and the BCT Taxonomy. \nResults: Participants employed a variety of strategies to manage cravings and avoid smoking triggers, including changing their environments, diverting attention, reappraising situations, and leveraging social support. The analysis revealed that participants engaged in polyregulation, whereby they used multiple strategies concurrently. The most frequently used strategies were situation selection/modification (51.9%) and cognitive change (28.3%), with behavior substitution and habit reversal being common BCTs. \nConclusion: Unassisted quitters drew from a sophisticated array of strategies beyond the traditional notion of willpower, suggesting a ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù approach to self-regulation and behavior change. These findings can inform public health policies and interventions to better support smoking cessation by promoting practical, learnable strategies for individuals attempting to quit without formal assistance.\n\nKeywords: Unassisted smoking cessation, self-regulation strategies, behavior change techniques, polyregulation, public health policy",

          "abstract": "There is extensive debate about the effects of social media use on wellbeing.

The rise of social media intervention experiments to tackle this issue has represented a positive change for the field. However, these studies are themselves encumbered by methodological issues, preventing a clear take-home message from this line of research. In the current paper we attempt to tackle this issue by highlighting to researchers what some of these issues are, and how they may design and interpret their research to allay or avoid such issues going forward. Our hope is that this contribution will ultimately help improve the quality of experimental research tackling this timely issue.",

          "authors": "Yiyu Liu; Fransisca Ting; Eden Moss; Daniel C. Hyde",
          "abstract": "While pre-verbal infants may be sensitive to others‚Äô mental states, they are not able to accurately answer questions about them until several years later, an ability referred to as having a theory of mind. Here we ask whether infant social-cognitive sensitivity is subserved by the same brain mechanisms as those that support theory of mind in childhood. To do so, we explored the relationship between functional sensitivity of the right temporal-parietal junction to mental state processing in infancy, a region known to underlie theory of mind in older children, and explicit theory of mind reasoning in the same group several years later. In a small initial sample (N=33), we find evidence of a longitudinal brain-behavioral link from infancy to childhood, providing preliminary support for a common mechanism for theory of mind across development. However, the brain metric that was predictive of individual differences was not the response to conditions that required tracking the beliefs, but instead, responses to a control condition where belief tracking was not obligatory to predict others‚Äô behavior. In hindsight, the ambiguity of this control condition may have best distinguished between infants who had different propensities to engage in belief tracking, suggesting a potential role for active experience in infancy contributing to individual differences in later theory of mind development in childhood. Given the exploratory nature of the study, other alternative explanations for these results must also be considered.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to visualize things outside our field of view feels similar to our visual perception. Yet, perception arises from real-world sensory experiences, while imagery depends on mental representations. This raises important questions about whether imagery and perception involve distinct mechanisms, how similar latent spaces support semantic representations in imagery and perception, and the extent to which one‚Äôs imagery vividness and performance measures relate. To answer these questions, we employed a computerized battery prompting visual perception and visual mental imagery across five semantic domains: Colors, Faces, Letters, Maps, and Shapes. Seventy-five participants with typical imagery (based on their scores obtained from the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, VVIQ) completed this battery. On each trial, we recorded two imagery performance measures, accuracy and response times (RTs), and two subjective measures, vividness for the imagery and confidence for the perceptual trials. Two analyses suggested the existence of domain-specific processes that differentiate imagery from perception: (1) there is a difference in both performance measures among some domains (Color, Face, Map) but not others (Letters, Shapes); (2) the logistic regression models predicted domain-specific performance. Participants‚Äô accuracy and RTs for imagery and perception were highly correlated, suggesting shared processes exist across these two modalities. Further, unsupervised clustering analysis revealed a latent space of four clusters, fewer than the 10 theoretically possible clusters (2 modalities √ó 5 domains). Last, we found that trial-by-trial vividness better predicted imagery performance than off-task VVIQ, indicating its more accurate reflection of an individual‚Äôs imagery performance.",

To address this question, we compared risky choices in the focus of researchers' and laypeople's perspectives. In a first study, we examined the overlap between these perspectives by determining how many choices they have in common. Leveraging large language models and calibrating semantic similarities with human judgments, we found an overlap of only 18%. To further examine the implications of this mismatch in terms of the psychological mechanisms that these various choices may tap into, we conducted a second study in which 825 participants rated the perceived relevance of seven classes of psychological mechanisms to their decision making in choices from both perspectives. Bayesian mixed effects models revealed credible differences between the perspectives in five out of seven classes of mechanisms. These findings suggest that current theories of decision making may explain only a narrow scope of choices, underscoring the need for the behavioral sciences to realign their focus to better capture the complexity of real-life decision making.",

While prosody crucially aids the process of L1 acquisition, for adult L2 learners it is often considerably challenging. Is it because of an age-related decline of the language-learning ability or because of unfavourable learning conditions? We investigated whether adults can auditorily sensitise to the prosody of a novel language, and whether such sensitisation is affected by orthographic input. After 5 minutes of exposure to MƒÅori, Czech listeners could reliably recognize this language in a post-test using low-pass filtered clips of MƒÅori and Malay. Recognition accuracy was lower for participants exposed to the novel-language speech along with deep-orthography transcriptions or orthography with unfamiliar characters. Adults can thus attune to novel-language prosody, but orthography hampers this ability. Language-learning theories and applications may need to reconsider the consequences of providing orthographic input to beginning second-language learners.",

To study how these properties affect speech processing, researchers can create retimed experimental stimuli with varying temporal patterns. However, retiming speech also poses significant challenges, such as preserving naturalness, intelligibility, and prosody.\n\nIn this chapter, we present three methods of altering the acoustic speech signal to achieve a desired rhythmic structure. Each method differs in how it adjusts the timing of the utterance and its segments. The methods are used to create stimuli with regular isochronous stress. We evaluate the methods in terms of how much they disrupt the speech signal and how effective they are in achieving isochrony.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate how retiming can be used to produce stimuli with more naturalistic rhythmic characteristics. We show that retiming can be a powerful tool for exploring perceptual effects of timing in speech.",

          "abstract": "To what degree is it possible to recognize a person‚Äôs ethnicity just from their face? What information do you need to do so? Here, we present the first investigation addressing these questions, and in particular the role of internal and external facial features for fine-grained ethnicity categorization among closely related East Asian ethnicities. Specifically, we tested the ability of N=105 Korean participants to categorize male faces into Korean, Japanese, or Chinese ethnicities - a categorization that according to participants‚Äã‚Äå‚Äå‚Äç‚Äç‚Äã‚Äç‚Äô own introspective opinion should be easily doable for them. Participants were split into two groups: one group (N=53) was shown cropped, grayscale images showing solely internal facial features, and the other (N=52) was shown faces including external features, including hair and full face outline. Our findings indicate categorization based on internal features only was barely above chance level, whereas external features resulted in more reliable above-chance performance - albeit at a low overall level of around 52%. Our study emphasizes the importance of external features in the accurate categorization of ethnic backgrounds, and establishes an overall low ability of Koreans to reliably distinguish between East Asian ethnicities.",

          "authors": "Abhishek Baba; Swarag. T; Ark Verma",
          "abstract": "Research suggests that individuals consistently demonstrate favorable attitudes towards members of their ingroups compared to those belonging to other social groups. Such ingroup biases are observed not only in well-established historical groups but also in minimal group settings. The current study investigates the robustness of the said ingroup bias across different contexts through four experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were merely assigned to one of the two existing minimal groups, and their ingroup bias was assessed. In the next three experiments (Exps 2a - 2c), the participants were assigned to one of the two minimal groups, and the relationship between the groups was manipulated. In Experiment 2a, both groups were described as good and in a mutually harmonious relationship; in Experiment 2b, the two groups were in a conflicted relationship, with the ingroup described as good and the outgroup as bad; and finally, in Experiment 2c, both groups were again in a conflicted relationship with the ingroup being described as bad and the outgroup as good. The degree of ingroup bias was indexed in terms of faster response times, higher accuracy, and greater sensitivity on a perceptual-matching task. Interestingly, while the preliminary analysis showed a significant moderation of bias measures across the four experiments, a more detailed examination using Bayesian regression analysis and Drift-Diffusion Modeling established a strong persistence of ingroup favoritism despite changing group characteristics and relations. Indeed, the changing relations didn‚Äôt affect the robust ingroup bias much as the general trend for favoring one‚Äôs own group persisted across all experiments. The minimal yet robust nature of ingroup favoritism is explicated.",

Method: Using a sample of 1,884 college students, path analyses tested whether perceiving transcendent accountability moderated the association between welcoming accountability to others in goal pursuit and the virtues of patience and courage, which were assessed both in goal pursuit and at the trait-level. Results: Welcoming accountability was associated with goal- and trait-level patience and courage, but transcendent accountability was only associated with courage in goal pursuit. Transcendent accountability amplified the associations between welcoming accountability and patience and courage in pursuing goals and trait patience in daily hassles. Conclusions: In addition to expanding the nomological network of welcoming accountability to include performance virtues, the amplifying effect of transcendent accountability highlights the importance of embracing accountability to both humans and a transcendent other for cultivating virtuous goal-pursuit.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Self-compassion can help people when they make mistakes, but does it affect how people respond when falsely accused of making a mistake? In this research we tested the hypothesis that self-compassion is associated with lower levels of anger after a false accusation which, in turn, lowers the likelihood that people will attempt to challenge the accusation.\n\nMethod: In Studies 1a (N = 422) and 1b (N = 492), participants imagined that they were playing in an important tennis match and were falsely accused by an official of making an error. In Study 2 (N = 346), participants completed an online survey that, at one point, displayed a message accusing them of plagiarising one of their responses. \n\nResults: In all studies, self-compassion assessed prior to the accusation was negatively associated with levels of anger following the accusation. Anger, in turn, was positively associated with intentions to challenge the accusation (Studies 1a and 1b) and with the likelihood that participants brought the false accusation to our attention when given an opportunity to do so (Study 2). \n\nConclusion: This research shows that highly self-compassionate people are not always ferocious and may be susceptible to being taken advantage of when facing false accusations.",

          "abstract": "Effective communication depends on reasoning about what others know and believe, and failures in executive functioning can disrupt the way adults reason about mental states. No study has revealed errors traceable to mental state reasoning processes, such as failures in interpreting premises, simulating possibilities, and formulating conclusions. We developed such a theory to account for both rational and error-prone mental state reasoning; to test it, we investigated a family of specific mental state reasoning inferences concerning agents and their states of knowledge and belief. Online participants in eight preregistered studies (N = 484) considered conditional inferences couched in terms of a mental state, e.g., Alia knows that if it‚Äôs rainy then the caf√© is closed; It‚Äôs rainy. What follows? They generated natural conclusions using a novel sentence construction interface (Experiments 1a-e, 3, 4) and by typing out responses (Experiment 2). These generative tasks permitted analyses of participants‚Äô tendency to draw sensible epistemic conclusions as well as their systematic errors. One family of errors was an ‚Äúomniscience‚Äù error: reasoners erroneously imputed knowledge of a deductive consequence to an individual. We explain these results in the context of a novel, model-based theory of epistemic reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Consumer neuroscience is, to some extent, defined by its methodologies. Traditional consumer research relies upon traditional behavioral techniques, such as examining choice, asking people to provide self-report ratings, and measuring response time. Consumer neuroscience utilizes many of these tools, but also employs neuroscientific methodologies, including eye-tracking, psychophysiology, neuroimaging, and circulating hormones. The present chapter examines how these tools have shed light in a range of domains. I focus here on brands, brand personalities, neuroforecasting, and purchase decisions. With respect to brands, I discuss findings from work comparing two brands (e.g., Coke and Pepsi) as well as multiple brands. For brand personalities, I discuss how brands are judged compared to people and novel neural techniques for capturing brand personality judgments. The neuroforecasting section discusses a range of types of predictions made using neural data. In investigating pricing and purchasing, I review a host of evidence from different paradigms. Across these topic areas, I review a range of types of evidence, including data from functional magnetic resonance imaging, circulating hormones, and lesion research, among others. In each case, evidence from neuroscience provides novel insight into a process that guides consumer behavior.",

Using data from three multi-country surveys (N = 60,414), Study 1 found that ideology predicted union membership within the European context but showed no significant association in the global or U.S. context. In Studies 2a (N = 1,620) and 2b (N = 2,351) using data from the U.S., Poland and India, left economic ideology emerged as the most consistent predictor of labor activism, as well as positive attitudes toward unions in the U.S. and Poland, but not in India.

          "abstract": "While political candidates differ in how extreme vs. moderate their ideas are, it remains unclear how the extremism of a politician‚Äôs agenda impacts voters. To fill this gap, the present research investigated the mobilizing effects of extreme vs. moderate politicians on both supporters and opponents. The results of five preregistered experiments (N = 3,532) showed that, in comparison to moderates, extreme political candidates were more successful in motivating their supporters to get engaged on their behalf. However, they were also more likely to energize their opponents to act against them. We further show that the effect the candidates‚Äô ideological extremism had on their support was positively mediated via higher perceived commitment to their goals, but negatively via lower expectancy of their success. Crucially, we show that social norms moderate the appeal of extreme politicians. Specifically, the advantage of extremists over moderates emerged when the opinions within society were polarized or skewed towards the extremes, but the advantage disappeared under a normal distribution of opinions. Taken together, these studies provide insights into why and when political candidates with extreme views win greater support than moderates.",

Across conditions, we vary skin tone (White/Black) and group size (small/large) in news images.

          "abstract": "Learning a second language (L2) is a desirable skill, yet some learners struggle to achieve proficiency. These difficulties might arise partly from perceptual strategies inherited from learners‚Äô first language (L1). For example, speakers of a tone language like Mandarin, in which pitch is an essential cue, tend to over-use pitch in English prosody perception and production. Here, we developed a novel training paradigm to help Mandarin learners of English adopt more native-like perceptual strategies by enhancing their ability to use duration relative to pitch cues during prosody categorization. 30 learners completed the targeted prosody training and the control group of 30 participants practiced English vocabulary. After prosody training, participants showed enhanced use of duration during categorization of phrase boundaries, where duration is the primary cue. For word focus and lexical stress, there was no clear change in perceptual strategies, suggesting that cue weighting training is most effective when it guides listeners towards using the primary cue for a given feature. Control group showed stronger reliance on pitch when categorizing lexical stress at post-test suggesting that in the absence of targeted instruction listeners tend to solidify the use of the strategy that works well for them. Our findings provide evidence of strong reliance on pitch among Mandarin learners and difficulties resisting default strategies in L2 speech perception. Nevertheless, we show that perceptual strategies that took a lifetime to develop can be adjusted with as little as three hours of training. These findings offer a new direction for designing targeted training paradigms.",

          "authors": "Benedek Kurdi; David Melnikoff; Adam Morris",
          "abstract": "Influential classic and contemporary accounts have posited that implicit attitudes reside beyond conscious awareness. This idea has been challenged by robust evidence demonstrating that participants can predict their own implicit attitudes highly accurately. However, past tests have all been conducted using well-known targets (e.g., racial groups), about which participants possess ample relevant knowledge. As such, predictions of implicit attitudes may have relied on inferential mechanisms drawing on sources of knowledge other than privileged introspective access, most prominently explicit attitudes. In this project we conducted eight experiments (five preregistered; total N = 6,794) in which implicit attitudes and their explicit counterparts were manipulated to shift in opposite directions, thus eliminating the latter as an obvious source of inference. Across experiments, mean-level implicit attitude predictions (Œ≤ =  0.31) were directionally consistent with explicit (Œ≤ =  0.49) rather than implicit attitudes (Œ≤ = 0.20). Moreover, although predictions and implicit attitudes were associated with each other at the level of individual participants (Œ≤ = 0.20), the relationship was considerably stronger among participants for whom explicit and implicit attitudes were aligned with each other (Œ≤ = 0.38) than among participants for whom the two were dissociated (Œ≤ = 0.11). These results generalized across two learning paradigms (impression formation and attribute conditioning), two implicit attitude measures (IAT and EPT), and two types of experimental design (between-participant and within-participant). Echoing classic and contemporary accounts, the present data suggest that implicit attitudes are largely unconscious, and successful implicit attitude predictions are subserved primarily by inference rather than introspection.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how developers problem-solve within ecosystems of practice, tooling, and social contexts is a critical step in determining which factors dampen, aid or accelerate software innovation. However, industry conceptions of developer problem-solving often focus on overly simplistic measures of output, over-extrapolate from small case studies, rely on conventional definitions of ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù and short-term definitions of performance, fail to integrate the new economic features of the open collaborative innovation that marks software progress, and fail to integrate rich bodies\nof evidence about problem-solving from the social sciences. We propose an alternative to individualistic explanations for software developer problem-solving: a Cumulative Culture theory for developer problem-solving. This paper aims to provide an interdisciplinary introduction to underappreciated elements of developers‚Äô communal, social cognition which are required for software development creativity and problem-solving, either empowering or constraining the solutions that developers access and implement. We propose that despite a conventional emphasis on individualistic explanations, developers‚Äô problem-solving (and hence, many of the central innovation cycles in software) is better described as a cumulative culture where collective social learning (rather than solitary and isolated genius) plays a key role in the transmission of solutions, the scaffolding of individual productivity, and the overall velocity of innovation.",

          "abstract": "Studying individual differences in psychology often involves examining\ncorrelations across various measures. However, research involving high-\ndimensional data‚Äîsuch as in task batteries or neuroscience‚Äîoften targets\nlatent constructs rather than individual correlations. Furthermore, the num-\nber of correlations grows quadratically with increasing dimensionality, po-\ntentially leading to overfitting and spurious inference. Therefore, researchers\ncommonly use factor analysis to study individual differences.

          "authors": "Oksana Zinchenko; Arman Onurcan; Yulia Eremenko; Anna Shestakova",
          "abstract": "The perception of food is probably one of the most multisensory experience in our daily lives. It also significantly affects our food decisions. Recent researches by psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists reveal how the complex multisensory interactions influence the food experiences we all know and love. The involvement of chefs in studies devoted to multisensory food perception made this topic even more interesting and interactive since many chefs who work in fine-dining restaurants are trying the optimize the customers' dining experiences (Spence, 2015). This topic is mainly studied by analyzing the cross-modal perception among different senses such as vision, taste and auditory. So far, it has been found that color-taste interaction may alter our perception of taste such as the sweets that are served on the white-round shaped plates are perceived 15 percent sweeter than the sweets that are served on black-rectangular shaped plates or stale potato chips are perceived even crispier than freshly made potato chips when the high-pitched crunch biting sound is involved (Zampini and Spence 2004). These findings support the importance of multisensory food experiences in our food decisions and this study will examine how we can nudge people into healthier food choices by using multisensory food perception and also by analyzing if different textures of the same ingredients and their cross-modal interactions with the congruent sounds may alter the consumers' liking of the sustainable foods.\n\nMultisensory food perception is quite a new topic that emerged in the last 20 years in relation with the 'neurogastronomy' (Shepherd, 2011). This field is closely related to cross-modal perception and synaesthesia. Even though these two topics have been researched for more than 150 years, there are no fundamental studies focused on the cross-modal perception of different senses in relation of different food products. Previous studies have investigated individual differences in multisensory food perception and suggest that individuals' multisensory food perception significantly differ genetically and culturally (Spence,2015). Several studies have also suggested that taste-sound or taste-color congruency may lead to cut down on sugar and salt consumption since the increased intensity of the taste match among different senses may provide less need of sugar or salt for any food product (Spence,2015 ; Piqueras-Fiszman et al., 2012). Considering these previous results, it is possible to hypothesize that the multisensory approach to food perception can be used to help nudging consumers towards healthier food decisions (Spence and Piqueras-Fiszman, 2014; Marteau et al., 2012). \n\nWe plan to investigate the cross-modal perception between texture, taste and sound by conducting a behavioural experiment where the participants‚Äô texture, taste and sound congruency will be measured to analyse if the multisensory food congruency may influence consumers‚Äô food decisions and food perceptions. We expect that this study will be able to nudge consumers towards healthier food choices by manipulating food perception in different sensory modalities.",

Sequential BCI listeners exhibited lower CNC scores on their second ear, compared to their first ear. \n\nConclusion: Speech perception with CIs is reduced in SSD listeners compared to BCI users, likely due to blocking, where the normal-hearing ear diminishes reliance on the CI. Lower performance in the second implanted ear of sequential BCI listeners also suggests greater reliance on the more experienced ear. These findings highlight the need for additional training, resources, and support to optimize CI performance in SSD listeners, despite prior evidence of positive CNC outcomes.",

          "authors": "Niclas Kaiser; Juan Camilo Avendano-Diaz",
          "abstract": "Relational neuroscience struggles to capture the complex dynamics of shared interpersonal moments, leading to gaps in understanding whether and how interdependencies between interacting persons translate into something meaningful. Current neuroscientific research often focuses on motor synchronization and cognition rather than the implicit relational qualities central to psychotherapy. We argue that this disconnect stems from an over-reliance on simplified quantitative methods, a failure to centralize experiential factors, and the lack of convergent research. Drawing on emerging frameworks such as 4E cognition (embodied, enacted, extended, and embedded) and MoBI (Mobile Brain/Body Imaging), we advocate for integrating subjective and experiential elements with neural data. We propose focusing on \"qualities\" in multi-brain neuroscience‚Äîmoving beyond binary or linear scales‚Äîto better capture the subtleties of relational moments. Finally, we emphasize the importance of convergence research across disciplines to better understand what interpresence holds. If psychotherapeutic knowledge is used to guide neuroscientists in what to look for, this multi-disciplinary approach holds promise for advancing the study of psychotherapy's relational processes, offering new insights into the neurobiology of meaningful moments in therapy and elsewhere. We propose ConNECT (Convergent research including Neuroscience and Experiences, Capturing meaningful dynamics with Therapists‚Äô knowledge) as the path forward.",

          "abstract": "Implementation intentions could be a promising metacognitive strategy for self-regulated learning. They could help students increase the likelihood of studying by planning when and where to study. In a 42-day micro-randomized trial in an authentic real-world setting, we examined the effectiveness of planning prompts to increase children‚Äôs engagement with a vocabulary learning app. Children (N = 357) received mobile prompts in the evening asking them to formulate appropriate implementation intentions for the next day, that is, if-then plans specifying when and where they would like to study vocabulary.\nResults indicated that planning prompts were not effective per se; rather, the effectiveness of planning depended crucially on the quality of the plan. Using a newly developed rubric to classify plan quality based on the specificity, saliency, and contextual aspects of the plan, we show that the higher the plan quality, the more likely children were to study the next day. These findings suggest that well-formulated if-then plans are a useful metacognitive strategy for action control, helping to increase the likelihood of studying.\nFor children to use this metacognitive strategy to plan their own studying, researchers and teachers need to ensure that they explain it carefully, provide examples of high-quality plans, and preferably scaffold the creation of plans by providing feedback.",

          "abstract": "Spatial navigation problems are regularly reported in older adults and represent a significant challenge to quality of life. This study aimed to understand navigational strategies in older adults using a virtual honeycomb-shaped maze. We have previously shown in this maze that younger individuals, aged 18 to 40, typically adopt a strategy of alternating their turns at successive junctions, while those aged 70 and above show significantly fewer alternations. One theory explaining this behavior in older adults is diminished spatial working memory. In the current study, we tested ways to support spatial knowledge of the environment: by providing either distal cues or a map of the environment, with only the former expected to facilitate spatial working memory. We asked younger (n = 107, aged 18-40) and older (n = 77, aged ‚â•70) participants to navigate a virtual honeycomb-shaped maze.  Without additional cues, older adults made fewer sequential alternations compared to younger participants. However, when provided with distal cues, older adults increased their sequential alternations, whereas the map did not have the same effect. The findings suggest that spatial memory limitations in older adults affect navigational choices, but providing certain types of environmental cues, such as distal cues, can help compensate for these limitations. This could have implications for designing environments to enhance independence in older adults and in the design of cognitive tests for spatial working memory.",

This included focusing on creating a distraction-free environment for writing, holding the event across a weekend to accommodate other commitments, and offering travel bursaries for those that lived significant distances from campus. Data gathered from feedback forms showed that the timing, location and content of the retreat met the needs of attendees; enabling them to connect with other doctoral students and make good progress with their writing. The focus group highlighted benefits of the retreat in more detail, including: the importance of peer support, the opportunity for self-reflection and empowerment, and the rarity of an opportunity that met their needs.

          "abstract": "Parental engagement is known to positively influence children‚Äôs educational outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether teachers in England are sufficiently equipped to facilitate effective parental engagement. We therefore conducted a national online survey of 1782 qualified teachers in England, to explore their parental engagement training, knowledge, skills and factors influencing those skills. \n\nWe identified concerning training gaps, with most teachers receiving no training in which types of parental engagement are most effective or how to identify and remove barriers to parental engagement. Only a minority of teachers recognised the importance of parent-child interactions in their conceptualisation of parental engagement, with many seemingly preoccupied with less effective school involvement activities. Teachers‚Äô parental engagement skills were associated with their self-efficacy, experience, workload, training route and other factors. \n\nThe findings suggest that teachers require better training to prepare them to facilitate effective parental engagement with learning. This study makes an important contribution to the development of future training by pinpointing specific gaps in teachers‚Äô parental engagement knowledge and skills, and identifying predictors of those skills. As such, it has implications for teachers, teacher educators, school leaders and policymakers, aiming to optimise parental engagement practices to enhance children's educational outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to examine how older adults form beliefs about their memory and how these beliefs are influenced by their level of concern about dementia. Inaccurate beliefs and excessive worrying, indicative of erroneous metacognition, are associated with negative health outcomes. This research can help identify mitigation for these harmful effects. \n\nDesign: Qualitative focus groups; thematic analysis\n\nSetting: Focus Group discussion with healthy older adults hosted at a university in central London.\n\nParticipants: Thirty-five healthy older individuals (Female = 29) without any psychiatric or neurological diagnoses, over the age of 65 (mean 75.31, SD: 6.15). Thirteen participants were identified as having a high level of worry about dementia and 22 as having low worry. Groups were matched for cognitive performance on the Telephone Mini Addenbrooke‚Äôs cognitive assessment (Tele-MACE).\n\nOutcome Measures: Participants were assigned to a focus group depending on their level of worry about dementia. During focus groups a vignette prompted discussion around lifespan changes in memory and how this affected concerns around memory. This allowed investigation of the differences in beliefs about memory. \n\nResults: Thematic Analysis revealed two key themes. First, older adults appear to base their definition of ‚Äònormality‚Äô of their own memory on comparisons. These comparisons were between themselves and others; and between themselves now and their own past self. Second, there was a key difference between those with high versus low worry; those with high worry consistently attributed dementia as directly relevant to themself. \n\nConclusion: Comparison is a common metacognitive strategy used in forming beliefs about memory. Targeting the use of comparison is potentially valuable in interventions aiming to alleviate older adults‚Äô memory concerns. Addressing self-focused thinking, e.g., with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, could improve harmful levels of high worry.",

          "abstract": "Nonlinear relationships among variables play an important role in psychological modeling and understanding changes over time from intensive longitudinal data (ILD). Most methods focus on linear models, with a few exceptions developed for specific nonlinear interactions or general system dynamics. Methods considering multiple possible nonlinear relationships among all variables remain sparse, hindered by challenges like overfitting and interpretation difficulties. This article examines the feasibility of applying such a method to psychological ILD, using the Regularization Algorithm under Marginality Principle (RAMP) alongside a local linearization method for interpretation. We evaluated its performance with simulated and empirical datasets using classification metrics, information criteria, and cross-validation. Results show this method often requires long series for satisfactory performance. While information criteria favor the nonlinear method in empirical datasets, cross-validation favors simpler AR models. Nonetheless, these challenges are comparable to those in linear idiographic modeling. Clear evidence of nonlinear relationships among variables supports the value of this method for exploratory studies. We developed an R package, quadVAR, as an implementation of this method.",

          "abstract": "Background: While growing research confirms the efficacy of transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (TD-CBT) by examining group-level changes from pre to post-treatment, less is known about inter-individual differences and dynamic changes during therapy. Understanding different symptom trajectories and their associations with treatment outcome would allow early detection of non-responders and treatment adjustments.\n\nMethods: Patients with anxiety disorders reported on demographics, clinical history, treatment motivation, and expectations before randomization to TD-CBT or wait-list. We analyzed data from the treatment group who provided symptom ratings every session and post-treatment follow-up (N = 64, 71.9% female, age: M = 32.67, SD = 11.91). Using latent class growth analysis (LCGA), we identified symptom trajectory classes and tested whether these could be predicted from baseline data. We also examined associations between classes and treatment outcome, using multilevel modeling and considering reliable change indices. \n\nResults: LCGA revealed four distinct trajectory classes: low severity - improved (32.81%), high severity - improved (29.69%), high severity-stagnant (18.75%), and low severity - worsened (18.75%). Only number of comorbidities emerged as a significant predictor of class, with patients in the high severity - stagnant group having more comorbidities. They also showed higher symptom severity at baseline and follow-ups compared to other classes, despite clear improvement.\n\nConclusions: During TD-CBT, latent classes of symptom change can be distinguished and point to malleable factors already present at pre-treatment. Particularly patients with high initial burden and a higher number of comorbidities may require monitoring and adaptive treatment strategies, which should be explored in future studies.",

          "abstract": "From their observations of others‚Äô behavior, adults quickly form character impressions.

Developmental psychology has provided some evidence that infants, like adults, may form impressions based on others‚Äô prosocial and antisocial behavior. But how do infants respond to inconsistent behavior? Do infants update their impressions when people behave inconsistently? The present, preregistered experiments examined 11-month-olds‚Äô (N = 189) ability to incorporate inconsistency in their social evaluations. We first successfully replicated the finding that when actors behave consistently, infants prefer looking to helpers over hinderers (Experiment 1). In our key experiments, infants observed an actor who behaved inconsistently (either mostly helping or mostly hindering) paired with an actor who behaved consistently (either always hindering or always helping, respectively). Would infants prefer the actor who was on average more prosocial? We found that infants preferred looking to more prosocial actors, but they did not look longer when an actor‚Äôs behavior changed, suggestive that they did not notice the change in behavior. Finally, in Experiment 3, we found that infants‚Äô evaluations of inconsistent actors in Experiment 2 may be due to a primacy bias: a focus on what an actor did first, rather than an ability to incorporate consistency. Together, these findings raise the possibility that infants‚Äô social evaluations are based on their first impressions of others. These findings may reflect a developmental precursor to adults‚Äô ‚Äústicky‚Äù character impressions.",

Results reveal relatively moderate LGBQ support among religious leaders (M = 2.61, range = 1.0‚Äì6.5), with psychosocial factors (e.g., identifying as White, woman, higher education, income) and religious/spiritual struggles associated with greater support, while literal Biblical interpretation and prayer practices associated with lower support.

Specifically, symptoms relevant to diverse disorders may be expeditiously alleviated when etiology is correctly identified at outset. This study aimed to evaluate how MindMetrix, a wide-ranging statistic-driven assessment, affected the trajectory of symptom improvement in patients at a large outpatient center.\n\nMethods:\nIn this retrospective, pretest-postest non-equivalent study, all patients who initiated treatment at Rochester Center for Behavioral Medicine completed an intake appointment before being assigned to take MindMetrix (n = 97) or commencing treatment without additional assessment (n = 50). Before every visit, patients took a pre-visit survey, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale-2, and the ADHD Symptom and Side Effect Tracking Scale (ASSET). To determine whether MindMetrix adjusted symptom improvement over time, moderation analyses with time in treatment, MindMetrix assignment, and an interaction term examined the interactive effect on PHQ-9, GAD-2, or ASSET scale scores. This analysis included all patient visits after they began treatment at RCBM.\n\nResults: \nThe moderation analyses found improvements in PHQ-9, GAD-2, and ASSET scales as patients proceeded through treatment, independently of their MindMetrix assignment. On the PHQ-9 and ASSET, MindMetrix significantly adjusted the effect of time in treatment, suggesting accelerated improvement.\n\nConclusions:\nResults suggest that MindMetrix is an effective tool that can be used to guide early clinical decisions. Improvements seen in patients who took the MindMetrix assessment support its clinical benefit and potential for broad application in behavioral health and primary care centers.",

          "abstract": "Embodied cognition research suggests a functional link between numerical and spatial cognition. Accordingly, numbers are assumed to be mentally represented on a ‚Äúnumber line‚Äù, with smaller numbers on the left and larger numbers on the right in Western culture. Supporting this, prior findings show a numerical lateralization effect, where participants generating random numbers while turning their heads sideways produce more small numbers when facing left than when facing right. Here, we aimed to replicate and extend these findings by investigating the relative contributions of visual and proprioceptive signals to the spatial-numerical association. Our novel augmented reality setup enabled us to separate visual and proprioceptive cues for horizontal head rotation. We hypothesized that participants would generate more small numbers when facing left in the ordinary visual perspective (normal condition, i.e., proprioceptive and visual cues aligned), and that this tendency would be reduced when the visual axis was inverted (inverted condition). We also used a rod and frame task to assess the individuals‚Äô visual dependency and a newly developed side detection task for head somatomotor rotation sensitivity. We hypothesized that visual dependency would correlate with numerical lateralization, while an inverted pattern would be observed for head rotation sensitivity. Results showed moderate evidence against the effect of head direction, indicating that we were unable to replicate the previously reported effect. Additionally, the moderate evidence against the effect of condition suggests that inverting the visual field did not reduce the frequency of small numbers generated when looking left. These findings imply that the spatial bias in number generation may be less robust or may not generalize to head-mounted display setups.",

          "abstract": "Discrimination in the evaluation of others is a key cause of social inequality around the world. However, relatively little is known about psychological interventions that can be used to prevent biased evaluations. The limited evidence that exists on these strategies is spread across many methods and populations, making it difficult to generate reliable best practices that can be effective across contexts. In the present work, we held a research contest to solicit interventions with the goal of reducing discrimination based on physical attractiveness using a hypothetical admissions task. Thirty interventions were tested across four rounds of data collection (total N &gt; 20,000). Using a Signal Detection Theory approach to evaluate interventions, we identified two interventions that reduced discrimination by lessening both decision noise and decision bias, while two other interventions reduced overall discrimination by only lessening noise or bias. The most effective interventions largely provided concrete strategies that directed participants‚Äô attention towards decision-relevant criteria and away from socially biasing information, though the fact that very similar interventions produced differing effects on discrimination suggests certain key characteristics that are needed for manipulations to reliably impact judgment. The effects of these four interventions on decision bias, noise, or both also replicated in a different discrimination domain, political affiliation, and generalized to populations with self-reported hiring experience. Results of the contest for decreasing attractiveness-based favoritism suggest that identifying effective routes for changing discriminatory behavior is a challenge, and that greater investment is needed to develop impactful, flexible, and scalable strategies for reducing discrimination.",

          "abstract": "What are the risky choices people are confronted with in our complex and fast-changing world? This article reports on a set of representative population surveys in Switzerland (N = 4, 380) that collected those risky choices people perceive to be relevant in their own lives or in the lives of a large number of fellow citizens. Based on this empirical basis we developed an inventory of 100 risky choices, which we analyzed to address several open issues of the behavioral sciences, such as regarding the structure of the current ecology of risk (e.g., life domains; stability). Moreover, we employed this inventory with an\nindependent follow-up study (N = 933) to thus address the generalizabilty of the psychological construct of risk preference to real-life choices that are relevant to various subgroups of the population. The five key insights that emerged from developing, analyzing, and employing this inventory may not only be useful for researchers studying decision making under risk and uncertainty (e.g., what criteria to use for the development of novel measurement instruments), but also for policy making and various applied settings (e.g., by mapping who will likely be confronted with which risky choices; how swiftly the\nrisks of modern life change, either spontaneously or in response to a global shock).",

          "abstract": "When solving problems with a clear goal, people often rely on backward reasoning by recursively breaking down a problem into subgoals. The cognitive mechanisms of backward reasoning are poorly understood, and no computational process models have been fitted on human data to explain this problem solving technique. We propose that backward reasoning can be seen as search through a space of subgoals and actions to attain them. We show that this space can be represented by an AND-OR tree, a structure first used in early artificial intelligence research to automate problem solving. We hypothesize that, when solving problems with a clear goal,  people reason backward by searching through AND-OR trees. To test this hypothesis, we collected data from a task where participants rearranged elements within a constrained space to achieve a specific goal. We then developed a psychologically plausible, single-parameter process model which we fit to data from the task on a per-participant basis. We found that our model successfully captured key trends in the data, unlike alternative models. Our results demonstrate a deeper understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of human problem solving.",

          "abstract": "Synchrony has been proposed as a relevant phenomenon for investigating social neurophysiological and psychological processes, with inter-brain synchrony, in particular, presumed to facilitate the functional integration of multiple brains. However, the lack of an accepted definition and a cohesive theoretical corpus that allows hypothesis-based approaches, often combined with inadequate empirical methods, weakens this area of research. To address this, we propose a rigorous definition of inter-brain synchrony and link various theoretical contributions to justify the existence of meaningful temporal alignment between different brain activities. This article outlines a set of methods to provide valid evidence supporting this neural mechanism. Our approach entails extracting instantaneous phase data from Hilbert-transformed EEG time series recorded from individuals under different experimental conditions that account for confounding factors such as shared attention, cognitive, and motor dependencies. We then describe multiple data analysis approaches, including circular statistics combined with permutation testing, and mutual information. Finally, we present an example of a potential application within the context of cooperation in nuclear families. We believe that, by employing such methods consistently, the concept of inter brain synchrony is falsifiable. Whether this phenomenon is empirically supported or not, it will contribute to advancing our understanding of the social brain.",

          "abstract": "Based on the paradigm of previous waiting-time studies (Jokic et al., 2018; Witowska et al., 2020), participants in our study (n = 133) were left alone in an empty room for 7.5 minutes and subsequently asked to report on their perceptions of time and subjective experiences during the waiting period. Participants completed personality questionnaires assessing the constructs of impulsiveness (UPPS-P), time perspective (CFC-14), and mindfulness (FMI). Consistent with previous research, a faster passage of time was associated with reduced attention to time, lower arousal and boredom levels, and more relaxation and positive affect. Mediation analyses revealed that, among all subjective experiences, boredom was the only significant predictor mediating the effect of personality traits on the perceived passage of time. Specifically, individuals (a) prone to rash actions under intense positive affect and (b) who prioritize immediate outcomes over distant future consequences of their actions tended to experience more boredom while waiting, which in turn led to a subjectively slower passage of waiting time. Potential explanations and directions for further research are discussed.\nKey words: waiting, time perception, passage of time, consideration of future consequences, impulsiveness, mindfulness, boredom",

          "abstract": "A great deal of research in dual process models has been devoted to highlighting differences in the structure and function of the implicit and explicit attitude constructs. However, the two forms of attitudes can also demonstrate important shared properties, and prior work suggests that one similarity may be in factors that determine measurement reliability. To better explore this issue, Study 1 analyzed the test-retest reliability in measures of both implicit and explicit attitudes within a single study session across 75 topics (N &gt; 35,000). Explicit attitudes had greater test-retest reliability than implicit attitudes, but each showed considerable heterogeneity across topics, even when measured within a single study session. Analyses also included several candidate moderator variables, such as attitude certainty or familiarity. While results were not identical, the moderators associated with greater test-retest reliability for implicit and explicit attitudes exhibited more similarities than differences. Specifically, attitudes experienced as more distinctive, more relevant to one‚Äôs self-concept, more certain, and more accessible had higher test-retest reliability for both forms of evaluation. Variation in short-term reliability for implicit and explicit attitudes was replicated in Study 2, and Study 3 revealed that topics low in short-term reliability were also lower in a longitudinal sample that completed measures separated by several weeks. These results advance our understanding of each attitude construct, and are consistent with a more dynamic relationship between an attitude and its measure, as even attitudes measured with high levels of conscious control could show remarkable short-term instability when assessed only minutes apart.",

Using a large (N=974) online experiment, we test the relationship between the illusory truth effect and prior belief in trivia statements. In contrast to previous work, we measure the prior belief that an individual assigns to a specific statement to allow for a precise estimation of this relationship. Concerningly, we find that not only does the illusory truth effect appear meaningful for statements where participants have low prior belief, the effect is also stronger for these initially implausible statements. Our findings suggest that repetition can be particularly harmful when statements are initially seen as implausible.",

          "abstract": "Drowsy driving is one of the leading contributing factors to traffic accidents. As drivers continue driving despite being aware of their drowsy states, it is necessary to adopt active countermeasures to avoid them falling asleep behind the wheel. Based on the multiple resources model, this study proposed five countermeasure types using voice assistants (no countermeasure vs. meaninglessly listening vs. meaningfully listening vs. repeating vs. answering) and investigated their effects on countering drowsiness of younger (25-35 years) and middle-aged (36-65 years) drivers. A simulated manual driving experiment with 29 participants was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures on driving behaviors, physiological indicators, eye movement indicators, and subjective ratings. All results indicated that the repeating and answering conditions were the most effective in alerting drowsy drivers, suggesting that countermeasures involving more human resource stages can enhance alertness. The trend of higher alertness in the answering condition compared to the repeating condition highlighted the potential advantage of increasing cognitive load in countering drowsiness. Listening conditions showed limited effects on alerting drivers but no adverse effects on driving performance or worsening drowsiness. Regarding age, younger and middle-aged drowsy drivers did not differ on average in response to different countermeasures. However, considering individual differences in physiological activation in reacting to countermeasures, drowsiness countermeasures should be tailored to the individual needs, particularly for middle-aged drivers. Apart from facilitating the understanding of drowsiness countermeasure mechanisms, the present findings provided implications for vehicle designers and engineers in utilizing in-vehicle voice assistants as an effective drowsiness countermeasure.",

          "abstract": "Advances in AI-assisted voice technology have made it easier to clone or disguise voices, creating a wide range of synthetic voices using different accents, dialects, and languages. While these developments offer positive applications, they also pose risks for misuse. This raises the question as to whether listeners can reliably distinguish between human and AI-enhanced speech and whether prior experiences and expectations about language varieties that are traditionally less-represented by technology affect this ability. Two experiments were conducted to investigate listeners‚Äô ability to categorise voices as human or AI-enhanced in both a standard and a regional Scottish dialect. Using a Signal Detection Theory framework, both experiments explored participants' sensitivity and categorisation biases. In Experiment 1 (N = 100), a predominantly Scottish sample showed above-chance performance in distinguishing between human and AI-enhanced voices, but there was no significant effect of dialect on sensitivity. However, listeners exhibited a bias toward categorising voices as ‚Äúhuman‚Äù, which was concentrated within the regional Dundonian Scots dialect. In Experiment 2 (N = 100) participants from southern and eastern England, demonstrated reduced overall sensitivity and a Human Categorisation Bias that was more evenly spread across the two dialects. These findings have implications for the growing use of AI-assisted voice technology in linguistically diverse contexts, highlighting both the potential for enhanced representation of Minority, Indigenous, Non-standard and Dialect (MIND) varieties, and the risks of AI misuse.",

          "abstract": "Climate skepticism remains a significant barrier to public engagement with accurate climate information, because skeptics actively engage in information avoidance to escape exposure to climate facts. Here we show that generative AI can enhance engagement with climate science among skeptical audiences by subtly modifying headlines to align better with their existing perspectives, without compromising factual integrity. In a controlled experiment (N = 2000) using a stylized social media interface, headlines of climate science articles modified by an open-source large language model (Llama3 70B, version 3.0) led to more bookmarks and more upvotes, and these effects were strongest among the most skeptical participants. Skeptics who engaged with climate science as a result of this intervention showed a shift in beliefs toward the scientific consensus by the end of the study. These results show that generative AI can alter the information diet skeptics consume, with the promise that scalable, sustained engagement will promote better epistemic health. They highlight the potential of generative AI as a tool for truth, showing that while it can be misused by bad actors, it also holds promise for advancing public understanding of science when responsibly deployed by well-intentioned actors.",

          "abstract": "Visual search tasks are commonly used to study how people guide their attention amidst distraction. Developmental studies have used visual search to explore age-related differences in attention. Typical findings show that performance declines and sensitivity to distraction increases in older compared to younger adults. Such findings are taken as evidence of the declining abilities in goal-driven attention. However, standard visual search tasks use static displays and therefore fail to capture the challenges and opportunities in natural environments, which include predictive structures within extended contexts. To investigate how adults of different ages guide their attention in dynamic and extended contexts, we used our recently developed Dynamic Visual Search (DVS). In DVS targets and distractors compete over time and embedded spatiotemporal regularities afford prediction-led guidance of attention. Critically, we manipulated the levels of distraction to chart whether and how benefits of expectations and deficits from distraction varied with age. Younger and older adults searched for multiple visual targets as they faded in and out of the display among distractors while varying the number of distracting elements. Half the targets always appeared at the same time and approximate locations and could be predicted. While we found evidence for decrement and elevated sensitivity to distraction with increasing age, benefits from predictions occurred in all groups. Interestingly, regardless of age, effects of predictions were only significant during periods of high distraction. This work extends our understanding of attention control through ageing to dynamic settings and indicates a dissociation between goal-directed and learning-driven and attentional guidance.",

This article explores the application of RRs to the study of identity and migration, focusing on the advantages and limitations of this format across both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. While RRs have been predominantly adopted in quantitative studies to mitigate issues like p-hacking and the publication bias towards positive results, their potential for qualitative research remains underexplored. Through the lens of creating a special issue on identity and migration, this article examines the feasibility of RRs in fostering rigorous, transparent, and contextually grounded scholarship. Seven RRs are reviewed, encompassing diverse methodological approaches and sociocultural contexts, which collectively highlight the fluidity of social identities and the impact of migration on identity formation. In the current article, we reflect on both the content of these studies, as well as the process of cultivating a special issue based solely on RRs. Specifically, we advocate for tailored guidelines that respect the iterative nature of qualitative inquiry, while encouraging the broader adoption of RRs to advance global research on identity and migration.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance declines across the lifespan, partly due to greater vulnerability to environmental distraction. WM requires resistance to distractors, which may enter WM due to ineffective filtering during simultaneous presentation with targets, as in a spatial array during WM encoding. Alternatively, distractors may enter WM due to insufficient ability to ignore them when they are presented during WM maintenance. Current research disagrees about whether a deficit in distractor suppression accounts for older adults‚Äô impaired WM performance, or not. Beyond these differing perspectives, it is unclear whether WM performance is vulnerable to different types of distractors, including those that are novel versus familiar, or high versus low saliency. Across three behavioral experiments we found that participants were more vulnerable to distractors presented during encoding than those presented during maintenance, with stronger effects in older adults. Distractor familiarity and saliency had minimal impact on WM performance, and patterns of results did not change across trials. Rather than providing converging evidence these data expand the pattern of distractor-related WM deficits observed in older adults.",

For external predictive validity across 24 traits, demographics, and behaviors, both language formats doubled the ratings‚Äô accuracy, with words reaching an average of r = .18 and essays r = .24 (p &lt; .001).

Current gold standard approaches draw from two sources of information: simple cognitive assessments of reasoning ability and past forecasting accuracy. Cognitive assessments are well-studied and normed psychometric instruments, but have lower predictive value. Real-world forecasting problems are more challenging to norm a priori: they typically require a large comparison sample of forecasters to make predictive inferences. This paper develops the Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT): a one-hour test that predicts more than 60% of the variation in out-of-sample forecasting accuracy, double the predictive utility of prior work. We highlight several key results: (1) Eliciting forecasts in a quantile format is considerably more psychometrically reliable, meaning it is more efficient at reducing measurement error about forecasters' expected accuracy with fewer items, than forecasts elicited using the standard probability format common to most judgmental forecasting tournaments. (2) Several cognitive tasks, novel to forecasting research, are highly predictive of forecasting ability. These include denominator neglect, Bayesian updating, and adherence to decision rules. (3) Although our methods do best at separating out the worst forecasters from the population, they are also remarkably effective at identifying elite talent in the upper range of the skill distribution.",

          "abstract": "Dual process accounts of reasoning posit that the interactions between automatic Type 1 processes and reflective Type 2 processes are regulated through the mechanism of conflict detection. Conflict detection is thought to be triggered when two or more incompatible responses to a problem are produced. Conflict detection can be viewed as an aspect of metacognition, as both are concerned with monitoring the outputs from the reasoning process as assessing one's certainty in them. In this paper we apply the self-consistency model of metacognition to analyse cues that inform confidence judgements in reasoning, to investigate the potential sources of responses to a given problem. In four experiments (total N = 524), we analysed the relationship between confidence and accuracy on the base-rate task and syllogisms, and used a solution-evaluation task format to manipulate uncertainty experimentally. We found that in both tasks, confidence and accuracy were influenced by many cues, rather than belief-logic conflict exclusively. Belief-logic conflict was a significant cue to confidence in the base-rate task, but not in syllogisms. Across all experiments, items identified as eliciting the most uncertainty, based on the self-consistency model, showed greater conflict detection effects. Introducing an additional cue that was inconsistent with the most common response generally increased uncertainty and conflict detection. These findings support the uncertainty monitoring account of conflict detection and link it with the broader metacognition research.",

Studies that compared reading acquisition for different scripts used line-based scripts and investigated them in terms of complexity, novelty, or associations of stimuli from different categories. Here, we directly compared a novel, custom-made, line-based script derived from Braille (Line Braille) to visual Braille, a script that only includes patterns of dots and no line junctions. For four consecutive days, two groups of participants underwent online training, during which they first mapped new letters onto the Latin alphabet and then trained on full words. Each day, participants were tested by asking them to transcribe a set of stimuli (words and pseudowords) from the novel to the Latin script. Across sessions, we found no significant differences between scripts in the overall transcription accuracy nor in the time required to transcribe words. We only found a small delay in the learning trajectory of the Braille group represented through an interaction between group and session in overall accuracy, and slightly higher sensitivity for stimulus length in the Braille group. Overall, these results show that line junctions only provide a small and temporary benefit when learning a new script, contrasting with the idea that line junctions is a core visual features for learning orthography.",

The dataset comprises in-depth interviews with 10 clinical psychologists, along with a sociodemographic survey and the application of the Techno-Stress Scale (RED/TIC) to a sample of 170 Brazilian clinical psychologists. Key findings include the following: the majority of participants are women (84%), white (64%), aged 24‚Äì35 (60%), and childless (72%). Additionally, 50% are single, 65% hold a graduate degree (either lato or stricto sensu), and 61% undergraduated from private higher education universities. Regarding professional experience, 92% have been doing online counselling for less than five years, and 48% have at least two concurrent work affiliations. While 93% work as freelancers, 27% also hold a salaried position. Regarding mental health and work challenges, 32% reported cognitive and emotional exhaustion linked to the use of technology for clinical counselling. Additionally, 54% felt pressured by the productivity demands imposed by social media platforms. Among participants, 40% exhibited moderate levels of techno-stress, and 9% showed high levels. Within the dimensions of techno-stress, 32% demonstrated high levels of fatigue, and 20% reported significant anxiety related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Among psychologists experiencing high levels of techno-stress, 93% are women, 73% felt pressured by the productivity logic of platforms, and 53% maintained two or more concurrent work affiliations. Furthermore, 40% struggled to disconnect from work, yet only 13% rated their emotional health for remote work as \"poor\" or \"very poor.\" This suggests that techno-stress often goes unrecognized by professionals in the short term. This study highlights the urgent need for a critical examination of how digitalization and platformization influence the well-being of clinical psychologists, offering valuable insights for future interventions and policy development.",

          "abstract": "Recent research documents that thinking about God encourages intergroup prosociality among believers. An open question is whether any such increases are dampened by intergroup conflict. We conducted preregistered field experiments with two ethno-religious populations in Fiji: indigenous Christian iTaukei (N = 324) and Hindu Indo-Fijians (N = 280). In each study, we manipulated (between-person) whether participants thought about intergroup conflict before completing a dictator game in which we manipulated (within-person) whether participants thought about God‚Äôs preferences when allocating real money to an outgroup member. Although participants who reflected on intergroup conflict gave less money away to outgroup members, thinking about God led to significant and comparable increases in intergroup prosociality regardless of whether participants thought about conflict. Results challenge widely held assumptions about the role of religious belief in intergroup conflict and raise questions about mechanisms that are often theorized to explain the spread of religious beliefs themselves.",

          "abstract": "Implementing existing green digital technology at scale could lead to a 20% reduction in global emissions annually. However, climate change has become a central focus of the \"culture wars\" providing a significant hindrance to the adoption of this technology. Using two survey experiments (total N = 2,089), we show that there is substantial heterogeneity in purchasing intentions when the same pro-environmental product is called \"smart\" or \"green.\" Environmental concern serves as an important moderator, with participants low in environmental concern showing a substantial aversion to green branding. We consider the marketing actions available to firms in this polarized environment and suggest that ideological sorting reduces the burden of targeting. We demonstrate that political party, an easily observable or inferred characteristic, provides a clean market segmentation correlating highly with environmental concern while capturing additional variation in the efficacy of green branding. Using simulations of multiple targeting schemes corresponding to different levels of sophistication and data access, we estimate that showing consumers the branding that aligns best with their political affiliation can increase purchasing intentions by 4%, performing just as well as a causal machine learning targeting approach. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that a 4% increase in purchasing intentions for just the five products tested here would reduce carbon emissions by approximately 1.2 gigatons by 2050, the equivalent of 5.4 million flights from London to New York City.",

          "abstract": "The digital revolution heralds the advent of the ‚Äú√©cran global‚Äù era. The transformation of media has led to the miniaturization of screens and films (or videos). The micro-videos have emerged as one of the predominant forms of contemporary audiovisual expression. The key characteristics of traditional cinema have been redefined, leading to a ‚Äúrelocation‚Äù of the cinematic experience‚Äîreactivated and reproposed elsewhere than the place in which it was formed, with alternate devices (such as mobile digital apparatuses) and in new environments (such as the peripersonal space). This new form of experience is characterized by two distinct features. Firstly, the micro-videos, by virtue of being presented within peripersonal space, become within-reach. Secondly, the micro-videos, displayed on touchscreens, permit a dual haptic experience. On this basis, a new metaphor regarding screens is proposed‚Äîthe ‚Äúskin-screen‚Äù. The trajectory of the cinematic experience traces a multi-directional ‚Äútopography of post-cinema‚Äù, aiming to provide a clearer delineation of the ‚Äústate of post-cinema‚Äù and to facilitate more pertinent philosophical reflection.",

          "abstract": "Of all people that develop a mental disorder, most are recognized late, and many not at all. The insufficiency of mental health infrastructure, which is driving these problems, is even more pronounced in developing countries. This underlines the pressing need for global and scalable solutions to the diagnosis and prediction of individuals‚Äô mental health. In this perspective, we argue for a possible utility of social media (SM) derived data combined with natural language processing (NLP) for the monitoring of individual-level mental health on a global scale. Using psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSD) as an example, we demonstrate how freely expressed speech can be processed automatically to predict and classify PSD with high levels of accuracy. We further outline the current state of PSD classification from SM-derived data and discuss methodological considerations that are hampering progress in this field. Finally, we delve into potential pitfalls of such systems and provide insight into how these may be navigated.",

          "authors": "Carlos Rey; Tomas Lejarraga; Antoni Rub√≠ Barcel√≥",
          "abstract": "This study examines the varying effects of potential losses compared to gains on reflective thinking and problem-solving performance. Building on prospect theory and previous studies, we hypothesized that individuals would engage in longer reflection when faced with potential losses compared to equivalent potential gains, and that this extended reflection would enhance problem-solving performance, particularly in more challenging tasks. Two experimental studies were conducted. Study 1 established that participants reflected longer in tasks designed to avoid monetary losses than to achieve gains, confirming the hypothesis regarding prolonged reflection. However, this increased reflection did not translate into better performance across various tasks, suggesting that losses encourage persistence but do not inherently improve problem-solving efficacy. Study 2, which employed anagrams of varying difficulty, revealed that losses indeed correlated with longer reflection times but only improved performance in tasks deemed more difficult. These findings indicate that the effect of losses on reflection and performance is nuanced, highlighting the importance of task difficulty and the sensitivity of performance measures in understanding the interactions between loss aversion and cognitive processing. Overall, the results suggest that while losses prompt greater cognitive engagement, their influence on performance is contingent on task complexity, necessitating further exploration into the conditions under which losses enhance reflection and problem-solving capabilities.",

          "authors": "Ashlesha Purohit; Simantini Ghosh",
          "abstract": "Sexual harassment is highly prevalent, poses significant mental health challenges and profoundly affects professional and social functioning. Our broad goal was to study posttraumatic growth and the role of coping strategies in the context of sexual harassment experienced by Indian young adults, particularly investigating dysfunctional/avoidant coping styles and their contribution to posttraumatic growth, because of scarce extant data. We asked if dysfunctional/avoidant coping negatively mediates the positive effects of self-compassion and social support on posttraumatic growth employing a self-report online questionnaire and a cross sectional design. The sample consisted of 264 Indian young adults who completed validated measures of self-compassion, social support, coping, and posttraumatic growth. Hierarchical regression  analyses revealed that self-compassion and social support predicted posttraumatic growth and accounted for 31.2% of its variance. Coping and dysfunctional/avoidant coping accounted for an additional 16.4% of the variance in post-traumatic growth [ŒîR¬≤ = 0.164, F(2, 259)= 41.0, p&lt;0.001], and combined, they accounted for 47.3% of the variance in post-traumatic growth. A mediation analysis showed that the relationship between self-compassion and posttraumatic growth was partially mediated by dysfunctional/avoidant coping [Íûµ=0.17441, z=4.293, p&lt;0.001] and the relationship between social support and posttraumatic growth was fully mediated by coping [Íûµ=0.24564, z=5.031, p&lt;0.001]. This finding expands and adds to the literature on posttraumatic growth in survivors of sexual harassment.",

          "abstract": "Fixed-effects modeling is a powerful tool for estimating within-cluster associations in cross-sectional data and within-participant associations in longitudinal data. Although commonly used by other social scientists, this tool remains largely unknown to psychologists. To address this issue, we offer a pedagogical primer tailored for this audience, complete with R, Stata, and SPSS scripts. This primer is organized into three parts. In PART 1, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to clustered cross-sectional data. We introduce the concepts of ‚Äòcluster dummies‚Äô and ‚Äòdemeaning,‚Äô and provide scripts to estimate the within-school association between sports and depression in a fictional dataset. In PART 2, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to longitudinal data, and provide scripts to estimate the within-participant association between sports and depression over time in a fictional four-wave dataset. In this part, we cover three additional topics. First, we explain how to calculate effect sizes and offer simulation-based sample size guidelines to detect median-sized within-participant effects with sufficient power. Second, we show how to test two possible interactions: between a time-constant and a time-varying predictor and between two time-varying predictors. Third, we introduce three relevant extensions: first-difference modeling (estimating changes from one wave to the next); time-distributed fixed-effects modeling (estimating changes before, during, and after an individual event); and within-between multilevel modeling (estimating both within- and between-participant associations). In PART 3, we discuss two limitations of fixed-effects modeling: time-varying confounders and reverse causality. We conclude with reflections on causality in nonexperimental data.",

          "authors": "Giovanbattista Califano; Tianyi Zhang; Charles Spence",
          "abstract": "This study explores how users perceive the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various culinary scenarios. Using a hybrid model that combines Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling and a Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression Mixture Model, the research examines the influence of factors including the perceived accuracy of AI systems, general attitudes toward AI, and AI anxiety, on people‚Äôs trust in AI cooking applications‚Äîand how this trust, in turn, affects their intention to adopt such systems. Analysis of the data from 380 UK participants revealed two distinct consumer groups identified by the hybrid model: a small group of Engagers, who demonstrate openness to adopting AI-assisted cooking tools, and a much larger group of Avoiders, who refrain from using such technologies. Trust is shown to be a pivotal factor, with participants exhibiting higher trust levels (+ 1 SD) being 5.44 times more likely to be Engagers than Avoiders. However, adoption was found to be very much scenario-specific: AI is most readily accepted in cooking contexts that prioritize analytical and efficient solutions, such as using and combining leftover ingredients, but is less favoured in socially meaningful situations, such as hosting a dinner party. The results also reveal a demographic profile of those more open to AI cooking assistance, suggesting that younger, educated individuals are more likely to engage. This study contributes to understanding consumer dynamics in AI culinary applications, highlighting areas of opportunity for AI as a practical kitchen assistant and underscoring the challenges in achieving broad user trust.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has highlighted the impact of phonological factors and morphological structure on compound pronunciation, but the role of semantics in this interplay remains largely unexplored. Building on psycholinguistic findings that demonstrate semantic effects in compound processing, this study examines whether these effects extend to the production of English nominal triconstituent compounds. Using a state-of-the-art computational model to derive semantic transparency measures, we assessed the predictability of compound meanings from their constituents. Our regression model of experimental speech data revealed a notable duration difference between the first and second constituent and the third constituent for opaque compounds. For semantically transparent compounds, we find a shortening of the third constituent, diminishing the larger duration difference observed for less transparent compounds. These findings underscore the importance of semantic considerations in phonetic analyses of compound constituents, complementing prior research on morphological and phonological correlates of phonetic variation.",

Trauma-informed approaches offer one possible avenue of support for those being chronically bullied in school. The aim of this study is to examine the traumatic impact of being chronically bullied in school and evaluate the use of a pilot trauma-informed therapeutic intervention to support young people being chronically bullied in England. In this study, 18 parents whose child was receiving a new bullying-focused trauma-informed therapy completed an online questionnaire about their child's experiences of bullying and their trauma symptoms. Their children were aged between 8 and 16 years old (M=11.28, SD = 2.24), 9 (50%) young people were male, and 9 (50%) were female. The questionnaire was completed before and after the 12-week therapeutic intervention. The findings of the study highlight the negative impact being bullied has on mental health, including symptoms of trauma. The findings of the study also highlight how the trauma-informed therapeutic intervention reduced symptoms of trauma and supported children and young people to cope with their experiences of bullying. While a pilot study, the findings offer a potential avenue for supporting young people being chronically bullied in school.",

          "abstract": "Social media presents both opportunities and risks to society. One risk includes the potential for the spread of disinformation, but methods for automatic detecting possible disinformation still mostly rely on low-level lexical cues. We present a new approach to the automatic detection of disinformation based on measuring discourse ‚Äòderailment‚Äô ‚Äì messages that try to force the topic of discourse away from one topic and onto another. While this may include both malicious and benign derailment, it could serve as an important signal for early-warning systems. In this study, we implement a system for automatic detection of discourse derailment which uses a Large Language Model to generate expected replies and compares them to the real replies. We test this system on a set of human annotated data to show that the system outperforms various baselines and approaches the agreement between human annotators. This suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be sensitive to discourse-level information. However, we also identify evidence of several limitations, including that the automatic system relies on different cues compared to human annotators, which leads to some amount of bias. Nevertheless, our project represents a considerable step towards understanding how to use LLMs to analyse discourse and a new angle on tackling disinformation.",

          "abstract": "The human visual system can recognise familiar forms, most notably faces, in other objects or patterns, a phenomenon known as pareidolia. The patterns that elicit pareidolia range from meaningful to ambiguous and random images, making it hard to generalise across the featural or configurational properties that trigger different types of pareidolia. Here, we aim to characterise the minimal stimuli associated with different types of pareidolia and investigate the extent to which pareidolia is tuned to variations in natural scene statistics and symmetry.  Participants in the current study viewed a range of synthetic noise patterns varying in their spatiotemporal spectral and symmetry characteristics and reported any shapes or structure perceived in these patterns. The patterns with spatiotemporal properties typical of natural scenes generated the highest number of responses with more animate, rather than inanimate, forms overall. While faces were the most reported animacy-related percept, responses covered a wide range of animate agents including animals and mythical creatures. The greatest number and the highest proportion of animacy-related percepts were observed in vertically symmetrical patterns compared to other types of pattern symmetry. Together, the current study establishes that pareidolia is tuned to natural scene statistics and biased towards animate forms, especially in patterns with vertical symmetry. It also demonstrates the usefulness of synthetic noise stimuli for pareidolia research.",

          "abstract": "The decision sciences have long striven to measure and model how people perceive uncertainty in specific choice situations. In the latter, people may be confronted with two types of uncertainty‚Äîepistemic and aleatory uncertainty‚Äîand in principle these may occur independently of each other. But how specific are people‚Äôs subjective perceptions thereof? And how are they related to perceptions of general uncertainty? We aimed to address these and related questions by reconciling different approaches to inducing and measuring perceptions of epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Specifically, we conducted a study with a 2 (epistemic uncertainty: low vs. high) x 2 (aleatory uncertainty: low vs. high) x 2 (choice modality: described choice scenarios vs. incentivized monetary lotteries) mixed experimental design (N = 185). The key results suggest that people‚Äôs perceptions of epistemic and aleatory uncertainty are strongly correlated and that both types of uncertainty are associated with the perception of general uncertainty. Additionally, learning about choice options in decisions from experience was associated with reduced epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Finally and at a more practical level, a novel and frugal measurement tool consisting of only two items achieved the same (and in some conditions an even better) performance as compared to the established but lengthier Epistemic Aleatory Rating Scale (√úlk√ºmen et al., 2016). Overall, these findings provide insights on how to study epistemic and aleatory uncertainty with incentivized tasks and choice scenarios, as well as how to measure subjective perceptions of these types of uncertainty. As such the current study contributes to the conceptual debate on the structure of uncertainty perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Motor learning is proposed to be associated with a minimization or optimization of physical and cognitive resources. Effort involves the voluntary investment of resources for task performance. While these two constructs are intrinsically linked, their relationship has never been empirically examined. This study aimed to investigate how the perception of effort evolves throughout the motor learning process. Thirty young adults volunteered in this study. In a within-subject design, each participant had four visits to perform 10 blocks of a continuous tracking task on each visit. The sequences within these blocks were either random (control condition) or repeated (experimental condition). Following each block, participants rated the intensity of the effort invested to perform the task. Sequence-specific motor learning was observed, with the repeated outperforming the random sequence condition at the retention test. Perception of effort decreased with sequence-specific motor learning, which was not observed during practice of the random sequences. Our findings suggest that motor sequence learning reduces perceived effort. Thus, as sequence-specific task proficiency increases, individuals find the task less effortful. This link between learning a motor task and effort perception presents valuable opportunities for future research to investigate the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying motor learning and effort.",

Participants were 441 Italian children (53.7% girls) aged between 7.9-10 (Mage = 9.05, SD = 0.56). A series of confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor lower order structure, whereas evidence for the intended 1-factor higher order structure was not found. Structural equation modeling confirmed convergent validity of the questionnaire with theoretically related constructs such as self-worth, emotional-behavioral problems, and prosocial behavior, and confirmed inhibitory control and attentional focusing as core aspects of EC. Overall, the EC scale is a valuable tool for assessing temperament-based self-regulation in middle childhood using four separate scores, but reliability analyses suggest the need for refinement, and more research is needed to clarify its hierarchical structure in the TMCQ.",

This paper investigates the detrimental effects of food insecurity on early childhood development, focusing on physical, cognitive and behavioural development. The critical years of life, first 1000 days are important for child‚Äôs brain and body development, therefore nutritional deficiencies can lead to stunted growth, weakened immunity and cognitive impairment such as poor memory due to low iron. Furthermore, food insecurity is associated with behavioural changes in children such as externalizing behaviours like aggression and internalizing behaviours like anxiety. This paper also highlights the need for thorough strategies such as government policies, community level initiatives and educational programs for parents to address and increase awareness about food insecurity. By incorporating these interventions that improve food accessibility, we can support developmental requirements of at-risk children.

          "abstract": "Research on academic performance typically revolves around average achievement scores\nof students or schools. Focusing solely on averages can miss important aspects of the\nlearning experience. The recent development of mixed effects location scale models\n(MELSM) has provided a modeling technique that incorporates a scale model that\ncaptures and explains the (in-)consistency of academic achievement within the cluster of\ninterest. Here, we formally introduce an extension to the MELSM, a Spike and Slab\nMixed-Effects Location Scale Model (SS-MELSM), for simultaneously modeling location\nand scale parameters while incorporating a spike and slab prior to select or shrink random\neffects. Our approach involves identifying clusters with unusually large or small\nwithin-cluster variance in academic achievement, which can indicate overly inconsistent or\nconsistent academic achievement. We apply the SS-MELSM to a dataset of 160 schools\nfrom the Brazilian Evaluation System of Elementary Education (Saeb) to illustrate its use\nin educational data analysis. Moreover, we show how to compare models with varying\nparameters regarding expected predictive accuracy. The results demonstrate that the\nSS-MELSM successfully identifies schools with unusually high and low consistency in\nmathematics achievement and that school- and student-level SES were relevant covariates\nwhen modeling the location and scale components. The methods presented in this paper\nare implemented in the R package ivd.",

          "abstract": "We assessed the evidential value of the large literature (k=643 to 825 studies) investigating the mortality salience (MS) hypothesis from terror management theory, employing a multitool assessment approach. First, we reviewed and evaluated recent efforts to replicate past experiments testing the MS hypothesis, summarizing the conflicting evidence and arguments to the evidential value of the MS literature. Next, we performed a random effects meta-analysis on the MS literature using multiple bias correction meta-analytic techniques, including selection models, PET-PEESE, WAAP-WLS, as well as the more recently developed p-curve and z-curve. Overall, the different meta-analytic tools often pointed to conflicting conclusions, reflecting methodological and philosophical differences among these tools. A synthesis of our findings suggests there are nonzero effects underlying some studies of the MS hypothesis, although the effects are highly heterogeneous, most studies are underpowered, and many individual effects may be spurious. We recommend future replications to assume a smaller effect size (r = .18) and to strictly follow expert guidance in the experimental protocol. Given the conflicting findings that emerged, we suggest future attempts to evaluate other literatures would benefit from a multitool assessment approach.",

In Experiment 1-3, subjects performed source memory task in which they were presented a sequence of 30 objects shown in one of four quadrants and then were tested on each item‚Äôs position. We repeated this procedure for 5 times in Exp 1, and 12 times in Exp 2 and 3. Interestingly, we discovered that individual differences in working memory continually predicted LTM accuracy across all repetitions. In Experiment 4, we replicated the stable working memory demands with word pairs. In Experiment 5, we generalized the stable working memory demands model to attentional control abilities. Together, these results suggest that people, instead of relying less on working memory, optimized their working memory and attentional control throughout learning.",

          "abstract": "A central goal of research in perceptual decision making is to determine the internal computations underlying choice and confidence in complex, multi-alternative tasks. However, revealing these computations requires knowledge of the internal representation upon which the computations operate. Unfortunately, it is unknown how traditional stimuli (e.g., Gabor patches and random dot motion) are represented internally, which calls into question the computations inferred when using such stimuli. Here we develop a new behavioral paradigm where subjects discriminate the dominant color in a cloud of differently colored dots. Critically, we show that the internal representation for these stimuli can be described with a simple, one-parameter equation and that a single free parameter can explain multi-alternative data for up to 12 different conditions. Further, we use this paradigm to test three popular theories: that confidence reflects (1) the probability of being correct, (2) only choice-congruent (i.e., positive) evidence, or (3) the evidence difference between the highest and the second-highest signal. The predictions of the first two theories were falsified in two experiments involving either six or 12 conditions with three choices each. We found that the data were best explained by a model where confidence is based on the difference of the two alternatives with the largest evidence. These results establish a new paradigm in which a single parameter can be used to determine the internal representation for an unlimited number of multi-alternative conditions and challenge two prominent theories of confidence computation.",

          "abstract": "The chronological hierarchy and classification of psychological types of individuals are examined. The anomalous nature of psychological activity in individuals involved in scientific work is highlighted. Certain aspects of the introverted thinking type in scientific activities are analyzed. For the first time, psychological archetypes of scientists with pronounced introversion are postulated in the context of twelve hypotheses about the specifics of professional attributes of introverted scientific activities.\n\tA linear regression and Bayesian equation are proposed for quantitatively assessing the econometric degree of introversion in scientific employees, considering a wide range of characteristics inherent to introverts in scientific processing. Specifically, expressions for a comprehensive assessment of introversion in a linear model and the posterior probability of the econometric (scientometric) degree of introversion in a Bayesian model are formulated.\n\tThe models are based on several econometric (scientometric) hypotheses regarding various aspects of professional activities of introverted scientists, such as a preference for solo publications, low social activity, narrow specialization, high research depth, and so forth. Empirical data and multiple linear regression methods can be used to calibrate the equations. The model can be applied to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological characteristics of scientific employees, which is particularly useful in ergonomics and the management of scientific teams and projects. The proposed method also provides scientists with pronounced introversion the opportunity to develop their careers, focusing on individual preferences and features.",

We find that ND children with SOR have reduced exogenous and elevated endogenous functional MRI connectivity which is diametrically opposed to ND children without SOR. Furthermore, this double dissociation is specific to ND children who are behaviorally resilient, while emotionally dysregulated ND children possess a distinct pattern, suggesting that achieving optimal brain system connectivity‚Äîa balanced contrast‚Äîis influenced by sensory over-responsivity and essential for resilience.",

          "authors": "Drew E. Winters; Juliet Spitz; Kristen Raymond; Crystal Natvig; Rebecca Waller; Susan Mikulich; Joseph T. Sakai",
          "abstract": "Background: Antisocial behavior in youth can encompass both conduct problems (CP; e.g., aggression, rule-breaking) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits (i.e., limited empathy, remorse, and guilt). CP are associated with pronounced and broad cognitive difficulties whereas CU traits have stronger links to disrupted affective theory of mind (ToM) and more specific cognitive difficulties involving cognitive control. Cognitive control difficulties have been linked to affective ToM among early adolescents with elevated CU traits, suggesting an interaction between cognitive and affective processing that are unique to CU traits. Here we sought to improve on those initial findings by leveraging a randomized dual-task (within-trial) design to replicate and extend prior findings.\nTrial design: The preregistered study leveraged a double-blind randomized controlled trial using a dual-task design. The dual-task used an inhibitory processing task as a secondary task to impose additional demands on cognitive control implicated in ToM to compete with a primary ToM task with cognitive, affective, and physical ToM condition. Participants were randomized into control and test conditions using a permuted block randomization stratified by sex at birth and severity of CU traits. The order of single ToM task or dual-task was counterbalanced to test within subject effects of cognitive control on affective ToM inferences.\nMethods: A total of 85 participants (47% female) were used in the final analysis. Primary and preregistered hypotheses were tested using a repeated measure random effect model that accounted for individual variance and tested fixed effect interactions for CU and CP with group across time. Outcomes tested involved change in accuracy and reaction time from single ToM to dual-task. Secondary analysis examined contrasts between ToM trial types, dual-task effect, and single ToM task performance as well as associations with antisocial behaviors. \nResults: CU traits were independently associated with decrements in affective ToM from single to dual-task for both accuracy and reaction time, as well as secondary contrast tests when comparing affective &gt; physical and cognitive trials. CU traits were also related to greater dual-task effects indicating greater difficulty in ToM after taxing cognitive control. CP were related to decrements at baseline ToM task performance but were not associated with changes after taxing cognitive control during the dual-task. Importantly, a subset of participants appeared to be resilient to dual-task effects reported lower baseline antisocial behavior even at elevated CU traits. \nConclusions: Resource limitations for cognitive control in those elevated in CU traits is an important mechanism underlying difficulty utilizing affective data from the environment to inform social behavior. Those less vulnerable to additional demands on cognitive control reported fewer antisocial acts even at higher CU traits. Overall, findings suggest specific cognitive-affective interactions that relate to CU traits and explain real world antisocial behavior. This is a novel mechanism outside of the traditional cognition or affect etiologies that may indicate a developmentally specific mechanism critical in the study and treatment of youth antisocial phenotypes and development of psychopathy in adulthood.",

          "abstract": "It is not obvious why we are conscious. Why can‚Äôt all of our mental activities take place unconsciously? What is consciousness for? We aim to make progress on this question, focusing on conscious vision. We review evidence on the timescale of visual consciousness, showing that it is surprisingly slow: postdictive effects reveal windows of unconscious integration lasting up to 400 milliseconds. We argue that if consciousness is slow, it cannot be for online action-guidance. Instead, we propose that conscious vision evolved to support offline cognition, in tandem with the larger visual sensory horizons afforded by the water-to-land transition. Smaller visual horizons typical in aquatic environments require fast, reflexive actions of the sort that are guided unconsciously in humans. Conversely, larger terrestrial visual horizons allow benefits to accrue from ‚Äúmodel-based‚Äù planning of the sort that is associated with consciousness in humans. We further propose that the acquisition of these capacities for internal simulation and planning provided pressures for the evolution of reality monitoring‚Äîthe capacity to distinguish between internally and externally triggered signals, and to solve ‚ÄúHamlet‚Äôs problem‚Äù in perception‚Äîthe problem of when to stop integrating evidence, and fix a particular model of reality. In line with higher-order theories of consciousness, we associate the emergence of consciousness with the emergence of this reality monitoring function. We discuss novel empirical predictions that arise from this account, and explore its implications for the distribution of conscious (vs. unconscious) vision in aquatic and terrestrial animals.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous institutionalization (PI) is a unique form of early life adversity that is associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially internalizing disorders. Onset of internalizing disorders is most common during adolescence. Developmental models emphasize differences in childhood learning, and corresponding avoidance behaviors, as a core pathway linking adversity to internalizing disorders yet little empirical research has tested this theory. \n\nMETHODS: During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 43 PI (12.1 to 22.8 years) and 47 comparison (9.9 to 22.9 years) youth completed an aversive learning task. The task involved an escapable stimulus reinforced with an aversive sound (CS+r), the same escapable stimulus without reinforcement (CS+nr), or an escapable stimulus that was never reinforced (CS-). Internalizing symptoms were measured using the parent-report Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scales.\n\nRESULTS: Functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala was elevated among the PI versus comparison youth, specifically for the CS- (p=.035). PI youth showed elevated connectivity for the CS- regardless of symptoms, whereas comparison youth showed elevated connectivity at higher but not lower levels of symptoms (p=.027). Elevated connectivity for the CS- was more evident among the PI group during early adolescence relative to late adolescence (p=.007).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: NAcc-amygdala functional connectivity, a circuit which has previously been implicated in escape from threat, is elevated during safety learning among PI adolescents. Differences in NAcc-amygdala functional connectivity may attenuate with age following adoption. Institutionalization may impact neurodevelopment in ways that increase generalization of threat appraisals to safe stimuli, thereby increasing risk for developing psychopathology.",

Using propensity score methods and piecewise linear latent growth curve models, we identified distinct trajectories of change for the two treatments. In particular, symptom distress, personality dysfunction, interpersonal problems, and general life satisfaction improved substantially and persistently in both treatments, with PP showing faster initial improvements and AP maintaining gradual progress over time. AP showed greater long-term effectiveness, particularly for patients with more severe problems at baseline. These findings indicate the value of AP for complex cases.

          "abstract": "Sleep dysfunction can impair cognition and may play a causal role in the development of hallucinations. Deficits in cognitive control have been implicated in cognitive models of hallucinations. To better understand the underpinning role of cognition in the relationship between sleep and hallucinations, the current study aimed to investigate the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive control mechanisms such as intentional inhibition and working memory capacity, as well as auditory top-down processing. Forty-five participants were allocated to either a sleep-deprivation condition (N = 15) or a rested control group condition (N = 30). Cognitive control assessments were applied at three timepoints for each condition: baseline (T1), post-sleep deprivation/post-habitual sleep (T2), and post-recovery sleep/post-habitual daily activity (T3). Results showed significant interactions between condition and timepoint on intentional inhibition and working memory, but not auditory top-down processing. Findings support current neurocognitive theories and suggest that sleep deprivation may lead to hallucinations through effects on intrusive thoughts, memories, and emotions. Future research should continue to explore the potential mechanistic pathway between cognitive control and sleep, to inform future intervention work.

This extension identifies a potential third function of positive emotions in addition to broadening and building: belonging. We suggest that positive emotions, inextricably linked to social interactions, play a crucial role in satisfying infants‚Äô and young children‚Äôs fundamental need to belong.

          "abstract": "Motor Simulation Theory proposes that imagined actions are produced using the brain‚Äôs motor system, and should therefore always be temporally equivalent to physical movements. However, empirical results are not always consistent with this prediction. Studies indicate that the durations of unfamiliar imagined actions are over-estimated, whereas the durations of more familiar actions may be closer to (or even faster than) actual movement execution. We therefore examined the effects of different levels of practice on the durations of both physically performed and imagined actions. Participants (N=31) completed an initial assessment in which the durations of physically performed and imagined finger movement sequences were measured. Participants then completed three days of physical training in which different sequences received either extensive training (150 repetitions/session), minimal training (10 repetitions/session), or no training. In a subsequent assessment session, we found that the time taken to both physically execute and imagine performing sequences decreased with training. However, contrary to the predictions of Motor Simulation theory, imagined movement durations consistently over-estimated those of physically performed movements. While the difference in the timing of imagined and physically executed movements decreased between the initial and final assessment, this effect was not modulated by training. These results extend our understanding of the relationship between motor imagery and physical practice, and highlight a key limitation in the predictions of Motor Simulation Theory.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making is driven by factors such as motivation, pleasure, and cognitive skill. The current study evaluates how these factors are related to decision-making in a community population. In recent years, work in the field of reinforcement learning has identified two main pathways that drive decision-making: model-based and model-free learning. Model-free learning updates action values retrospectively, after a reward is received. In contrast, model-based learning updates action values prospectively, by weighing contextual factors, the overall structure of the situation, and reward received. The current study utilizes a two-stage decision-making task to assess the relative contribution of model-free vs model-based learning in relation to measures that assess motivation, pleasure, and cognition in a community sample (n=127). General linear mixed effect models showed that individuals high in motivation and pleasure had significantly greater reliance on model-free decision making (p=0.0267). In contrast, individuals with better working memory, as measured by a running span task, had significantly greater reliance on model-based learning (p=0.0003). These findings provide evidence that individual differences in motivation and cognition are associated with reliance on particular learning pathways. It has been suggested that lower levels of motivation, pleasure, and cognition in various forms of psychopathology (e.g., depression) can impair decision-making. Our results show these relationships transcend clinical contexts. Specifically, these findings suggest that individuals who experience low motivation and pleasure may be less sensitive to immediate rewards, and that working memory capacity is highly relevant to model-based learning.",

          "title": "Validation of the French Version of the 18-Item Short Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (F-DERS-SF) and of a Super Short Six-Item Form (DERS-F SSF)",
          "authors": "Elise Dan-Glauser",
          "abstract": "Difficulties in emotion regulation, i.e., when people struggle to feel and manage emotions, as well as to pursue their goals despite emotion occurrence, is a predominant symptom in many diagnoses. When studied in lay populations, this variable can be measured with rather complete questionnaires, extensively examining their different components. This is the case of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), which includes 36 items, resulting in a total score and six different sub-scores, i.e., lack of awareness, lack of clarity, difficulties in goal-directed behavior, non-acceptance of emotions, lack of available regulation strategies, and impulsivity. In most cases, however, long versions are tiresome and their length and complexity compromise valid recordings. This is the reason why shorter versions of the DERS are available, such as the DERS-SF, which comprises 18 items. When dealing with specific populations, and in particular clinical ones (such as patients with addictions or with attention deficits), 18 items remain burdensome. The creation of a Super Short Form is thus necessary in the field. The present work has two aims. First, we aimed at validating the French translation of the 18-item DERS-SF, as it is a widely used instrument, but which lacks clear French validation. Second, based on an extensive database gathered in our lab, we propose a DERS Super Short Form composed of just 6 items, each reflecting a dimension of the difficulties in emotion regulation. Data of 3944 participants (76% female), who completed either the 36-item or the 18-item form of the French DERS were analyzed. Results support the validity and reliability of the French version of the DERS-SF (Cronbach Œ± &gt; .84 for the total score and congruence index, Tucker‚Äôs œï &gt;.99). The Super-Short Form demonstrated satisfactory reliability. External validity was confirmed, above and beyond what could be seen with longer scales, enriching the understanding of the various sub-dimensions of the difficulties in emotion regulation, and particularly with respect to the awareness subscale.",

          "abstract": "The visual system can encode multiple objects in the form of ensemble representations. Such representations can be accessed with either explicit or implicit reports, but depending on the type of report, the observed properties of the ensemble representation can differ in detail. Previous studies have suggested that the saliency of individual items biases the perceived mean of ensembles. It is unclear, however, whether saliency affects implicit representations of the whole feature distribution (beyond mean and variance). Our observers were presented with sets of lines varying in orientation and size where size was a task-irrelevant salient feature. To estimate explicit representations, observers adjusted the mean orientation and their accuracy was measured. To access the implicit representation of the feature distribution we used a visual search task for an oddly-oriented line among heterogeneous distractors and measured the search times. The results revealed a strong saliency-induced bias in the explicit report, with mean orientation estimates biased toward the more salient items. However, no such effect was observed in the implicit report, as search times were unaffected by the saliency of the items. Our results support the hypothesis that distinct mechanisms underlie the more detailed implicit representations of full distributions and explicit ensemble representations that are based on summary statistics.",

Finally, this paper discusses the principle of consciousness intelligence, and points out that consciousness intelligence is a multi-cell collaborative overall feedback to record natural change data and form a data structure model.

          "abstract": "Assets, income, socioeconomic status, and other measures of financial position are consistent predictors of depression. Although financial stress has been proposed as a mediator of this relationship, no study has explored this hypothesis using a rigorous longitudinal design or outside of high-income countries. We address this gap using longitudinal cohort data collected from 2021 to 2023 across four timepoints. The sample comprised 831 women (M = 35.9 years old) living in Nawalpur, a rural district in the Gandaki province of Nepal; the majority of which were married (88%) and of Janajati caste/ethnicity (61%). Financial position was determined using household assets, depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and financial stress with a single bespoke item. Direct and indirect effects were estimated using a cross-lagged panel mediation model (CLPM); we also conduct cross-sectional mediation models ‚Äì of the sort typically employed in mediation analyses ‚Äì for comparison and bias estimation. In the CLPM, financial stress significantly mediated the financial position-depressive symptom relationship between timepoints one and three, but not between timepoints two and four. After accounting for financial stress as a mediator, the direct effects of financial position on depressive symptoms were not statistically significant. The cross-sectional models overestimated the relationship between financial stress and depressive symptoms; otherwise, results between the CLPM and cross-sectional models were generally comparable. Our findings suggest that interventions components that address financial stress may help improve depressive symptoms. Methodologically, we argue that more researchers should employ longitudinal designs when investigating mediation processes.",

However, only cognitive and somatic anxiety and social anxiety explained individual variance in neurodivergent status after taking into account the effects of other measures. Despite differing anxiety levels (which showed variability between different neurodivergences), neurodivergent and neurotypical students were equivalent in cognitive reflection scores, suggesting similar levels of analytic thinking skills (including reasoning about mathematical content). In both the neurotypical and neurodivergent groups, higher levels of cognitive reflection were associated with male gender, less fear of negative evaluation, and lower mathematics and creativity anxiety, replicating and extending previous work. Our findings have implications for instructors across sectors with respect to supporting neurodivergent individuals.",

Participants engaged either in 90 minutes, alternating between video gaming and scrolling on smartphone (VGSS - experimental condition) or watching documentaries (control condition). Participants rated the perceived workload of each task and their mental fatigue, motivation and boredom during the VGSS or documentary watching. Cognitive performance and physical activity intention were measured pre-post VGSS and documentary watching. Then, participants performed a knee extensors endurance task until exhaustion at 20% of their maximal voluntary peak force, to measure muscle endurance performance. \nParticipants perceived the VGSS as more demanding than the documentary condition. However, only a slight increase in perceived mental fatigue was highlighted and no difference between conditions in cognitive performance was observed. Muscle endurance performance did not differ after VGSS or documentary and physical activity intention decreased regardless of the condition.\nEngaging in VGSS did not induce a specific state of mental fatigue, thus explaining the absence of impaired muscle endurance performance, compared to watching a documentary. A negative impact on physical activity intentions was observed following both VGSS and documentary watching, suggesting that simply sitting in front of a screen impairs intentions to be active.",

          "abstract": "Background: Ageism, defined as stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination based on a person‚Äôs age is prevalent and negatively impacts individuals and society. In 2016 WHO received a mandate from its Member States to lead the global campaign to combat ageism. However, success in combating ageism is critically dependent on the availability of valid and reliable measures of people‚Äôs experiences of ageism that can capture its multidimensional nature and as directed against multiple age groups across diverse country settings. The goal of current study is to present a preliminary psychometric validation of a measure specifically designed to meet this need: the 15-item WHO experiences of ageism scale. The scale includes items measuring self-directed, interpersonal, and institutional ageism and spans stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination. \nMethod: We collected data from a UK mixed-age adult sample (N = 402), and several psychometric properties were tested, including internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity. \nResults: Results suggested that the 15-item WHO experiences of ageism scale has good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor model for self-directed ageism items. This scale also proved to have adequate convergent validity. \nDiscussion: The results provide sufficient supports for the adoption of the scale in this population and underscore the need for its translation and validation in other settings, as well as the evaluation of a more extended set of psychometric properties in future studies.",

          "authors": "Georgios V. Thomaidis",
          "abstract": "The expansion and gyrification of the human cerebral cortex, are crucial for the emergence of higher cognition and emotion, as they increase the available space for the dense and topologically complex configuration of the connectome. These phenomena emerge during a developmental trajectory that spans from the early stages of life to early adulthood and are shaped by genetic, biochemical, mechanical and environmental factors.  \nBeyond the expansion and folding observed during development, transient or permanent changes in the cortical surface area and folding patterns have also been observed during certain learning tasks in adulthood. In this essay, we propose a multi-staged qualitative model, for the expansion and potential convolution of cortical surface during learning in adults.  The model integrates existing knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for developmental cortical surface area expansion and folding, with recent advancements in the understanding of learning-induced microstructural changes and growth. \n\nThe primary driver of cortical surface area expansion in hypothesized to be learning-induced growth of transcolumnar dendrites and their supportive structures in the neuropil. This growth serves as a critical link between functional dynamics and structural organization across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Thus, the model incorporates feedback loops between the different stages of surface expansion and network growth. It connects information flow, adaptive network reconfiguration and growth, mechanical phenomena during network growth (increased local mechanical stiffness and tension in the neuropil), cortical surface expansion (including a contribution of cortical thickness) and their impact on the preceding stages of the model. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this model for research on the neurobiology of knowledge acquisition, the rate of learning new tasks and explore potential research directions.",

However, this concept rooted in the ecological psychology theories, finds its contemporary definition and use reduced to the external validity criterion of laboratory experimentation. This misapplication of the concept of ecological validity, in which ecological conditions are assumed to be replicated, leads to theoretical ambiguity in all disciplines involved in the study of cognition and behavior.\nObjective: We propose to explore the concept of ecological validity for cognitive and clinical neuroscience in its original formulation derived from functionalist theories and further developed by theories of direct perception and theories of enaction. This highlights the limitations of experimental and clinical studies in achieving this quality in their observations and results. In the first part, we will describe the origins of contemporary problems of ecological validity in behavioral and cognitive sciences, stemming from the adaptation of Fisher's experimental design for experimental psychology. Then we will address the fundamental importance of the concept of ecological validity in neuroscience and mental health research.\nDiscussion: Finally, we will discuss possible solutions in cognitive and clinical neuroscience to improve ecological validity and enable better transferability of experimental results to various everyday situations.",

Characterized by a large symptom heterogeneity and comorbidity, it remains elusive how individual internalizing symptoms relate to DN, FP, and SA connectivity. Leveraging a large population-based sample of adolescents (N = 2426; mean age = 14.1 years) and an integrated network modelling approach, we identified symptom-specific associations between internalizing problems and functional connectivity and explored sex and timing-specific differences in these links. Our findings revealed small negative associations between self-reported feelings of worthlessness and guilt and DN within-network connectivity and positive associations between fearfulness and FP within-network connectivity. Moreover, sadness and fearfulness were positively associated with DN-SA between-network connectivity. Exploratory analyses revealed no significant sex differences but indicated that DN within-network connectivity around age 10 was negatively associated with self-reported worthlessness at age 14. Our findings show symptom-specific associations between internalizing problems and brain functional circuitry in youth and highlight the complex interplay of symptoms and brain networks.",

However, previous research syntheses addressing the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on RNT are limited to specific diagnoses, treatments, or RNT constructs (transdiagnostic RNT, worry, rumination). In the present meta-analysis, we integrate findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT on RNT across diagnoses, intervention types, and RNT constructs. We investigate the following questions: What is the overall transdiagnostic efficacy of CBT interventions on all post-treatment RNT outcomes? Which RNT construct is addressed most effectively? Are RNT-specific treatments superior in reducing RNT than less specific approaches? Inclusion criteria were met by 55 studies with a total of 4,970 participants. The overall post-treatment effect of CBT interventions on RNT compared to respective control groups was moderate in favor of CBT (g = -0.67). Treatment efficacy did not differ significantly by RNT construct. RNT-specific interventions (g = -0.99) were significantly more efficacious in reducing RNT than less specific approaches (g = -0.56). Treatment efficacy was not significantly enhanced by individual or in-person settings. Our results advocate a dissemination of RNT-specific treatments in research and practice and a general improvement of CBT treatments by concentrating on relevant transdiagnostic processes such as RNT.",

How do generalization and discrimination in reward learning develop throughout lifespan as semantic knowledge is gradually acquired? Using a probabilistic reward learning task with a hierarchical value structure organized by semantic categories, we found children can generalize values of stimuli based on semantic categories at least as early as three to four years old. Furthermore, age-related performance improvement is explained by a combination of increased decision certainty, decreased initial exploration, change in memory retention, and a reduced categorical learning rate.",

          "abstract": "The study of aperiodic neural activity ‚Äì reflecting patterns of non-frequency specific activity that are observed in electrical neural recordings such as M/EEG and intracranial LFP recordings ‚Äì has recently rapidly expanded as a topic of study. While the extent of this work reflects a newfound interest in the study of aperiodic activity, the study of aperiodic activity itself is not new. There is a rich, though arguably underappreciated, history of work developing and demonstrating key findings and ideas regarding aperiodic neural activity, dating back many decades. In addition, studies of behavior, physiology, and physics have contributed many ideas, methods, and theoretical frameworks that have informed the study of neural activity. This perspective explores the history of the study of aperiodic neural activity and related topics, covering early discussions of separating oscillatory and aperiodic activity that started in the late 1940s, the emergence of frequency-domain measures of non-frequency specific activity by the mid 1970s, and findings from across the subsequent half-century of work investigating how aperiodic neural activity relates to development, cognition, disease, and more. Collectively, this history set the foundation for key ideas regarding aperiodic activity prior to the recent (re-)emergence of these topics in contemporary work. In summarizing this historical study of aperiodic neural activity, this perspective seeks both to establish the historical context of such work as well as to emphasize the wealth of knowledge available in the historical record to contextualize and contribute to current and future work.",

We describe several parallels between the theoretical models and discuss how the cognitive mechanisms posited by the Triangle Framework might be used to understand the commonalities in learning processes across these learning domains In particular, we discuss how the cognitive mechanisms implemented in the Triangle Framework can be used to understand linguistic aspects of numerical cognition, specifically, learning the connections among numerals (e.g., 24) and words (e.g., twenty-four), and linking those to semantic representations of magnitude. Following from these commonalities between the two models, we discuss several ways that interdisciplinary work integrating both models can benefit math cognition research.",

For internal structure validity, the fit indices of a series of confirmatory factor analyzes were evaluated for the one, two, and three-factor models. For validity with respect to other constructs, the SD-R constructs were correlated with the purity/sanctity subconstruct of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. For reliability, the ordinal alpha and the omega coefficient were used. Acceptable fit indices were obtained for the two and three oblique factor models, acceptable reliability indices for the core disgust and animal reminder scales was obtained, and small and significant positive correlations were obtained between the contamination and animal reminder factors with the purity/sanctity scale of the MFQ. The DS-R is an instrument with acceptable psychometric properties, although some adjustments must be made related to the reliability of the contamination scale, added to the exploration of other variables that correlate to each of its constructs to obtain greater validity in relation to other variables.",

          "abstract": "Dreams are theorized to enhance evolutionary relevant skills such as coping with threats or social situations. At the same time, most dreams are forgotten rapidly. Here we discuss how this paradox of skill learning during dreams despite subsequent dream amnesia can be dissolved with reference to different memory systems. On the one hand, dream amnesia affects explicit declarative memories of dream episodes to avoid dream-reality confusion. The acquisition and training of threat coping and social skills during dreaming, on the other hand, are not affected, as these non-declarative learning experiences rely on implicit memory systems. We quickly forget the potentially confusing explicit content of our nocturnal training lessons; however, we retain their implicit practical insights to shape our daytime skills in recognizing and coping with threatening or social situations.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes the experimental psychometrics framework, an approach that integrates causal inference and experimental design, representational measurement theory, and data theory to enhance psychological measurement. The framework addresses limitations of traditional psychometric methods by emphasizing the need for experimental control to account for sources of systematic error and to test the assumptions underlying psychometric models. It is argued that past propositions found in the literature have demonstrated how experimental manipulation can improve the validity of measures and provide better tests of theoretical expectations. However, the application of experimental manipulation and causal modeling as tool for assessing the abstract structure of the data, that can be tested from a representational measurement theory perspective are not well developed. Two empirical examples are presented to illustrate how the experimental psychometrics framework offers a structured approach for deriving more robust and replicable measurements. This work contributes to the growing discourse on improving the rigor of psychological measurement and theory, advocating for a more experimentally-driven and theory-informed approach. The potential for this framework to reshape psychometric practices is significant, promising to enhance the accuracy, validity, and reliability of psychological assessments.",

          "abstract": "There are growing calls for a comprehensive, evidence-based national eating disorder strategy. This is due to the rising prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) in England, the lack of national guidance in relation to different ED presentations (and potentially varying treatment needs), ad hoc data collection, and inconsistencies in both care and evaluation of quality-of-service provision. Furthermore, the shift towards the remote delivery of care during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for government strategy to include specific guidance on remote delivery of ED services. The increased use of remote healthcare presents an opportunity to mitigate regional disparities in the provision of care. However, there are distinct challenges when delivering ED services remotely. In this position paper, we firstly highlight the growing need for a comprehensive national ED strategy for England to combat the rising prevalence and harm of EDs. Secondly, we specify the importance of ensuring that future governmental strategy incorporates evidence-based guidelines specific to remote delivery of ED services. This is crucial for promoting consistent provision of ED care. We set out the lack of comprehensive national data, and the need for further research into remote delivery of care. Finally, we provide recent research findings from the RHED-C project (Remote Healthcare for Eating Disorders throughout COVID-19) that present recommendations aimed at enhancing future service delivery for remote treatment and support.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that older adults perform worse than do younger individuals in spatial navigation tasks, though the reasons for these age differences remain unclear. One hypothesis is that aging leads to a specific deficit in allocentric navigation, which is often assessed by examining how well participants can remember the spatial location of objects in relation to external landmarks within the environment. To test this hypothesis, we had young and older adults navigate a virtual environment under two conditions: a desktop setup using a keyboard and mouse to navigate, and an immersive virtual reality setup that allowed unrestricted ambulation. Both age groups performed worse when recalling locations from novel compared to familiar start locations - often taken as a hallmark of allocentric navigation - though the costs of switching from familiar to novel locations did not significantly differ between the two age groups. Older adults also employed distal landmarks to a comparable extent as did young adults in all conditions. Older adults were more likely to replicate previously taken paths, possibly indicating a preference for egocentric or route-based strategies. This effect was significantly attenuated in the immersive VR condition, particularly in the presence of geometric boundary cues. Age differences in spatial navigation may therefore be driven in part by a selective bias for navigating familiar routes, though these differences appear to be mitigated in the presence of multimodal visual and sensorimotor cues. By contrast, we did not identify any evidence to suggest that spatial errors in older age stem from a failure to attend to stable landmarks within the environment. These results suggest that age differences in navigation are influenced by multiple factors that cannot be reduced to a simple allocentric-egocentric dichotomy.",

          "abstract": "Reinforcement-driven learning involves processing feedback signals to optimize future actions and decision making. This feedback can be discrete, occurring as a separate event from action or anticipation, or continuous, occurring constantly and concurrently with ongoing decision-making. Despite the real-world relevance of continuous feedback, most research paradigms investigate feedback processing as a discrete process. To address this, we analyzed fMRI data from four neurofeedback studies in which participants engaged in continuous feedback learning. Neural responses to the most positive, most negative, and the weakest feedback signals were compared. Our results show that nucleus accumbens activity tracked with feedback valence, and specifically, was greater in response to success than to failure during neurofeedback. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), hippocampus, supplementary motor area (SMA) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) were more activated in response to weak feedback than to strong feedback. Our findings suggest that during continuous feedback learning, weak feedback (more than strong feedback) increases activity in brain regions previously implicated in self referential thinking, decision-making under uncertainty, and referencing past experiences. These data suggest the ambiguity inherent in weak feedback may result in engagement of these processes to support context-dependent interpretations of the feedback signals.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge organizes our understanding of the world, determining what we expect given what we have already seen. Our predictive representations have two key properties: they are productive, and they are graded. Productive generalization is possible because our knowledge decomposes into concepts -- elements of knowledge that are combined and recombined to describe particular situations. Gradedness is the observable effect of accounting for uncertainty -- our knowledge encodes degrees of belief that lead to graded probabilistic predictions. To put this a different way, concepts form a combinatorial system that enables description of many different situations; each such situation specifies a distribution over what we expect to see in the world, given what we have seen. We may think of this system as a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT), in which representations are built from language-like composition of concepts, and the content of those representations is a probability distribution on world states. The purpose of this chapter is to formalize these ideas in computational terms, to illustrate key properties of the PLoT approach with a concrete example, and to draw connections with other views of conceptual structure.",

          "abstract": "Forecasting tournaments are a well established method for assessing human forecasting skills. Most forecasting tournaments are based on a format where participants estimate the probabilities of discrete events. For predictions of continuous values, the possible range of outcome values is divided into mutually exclusive bins covering the entire outcome distribution so that probabilities for each bin can be elicited. An alternative approach involves directly eliciting forecasts about quantiles of the continuous quantity. Using both simulated data and data from 1,147 participants who completed five surveys focused on forecasting tasks in a longitudinal study, we compared the psychometric properties of quantile and probability elicitation methods. In the simulation, we demonstrated that items in the quantile format recovered parameters that defined forecasters‚Äô latent forecasting skill in fewer items than the probability format, and identified several idiosyncrasies in accuracy scores for the probability format that drive these differences. In the empirical analyses, we elicited forecasts about a set of 36 forecasting questions in both formats: quantile forecasts at five fixed probability values (5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%) and probability forecasts for five pre-determined item-specific bins. Consistent with the simulated results, our findings revealed that forecasts in the quantile format showed considerably stronger internal consistency, achieving a suitable reliability level with fewer items. When cross-validating how well individual forecasters‚Äô accuracy on in-sample questions predicted their performance in out-of-sample questions, the variability in the accuracy of quantile forecasts was more statistically explainable. Despite its desirable properties, errors and signs of comprehension difficulties were more frequently observed in the quantile format. Further research is needed to refine elicitations that optimize the effectiveness of quantile-based forecasting judgments.",

Evidence suggests that long-term heavy use of cannabis is negatively associated with important cognitive functions related to executive functioning, attention, and working memory, learning, and memory. Previous findings link the early onset of cannabis use to more extensive cognitive alterations. However, significant inconsistencies exist across studies. \nMethod: In this cross-sectional study, we examined associations between cannabis use and cognitive performance across a broad range of cognitive tests (including a new test of visuo-spatial abilities, The Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test) in a sample of 109 Danes aged 15-26 with varying risk of developing harmful cannabis use and varying levels of current use. Cannabis use was evaluated using the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test-Revised (CUDIT-R) and questions on recent use (past 30 days) and age of onset. Cognitive performance was assessed using subtests from WAIS-IV, WMS-III, and the Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test. \nResults: Findings show a negative association between recent cannabis use and specific cognitive functions of working memory and visual memory, while the CUDIT-R was not associated with cognitive functions. \nConclusion: Our findings nuance previous findings by suggesting differences in vulnerability across cognitive domains, while providing the first evidence of a negative association between recent cannabis use and visual memory based on visuo-spatial functions without requiring visuo-constructive abilities (Ruff-Light Trail Learning Test). Furthermore, findings suggest that past-month use may be a more relevant measure than CUDIT-R when evaluating cognitive correlates of cannabis use in youth. This has implications for treatment and preventive interventions in this age group.",

Results: We found that young people who experienced school exclusion had significantly worse scores at age 14 on all of these outcomes. The use of propensity score matching (including matching on prior behavioural problems) strengthens confidence in the idea that the effects are causal. Conclusions: Results point to the need for policies oriented towards reducing school exclusions and ensuring mitigating measures are in place to minimise its impact on those who experience it.",

A key challenge lies in explaining behavioral irrationalities that specifically arise in multi-alternative decisions. This study, based on pre-registered procedures, investigated such non-normative behaviors in a three-choice dot numerosity discrimination task. We systematically manipulated the value of the lowest-numerosity alternative (the dud stimulus) and quantified its non-normative effects on choice, response time, and confidence. We then explained observed irrational behaviors with a sequential evidence accumulation model featuring a ‚Äúmax vs. next‚Äù decision algorithm. This pseudo-optimal decision-making rule naturally captured a well-known non-normative choice pattern: the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Our model also explained a multi-choice metacognitive bias, known as the dud-alternative confidence boost, by considering evidence accumulation dynamics right after stimulus presentation. By uncovering the computational processes behind these non-normative multi-choice behaviors, this study represents a significant advancement in understanding the core principles of decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research faces a ‚ÄúPBS impossible trinity,‚Äù involving three key criteria: precision, breadth, and simplicity. Experimental findings are often precise and simple but may lack breadth, while concepts that are broad and simple frequently sacrifice precision. Developing a theory that is both precise and broad requires added complexity, a challenge intensified by a human preference for simplicity and certainty. To address this, a theory-oriented, data-driven comprehensive exploration approach is proposed. This approach involves conducting a large-scale experiment with tens of millions of observations, followed by the development of a moderately complex computational model that aims to integrate all relevant factors for the research question. A similar strategy has driven breakthroughs in artificial intelligence over the past two decades, suggesting it could yield similar advancements in psychology. Initial studies indicate that this approach is both practical and promising.",

However, research linking the microbiome to brain function is limited, particularly during child development, when tremendous microbiome plasticity is taking place and many mental health issues, like depression and anxiety, initially manifest.\n\nChallenges arise in studying the gut and brain together due to their complex and multidimensional nature, which complicates feature selection and data analysis. Multivariate machine learning techniques, such as sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression, offer potential solutions by identifying combinations of variables that best explain variance in outcomes.\n\nIn the current study (N = 55), we used sPLS to identify linear combinations of brain networks (‚Äúbrain signatures‚Äù) at age 6 years that maximally covaried with internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) measured at age 7.5 years, before identifying microbe abundances (‚Äúmicrobial profiles‚Äù) at age 2 years that maximally covaried with those brain signatures. Finally, we tested whether any microbiome features  (microbial profiles or alpha diversity)  were indirectly associated with internalizing symptoms via the brain signatures. We found that microbes in the Clostridiales order and Lachnospiraceae family were associated with internalizing symptoms in middle childhood through alterations in connectivity within emotion-related brain networks.",

          "abstract": "The Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP) proposes that the effects of pursuing perfection (i.e., perfectionism) need to be assessed beyond the effects of pursuing excellence (i.e., excellencism). Our objective in this research was to rely on the MEP to further our understanding of athlete perfectionism on two key points. First, we focussed on a scale designed to measure dispositional perfectionism and excellencism ‚Äì the Scale of Perfectionism and Excellencism (SCOPE) ‚Äì and tested the factor structure of an adapted version of the SCOPE for athletes (SCOPE-A). Second, we addressed the substantive question of whether perfectionism, beyond excellencism, is beneficial, unneeded, or harmful for athletes‚Äô thriving (i.e., experiencing high levels of well-being and performance satisfaction). We analyzed data collected across four samples of athletes (total N = 1,549). The results of confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses provided evidence to support the factor structure of scores from the SCOPE-A, and the conclusion that, when it comes to athlete thriving, perfectionism is almost always unneeded and excellencism is almost always good enough. These results shed new light on the connection between excellencism, perfectionism, and athlete thriving, and contribute to future research examining the effects of excellencism and perfectionism in athletes using the SCOPE-A.",

          "abstract": "Everyday situations require us to face a tradeoff to inform our decisions: exploit known information or explore for new information. Although both have risks, empirical research has not shown whether individuals prefer exploring or exploiting across contexts. In the present study, we examined the explore-exploit tradeoff as a theoretical framework across two broad domains: decision-making and spatial navigation. In this registered report, we applied computational modeling to human behavior on a novel version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to predict behavior on a spatial navigation task in which the navigator must either exploit a learned, familiar route or explore a new shortcut. If the hypothesis that risk tolerance is a domain general trait is correct, we predicted that explore-exploit patterns would correlate across these tasks. We also examine the predictive power of computational models for the IGT on behavioral uncertainty and the role of confidence in spatial navigation strategy.  Our findings suggest that, while there is some overlap in risk tolerance between spatial navigation and gambling, the influence of exploration and exploitation on navigational decision-making is weaker than initially predicted.",

Both latter conditions are usually not mentioned in the literature among consequences of physical abuse. Furthermore, the maltreatment can modify manifestations of affective disorders. Prolonged maltreatment can induce psychiatric abnormalities also in initially healthy individuals, in particular, paranoid ideations. Children and adolescents regularly punished for hyperactivity or other behaviors, regarded by perpetrators to be undesirable, would discontinue these behaviors but start adaptive or maladaptive conduct that may be more or less compatible with autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Repetitive binge drinking can be compulsive. Besides, loitering with drinking companies is a way of escape from domestic violence. It is known that autistic persons tend to avoid socialization. However, in conditions of collectivism and a pressure to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù like everyone, individuals with communication abnormalities would have strong motives to contact with peers to avoid stigmatization. Alcohol consumption and, in particular, binge drinking is a method to overcome communication barriers. In doing so, the individuals often forget that excessive alcohol consumption may cause health problems.",

The resource-rational belief updating rule we derive provides a novel explanation for conservative Bayesian updating, where individuals tend to underweight the likelihood of new evidence. Our theory also generates predictions consistent with several process models, particularly those based on approximate Bayesian inference.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Difficulties in emotion regulation during adolescence‚Äîa critical period for the development of these abilities‚Äîhave been linked to depression. Early identification of deficits in emotion regulation may help prevent the onset of depression. This study investigated whether emotion regulation dynamics, particularly the speed of regulation to one‚Äôs affective equilibrium (damping) inferred from the Damped Oscillator Model (DOM), could predict future depressive symptoms in adolescents. We hypothesized that the relationship between damping and long-term outcomes would depend on the position of an individual's equilibrium. Methods: Participants (N = 115) aged 12-15 completed smartphone-based EMA for 30 days, rating six emotions four times daily. The DOM was applied to each participant's time series data, yielding person-specific frequency of oscillations (Œ∑) and damping (Œ∂) parameters. These parameters were then used to predict depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month follow-ups controlling for baseline levels of depression. Results: Results revealed that the interaction between the damping parameter and the equilibrium position significantly predicted depressive symptoms for sadness, but not for other emotions. For individuals with higher equilibrium levels of sadness, stronger damping predicted higher follow-up depressive symptoms. Additionally, higher frequency of oscillation around the equilibrium ‚Äì representing greater elasticity and less rigidity ‚Äì of two emotions (interest and happiness) predicted fewer depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the adaptive value of rapid emotional recovery depends on one's baseline emotional state. Tracking emotion regulation dynamics of both positive and negative emotions may improve our ability to identify adolescents at risk for depression before symptoms emerge, thereby informing targeted intervention and prevention efforts.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (problems in thinking, learning, remembering, judging, and decision-making) is central to many mental health disorders and often appears long before the onset of psychiatric symptoms. As psychiatric disorders are often heritable, children with first-degree relatives affected by severe mental illness are at higher risk for future psychiatric disorders, potentially showing early psychiatric symptoms. Our study explored the potential association between cognitive impairments and early subsyndromal psychiatric symptoms in at-risk youths from a transdiagnostic perspective. We analyzed 970 at-risk youth (aged nine to ten) with 970 matched controls from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and found they performed worse in some cognitive domains and exhibited more psychiatric symptoms than controls. Our multivariate analyses revealed a pattern most strongly linking emotional dysfunction symptoms and cognitive language abilities in at-risk youth, suggesting a link between cognitive impairment in at-risk youth and a higher prevalence of early psychiatric symptoms. Such association could potentially guide prediction, prevention and early intervention for children who are more at risk of developing mental illness later in life.",

However, a mechanistic cognitive science framework for understanding how it transforms mental processing is still needed. The act of practicing meditation involves trying to be deliberately conscious of a target content. This requires monitoring the contents of one‚Äôs consciousness and regulating them in favor of the target. I propose, this involves a metacognitive template of the target being present in consciousness, which when compared to the actual conscious content generates a ‚Äúmetacognitive prediction error‚Äù (MPE). MPE leads to efficient regulation of conscious content by helping fine-tune the frequency of monitoring, downstream unconscious processing, and the metacognitive template itself.

Experiment 1 found that badass is a dual-character concept. That is, people rely on two sets of criteria when judging badassness: a superficial, concrete sense and a deeper, abstract sense. Experiment 2 suggested that these two senses of badassness reflect outer toughness (e.g., physical strength and a formidable presence) versus inner toughness (e.g., moral resilience and courage). Experiments 3-4 explored the qualities that make a person tough ‚Äúon the inside,‚Äù revealing effects of overcoming social pressure, doing the morally right thing, taking on difficult challenges, and succeeding in one‚Äôs efforts.

          "abstract": "Although factor models have been pivotal in understanding the relations among variables, they are difficult to apply to data from experimental designs. In experiments, data are from trials which are nested in conditions, tasks, and individuals. Data at the trial level is quite noisy, so much so that even averages on critical contrasts are subject to excessive measurement error. In this paper, we develop hierarchical factor models where the first level are linear models that account for trial noise and are parameterized with separate, latent individual-by-task scores. The second level consists of factor models on latent individual-by-task scores. Because the model is hierarchical, Bayesian analysis is convenient and conceptually straightforward. We provide development with good computational properties. The advatages of the model are that (a) correlations across tasks may be both disattenuated and localized fairly precisely; (b) uncertainty from both variability in individuals and across trials may be accurately assessed; and (c) factor structures may be recovered even in high-measurement-error contexts. Applications to visual illusions and to cognitive control are included.",

Despite its significance, the neurocognitive processes underlying dissociation remain poorly understood, potentially limiting the effectiveness of PTSD diagnostics and treatment. To address this gap, we apply network control theory to examine neural dynamics corresponding to dissociative states in two contexts: intravenous ketamine administration, an anesthetic known to induce dissociative states (n=30, healthy volunteers), and therapeutic interventions in PTSD patients expected to alleviate dissociative symptoms (n=78). Ketamine administration led to brain dynamics resembling those observed in PTSD patients pre-treatment, with increased dominance of a default mode network meta-state and decreased dominance of a somatomotor meta-state. While ketamine did not significantly alter the brain's energetic landscape, transition energies increased post-treatment in PTSD patients, potentially indicating more organized and less entropic brain dynamics.",

This paper develops and tests a theory regarding a previously unconsidered variable: central bank independence (CBI). We argue that increases in CBI alter the pressures a central bank faces, compelling them to address these pressures to maintain their reputation. We fine-tune and validate a Large Language Model (Google's Gemini) to develop novel textual indices of policy pressures regarding monetary policy communication of central banks in speeches of 100 central banks from 1997 to 2023. Employing a staggered difference-in-differences and an instrumental variable approach, we find robust evidence that an increase in independence decreases monetary pressures and increases financial pressures discussed in monetary policy communication. These results are not, as generally is assumed, confounded by general changes in communication over time or singular events, in particular, the Global Financial Crisis.",

It then critically reviews the challenges of current approaches to science mapping, which implicitly assume a ‚Äònatural‚Äô underlying structure, with examples from recent case studies. We observe that existing algorithmic approaches, either based on citation or semantic approaches, have problems of logic consistency of the categories obtained, which belong to methods, materials, empirical objects or theories. I propose that science mapping should engage with the conceptual goals of analyses that could define the type of ontologies relevant for each specific study. To do this science mapping should embrace mixed-methods to generate plural classifications and multiple ontologies which respond more specifically to sociological and policy questions.",

In this paper, I argue that prevailing educational conditions, influenced by technological advancements, can find valuable support in Freire‚Äôs age-old yet enduring educational philosophy. Such a philosophy requires us to reimagine how to shift from policing knowledge to embracing new pedagogies that instil in our students the ethics and values they need to navigate the vast information readily available for consumption.

We find that this message about climate leadership did not encourage the wineries to participate in the webinar, and it even had a negative effect on nearby wineries.

          "abstract": "To address social concerns that online personalisation algorithms increase polarisation, scholars have studied two distinct classes of agent based models of opinion dynamics constructed to explain polarisation: contagion/reinforcement class and repulsion class. It has been rigorously demonstrated that these classes make contrasting predictions on the relationship between polarisation and homophily (thought to be a consequence of online personalisation algorithms). However, consequences of a model that combines contagion and repulsion on the relationship between homophily and polarisation has not been rigorously studied. Thus, this paper proposes a theoretical foundation for such a model and extends an existing contagion class attitude dynamics model into a  contagion-repulsion combination model. This results in a novel equation of attitude change which positions the combination model as a generalisation of several other opinion dynamics models. Subsequently, simulation experiments test implications of this model on the relationship between homophily and polarisation. Results show different parameter combinations produce several qualitatively different forms of the relationship, ranging from increasing, decreasing, U-shaped or even flat. This suggests the relationship between polarisation and homophily is sensitive to context and may be issue dependent.",

          "authors": "Margot Belguise; yuchen huang; Zhexun Mo; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Recent experimental evidence contends that meritocratic ideals are mainly a Western phenomenon. Intriguingly, the Chinese public does not appear to differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, despite China‚Äôs historical emphasis on meritocratic institutions. We propose that this phenomenon could be due to the Chinese public‚Äôs greater reluctance to make an active choice in real-stake redistribution decisions. We run an incentivized redistribution experiment with elite university students in China and France, by varying the initial split of payoffs between two real-life workers to redistribute from. We show that, compared to French respondents, Chinese respondents consistently and significantly choose more non-redistribution across both highly unequal and relatively equal status quo scenarios. Additionally, we also find that Chinese respondents do differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, and do not redistribute less than the French, excluding the individuals who engage in non-redistribution choices. Chinese respondents are also as reactive as the French towards scenarios with noisy signals of merit, such as inequalities of opportunities. Ultimately, we contend that the reluctance to make an active choice is indicative of diminished political agency to act upon redistribution decisions with real-life stakes, rather than apathy, inattention, having benefited from the status quo in Chinese society or libertarian preferences among the Chinese. Notably, our findings show that Chinese individuals‚Äô reluctance to make a choice is particularly pronounced among those from families of working-class and farming backgrounds, while it is absent among individuals whose families have closer ties to the private sector.

This systematic review examines the evolution, impact, and future prospects of open citations through a detailed analysis of literature, including articles, proceedings, presentations, datasets and blog posts. The study explores the motivations behind citing, the changing meanings of citations, and highlights key milestones in the open citation movement, particularly focusing on initiatives like OpenCitations and the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC).\nKey findings indicate that open citations democratize research by providing free access to citation data, improving discoverability, and facilitating the creation of public citation graphs. Technological advancements, such as advanced data models and reference mining tools, have significantly contributed to the management and utilization of citation data. Despite these benefits, challenges such as ensuring data quality and standardization, addressing structural inequalities in citation networks, and achieving universal publisher adoption persist.\nThe study concludes with recommendations for future efforts, emphasizing policy advocacy, technological innovation, global collaboration, and educational initiatives to promote the widespread adoption and effective use of open citations. These strategies aim to make the ‚Äúfrozen footprints‚Äù of scholarly communication accessible to all, fostering a more equitable and transparent scientific landscape.",

Amidst the ongoing journalism crisis‚Äîmarked by newspaper closures, job insecurity, and high emotional labor‚Äîmany journalists continue their work, sustained by moments of joy and humor. Drawing on interviews with 21 U.S. journalists and building on Parks' (2021) theory of \"joy as a news value,\" this research investigates how humor not only serves as an emotional release but also fosters camaraderie in the newsroom, strengthens journalist-source relationships. The findings highlight humor's critical role in contributing to building a supportive work environment, enhancing job satisfaction, and allowing journalists to maintain engagement with their profession.

          "abstract": "When conducting quantitative surveys, it is crucial to choose a research design that is tailored both to the target group and to the particular context. According to the literature, personalized salutations in survey invitations have a beneficial effect on response rate and consequently on data quality. However, in our case, the 2019/20 cohort of the DZHW Scientist Survey, it remained to be determined which personalized salutation is most suitable to the specific target group of scientists in Germany and whether there are differences according to subgroups such as academic status or gender. We argue that for many survey studies this question of specific tailoring for a target population arises. Also, because personalization necessitates a significantly increased effort for the collection and preparation of address data, it can be decisive to know whether or not there is an advantage over simple non-personalized forms of address. In the case of scientists in Germany we tested three different personalized forms of address at the beginning of the field phase with 20.000 invitees. Each of the three is associated with different social signals and requirements for address data, and compared with the benchmark of the non-personalized, but ingroup signalling salutation ‚ÄúDear Colleague‚Äù. We find that, for all three status groups - professors, postdocs, and predocs - personalized salutations are associated with significantly higher response rates. However, the exact preferences for one form of personalization or another vary between these subgroups. The results from the experiment allowed us to precisely tailor salutations to subgroups for the remainder of the field phase, and to maximize the final overall response in the survey.",

          "abstract": "\"Divided We Fall: A Multidisciplinary Analysis of Polarisation, Social Divides, and the Fragility of Unity in Human Societies\" explores the escalating threat of polarisation and tribalism in modern human societies. By examining historical case studies, such as Nazi Germany and McCarthyism, alongside contemporary events like Brexit and the U.S. elections of 2016 and 2024, the paper identifies recurring patterns in how societal divisions are exploited for political and ideological gain. The analysis integrates insights from social psychology, highlighting cognitive biases like confirmation bias, in-group/out-group dynamics and heuristic-driven decision-making, which leave individuals vulnerable to manipulation.\nThe paper also delves into the role of emerging technologies, such as social media and AI-driven propaganda, in amplifying divisions, creating echo chambers and eroding democratic norms. Beyond diagnosing the problem, it explores opportunities for fostering unity, drawing on historical examples of collective action, such as post-WWII reconstruction and the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the fragility of social cohesion and emphasize the urgent need for proactive leadership, media responsibility and grassroots mobilisation to counter polarisation. This multidisciplinary framework aims to provoke discussion on how humanity can navigate its growing divides and build resilience against future existential threats.\n\n\nThe paper also explores how modern technologies‚Äîsuch as social media algorithms and artificial intelligence‚Äîamplify polarization, creating echo chambers and eroding trust in democratic processes.

A multiple regression analysis indicates that social progress is correlated strongly to gross domestic product per capita divided by the cost of living and higher scores on a democracy index. Religious commitment, indicated by surveys of daily prayer, is correlated to less social progress. The research literature suggests that religious commitment leads to neglect of the prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries recommended by science, disdain for scientists, and acquiescence to or support of autocratic government. The trend toward autocracy in several democracies may lead to the deterioration of social progress. Increased global warming and the threat of nuclear winter depend disproportionately on the behavior of autocratic leaders in China, Russia, and the U.S. that neglect or deny the need to curb fossil use and express intent to expand their nuclear arsenals.",

          "abstract": "The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is now an integral part of many occupational task profiles. Therefore, like mathematics and science, ICT represent an important content domain that adolescents may consider in their early vocational choices. Drawing on Eccles‚Äô situated expectancy value theory and related theories, we hypothesize that adolescents‚Äô ICT interest and self-concept should influence their vocational choices with respect to the intensity of ICT use in future occupations. Using longitudinal data from 1,964 Swiss adolescents transitioning into firm-based vocational education and training, we find strongly gendered patterns. Higher ICT interest predicts selection into occupations involving greater intensity of both basic and advanced ICT use, but only for girls. A more positive ICT self-concept is a significant predictor of greater occupational ICT use in future occupations only for boys, and this association is driven mainly by boys choosing careers as ICT specialists. Girls‚Äô lower average ICT interest and their less positive ICT self-concepts explain almost half of the gender differences in the intensity of advanced ICT use. These findings emphasize that ICT are an important content domain of adolescents‚Äô vocational choices today and highlight how gendered interests and self-concepts towards ICT perpetuate occupational gender segregation.",

          "abstract": "Background: Evidence shows that community group activities can support and improve health and wellbeing. However, research into the patterning of community engagement suggests that socioeconomic factors may act as barriers to participation. Yet, because this research has mainly been conducted in high-income, Western and Global North countries, it remains unclear whether these patterns are consistent across different countries and cultural settings, especially in Global South, low-middle income, and non-Western countries. Further, we do not know whether country-level socioeconomic factors influence community engagement.  \n\nMethods: Data from 64,065 adult respondents in the World Values Survey were analysed to examine the association between individual-level (education, income, and employment) and country-level (years of compulsory education, GDP per capita, Gini coefficient, and unemployment) socioeconomic factors and community organization membership rates. Multilevel regression modelling was used. Further analyses tested the associations between active membership and various types of community organization memberships. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, immigration status, household size and marital status. \n\nResults: Prevalence of community organization membership varies across countries. Kenya, Colombia and Mongolia have the highest numbers of memberships and Greece, Russia and Egypt have the lowest numbers. Individual education and perceived household income, and country-level income inequality and employment rate were all positively associated with group membership. Some variations by organization type were observed.\n\nConclusions: We found a universal social gradient in community organization membership, with individual education as the most influential predictor of more memberships across countries. Given that participation in community organizations can improve and support individual and community wellbeing, and plays a role in cultural and social capital development, reducing participatory disparities in these organizations could contribute to the reduction of health and social inequalities.",

Our approach is validated against national lists of societies from Austria, Finland, and the UK, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of our method which, however, has several limitations discussed in the paper. Our findings show that 92% of 1,471 societies identified in ROR are currently assigned to ‚ÄòOther‚Äô and ‚ÄòNonprofit‚Äô categories. We also highlight the geographical distribution and field-specific categorization of learned societies, emphasizing the diversity and scope of their influence.

We found that all dimensions of trust positively correlate with support for management, with rational trust being the strongest predictor. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and race showed minimal impact compared to trust dimensions. Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of trust and its critical role in resource management and suggest that building and maintain multiple dimensions of trust can enhance public support for environmental management, ultimately leading to more effective and resilient environmental governance.",

          "abstract": "Following a brief outline of labour-power through Marx, Ciccarelli (2021) and my own work, it is argued that the fragmentation of Marxist work on labour-power undermines what is critical for its understanding in contemporary society: the notion that labour-power is a ‚Äòunity of the diverse‚Äô (Marx). In Marxist theory and empirical work today, labour-power as ‚Äòunity‚Äô, as a unified social force within humans, is sacrificed to its ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô. The result is theorisations and empirical research that split the study of labour-power into seemingly competing projects; either as arguments regarding whether the key focus should be on the social production of labour-power through education and training, or the social reproduction of labour-power through the family and domestic labour. This paper argues that labour‚Äìpower is better viewed through its various diversities that constitute its unity. Each of these diversities is a spectral (but real) point in analysis of labour-power, but its unity blends the pinpointing analysis of its diversities. These labour-power diversities are social forms of its social re/production that are manifested in and through various institutions in capitalist society. In this light, the following diversities of labour-power and their institutional forms can be viewed directly through the work of Marx: the social production of labour-power (e.g. in education and training); its social reproduction 1 (e.g. through the family and domestic labour); social reproduction 2 (e.g. through state pensions, unemployment benefits); maintenance of labourers 1 (e.g. through consumption, food); maintenance of labourers 2 (e.g. through health, and mental health services). These labour-power diversities constitute a web of social forms shaping labour-power in contemporary capitalism. The paper ends by exploring some recent empirical examples illustrating how moving between the spectral points of labour‚Äìpower and its diversities solidifies their unity in analysis.",

          "authors": "Asad L. Asad; Livia Baer-Bositis",
          "abstract": "System avoidance refers to the tendency of individuals who are concerned about formal social control (e.g., incarceration, immigration enforcement, or the removal of children from their families) to avoid surveilling institutions that engage in recordkeeping. While this research locates concerns about formal social control in an individual‚Äôs sanctionable status, the laws, policies, and practices that generate the threat of formal social control vary across space and time. Drawing on theories of legal consciousness, this article posits that spatial and temporal variation in the threat of formal social control has differential associations with whether and to what degree individuals with a sanctionable status report involvement in surveilling institutions. Our empirical case is U.S. immigration policing, which burdens Latinos across citizenship statuses. We link individual-level data on institutional involvement from the American Time Use Survey with administrative data on immigration policing across state-years. Results from double- hurdle models show that Latinos in state-years with higher rates of immigration policing (1) are less likely to report involvement in surveilling institutions but, (2) conditional on any involvement, do not vary in the time reported involved. We evaluate variations by nativity, citizenship status, institution, and the presence of sanctuary policies that circumscribe immigration policing. We conclude that the threat of formal social control across space and time implicates the situational meanings of institutional involvement for subordinated populations.",

          "authors": "Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "L'articolo esplora l'importanza strategica dell'implementazione dei servizi di kitting e assembly per affrontare problematiche di assegnazione delle risorse in un magazzino operante nel settore idrotermosanitario. Si concentra sulla crescente complessit√† delle operazioni logistiche in un contesto caratterizzato da una domanda sempre pi√π personalizzata e dalla necessit√† di garantire tempi di consegna rapidi. Attraverso un'analisi approfondita, il lavoro evidenzia come il kitting e l'assembly siano strumenti fondamentali per ottimizzare i flussi operativi, migliorare l'efficienza e soddisfare le aspettative dei clienti. Il kitting viene descritto come il processo di raggruppamento di componenti per assemblaggi specifici, contribuendo alla riduzione dei tempi operativi e minimizzando gli errori umani. L'assembly, d'altro canto, completa il ciclo producendo kit semi-finiti o finiti, pronti per la distribuzione. L'articolo analizza il valore di questa integrazione, mostrando come essa migliori la gestione degli spazi e la tracciabilit√† dei materiali, oltre a fornire un vantaggio competitivo. La ricerca adotta un approccio olistico, prendendo in esame sia gli aspetti tecnologici, come l‚Äôuso di software di gestione logistico avanzato, sia quelli collaborativi, evidenziando l'importanza del coordinamento tra risorse umane e materiali. Inoltre, include casi studio dettagliati che dimostrano i benefici tangibili delle soluzioni implementate, come la riduzione degli errori, l‚Äôaumento dell‚Äôefficienza e un impatto positivo sulla sostenibilit√†. Questo lavoro rappresenta un contributo significativo per le aziende che intendono migliorare la gestione logistica, con un focus su innovazione e ottimizzazione dei processi.",

          "abstract": "Experimental studies on political behavior are on the rise in economics and political science. Especially, apart from traditional forms of political participation such as voting and petitions, we have also seen a burgeoning literature on protests, a non-institutional and contentious form of political participation.  Despite various ethical concerns with recreating artificially contentious environments for conducting experiments, this burgeoning literature is robust and still growing to cover all analytic issues about the genesis and effects of protests. This essay provides a comprehensive framework and a critical review for the recent experimental literature on protests in social sciences.",

          "abstract": "This AHURI research examines how governments can encourage small-scale private investors to provide affordable rental housing. It finds that landlords who follow the positively geared, long-term hold investment (LTHI) model are most likely to be part of affordable housing schemes.\n\nThe LTHI landlords invest on the basis of positive cashflow earning reliable rental income. In general, they purchase cheaper housing in lower value locations and seek to own their investment property outright by retirement. LTHIs landlords can provide a source of affordable rental housing, but do not tend to lead the creation of new stock.\n\nThe landlords will participate in affordable housing schemes that maximise the potential for a positive cashflow, and not those based on financial schemes such as negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. It is important to index rental increases to market rates so that investors who lock-in to long-term schemes are not disincentivised.\n\nFocus groups with small-scale landlords who lease their properties to social housing providers (SHPs) found the landlords were unanimous in their support for headlease programs. The advantages for landlords included:\n- guaranteed rental payments provided cashflow security‚Äîsuch rental guarantees made investors 12 per cent more likely to participate in a scheme\n- no loss of rent due to vacancy and no need to advertise for new tenants\n- guaranteed make-good provisions gave confidence that the property would be returned in original condition\n- reduced administration demands provided peace of mind and a ‚Äòhands free‚Äô approach.",

Using geocoded administrative data on reported crime, stops and searches and police use of force incidents, combined with daily temperature data at 1km grid-level, results show the same temperature-crime link found in other countries. Against this background, I find evidence for changes in police priorities and search outcomes. While there is no decrease in police effectiveness in searches, there is evidence for ethnic differences, especially affecting Black subjects. Additionally, police use-of-force incidents increase in intensity during hotter periods, leading to higher civilian resistance and injuries.",

          "title": "From Indigenous Resistance to the Contemporary Argentine Contempt for Authority",
          "authors": "Carmelo Jos√© Felice; Gabriel Alfredo Ruiz",
          "abstract": "The political stability of a modern democracy, excluding environmental or external causes, is determined by multiple factors, all influenced by human behaviour. One indicator of political stability that takes the human factor into account is the time in office of a ruler. The stability of a ruler can be directly affected, for example, if they are killed, or indirectly, if the laws issued by the ruler are not followed. Non-compliance is dependent on the level of contempt for authority among citizens. A post-hoc hypothesis from a previous publication suggests that indigenous contempt for the authority of the white conqueror and coloniser is seen as a primary causal factor of political instability in Argentina. In this work, indigenous contempt has been shown to have originated from the mistreatment of indigenous peoples by the conqueror and coloniser, and it is expressed in practice by laws and norms being violated as a covert form of resistance. This behaviour has been spread throughout Argentine society due to extensive genetic mixing between Amerindian and Eurasian peoples, initially encouraged by the Spanish Crown. It is observed that these behaviours persist in the 21st century, partly because mistreatment and discrimination against indigenous peoples continue, and partly because pigmentocracy exists, a social system where wealth and status depend on skin colour. It is therefore crucial to understand that a large part of the causes of Argentina's political instability can be traced to the non-compliance with laws and regulations, which originated as forms of indigenous resistance to the Spanish conqueror and coloniser. Public policies aimed at improving compliance should be designed to integrate indigenous cultures into Argentine identity, ensuring that all citizens wish to comply with the laws because they now see them as their own.",

          "authors": "Holly Shorey; Abrar Bawati; Rense Nieuwenhuis; Merve Uzunalioglu; Max Thaning",
          "abstract": "Background: The concept of resilience in familial and social contexts has gained prominence in academic and policy discussions. However, the interplay between family life and social inequalities, and how these relate to each other in the resilience literature, has yet to be documented.\n\nObjective: This scoping review addresses this gap by analysing 250 articles published between 1998 and 2023. We compare the concept of resilience as applied in family and social resilience studies through four constitutive elements: (I) unit of analysis, (II) definitions, (III) types, and the (IV) topics of risks, outcomes, and explanatory factors empirically examined.\n\nResults: While both perspectives study individuals‚Äô resilience, the emphasis in family resilience is on families, whereas social resilience studies focus more on communities and societies. Both perspectives emphasize the centrality of risks in defining resilience, yet family resilience scholarship seeks solutions within the family, while social resilience highlights community dynamics. Additionally, family resilience studies explore topics related to family-specific risks and resources, while social resilience studies examine external risks and resources.\n\nConclusions: The family resilience scholarship follows the clinical tradition of resilience literature, viewing families as a separate entity that is resourceful and agentic. Socioeconomic risks are recurrent themes in social resilience, but not in the family resilience literature.\n\nContribution: Understanding resilience through the lens of family inequalities in socioeconomic contexts can bridge these two perspectives. Incorporating factors such as labour market dynamics, family transitions, and educational attainment into definitions of risks, outcomes, and explanatory factors of resilience can enhance this integration.",

          "title": "Gender quotas and upward political mobility in India",
          "authors": "VARUN KAREKURVE RAMACHANDRA",
          "abstract": "This paper uses the staggered implementation of gender quota policy in India to understand whether women who won office due to quotas go on to win higher-level office.   Indian local government elections impose mandatory gender quotas, but  state elections do not. This provides a setting to assess if there is an increase in women's representation at higher levels of governance due to quotas at the local level. The identification strategy  allows me to ascribe an increase of three percentage points in the share of women at the state-level  to gender quotas in local government. Additionally, to establish upward political mobility of local-level leaders I tracked political biographies of over 1000 women legislators  across India's 15 major state assemblies. In doing so, I identify that political dynasties, and ground-level leadership  --- those who  entered politics due to mandatory gender quotas --- are the two primary channels that enable  entry of women into state-level politics. Further, I show that the effect of democratic entry of women into politics via quotas is pronounced in states with parties that are reliant on empowered rank and file members.  Overall, these results highlight the importance of gender quotas as a democratic state-building tool and provide evidence for career advancement of women in politics  whose democratic entry into politics was facilitated by the implementation of mandatory gender quotas.",

          "authors": "Ole R√∏geberg; K. Paige Harden; Torkild Hovde Lyngstad",
          "abstract": "According to sociological modernization theory, the shift towards a more meritocratic society should reduce the impact of family background on education and increase the importance of individual abilities. Sibling correlations have been used as an omnibus indicator of the importance of families for socioeconomic outcomes. However, sibling similarities in education are influenced by both the siblings‚Äô genetics and their shared environments, making it challenging to interpret changes over time. This study examines the changing contributions of genetic and environmental factors to educational attainment among Norwegian twins born from 1915 to 1991. Using administrative data on education for more than 13,000 twin pairs, we applied a Bayesian hierarchical liability threshold model to estimate the heritability and shared environmental influences on educational attainment across birth cohorts, while accounting for changes in the educational system and population distributions. For women, the heritability of educational attainment increased throughout the 20th century, whereas the influence of shared environmental factors decreased. This pattern corresponds with sociocultural changes that promoted gender equality and expanded educational opportunities for women. In contrast, men exhibited no significant changes in heritability or shared environmental influences over time. This study adds to the body of research on how genetic influences on educational outcomes do ‚Äì and do not ‚Äì differ across historical time and social context.",

          "abstract": "Economic independence from parents is increasingly delayed in the United States. This delay has implications for the timing and sequencing of other life transitions such as employment and marriage, and for inequalities in the support young adults receive. In this study, we leverage the Panel Study of Income Dynamics‚Äô Transition to Adulthood Supplement on 1,081 young adults aged 18‚Äì28. Using sequence analysis, we examine how financial and co-residential support are embedded within the transition to adulthood. We study heterogeneity in support trajectories between and within families and disentangle the temporal order of transition to adulthood milestones. In line with existing theory on intergenerational transfers, parental economic support serves as both as an investment in young adults‚Äô educational and economic pursuits and as a safeguard for struggling children. However, we also find evidence of more traditional, gendered pathways to economic independence linked to marriage: marriage facilitates economic independence and, for young men especially, achieving economic independence is an important precursor to marriage.",

Our objective here is to provide an integrated picture of how cities work ‚Äì the physiology in some depth ‚Äì and to show how this can be deployed in problem-solving and urban planning. What is new is the laying of foundations in input-output accounts for modelling, potentially from the spatially macro and global scales and integrating via the meso city scale, to the micro, neighbourhood scale, but focussing here on building  fine-scale small-zone input-output accounts. This enhances the science, and facilitates problem-solving and planning in a variety of situations along with the handling of interdependencies.",

          "abstract": "Science diaspora networks (SDNs) are integral to science diplomacy and pivotal in tackling local, regional, and global challenges. Given the increasing mobility and connectivity in today's world, these groups play a key role in building partnerships and promoting bilateral benefits through research and development. Our objectives in this study were 1) compile a comprehensive list of SDNs, detailing their goals, missions, and objectives, 2) evaluate overarching trends within these networks, specifically examining variations based on the network's age and the nature of relationships between host and origin countries, and 3) develop a flexible framework for the establishment of new SDNs across different countries, adapting to varying geopolitical and cultural landscapes.\n\nOur results suggest that most SDNs are hosted in North America, predominantly involving high-income countries with strong alliances. African countries lack active SDNs, though existing general diaspora networks could evolve into STEM-focused subgroups. Significant innovation potential exists within choosing host countries (e.g., LMICs or neutral states) and mission focus (e.g., grand challenges). To be effective at the foreign policy level, SDNs need to have a large member base or targeted goals. Our framework, complemented by a synthesized objectives list, guides SDNs in establishing clear value propositions for members and partners, enhancing their role in science diplomacy and addressing global challenges.",
