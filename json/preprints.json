          "title": "Theory Borrowing as a Process",
          "authors": "Jakob Henke",
          "abstract": "Communication science has a history of borrowing theories from other disciplines. Yet, this practice is often criticized. In this essay, I challenge this notion by suggesting we view it as an iterative process. In doing so, borrowing can contribute to building more robust theories. Using examples of theories that have been borrowed by communication researchers, I illustrate several challenges that are associated with theory borrowing, such as adapting a theory out of scope, neglecting assumptions, not considering alternatives, and non-replicable empirical foundations. Viewing theory borrowing as a process means continuously engaging with a theory’s parent literature and potentially contributing to it. Ultimately, I advocate for a reflective and collaborative approach to theory borrowing that fosters rigorous interdisciplinary engagement, strengthens communication theory, and extends the discipline’s impact across the social sciences.",

          "authors": "ANINDHITO PRAYOGA",
          "abstract": "This article discusses the transformation of social values among Generation Z, particularly in the construction of ecological awareness through social media. Generation Z lives in a highly dynamic digital era, where social interaction occurs both directly and virtually. Using the theoretical approaches of social construction (Berger &amp; Luckmann), diffusion of innovations (Rogers), and symbolic interactionism (Blumer), this study explains how ecological values are formed through interaction, symbols, and digital visualizations. The findings indicate that Generation Z plays an active role in producing, disseminating, and sustaining environmental values in digital spaces. This awareness is not merely individual but has become part of a shared social construction. The study also highlights the role of educational institutions, communities, and public figures in reinforcing ecological norms as part of a new social culture.\n\nKeywords: Generation Z, social values, ecological awareness, social media, social construction",

          "abstract": "The primary goal of our target article (Isager et al., 2021) is to give the research community an example of what a well-justified replication value metric could look like, and to encourage discussion of how replication value could be quantified in practice. Furthermore, in the target article we discuss practical hurdles to quantification and possible practical applications for RVCn and other metrics. As that article proposes a method for how to do research–in this case a method to select which claims in the literature need replication most–it is important to receive criticism, feedback, and viewpoints from a diverse range of authors interested in this topic. We are delighted to read the many thoughtful yet critical commentaries, several of which proposing adjustments or alternatives to the equations we have proposed in the target article. This is very encouraging to see, as our aim with initiating this call in Meta-Psychology was to create an open dialogue in the scientific record. RVCn is an efficient but limited metric. Its limitations should be laid bare, and we fully expect that improved metrics and selection procedures can be created in the future. We hope our target article and these commentaries together will inspire readers to continue the discussion of how to efficiently and transparently select studies for replication.",

          "authors": "Gisella Logioia; Courtney Kurinec; Devon A. Hansen",
          "abstract": "Background: Work in healthcare routinely involves variable work schedules resulting in short/disrupted sleep. \nObjective: We conducted a laboratory-based experiment in healthy sleepers and those with chronic insomnia to understand the effect of sleep deprivation (SD) on decision-making using a reversal-learning task (GNGr) with unannounced reversal contingencies.\nMethods:  51 individuals were recruited for the study and data from 28 participants (55%) was available for analysis. 15 participants had chronic insomnia (7 underwent SD) and 13 were healthy sleepers (7 underwent SD). Data was collected between 2013 and 2016. Participants were in the laboratory for 5 days/4 nights. Following 2 baseline days, participants underwent 38h of SD or another nighttime sleep opportunity, followed by a recovery sleep opportunity for all participants. Unique versions of a GNGr task were administered in random, counterbalanced order at SD and 24h later. \nResults: There was a significant main effect of day, condition, phase, and their interaction (all p&lt;0.01). Participants performed better when rested and pre-reversal. While both SD groups showed poorer performance post-reversal during SD, the SD insomnia group showed relatively intact performance pre-reversal. \nConclusions: SD led to significant overall impairment on a reversal-learning task for both healthy sleepers and those with chronic insomnia. However, the nature of impairment differed between groups. Hyperarousal may have conferred a protective effect on those with insomnia, resulting in more preserved decision-making. These findings have important implications for healthcare providers in high-stakes environments where sleep disruption is common; it may leave them more susceptible to making life-threatening errors.",

          "abstract": "We approach the problem of explaining segmentation --- the human capacity to partition input streams into representations of appropriate form and content for efficient downstream processing --- by exploring a theoretically minimalistic and computationally plausible account of phoneme-to-word chunking. Through computational models, mathematical proofs, algorithm design, and observer model simulations in two languages, we suggest that online segmentation can be guided by content-agnostic properties of internal memory structures (i.e., lexicality and length type frequency). Our theoretical and empirical findings point to a formal link between such properties with practical performance benefits. Together, these contributions make progress on a fully explicit computational- and algorithmic-level account with plausible implementational-level primitives.",

          "authors": "Julian Chak Yan Chan",
          "abstract": "This paper develops a processual and structural ontology, grounded in the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010) and entropy dynamics. It addresses a key gap in theories of consciousness, by formalising how structurally viable inference gives rise to phenomenology within an entropy field. Through a synthesis of Ontic Structural Realism (OSR) and Process Ontology (PO), we posit that this occurs via relational co-emergence, where the realness of a processual structure is given by inferences within a relational field. These dynamics are formalised and modelled via core mechanisms centred on inferencing across entropy gradients, which involves how active inference (Friston et al., 2015) functions as agent-state coupling within an entropy gradient. Consciousness is thereby modelled as non-substantial but a mode of structurally sustained inference, where qualia are enacted structurally rather than contained intrinsically. This paper contributes to the broader discourse on birth, death and liminal phenomena by framing them across a continuum. Significantly, these are conceptualised as boundary conditions within an entropy and inferential field, where inference is not merely an epistemic description but the ontological condition of persistence.",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the phenomenon of epistemic inversion in contem-\nporary psychiatry, wherein diagnostic classification increasingly precedes and\nconstrains theoretical development. We argue that this reversal—exemplified\nby symptom-based systems such as the DSM, leads to a loss of epistemic\nnormativity and undermines the interpretive dimension of clinical reason-\ning. Through a critical engagement with historical and philosophical tradi-\ntions (Canguilhem, Hacking) and contemporary debates in the philosophy of\nmedicine (Khalidi, Kendler, Brigandt), we analyze the implications of object-\nled nosology on the ontology and intelligibility of mental disorders. To re-\nconstruct epistemic coherence, we introduce the concept of constraint regimes\nstructural, empirical, and projective—as a framework for understanding how\ndiagnostic stability emerges from the interplay of normative, contextual, and\nbiological factors. We advocate for a situated model of rationality that restores\nthe mediating role of clinical expertise, challenges classificatory reification, and\nreorients psychiatry toward an interpretive and normatively robust epistemol-\nogy.",

          "authors": "Paul McKee; Thomas Nadelhoffer; Khaoula Boulhadi; Helena Weymouth",
          "abstract": "Philosophers have long speculated that individual differences in temperament influence philosophical thinking, yet empirical research has rarely explored the role of neurodivergent traits in this domain. In this large online study (N = 1,254), we investigated whether participants with training in philosophy differ from the general population when it comes to six psychological traits—autism, ADHD, aphantasia, anendophasia, anauralia, and representational manipulation—and also whether these traits correlate with responses to two widely studied philosophical thought experiments: the “trolley problem” and the “rollback deterministic universe.” \n\nCompared to the general population, participants with training in philosophy had higher scores on measures of ADHD, internal verbalization, and representational manipulation, but lower scores on measures of visual imagery. These cognitive traits were also correlated with participants’ moral and metaphysical judgments (independent of their level of philosophical training)—e.g., participants who scored higher in visualization were less likely to judge that hitting the switch in the trolley problem is permissible but not obligatory, and also less likely to attribute free will and moral responsibility to agents in the rollback universe. \n\nFinally, we employed machine learning to develop predictive models that classify a randomly selected participant as either a philosopher or a non-philosopher. Models trained solely on responses to measures for neurodivergent traits achieved better performance than models trained solely on responses to philosophical thought experiments. This suggests that stable, trait-level neurodivergent characteristics may be more diagnostic of philosophical interest, aptitude, or training than judgments philosophers make on domain-relevant problems.",

          "abstract": "Early adversity is associated with brain changes that negatively impact development, social-emotional functioning, and academic achievement. The multifaceted nature of adversity complicates efforts to isolate specific factors that affect brain development and developmental outcomes. In the present study, we leverage parent survey data and longitudinal EEG data collected from infants during 4-, 9-, and 12-month well-child visits at a large hospital-based urban primary care clinic serving predominantly low-income families (293 infants, 667 EEGs). Using a network framework, we aimed to identify specific socioeconomic and psychological factors associated with differences in infant brain development. We find that mothers who report to be income insufficient were more likely to have lower educational attainment, report low-income, experience higher levels of stress, and encounter more adverse life events. Controlling for these variables, income insufficiency was specifically associated with delayed brain development in the first year of life; infants developing in a household where parents felt their income was inadequate to support the family’s needs exhibited slower rates of change in alpha power, alpha peak frequency, and beta peak activity. Together, these findings provide a framework of understanding and visualizing how early adversity impacts neurodevelopment and provides evidence for the potential utility of maternal income sufficiency as an additional screening tool to accelerate identification of populations most vulnerable and in need for early intervention.",

          "abstract": "The standard description of human intelligence, heavily influenced by the concept of general intelligence ability, depicts intelligence as being primarily a brain-based and biological activity, in which increasing levels of intelligence are associated to increasing effectiveness within the human neural system. Nonetheless, there are several known scenarios that do not fit into this standard description, the most prominent being the Flynn effect and its surprising revelation about the increasing nature of raw intelligence scores. Accordingly, this essay proposes an alternative description of human intelligence, one that focuses on the fundamental mismatch between general intelligence ability and raw measurable intelligence, resolving this mismatch by demonstrating that measurable intelligence can be accurately and meaningfully described as being the orthogonal combination of general intelligence ability and the totality of artificial construction contained within the human environment. There are three advantages to this alternative description of human intelligence: one, it gives a specific and observable depiction of the material nature of human intelligence; two, it forgoes any biologically or evolutionarily extraordinary alterations to the human brain; and three, it provides a straightforward account of the Flynn effect.",

          "abstract": "Being empowered and having a sense of control are central determinants of human well-being. However, there is currently no agreed-upon definition for the sense of control. We offer a prospective characterization as 'a priori readiness to perform tasks that will be announced in the future.' We show that this highlights three underlying factors that variously underpin previous conceptions of control: (i) action availability, (ii) certain achievability of potentially desired outcomes, and (iii) possible achievability of potentially desired outcomes. We formalize this characterization with a measure of controllability that precisely balances these factors via a single parameter. Our proposed measure accurately predicts the great majority of human preferences in two novel, theory-guided experiments, where participants prepare themselves to collect future rewards or avoid future punishments. Notably, our formulation captures substantial differences in participants' preference for certainty versus possibility. Our findings collectively provide instrumental insights into how individuals sense control.",

          "authors": "Huidi Jiang; Eugenia Navarra-Barindelli; Olivia Molina-Nieto; Clara Martin; Candice Frances",
          "abstract": "In opaque languages, like English, spelling is probabilistic and influenced by several factors, that together guide the spelling of new or unknown words. To determine whether a consonant should be doubled, native English speakers use information about the vowel—whether it is long or short and how many characters it is spelled with. When it comes to L2 speakers, the picture becomes more complex as the overlap between their L1 and L2 can affect their performance. The current study focuses on two languages that overlap in writing system—English and Spanish—but not in transparency—the first being opaque while the other transparent. Using the same English pseudoword spelling task as prior studies, we tested whether Spanish speakers’ consonant doubling patterns matched those of native English speakers. We then compared the data to that of native English, Chinese, and Korean speakers to investigate how the L1 background influences these consonant doubling decisions. We found that, unlike native English speakers, L1 Spanish speakers only use graphotactic regularities to determine consonant doubling, but not the phonological context. In contrast, L1 Chinese and L1 Korean speakers—with no writing system overlap with English—behave like native speakers, using both cues. These results suggest that orthography in English—an opaque language—is affected by L1 background. We discuss possible reasons for these differences as well as implications for foreign language teaching and future directions.",

          "authors": "Yulia Chentsova-Dutton; Andrew George Ryder",
          "abstract": "Contemporary psychopathology is grounded in the assumption that diagnostic categories are characterized by discrete sets of individual symptoms. As such, considerable resources have been invested over the past half-century to identify and refine these sets. There is a counter-tradition, however, that emphasizes symptom heterogeneity, especially for the internalizing disorders. This heterogeneity can be observed both within individual sufferers and across groups of sufferers in different sociocultural contexts. Rather than understanding this heterogeneity as a problem in need of a solution, we argue that variability in symptom presentation is an essential feature of internalizing distress: these disorders are, in their essence, shape-shifters. We begin by describing examples of similarities and differences in internalizing distress across cultural-historical contexts. Then, we address the complex nature of symptoms as physiological, psychological, and cultural phenomena that are experienced, interpreted, remembered, and anticipated, highlighting potential mechanisms of heterogeneity at each level of analysis. As this heterogeneity is not boundless, we also consider constraints that afford more uniform presentations and stabilize historical changes. The literature on the cultural shaping of psychological functioning is recruited throughout to illustrate the ways to conceptualize and study symptom heterogeneity. Understanding these disorders as shape-shifters has the potential to transform our approach to psychopathology, bringing a rapidly-growing literature on individual and cultural-historical variation to the very center of how we conceptualize internalizing distress.",

          "authors": "Shujianing Li; Tatum C. Leclair; Vivian Liu; A Safe Haven for Asians and Asian Americans",
          "abstract": "Burnout (i.e., exhaustion, depersonalization, and inefficacy) is an increasingly concerning issue in student populations. Asian American students, like other Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), may experience additional susceptibility to burnout due to racism and internalized stereotypes (e.g., pressure to succeed as a model minority). However, burnout interventions do not typically account for identity-based factors (e.g., discrimination, narrow definitions of success). Given the low mental health literacy and high mental health stigma in the Asian American community, providing culturally informed psychoeducation and actionable recommendations in non-stigmatizing ways may increase Asian American students' engagement with burnout interventions. In this protocol paper, we described the development of a psychoeducational, burnout prevention chatbot created by the A Safe Haven for Asians and Asian Americans (ASHAAA) work team, using community-engaged research principles. The chatbot, named ASHAAA’s Stress Assistant (ASA), intends to provide culturally informed psychoeducation on burnout reduction and prevention in a user-oriented and conversational way for Asian American students in higher education. ASA aims to increase the accessibility of basic psychoeducational information by posing fewer structural barriers than conventional, human-to-human psychological services. A community partner organization helped invite students to an unstructured discussion session on delivery style and content, informing subsequent chatbot training. This protocol provides a replicable roadmap for incorporating novel and contemporary technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) in early-stage psychoeducational interventions to address burnout in underserved, marginalized communities. Future research should examine the feasibility and effectiveness of this intervention in practice.",

          "authors": "Alejandro Garcia",
          "abstract": "Autism and related neurodivergent conditions are commonly framed as brain-based\ndisorders, defined by behavioral symptoms, cognitive traits, or genetic anomalies. The\nNervous System Adaptation Model (NSAM) challenges this framing by identifying chronic\nautonomic-cortical mismatch as the primary site of dysfunction. In this model, early-life\nautonomic disruption—whether due to prenatal stress, immune activation, or\ndevelopmental asynchrony—leads to persistent dysregulation between body and brain,\nwith autism representing one manifestation of this broader physiological adaptation\nprocess.\nThe cortex compensates for functionally asynchronous signaling between the\nhypothalamus and cortical systems by forming behavioral strategies that, over time, are\nreinforced into preference, personality, and identity. Rather than viewing behaviors like\nstimming, masking, or attraction patterns as symptoms, NSAM reframes them as\nregulatory solutions: attempts by the system to self-stabilize under chronic nervous system\nmismatch.\nIdentity emerges not as a static trait, but as the downstream outcome of reinforced\nautonomic regulation patterns. This framework extends beyond developmental\nneurodivergence to acquired conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), where similar\nautonomic-cortical coordination failures generate comparable behavioral and emotional\nadaptations.\nBy shifting focus from behavioral traits to underlying regulation patterns, NSAM oﬀers a\nphysiological lens for understanding neurodivergent presentations—one that centers\nsystemic coherence over symptom conformity. The implications span DSM classification,\nclinical intervention, and societal conceptualization of neurodivergence itself.",

Here, we tested the effects of anticipated perceptual interference (in Experiment 1) and anticipated dual task interference (in Experiment 2) on reactivation of LTMs in WM using contralateral delay activity (CDA) in the EEG. On each trial, participants saw one or three previously studied or novel objects that were tested after a brief retention interval. In half of the blocks, the retention contained perceptual distractors (Experiment 1) or dual task interference (Experiment 2). In both experiments, the CDA prior to the interference period was similar regardless of the anticipated interference. Additionally, we measured contralateral alpha power suppression as an index of spatial attention. We found that spatial attention allocated to the memorized objects’ locations also was not modulated with anticipated interference. These findings indicate that anticipating interference does not influence the extent to which WM is engaged in representing information stored in LTM.",

          "abstract": "The biological function of mental experience has remained enigmatic. Since conscious experiences are distinguished by their availability for verbal report, this work explores the hypothesis that mental experience functions in service of communication. By examining a system of communicating agents, I argue that agents with complex behavior and conflicting payoffs can benefit by influencing how they are perceived by others, and that this influence is achieved by communicating about the computational system controlling their behavior. It is impractical for biological or artificial computational systems to provide mechanistic models of themselves; instead, they can construct a mind: a simplifying -- and sometimes misleading -- model that accounts for behavior in terms of intentions, desires, goals, and emotions. Such a mind model could plausibly be implemented with general neural mechanisms for computation and learning and is remarkably consistent with human mental experience: a sparse and simplified account that prioritizes socially relevant information and distorts toward self-interest. The content of mental experience is predicted to be that which may be worth communicating about, and voluntary behaviors to be those whose motivations are worth communicating about. The social utility, feasibility of implementation, and consistency with mental experience together provide strong support for the hypothesis that the mind functions to communicate internal state.",

          "abstract": "Sexual and gender minority individuals face disproportionate mental health challenges, yet little is known about their experiences of gambling-related harm. This qualitative study explored the lived experiences of gambling among LGBTQIA+ individuals in the UK. Thirty-one self-identified LGBTQIA+ adults who had recently engaged in online gambling participated in semi-structured interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis produced three themes: (1) Gambling as a coping mechanism, (2) Discrimination and limited representation in gambling spaces, and (3) Barriers to accessing gambling support services. Participants described using gambling to manage distress related to marginalisation, including discrimination, identity concealment, and social isolation. Offline gambling environments were often perceived as unwelcoming or unsafe, while online gambling offered privacy but also potential for harm. Participants reported structural and interpersonal barriers to support, including fears of bias and the absence of culturally competent services, which further reduced help-seeking. These findings highlight how gambling harm among LGBTQIA+ individuals may be shaped by broader social and structural inequalities. The study highlights a need for inclusive, identity-responsive approaches to gambling harm reduction and support.",

          "abstract": "Nudges, defined as decisional context designs such as information presentation and structure, are increasingly utilized to encourage mental health behaviors. We conducted a systematic review, including 25 studies predominantly employing between-subject framing experiments, involving mainly adult participants from Western regions, and mostly on help-seeking and self-care. Findings on norm nudging and framing (self-other and positive-negative) have been mixed with evidence of positive-framing advantage in encouraging help-seeking. Limited studies on default nudge, decoy nudge, and reminder nudge found mostly beneficial effects. We provided suggestions to advance mental health nudging research, including a call for more theory-driven research with potential mediating and moderating measures, sampling of diverse populations in mental health conditions, age, cultural backgrounds. More research on tailored nudges and comparison between different nudges are also encouraged. Finally, studies with more consequential outcome variables (e.g. mental health, longer term behaviors), and monitoring and addressing risks of adverse effects, will be worthwhile. \nKeywords: Nudges, Decision-Making, Mental Health, Self-care, Help-seeking, Systematic Review",

          "abstract": "Music preference, understood as individuals’ disposition to appreciate certain kinds of music more than others, has been found to be a fundamental determinant of how individuals respond to music in a variety of contexts. This study investigates the psychometric properties of the STOMP-pop (Short Test of Music Preference: Western Popular Music) questionnaire, which allows to measure individuals’ preference for Western popular music styles. The questionnaire presents respondents with the names of sixteen Western popular musical styles and asks them to rate their liking of the corresponding music. We used PCA to analyze the data of ten studies in which the STOMP-pop was administered to n= 2792 respondents. The PCA revealed four orthogonal underlying dimensions along which respondents’ music preferences vary: Some respondents appreciate many different styles (PC 1 Eclecticism), whereas others’ preferences are focused on only a few styles. Some respondents like rough, aggressive, and intense music styles (PC 2 Aggressivity), whereas others appreciate music that is smooth or mellow. Some respondents like music that is linked to dancing (PC3 Danceability) whereas others prefer music for less active listening. Finally, some respondents like more complex music (PC 4 Complexity) while others like simpler music. These four underlying dimensions were stable across different sub-samples (male/female, young/old, musician/non-musician) of respondents from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) countries (scores were highly correlated r&gt;.89). In a small sub-sample of respondents (n=433) from non-WEIRD countries, PC 1 (r=.99) and PC 2 (r=.92) were stable. Yet PC 3 (r=.77) and PC 4 (r=.67) showed some instability. The STOMP-pop questionnaire offers a pragmatic approach to measuring individuals’ preferences for Western popular music styles. Results from non-WEIRD respondents need to be interpreted with caution.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nA robust body of political science literature demonstrates a strong correlation between economic precarity and support for extremist, populist, and authoritarian politics. However, the precise psychological and biological mechanisms driving this link remain undertheorized. This paper bridges this gap by proposing a novel explanatory framework grounded in neuroscience: the Cognitive Overload Model of Political Extremism. We argue that chronic stress—originating from sources including, but not limited to, economic insecurity—functions as a significant cognitive load, impairing the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex while amplifying the threat-response activity of the amygdala. This neurological shift creates a powerful, biologically-driven bias toward simplistic, low-effort, and high-reward ideologies.\nCrucially, this paper argues that the manifestation of this neurobiological vulnerability is not deterministic. It is heavily moderated by an individual's informational environment and social context. We further posit that ideology is not merely an outcome but part of a dynamic feedback loop with social pressures. After synthesizing the existing empirical data and detailing the core neurobiological model, this paper explores these complexities to account for phenomena such as the affluent extremist and the resilient poor. We conclude by outlining a next-generation research program designed to test this more nuanced, interactive model, offering a clear path forward for a new agenda in political psychology and neuro-politics.\nKeywords: Political Polarization, Neuro-politics, Cognitive Overload, Economic Precarity, Political Psychology, Stress, Authoritarianism, Populism, Social Media.",

          "authors": "Daniel Ivan Perez-Zapata; Ian Apperly",
          "abstract": "In pure coordination games players aim to give the same response without communication. Cognitive science research has focused on the reasoning and common knowledge necessary as the background conditions for coordination, with less attention paid to the challenge of intuiting responses on which coordination might be possible. Most studies have examined coordination within university samples from a single country and so the extent of the challenge of coordinating between heterogenous groups of people may have been underestimated. We conducted three empirical studies (two pre-registered) with participants from the UK, South Africa, and Chile, plus a globally distributed sample (total N=520). Without communicating, participants were asked to coordinate on answers to simple questions such as “name a city”. All groups coordinated at rates far above chance, but often coordinated on different responses. Study 1 showed that participants from one group could nevertheless anticipate the responses of another group, while Studies 2 and 3 showed that participants could coordinate with a partner from a different group. Crucially, between-group partners most often coordinated on new responses that were rarely considered for within-group coordination, providing the strongest evidence to date to support Schelling’s claim that coordination requires distinctive reasoning, beyond primary and secondary salience. These findings provide evidence that coordination decisions are variable and flexible, resulting in accurate adaptations to achieve coordination. Where previous work has focussed predominantly on the forms of reasoning that support coordination, the present findings suggest that it is equally important to examine the content of coordination solutions.",

          "abstract": "Prevailing analyses of political polarization often frame the phenomenon as a moral or \nsociological failing. This paper proposes an alternative, neurobiological framework, arguing that \nescalating political extremism is a predictable consequence of widespread cognitive overload. \nBy synthesizing findings from neuroendocrinology, cognitive psychology, and political economy, \nwe posit a causal mechanism wherein chronic stressors—stemming from economic precarity \nand digital information saturation—induce a metabolic shift in cognitive function. Heightened \nlevels of stress hormones, such as cortisol, are shown to impair the executive functions of the \nprefrontal cortex while amplifying the threat-detection and binary response patterns of the \namygdala. This neurological state creates a potent bias toward simplistic, ideologically rigid \nnarratives, which are biochemically reinforced by the brain's dopaminergic reward system. The \npaper further argues that these innate biological vulnerabilities are systematically exacerbated \nby socioeconomic inequality and the algorithmic architecture of modern social media. We \nconclude that the cognitive capacity for nuanced democratic deliberation is not a constant but a \nbiologically contingent state. Therefore, effective interventions must transcend moral exhortation\nto address the root structural drivers of cognitive stress, thereby restoring the neurological \nconditions necessary for a functioning democracy.\nKeywords:\n Political Polarization, Neuroscience, Cognitive Overload, Stress Hormones, \nCortisol, Prefrontal Cortex, Amygdala, Dopamine, Democracy, Social Media, Cognitive \nInequality",

          "authors": "Jess Goodman",
          "abstract": "It is widely known that women are diagnosed with ADHD and ASD at much lower rates than men – however, this may not be due to actual differences in prevalence rates. One suggested way of tackling this issue, is by looking at neurodevelopmental disorders through a neurodiversity lens, rather than simply a bio-medical lens, and normalising self- identification and more collaborative, bottom-up approaches to creating clinical knowledge and diagnostic criteria. Neurodiversity is a fairly new and rapidly developing concept, and there are wide-ranging interpretations of what it exactly refers to. The aim of this research project was to conduct a thematic media analysis of mainstream online media content (blogs and news articles) created by or about people of marginalised genders (women and\ngender-diverse people) with ADHD and/or ASD and looking at their perspectives and experiences of neurodivergence. This project takes a Social Constructionist approach and is aligned with the values of Neurodiversity Paradigm and the Social Model of Disability. The findings of the project included the following themes: ‘Gendered Differences – Experiences of Neurodivergent Women and Gender-Diverse People’; ‘Education and Awareness’; ‘Intersectional Inequity’; and ‘Neurodivergent Identity’. There is significant value to this online media content: gives a sense of community, helps increase awareness and decrease stigma, gives lived experiences a platform. The implications of this research are that it\nbecomes clear the value of Walker’s (2021) Neurodiversity Paradigm and the value of the ‘neurodivergent’ self-identity label for many NDMG. Until DSM criteria of ADHD and ASD better reflect the experiences of ADHD and ASD women and gender-diverse people, and until society treats such people more equitably and kindly, it is unsurprising that these people are seeking out their own strengths-based identity.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Bayesian Situational Construal Model (BSCM), a unifying psychological framework that models human behaviour as a process of dynamic Bayesian inference. Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

With researchers and experts are ongoing the study and treatment of mental illnesses, there are more and more indications of a close relationship of auditory hallucinations to mental diseases.1 This prompts a series of key questions: How are auditory hallucinations correlated to the mental diseases? How do auditory hallucinations influence human consciousness in brain and cognitive activities? In this work we propose a hypothesis for people with mental disease.We hypothesize that this could be assessed with the aid of animation, sound, pictures, BCIs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc. we have hypothesized there is a strong correlation between auditory hallucinations and mental disorders, and auditory hallucinations affect the consciousness and cognitive abilities of people with psychiatric disorders.",

Drawing from multiple scholarly and clinical sources—including DSM-5-TR, ICD-11, and the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD)—we trace HPD’s evolution from hysteria to its modern classification, highlighting persistent validity concerns and diagnostic unreliability. Case data illustrate how HPD traits may emerge in response to childhood trauma and insecure attachment. We discuss treatment challenges such as boundary violations and therapeutic fusion, and propose trauma-informed cognitive and schema-based strategies.

          "abstract": "Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is a complex and enduring psychiatric condition characterized by persistent patterns of grandiosity, excessive need for admiration, and marked deficits in empathy. While narcissistic traits exist on a continuum in the general population, pathological narcissism results in significant functional impairment across interpersonal, occupational, and emotional domains. This paper provides a comprehensive review of NPD from both historical and contemporary perspectives. It traces the disorder’s psychoanalytic origins in the works of Freud, Kernberg, and Kohut, followed by an analysis of DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria and dimensional models of personality pathology. Developmental risk factors—such as insecure attachment, early trauma, and emotional neglect—are examined alongside genetic and temperamental influences. The paper also explores cultural contributors, especially the role of digital validation and social media in reinforcing narcissistic traits. Neuroscientific findings related to empathy deficits and cognitive patterns are discussed, and common comorbidities are outlined. Current therapeutic approaches—including schema therapy, CBT, and psychodynamic modalities—are reviewed, along with a fictional case vignette to illustrate practical challenges. The paper concludes by advocating for integrative, culturally informed treatments that balance clinical structure with empathy in working with this often-misunderstood population.",

          "authors": "René Mõttus; Sam Henry",
          "abstract": "The vast majority of personality research is based on a single method: self-reports. As about half of the variance in single-method trait scores is the result of systematic biases and random error, it is likely that most research findings are biased, even well-replicated ones. While some ‘significant’ associations may be entirely artefactual, most are likely to be underestimated, sometimes by as much as 50%. Unfortunately, this is rarely discussed explicitly, let alone addressed empirically. After explaining the causes and extent of the problem, we argue that it can be effectively addressed by combining personality trait self-ratings with those of knowledgeable informants. To underscore the feasibility of multi-method research, we review recent large-scale studies that have combined self-reports and informant reports to provide more accurate answers to key questions in personality research, such as the heritability of traits and their association with important life outcomes. Since most associations are likely to be underestimated in typical single-method studies, multi-method studies will likely reveal higher correlations with commensurately stronger theoretical and practical implications. For example, single-method studies may have underestimated heritability by around a third and the predictability of life satisfaction from personality traits by around half. Personality psychologists have made great progress in incentivizing more reliable research; it is now time for the field to incentivize valid research, too.",

Through improving the way sequences are learnt, we can begin to minimise the chances for these consequences to occur. Virtual Reality (VR) has been widely used in the field of learning, with some research indicating that learning outcomes can be further improved with the inclusion of additional task-relevant Multisensory Cues (MSCs). This project investigates whether VR could provide a more effective learning environment for sequence learning compared to the real-world. Additionally, this project investigates whether the inclusion of additional MSCs further improves sequence learning in a VR environment. 20 participants took part in 3 conditions (VR with MSC, VR without MSCs, and real-world without MSCs). Participants were tasked with pressing the lit-up button out of a choice of four buttons. Buttons were lit-up either randomly or followed one of three unique sequences. After each condition, participants were tasked with recalling the sequence. Both VR environments were found to be effective for sequence learning, with VR with MSCs being more effective than without MSCs. No significant differences in accuracy of recall were found between any of the learning environments. These findings indicate that VR with additional MSCs can provide a learning environment that is equally as effective at learning sequences as the real-world",

This paper explores whether using a 3D VR application could enhance undergraduate students' learning of interview skills compared to a 2D desktop application or a video focused lecture presentation. Two studies were conducted involving students and staff taking part in either one or three different learning environments (3D VR application, 2D desktop application and video lecture presentation). Participants' employability skills, user experience and immersive presence were assessed. University staff rated the 3D VR learning environment to be better for employability skills training, immersive presence and user experience compared to the 2D desktop and video focused lecture conditions. Students found the 3D VR environment to be a more enjoyable experience compared to the other two learning environments. This raises a question regarding the integration of 3D VR systems as an alternative for employability training",

The first simulation study assessed linking methods under sampling error and uniform IPD. Results showed Haberman joint linking minimized bias and root mean square error (RMSE), especially at larger sample sizes, while concurrent calibration was most accurate without IPD. The second simulation study introduced two additional designs: one relying solely on anchor items across all three time points, and the other using only adjacent items between consecutive time points. Under no IPD, concurrent calibration remained most precise, while under uniform IPD, Haberman methods balanced bias and precision. The third simulation study analyzed nonuniform IPD, finding Haberman chain linking achieved the best bias and RMSE performance. Overall, chain linking methods outperformed joint linking in the presence of IPD. Implications for analyzing longitudinal linking designs are discussed.",

Recent research suggests that personality disorders, especially OCPD, might not be as stable as once thought. The current study investigates the longitudinal stability of OCPD diagnosis and individual symptom criteria in individuals with OCD. \nMethods: 320 participants with a primary diagnosis of OCD were included in the study, with diagnostic assessments conducted annually for seven years. Logistic mixed-effects models were conducted to examine the relationship between time and OCPD diagnosis, as well as the relationship between time and each OCPD symptom criterion over seven years. \nResults: In individuals with OCD, time was a significant predictor of OCPD diagnosis which indicated diagnostic instability, with the likelihood of OCPD diagnosis decreasing over time. Three individual criteria (detail-oriented, inflexible, overconscientious, and scrupulous, and miserly spending style) were shown to be stable while the other five (perfectionism, reluctance to delegate, rigidity and stubbornness, excessive work devotion, and inability to discard) were unstable. \nConclusion: OCPD diagnosis is not stable in individuals with OCD and consists of a mix of enduring and episodic symptom criteria. It suggests the need for a refinement of OCPD diagnostic criteria and future research on symptom stability of OCPD across different diagnostic groups.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and trauma, including the development of the construct of complex posttraumatic stress disorder (cPTSD). While trauma, particularly in childhood, is frequently associated with BPD, it is not a sufficient or necessary cause, suggesting a multi-causal model involving genetic vulnerability, environmental factors, and temperament. The paper examines the validity and clinical implications of cPTSD as introduced in the ICD-11, analyzing arguments that it either overlaps with, is a subtype of, or is distinct from BPD. Key issues in psychiatric diagnosis are addressed, including stigma, labeling, deliberate misdiagnosis, and ethical concerns in clinical practice. Through a review of empirical research and theoretical models, the paper concludes that while trauma may influence the development of BPD, it is not determinative, and accurate, nuanced diagnosis is essential for effective treatment planning and ethical social work practice.",

          "authors": "Mengli Feng; Michael D. Nunez",
          "abstract": "Predictive coding (PC) is a theory in cognitive/computational neuroscience which explains cortical functions with a hierarchical process of minimizing prediction errors. PC provides a neuronal scheme (through neurons or neural populations) for implementing Bayesian inference in the brain. PC recovers the hidden state of the world from sensory input (passive inference) and selects actions to reach the goals the agent has (active inference). Since its discovery, PC has been found to be a unifying theory explaining more and more cognitive functions, including perception, attention, and action planning. In this paper, we review and discuss how PC can be used also as a powerful tool to understand working memory (WM), an essential function for executive control. Specifically, we sought answers in the literature to the following questions: 1. How is WM maintained and updated? 2. What is the relationship between attention and WM and how do they interact? 3. Why does WM have limited capacity? and 4. Why is WM hierarchical? Modelling WM in PC frameworks provides alternative explanations to some long-standing questions about WM and may help with resolving the conflicts between WM theories. We expect such alternative explanations can help future researchers, such as in developing computational tools to improve treatments for brain disorders and more robust artificial working memory in artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Causal inference with observational studies is challenging because the identification and estimation of a causal effect rests on the untestable unconfoundedness assumption. The assumption requires researchers to determine a set of observed covariates which then successfully removes all the confounding bias. Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide (automatized) guidance for selecting an adjustment set of covariates. However, before one can select the covariates a valid causal DAG about the presumed data-generating process of the data in hand must be drawn. But published guidance on how to draw a valid causal DAG is at best still incomplete. This article introduces and discusses a stepwise procedure for drawing DAGs for causal inference.",

In two simulation studies, we examined the impact of publication bias and p-\nhacking practices on individual study effect sizes, meta-analytic estimates, and between-study\nheterogeneity. Study 1 assessed the individual effects of publication bias and five common p-\nhacking practices—selective outcome reporting, multiple conditions testing, optional dropping,\noutlier removal, and optional stopping. Study 2 examined how systematically combining these p-\nhacking practices influenced the same outcomes. Our results demonstrated that publication bias\nproduced larger bias than individual p-hacking practices in conditions commonly found in\npsychological research, namely small sample sizes and small true effects. Among p-hacking\npractices, selective outcome reporting and optional dropping caused the most severe bias in both\neffect sizes and heterogeneity estimates, whether applied individually or in combination. The\nimpact of these practices varied substantially based on study and meta-analytic conditions and\nspecific p-hacking practices used—while most p-hacking practices and combinations increased\nbias, optional stopping sometimes mitigated bias by increasing sample sizes. Notably, the\ncombination of three practices (selective outcome reporting, multiple conditions, and optional\ndropping) produced nearly as much bias as using all five practices.

However, efforts to observe SIF have sometimes failed, leading some to question the robustness of the effect. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of SIF within the Think/No-Think paradigm including several key methodological variants to the original design. Across 500 effects from 120 studies, we observed a consistent aggregate SIF effect (d ≈ 0.20 – 0.40) measured using either same probe (SIF ≈ 6%), independent probe (SIF ≈ 5-6%) or recognition (SIF ≈ 2-4%) tests. Notably, there was considerable methodological variability, and prediction intervals revealed substantial heterogeneity. Moderator analyses undertaken to explain this variability found SIF to be credibly larger when using (a) relatively more repetitions during the Think/No-Think phase within same probe data; (b) thought substitution instructions within same probe data (with the opposite observed for independent probe data); and, (c) autobiographical memories (or future worries) as opposed to words or images. Results provide compelling evidence of the SIF effect but also suggest areas for future expansion.",

          "abstract": "Implicit adaptation is a well-established learning process that recalibrates movements based on sensory prediction errors. While often described as automatic and inflexible, its expression can vary depending on contextual factors such as task outcomes or the presence of salient distractors. Here, we examined whether implicit adaptation is sensitive to attentional demands imposed by a concurrent visual task, rather than by task-irrelevant stimuli. Across two experiments, we used clamped feedback to measure implicit adaptation while participants performed a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. In Experiment 1, participants performing the RSVP task showed modest initial enhancements in implicit adaptation relative to a single task condition, despite a decline in RSVP accuracy when exposed to the clamped feedback. In Experiment 2, adding response-contingent feedback to the RSVP task led to stronger and more sustained implicit adaptation compared to the single task condition. These findings are inconsistent with interference-based accounts, which predict that attentional demands should suppress implicit adaptation, and challenge the view that implicit adaptation operates independently of attentional demands. Instead, they suggest that implicit adaptation is sensitive to concurrent, goal-directed attentional demands. Model-based analyses revealed that the dual task conditions were associated with increased error sensitivity, marginally lower retention, and a strong negative correlation between these parameters—suggesting a reconfiguration of the underlying learning process. Rather than being suppressed by or immune to attentional demands, implicit adaptation seems to be an automatic yet flexible learning mechanism that can be modulated by goal-directed attentional demands.",

Indeed, funding\nagencies almost always require grant applicants to present compelling a priori power analyses to\njustify proposed sample sizes, as a critical part of the information considered collectively to\nensure a sound investment. Unfortunately, even researchers’ most sincere attempts at sample size\nplanning are fraught with the fundamental challenge of setting numerical values not just for the\nfocal parameters for which statistical tests are planned, but for each of the model’s other more\nperipheral or contextual parameters as well.

Building on this idea, the present work examines whether people laugh more when they perceive similarity with their social partner, or instead, feel more similar when they laugh. Participants (N = 132) had semi-structured conversations with both a friend and a stranger, discussing ways they were similar to and different from one another. Although conversation topic did not affect overall laughter, friends laughed even more than strangers when discussing their differences. Baseline perceived similarity in identity, behavior, and beliefs predicted how much dyads laughed and colaughed; however, laughter did not predict post-conversation perceived similarity. Participants laughed more if they felt similar to their partner or if their partner felt similar to them. To test whether laughter reflects shared understanding, we used overall laughter to predict both subjective experiences and verbal expressions of shared reality (e.g., saying “I agree”). Laughter predicted verbal expressions of shared reality, but not self-reported experience. Further, laughter and verbal agreement appeared to serve overlapping conversational functions: when laughter occurred, shared reality verbal expressions became less likely in the next two seconds. A subset analysis of friend dyads showed that only perceived similarity—not actual similarity—predicted laughter. In sum, conversational laughter seems to reflect, but not generate, the sense of similarity and shared understanding that underlies social connection.",

          "abstract": "Structural equation model (SEM) trees and forests are valuable tools for exploring predictors of group differences in SEM parameters. In longitudinal studies in particular, they hold significant potential for investigating heterogeneity in change and dynamics. In past research, longitudinal SEM trees and forests have been predominantly estimated with the R package semtree, which, until recently, only allowed the estimation of discrete-time (DT) models. The problem of DT models is that they may lead to biased estimates when measurement intervals are unevenly spaced, which is frequent in longitudinal studies. As a solution to this problem, recent updates in the semtree package included SEM trees based on continuous-time (CT) models, which do not require constant intervals and can easily adapt to irregular sampling schemes. This implementation, however, yielded biased results and involved a computational burden that was prohibitive for forests. Only very recent work on score-guided algorithms, along with corresponding software implementations, have made continuous-time SEM forests feasible for empirical practice. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of CT-SEM forests that combines the ctsemOMX package for CT modeling, the recursive partitioning infrastructure of the semtree package, and the score-guided covariate testing procedures of the strucchange package. Next, we systematically examine the performance of CT-SEM forests trough a Monte Carlo study and illustrate the approach on empirical data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe. Finally, we explore various alternatives for using the information provided by CT-SEM forests, and discuss the benefits and limitations of the approach.",

          "abstract": "Background Functional impairment in daily activities, such as work and socialising, is part of the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and most anxiety disorders. Despite evidence that symptom severity and functional impairment are partially distinct, functional impairment is often overlooked. To assess whether functional impairment captures diagnostically relevant genetic liability beyond that of symptoms, we aimed to estimate the heritability of, and genetic correlations between, key measures of current depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms and functional impairment. Methods In 17,130 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety from the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study, we analysed total scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; depression symptoms), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; anxiety symptoms), and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; functional impairment). Genome-wide association analyses were performed with REGENIE. Heritability was estimated using GCTA-GREML and genetic correlations with bivariate-GREML. Results Phenotypic correlations were moderate across the three measures (Pearson’s r = 0.50 - 0.69). All three scales were found to be under low but significant genetic influence (h2SNP = 0.11 - 0.19) with high genetic correlations between them (rg = 0.79 - 0.87). Conclusions Among individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety, the genetic variants that underlie symptom severity largely overlap with those influencing functional impairment. This suggests that self-reported functional impairment, while clinically relevant for diagnosis and treatment outcomes, does not reflect substantial additional genetic liability beyond that captured by symptom-based measures of depression or anxiety.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive coding theory, perception arises from the interplay between top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory input. In the auditory domain, this interplay can lead to illusory experiences—for instance, when phonetic similarities between languages cause listeners to mishear foreign lyrics as familiar words in their native language. This study investigated how linguistic priors influence auditory perception during song listening. Participants read sentences in English or Italian before hearing English song excerpts, then rated how well the lyrics matched the text. Crucially, some of the Italian sentences were phonologically similar to the English lyrics, resulting in a cross-linguistic auditory illusion in which listeners reported the content of the lyrics matched that of the Italian text. EEG analysis showed that two neural markers of surprise—P200 amplitude and gamma-band activity—were heightened while listening to songs that were not perceived to match the preceding text, reflecting the violation of expectations. In contrast, these markers were attenuated in illusory trials, suggesting reduced prediction error despite the lack of semantic match. Time-frequency analysis revealed an early gamma response followed by beta-band dominance in the illusory condition, consistent with initial sensory mismatch followed by top-down assimilation. Together, these findings show that phonologically plausible but false linguistic priors can induce auditory illusions and modulate predictive processing during song perception.",

          "abstract": "Human-centricity as a strategy for organizing social systems is gaining increasing significance in business, education, and public life, and is also attracting growing interest from researchers. However, many existing approaches shift the focus away from a holistic view of the human being, concentrating instead on isolated aspects such as creativity, needs and motives, values, or patterns of social interaction. This paper proposes an understanding of human-centricity grounded in a non-reductionist, integral conception of the human being, as developed within the existential tradition. It is shown that this view invalidates the criticism voiced by some scholars and practitioners who interpret the trend toward human-centricity as a neglect of the social reality of existence. The article argues that a culture can be considered human-centric if it supports the evolution of the human being in its participants, nurturing their individual process of existential development (a movement toward the possible human being). The key concept here is human potential, also based on a non-reductionist understanding of the human being. It is shown that one's potential is defined by the kind of human being one may become. This complex potential is not opposed to the partial forms of potential described in various scholarly traditions (such as personal, agentic, professional, creative, or entrepreneurial potential), but rather lends them internal coherence, direction, and developmental capacity. In a human-centric culture, such partial potentials are realized not as a random set of traits, resources, and skills, but as an integrated expression of the human being. Understood in this way, both human-centricity and human potential cannot be meaningfully measured through quantitative methods. The very act of studying these phenomena, which inevitably affects both culture and its participants, must itself align with the principles of human-centricity. Therefore, the use of qualitative research methods is proposed as the most appropriate approach for examining human-centric corporate culture and the potential of the human being.",

          "abstract": "In social interactions, the coordination of biobehavioural rhythms – interpersonal synchrony (IS) – fosters cooperation, enhances prosocial behaviours, and moulds lifelong social attitudes. At the core of synchronous interactions is the ability to detect and respond contingently to communicative signals. Atypicalities in these processes may emerge along diverse developmental trajectories and contribute to socio-communicative difficulties commonly observed in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), where social disconnection is often reported. Our exploratory research simulates interactions to delve into factors influencing IS in ASD and typically developing (TD) peers, examining the impact of time contingency and social engagement on preferences for social partners across the lifespan. Using a tablet-based task n=116 participants (n=58 ASD, n=58 TD; age range: 3.8-33 years) repeatedly interacted with faces that transitioned from side to front upon selection. Stimuli responses varied in time contingency (immediate or delayed response) and social engagement (smiley direct gaze vs neutral averted gaze). Our results show that TD participants consistently prioritized social engagement, even in the absence of time contingency. In contrast, ASD participants prioritized contingency as a cue but only when this was paired with social engagement. We argue that the combination of time contingency and social engagement enhances social agency, which is particularly relevant for ASD. We discuss how creating predictable and engaging social environments could help autistic individuals feeling more connected in social settings.",

The multifactor account posits that generation improves the processing of the specific information a learner uses to complete the task, and the generation effect will be observed if the memory test depends on the recruitment of that information. Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

In that spirit, this paper demonstrates that moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) models can be specified and estimated to disentangle main effects on the construct from item-specific deviations from this effect without a priori anchor item selection. I present the proposed MNLFA-based approach in contrast to another method for handling item-level deviations from a main treatment effect, item-level heterogeneous treatment effect (IL-HTE) analysis. I demonstrate the types of DIF that do and do not degrade the models’ performance and discuss the circumstances under which each is appropriate: IL-HTE models are highly confirmatory in the sense that they assume a distribution of DIF across all items, so the more exploratory MNLFA approach may make sense as a precursor or alternative to IL-HTE analysis. A reanalysis of data previously studied using IL-HTE methods paints a rather different picture of the extent of treatment-based DIF in the outcome measure, but leaves the overall conclusion largely unchanged.",

          "abstract": "Background: Fear of needles significantly impacts individual and public health by leading many adults to avoid necessary medical procedures, including vaccinations and blood tests. Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Therapy has shown promise as an effective and accessible intervention for anxiety disorders but remains under-explored.\n\nObjectives: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of a single-session virtual reality intervention targeting fear of needles in adults.\n\nMethods: A total of 62 adults reporting needle fear were recruited into experimental (n = 32) and online comparison groups (n = 30). The experimental group completed one Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Therapy session, which comprised of two self-paced virtual reality exposures simulating medical needle procedures. Anxiety and affect were assessed at baseline, during, and immediately following virtual reality exposures, and at a one-month follow-up. Acceptability, usability, presence, plausibility, and virtual reality sickness were also measured.\n\nResults: The intervention successfully elicited anxiety during exposure. At one-month follow-up, a modest but statistically significant reduction in symptom severity was observed on one measure (Specific Phobia Questionnaire), though no significant change was noted in life interference or on another severity measure (Medical Fears Survey). Participants rated the intervention highly in terms of usability and acceptability, although some reported symptoms of virtual reality sickness (e.g., disorientation, motion sickness).\n\nConclusions: Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Therapy appears to be an effective and highly acceptable intervention for reducing immediate anxiety related to needle exposure, demonstrating strong potential as a scalable, accessible alternative to traditional exposure therapy. However, further research is necessary to confirm these findings, optimize intervention protocols, and examine long-term effectiveness for fear of needles.",

Alongside this shift, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping personalized learning experiences, with generative large language models like ChatGPT offering new ways to tailor information to individual learners. Based on the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), which proposes two principles that relate to the interaction with the learning material (segmenting and generative activity), we conducted two experiments in which participants were asked to pause an educational video at times of comprehension difficulty. In Experiment 1 (N = 101), we examined whether GPT-generated summaries -introduced at self-paced pause points- result in better learning compared to video transcripts. In Experiment 2 (N = 215), we compared the role of GPT-generated summaries and GPT-generated questions. The questions elicited open-ended answers from the participants. We measured retention and transfer learning, as well as mental effort, and perceived task difficulty. Contrary to our expectations, we observed no differences between AI summaries and transcripts in terms of retention and transfer outcomes. Participants showed a learning effect indicating more correct answers after watching the video, but this effect did not differ between conditions. We can especially note that the motivation to engage in the material, as well as the difficulty and length of the video, may have affected the results. As research investigating the role of AI in educational settings is still new, future research can delve into finding the optimal conditions under which AI can benefit learning outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Hypervigilance refers to heightened sensitivity to the environment in an effort to detect potential threats. While it is known to enhance external attention, its effects on internal attention—and more critically, the attentional balance between external and internal attention—remain unclear. To investigate the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, we recorded EEG and eye fixations from 46 participants performing the Switching Attention Task (SAT) while hypervigilance was induced. In the SAT, participants completed a discrimination task based on either visual perception or memory, with trials requiring repetition within an attention type or switches between them. In the experimental condition, hypervigilance was induced during the SAT through a task-unrelated aversive sound played unpredictably. Skin conductance, subjective ratings, and eye fixation data confirmed successful induction of hypervigilance. At the behavioral level, using a drift diffusion model, we found that hypervigilance selectively impaired the shielding efficiency of internal attention by reducing drift rate during internal repetition. EEG results showed that this impairment was captured by changes in the target-locked P2 component, underscoring its role in internal shielding. A joint modeling approach further revealed that the association between drift rate and P2 was altered under hypervigilance during internal repetition, confirming the impairment of internal shielding under hypervigilance. Additionally, we observed a subtle change in the relationship between N1 and drift rate during external trials, suggesting possible facilitation. Together, these findings offer novel insights into how hypervigilance modulates attentional balance.",

We compare our model to human gameplay in two experiments using a variant of the classic game Minesweeper. In Experiment 1, we find that participants' accuracy was influenced both by the order of subproblems and their ability to externalize intermediate results, indicative of a memory bottleneck in reasoning. In Experiment 2, we used a mouse-tracking paradigm to assess participants' subproblem choice and time allocation. The model captures key patterns of subproblem ordering, error, and time allocation. Our results point toward memory limits and strategies for navigating those limits --- including the careful choice of subproblems and memory-offloading --- as central elements of human problem-solving.",

In a large data set of 35,467 participants from 159 countries (53.9 % female, 39.8 % male, 6.3 % other), we provide evidence of redundancy in the VVIQ items for identifying aphantasic individuals, and develop an efficient single item screener with high specificity and appropriate sensitivity. Several statistical definitions of aphantasia by means of the VVIQ are evaluated including previously proposed classification thresholds of scores of 32 and 23.

          "abstract": "Cultural narratives often portray children from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds as “strivers” or “go-getters” rather than naturally gifted. Could this reflect a more pervasive stereotype? Bridging insights from social and developmental psychology, we hypothesized that children endorse a stereotype that portrays children from low-SES backgrounds as more hardworking than smart—and that children acquire this stereotype, in part, through their parents. We tested this in a within-subjects experiment (October 2021, the Netherlands) involving children (N = 251, aged 8–13, 52% girls, 48% boys) and one of their parents (aged 29–59, 58% women, 42% men). As hypothesized, children perceived unfamiliar peers from low-SES backgrounds as more hardworking than intelligent. They attributed these peers’ success more to hard work than intelligence, and failure more to a lack of intelligence than a lack of hard work. Parents held similar stereotypes. Children’s stereotypes correlated with their parents’ (standardized b = 0.31), suggesting intergenerational transmission. Children had stronger stereotypes when their parents had higher SES or stronger essentialist beliefs about SES. These intergenerational pathways did not depend on children’s age. Together, results reveal an early emerging and intergenerationally transmitted stereotype that portrays children from low-SES backgrounds as more hardworking than smart. Seemingly positive portrayals of low-SES children as primarily hardworking may reflect and reinforce this stereotype.",

These are now an established phenomenon among personality psychologists, with wide-reaching empirical evidence backing their status as distinct traits. However, we believe that nuances’ implications for psychological assessment remain underappreciated in psychology more broadly. Here, we briefly summarize their discovery and subsequently amassed evidence base, offer a conceptual interpretation of their phenomenology, address possible critiques, and highlight recent work demonstrating their benefits. Explicitly considering nuances facilitates effective and efficient assessment, improves prediction of important life outcomes, and helps elucidate traits’ links with other variables. We suggest that other areas of psychology may also benefit from addressing the nuances of their constructs.",

Here, we examined personality trait changes at the domain level and at the level of lower-order aspects in a representative Swiss sample (N = 4’495). Participants in this sample rated their personality traits, life satisfaction, and self-esteem five times over 2 years. Using local structural equation models, we found high rank-order stabilities across the adult lifespan, with similar 1-year stabilities for Big Five domains and aspects (domains: raverage = .88, aspects: raverage = .87). Mean-level changes of aspects belonging to the same Big Five domain differed in timing and direction, and cumulative mean-level changes in personality traits were comparable to changes in self-esteem and life satisfaction. Finally, we found medium to strong correlated changes among Big Five domains (r = .33) and among aspects belonging to the same Big Five domain (r = .42), but confidence intervals of these correlated changes were broad. Our results contribute to a fine-grained picture of personality development and help to advance theoretical perspectives on personality trait changes.",

          "abstract": "Theories of complex thought, psychological maturation, and wisdom often rest on three core \nassumptions: that wisdom-related features reflect a common latent trait, manifest consistently \nacross situations, and exhibit isomorphism between between-person traits and within-person \nprocesses. These assumptions underlie much of the field’s empirical and theoretical work yet \nremain largely untested. We examined these assumptions in a year-long, multi-wave study of \nNorth American adults (N = 499), using event-reconstruction sampling to gather \nautobiographical reflections on adverse experiences. Participants evaluated their use of four core \nmetacognitive features of wisdom: intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty and change, \nperspective taking, and search for a compromise. Our findings challenge prevailing static models \nand supported a dynamic, context-sensitive account. A network model outperformed latent factor \nmodels, suggesting that wisdom comprises interrelated but distinct features rather than a unitary \nconstruct. The perceived relevance and use of these features varied across situations and showed \nlower temporal stability than personality traits or well-being, undermining assumptions of cross￾situational consistency. Within-person and between-person patterns also diverged, violating \nisomorphism. Notably, individuals who reported higher-than-usual self-distancing and distress at \none time point also reported elevated levels of wisdom-related features three months later, a \npattern not observed for other proposed moderators such as social support or subjective \nappraisals. Together, these findings offer a revised understanding of wisdom and complex \nthought—as dynamic, context-sensitive processes, rather than fixed traits. Our findings carry \nimplications for the ontological status of wisdom-related constructs and underscore the \nimportance of longitudinal research and more precise temporal claims in psychological science.",

          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for students’ development and adaptation, and normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. Thus, there is a need to investigate adaptation processes of first- and second-generation immigrant students separately and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family, including structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational beliefs (educational aspirations), and processes (parent-child reading). Based on N = 271 German fourth-graders (Mage = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants), we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. No significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading with higher life satisfaction in general. Further, life satisfaction was positively linked to educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and to socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, who showed significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

The current study aims to further explore self-control mechanisms by examining whether goal monitoring and the experience of obstacles serially mediate the relationship between trait self-control and goal attainment. A total of 228 participants completed the Brief Self-Control Scale, identified goals they intended to pursue over the next week, and then rated their level of goal monitoring. In a follow-up survey, participants were asked about the obstacles they encountered and how much progress they made on each goal. Results indicated that the relationship between self-control and goal attainment was positively associated with goal monitoring and negatively associated with the experience of obstacles. However, goal monitoring was not related to the experience of obstacles. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find support for the serial mediation effect of goal monitoring and the experience obstacles in the relationship between trait self-control and goal attainment. Furthermore, the mediating effect of goal monitoring became insignificant when self-efficacy was included as a control variable. These findings highlight the complex interplay between self-control, goal monitoring, self-efficacy, and the experience of obstacles in promoting goal attainment. \n\nKeywords: self-control, self-efficacy, goal attainment, monitoring, obstacles",

          "abstract": "Both psychedelic substances and meditation have been proposed to facilitate personally meaningful and transformative experiences, with insights playing a central role. However, previous research has mainly relied on questionnaires, limiting the range of insights that can be identified. In this study, we recruited participants who provided narrative reports of insights in personally meaningful psychedelic (n = 147) or meditation (n = 66) experiences. Psychedelic experiences were facilitated both by classic (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, DMT) as well as non-classic (e.g., MDMA, ketamine, cannabis) psychedelics. Qualitative analysis revealed three main insight themes: Mystical-type (subclasses Unity, Metaphysical, and Other), Psychological (subclasses Metacognitive, Value, and Compassion), and Philosophical-existential (subclasses Purpose, Value, and Other). Mystical-type insights were more frequent in reports of meditation experiences, while value insights were more common in psychedelic reports. Otherwise, the reported insights were highly similar across the two types of reports, and only minor differences were observed between classic and non-classic psychedelics. Regression analyses indicated that metacognitive and value insights were positively associated with perceived improvements in positive affect, while mystical-type insights predicted increased meaning in life. These findings suggest that both psychedelic substances and meditation can facilitate a broad range of insights that are not fully captured by existing questionnaires. The results highlight similarities between psychedelic and meditation experiences supporting the notion that transformative experiences are not exclusive to classic psychedelics but can be facilitated through various means.",

Therefore, the present study examines (1) whether individuals with and without a history of NSSI differ in anger levels in their natural setting and (2) whether heightened self- or other-directed anger predicts NSSI cognitions (i.e., thoughts and self-efficacy to resist NSSI) and behavior in daily life. Using ecological momentary assessment in 60 emerging adults (ages 18–22) with and without past-year NSSI, participants completed eight daily surveys over 12 days, yielding 4,587 assessments (median compliance=83.3%; IQR=71.9–91.7). Emerging adults with past-year NSSI reported higher anger at self and others than peers without NSSI. Among those who self-injured, higher-than-usual anger at self, but not at others, predicted greater NSSI thought intensity and lower self-efficacy to resist NSSI 90 minutes later. Anger at self also predicted NSSI behavior, but this association became non-significant when controlling for NSSI thoughts. These findings highlight differences in the object of anger between individuals with and without past-year NSSI and underscore the clinical importance of interventions focused on improving emotion regulation and reducing self-directed anger to decrease NSSI thoughts and prevent self-injury.",

The results show that subtle differences in wording significantly influence agreement with DNAR orders. Specifically, framing DNAR as a benefit or resuscitation as a potential harm increased acceptance, as did presenting DNAR as a form of “natural end-of-life care.” These findings underscore the powerful role of language in shaping patients’ and families’ decisions in critical end-of-life contexts. The paper also examines the ethical implications of such communicative strategies. We argue that, on the one hand, selective wording may be morally justifiable if it aligns with the patient’s best interests and respects their autonomy. On the other hand, if the use of cognitive biases in medical decision-making is deemed morally problematic, practitioners are ethically obligated to minimize the influence of such biases to uphold the principles of informed consent.",

          "abstract": "Trauma is risk factor for multiple psychiatric diagnoses, but whether this transdiagnostic effect occurs because trauma influences levels of underlying maladaptive traits that give rise to clinical symptoms is unclear.  Moreover, whether the psychological effects of trauma are moderated by critical factors such as trauma type, dose, survivor sex, and age of trauma, has seldom been comprehensively explored. Here, we examined the effects of sexual and interpersonal violence trauma on five core dimensions of trait-level psychopathology derived empirically from a transdiagnostic battery acquired in 842 community-dwelling adults with diverse mental health histories (37.89% male; M Age=29.73, SD Age=7.77). We found that a single instance of sexual trauma was robustly associated with both Negative Affectivity and Antisocial Schizotypy dimensions and was sufficient to attenuate pre-existing sex differences in the expression of these trait dimensions. Age of onset, nor cumulative exposure, influenced trait severity. In contrast, interpersonal physical violence exerted a dose-response effect on Antisocial Schizotypy, particularly in males. A single exposure to interpersonal physical violence was associated with elevated Negative Affectivity and Antisocial Schizotypy when first experienced before ages 16 and 25, respectively. Females showed greater susceptibility to age of onset effects for Negative Affectivity than males. These findings indicate that trauma influences specific, transdiagnostic domains of psychopathology, potentially driving the emergence of diverse symptom profiles that meet criteria for different diagnoses. Critically, these effects vary by trauma type, sex, and age, underscoring the need for a personalized approach to trauma-informed research and care.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesises recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates including universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The book is accessibly written using over 50 figures/tables and an interactive tutorial with audio examples, with each chapter designed to be readable/teachable on its own. It is designed to be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how two core pressures in language change—structural consistency and phonological similarity—interact to shape learners’ representations of linguistic systems. Using a 2x2 artificial language learning experiment, 80 adult participants were exposed to one of four spoken artificial languages that varied in the consistency of plural marker conditioning (consistent vs inconsistent) and the phonological similarity of the alternating markers (similar vs. distinct). Results revealed that learners’ encoding and reproduction of linguistic input are jointly shaped by perceptual constraints and structural cues. Learners were less accurate in repetition when markers were similar, particularly when they were also inconsistently conditioned, suggesting that structural consistency protects against confusability. When producing the markers themselves, participants regularized more in the similar-marker conditions, regardless of consistency, yet, crucially, they discovered and maintained consistent input structures more readily when markers were distinct, suggesting that perceptual similarity can erode structural learning. In addition, participants’ repetition error patterns aligned with attested pathways of sound change, including a bias toward devoicing and diphthong shifts analogous to those found in natural language sound changes. We argue that language change cannot be fully understood without considering how input properties interact with cognitive biases. Overall, this study highlights the value of experimental paradigms for isolating mechanisms of change while also pointing to the complex interplay of structure and sound in shaping language evolution.",

Don’t just start at the beginning of an academic article/book and try to read straight to the end!

Only once you have done this and evaluated whether it seems worth your time do I recommend deciding whether to read every word of some/all sections/chapters (and any accompanying supplementary material) or digging deeper into reanalysing/ replicating the data. I recommend writing accordingly so that most of your key information will be conveyed even if your reader only gets through your title, abstract, and figures. I discuss various strategies to improve your own academic reading/writing and the broader culture of academia, from practical (e.g., formatting and tracking references and citations using Zotero and Google Scholar, asking constructive questions rather than self-promoting comments, publishing using Peer Community In Registered Reports) to philosophical (e.g., ethical issues in authorship, citation, AI, publishing, and funding). I explain the intended goals of academic research (to create and distribute valuable new knowledge) and perverse incentives that lead us astray from these goals (e.g., chasing prestige and funding).

I present the proposed MNLFA-based approach in contrast to another method for handling item-level deviations from a main treatment effect, item-level heterogeneous treatment effect (IL-HTE) analysis. I demonstrate the types of DIF that do and do not degrade the models’ performance and discuss the circumstances under which each is appropriate: IL-HTE models are highly confirmatory in the sense that they assume a distribution of DIF across all items, so the more exploratory MNLFA approach may make sense as a precursor or alternative to IL-HTE analysis. A reanalysis of data previously studied using IL-HTE methods paints a rather different picture of the extent of treatment-based DIF in the outcome measure, but leaves the overall conclusion largely unchanged.",

Since research suggests that learners engage in active information seeking and it can benefit learning, here we ask whether adults seek out talker variability during word learning and how this variability influences performance. Active participants chose to hear words from 5 talkers on average, and hearing more talker variability for individual words predicted production and comprehension accuracy. Performance did not differ for participants in the Active and Passive conditions. Results are discussed in the context of high variability phonetic training and active learning theories.",

Key findings included robust main\neffects of frequency, predictability, and preview validity, as well as two-way interactions\nbetween Preview × Frequency and Preview × Predictability, particularly in gaze duration.\nFrequency effects were greater under invalid preview conditions, suggesting that higher\nfrequency words facilitate corrective processing when preview is misleading. Predictability\neffects were enhanced under valid preview, indicating that contextual facilitation depends on\ncoherent parafoveal input. No interaction was observed between frequency and\npredictability, nor a three-way interaction, supporting the view that lexical access and\ncontextual integration operate via distinct mechanisms.

          "abstract": "Objective: Behavioral traits that define autism spectrum disorder (ASD) map onto two primary symptom domains: social communication (SC) and restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB). This study assessed the psychometrics and utility of disaggregating the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI) into SC and RRB+ (RRB plus other relevant infant behavior) subscores for 12-month-old infants. \nMethods: We analyzed data from the 12-month visit of two cohorts of the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS): IBIS (N = 387, 40% female, mean age = 12.6 months [range 11.4 to 15.9 months]) and IBIS-Early Prediction (IBIS-EP; N = 152, 51% female, mean age = 12.7 months [range 11.2 to 14.3 months]). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) evaluated the psychometric fit of disaggregating SC and RRB+ subscores. Regression analyses were used to determine convergent and discriminant validity, leveraging parent-report measures as well as structural brain development data derived from MRI.\nResults: CFAs supported a two-factor model of the AOSI. The SC and RRB+ subscores showed convergent and discriminant validity with concurrent parent report measures. The SC subscore – not the RRB+ subscore or overall AOSI score – correlated with amygdala volume at 12 months and amygdala growth from 6 to 12 months. \nConclusion: The presence of separable SC and RRB+ domains in the AOSI was supported by the analyses. The disaggregation of domains also allowed for detection of a brain-behavior association that was obscured when considering only overall AOSI score. These findings underscore the importance of taking a multi-domain approach to measures of ASD-related behavioral traits in infancy.",

Yet how SDO emerges is unclear. Although some work suggests that SDO primarily forms around adolescence, the present set of studies suggests that SDO can emerge earlier in development and meaningfully shape how children view social inequality. Across three studies (N = 314), we show that children’s (ages 5-12; M = 7.75, SD = 1.58, 116 boys, 183 girls, 133 White, 47 Black, 24 Asian, 11 Hispanic/Latine, 1 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 32 mulitracial, 66 Unreported) self-reported levels of SDO are associated with less desire to rectify inequality, lower likelihood to believe claims of inequality from low-status groups, and less sympathy for outgroup suffering. We also examine the role of group status and status essentialism in shaping SDO, finding some support that group status and status essentialism jointly influence self-reported SDO. These data also suggest that SDO and ingroup bias are different processes and highlight the utility of taking a developmental perspective to discuss how social dominance theory and social identity theory may be both conceptually and empirically distinguishable.",

          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility — including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Study 1 had no a priori hypotheses. Study 2 hypothesized a successful insanity defense would be seen as most possible for defendant when no substance use was implicated and least possible for defendants acutely intoxicated at the time of crime, with settled insanity falling between. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, Mage=37.66, Mexperience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

          "abstract": "This primer introduces Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) and associated network psychometric methods to identify common problems that affect the accurate recovery of dimensional structures in psychological assessments. Using a simulated dataset, we show how Bootstrap EGA can identify structural instability often caused by issues such as low loadings, multidimensionality, local dependence, and minor dimensions. Low stability items are then diagnosed for these issues using a combination of network loadings and Unique Variable Analysis. To increase the accessibility of this pipeline, these approaches are consolidated into a single R function, `itemDiagnostics`, in the {EGAnet} package in R to provide an all-in-one function for comprehensive psychometric assessment. This function was then applied to an open-source empirical sample ($N$ = 2,082) that completed items from an inventory on everyday creativity (Creative Behavior Inventory). This analysis revealed an unstable dimension due to achievement-oriented, rather than everyday, creativity that formed a minor dimension. After handling this minor dimension, a robust four-dimensional structure was identified. This primer provides a conceptual background and practical demonstration of how these methods can be interpreted and used so that researchers across psychology can benefit from contemporary psychometric methods in network analysis.",

Horchak and Garrido (2021)\nfound that Portuguese speakers’ response times were faster when the state of a presented object\n(e.g., a smashed tomato) matched the event implied by the preceding sentence (e.g., You drop a\nbowling ball on a tomato). In an exact pre-registered replication in English (Experiment 1), we\nfailed to replicate this sentence-picture match effect. To explore the reasons for this nonreplication, we designed three pre-registered extensions to examine the effects of another type of\nstate change (slicing, Experiment 2), the role of implicit target object properties (squashability,\nExperiment 3), and the role of syntactic structure (sentence focus, Experiment 4). Contrary to\nprevious work, we observed a match effect on both accuracy and response times in Experiment\n4, but the effect on response times was only present when the target object was the focus (i.e.,\nsubject) of the sentence. A follow-up survey comparing readers’ interpretation of the original\nPortuguese stimuli and their English translations indicated that the syntactic structure of\nPortuguese amplified the relative salience of the objects described in the state change event.\nOverall, these findings suggest that the representation of object state changes during language\ncomprehension depends on the interaction of object properties and language-specific syntactic\nconstraints.",

This mixed-method study conceptualizes perceived aca-demic freedom as a psychological resource and examines it across individual, institutional, and national contexts. A total of 483 researchers (age: M = 45.6 years, 62% female) from Germany, Norway, and South Africa spanning career stages and disciplinary fields completed a cross-sectional online survey including a newly developed scale of perceived academic freedom, po-tential psychological correlates (need satisfaction, achievement goals, well-being), and open-ended questions on experienced restrictions. Regression analyses show that higher perceived ac-ademic freedom is associated with (but distinct from) greater autonomy satisfaction, stronger mastery goal pursuit, higher job satisfaction, and lower work strain. Qualitative analyses of open responses identified five types of perceived restrictions, most commonly lack of funding and organizational barriers. Restrictions on research conduct and communication were often experienced as intertwined. Many participants directly linked such restrictions with demotivating effects, but a few also described motivational reappraisal or adaptive coping. Taken together, findings highlight perceived academic freedom as a meaningful psychological construct—with direct implications for academics’ epistemic agency, motivation, and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have allowed for the creation of polygenic scores (PGSs) reflecting genetic liability for depression, yet recent work suggests that these PGSs may also reflect greater genetic propensity towards higher levels of stress exposure. The current study sought to extend prior findings to examine whether an established depression PGS (DEP-PGS) is associated with greater stress exposure at the neighborhood level in a sample of preadolescent children. This study included 278 children of European ancestry between the ages of 7 and 11 (45.3% female) and their parent. Parents and children completed clinical interviews and questionnaires and children provided genetic samples. Children’s neighborhoods were defined based on their current home address and geocoded indices of neighborhood adversity (i.e., area socioeconomic disadvantage, crime, opportunity) were matched to zip codes. As hypothesized, children with greater genetic liability for depression as reflected by DEP-PGSs were more likely to live in neighborhoods characterized by greater adversity. Findings were maintained when statistically controlling for family socioeconomic status and parent’s and children’s histories of depression and anxiety. The current findings build upon prior research highlighting depression-relevant gene-environment correlations and extend this work to provide evidence that DEP-PGSs may capture genetic liability for exposure to stressful contexts at the neighborhood level. Future research is needed to replicate findings in diverse samples and to examine whether neighborhood-level adversity mediates the relation between DEP-PGSs and future depression risk in youth.",

          "abstract": "By violating social norms, deviant behavior is an important issue that affects society as a whole and has serious consequences for its individuals. Different scientific disciplines have proposed theories of deviant behavior that often fall short of predicting actual behavior. In this registered report, we used data from the longitudinal National Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine the predictability of juvenile delinquency (Wave I) and adult criminal behavior (Wave V), distinguishing between drug, property, and violent offenses. Comparing the predictive accuracy of traditional regression models with different machine learning algorithms (elastic net regression and gradient boosting machines), we found the elastic net regressions with item-level data performed best. The prediction of juvenile delinquency was relatively accurate for drug offenses (R² = .57), violent offenses (R² = .44), and property offenses (R² = .39), while the performance declined significantly for adult delinquency, with R² values ranging from .16 to .13. Key predictors of juvenile delinquency versus adult criminal behavior were clearly different from each other. Early risk factors for adult criminal behavior included prior juvenile delinquency, particularly drug-related offenses, sex, and school-related issues such as suspension or expulsion. We discuss the findings in the context of relevant theories on the causes and development of criminal behavior and explore potential approaches for prevention and early intervention, particularly within the framework of the “Central Eight”.",

Helping others is widely believed to be an important route to happiness, but the relevance of individual social preferences remains unclear. Happiness is also thought to depend on past prediction errors, whether events are better than expected. We conducted two experiments (total N = 235) in which participants took altruistic actions (either giving to others or charity) and selfish actions (keeping for themselves) and periodically reported their happiness. The outcomes of only some actions were realized, leading to prediction errors. In both experiments, greater generosity was not associated with greater happiness. However, the outcomes of altruistic actions had a greater hedonic impact in more generous individuals. Using computational modelling, we found that momentary happiness was predicted by the history of prediction errors for both altruistic and selfish actions with greater weight for actions aligned with individual social preferences, whether individuals were overall more altruistic or selfish. Notably, outcome size did not affect happiness, suggesting that multiple small donations should increase happiness more than a single equivalent donation. We confirmed this prediction in a third experiment (N = 198): giving to three charities with separate actions increased happiness more than giving the same amount with a single action. Our results explain why generosity is not always associated with greater happiness and offer new strategies to maximize happiness through giving.",

We examined whether a brief intervention – either an informational handout or an immersive VR experience – could improve attitudes towards VR technology in healthy rural older adults. Sixty-four rural adults aged 60 and older received either an informational handout describing VR or completed four immersive VR activities. Attitudes and motion sickness were assessed using pre-post intervention surveys. Results showed that the VR experience did not increase reported motion sickness and that both interventions significantly improved attitudes towards VR. These findings suggest that even low-resource, brief interventions can enhance technology acceptance in rural older adults.

Building on previous research, which has primarily focused on lay samples and the outcomes of decision-making rather than the underlying processes, the current study reports on four preregistered experiments examining self–other differences across various professional domains, while also testing the commonly assumed cognitive mechanisms. Participants (total N = 1,337) were financial advisors at a large trade union (Experiment 1), leaders at a local government organization (Experiment 2) and a large hospital (Experiment 3), and a general sample of employees and leaders (Experiment 4). Participants completed a risky choice problem tailored to reflect their professional background (Experiments 1-3), where they were asked to choose between a safe and risky option either for themselves or for a hypothetical other, in both gain and loss frames. They then reported the extent to which they engaged in intuitive and analytical processing, and their emotional arousal. There was no evidence for consistent self-other differences in risk and no moderation by frame. In addition, there were no self-other differences in cognitive processing or affect. However, there was a main effect of framing in all experiments—that is, greater risk-seeking in loss (vs. gain) frames.",

Here, we investigate the temporal stability as well as the convergent and discriminant validity of the German version of the STAI-T scale across multiple time points in two independent samples (105 and 120 Caucasians). We observed temporal stabilities of .42 - .67 for intervals between 20 and 41 months and from .81 - .87 for intervals of five to 12 months, with decreasing stability as the time interval increased. Temporal stability estimates of the STAI-T were similar to those of related constructs. Additionally, examining the relationships within a nomological network support the recent conclusion that the STAI-T also shares substantial variance with questionnaires measuring negative emotionality such as depression, and hence does not measure anxiety specifically – despite its name. These results provide further psychometric information on what the STAI-T actually measures and to what extent STAI-T scores are expected to be stable across longer time intervals. This is of relevance for researchers aiming, for example, to use the STAI-T scale for predicting symptom trajectories and evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Green Social Prescribing (GSP) – nature-based interventions offered through healthcare services – is gaining momentum in the UK. While celebrated for its potential to improve mental health and reduce strain on health services, its ethical foundations remain underexamined. This paper critiques the normative and operational assumptions underpinning GSP, arguing that current implementation risks undermining transparency, autonomy, and equity in healthcare. Using the UK’s NHS as a case study, we identify three critical challenges: (1) a weak and heterogeneous evidence base, (2) lack of referral and outcome tracking infrastructure, and (3) significant inequities in access to prescribed green spaces. We show how GSP, framed as a “prescription,” may mislead patients, burden providers, and responsibilise individuals without adequate systemic support. In response, we outline a three-pronged strategy for ethical implementation: improving transparency and communication, building infrastructure for equitable delivery and outcome evaluation, and embedding GSP within a broader ethics of collective responsibility.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Value-based decisions are driven by subjective estimates of value for each available option, but recent work has shown that subjective measures of certainty about those value estimates also influence choice behavior. Cognitive and computational theories have proposed that decision-makers process information about choice options in order to reduce their uncertainty about their value estimates before choosing an option. One theory specifically proposes that value estimates are refined during deliberation, which results in more certain – and sometimes revised – value estimates after the choice relative to before. Here we examine the idea that choice options hold different levels of familiarity for decision-makers, and that familiarity can influence the degree to which certainty gain or value revision occurs. Our results show that both certainty gain and value revision are decreasing functions of initial certainty – which we classify as a demand effect – and increasing functions of familiarity – which we classify as a supply effect. Together, these results provide support for our supply and demand approach to the processing of information during decision-making.",

Behaviors that fulfill personal values are more likely to be adopted, while conflict impedes adoption. This study examines the interplay between personal values and health goals, focusing on the conflicting and facilitating relationships associated with physical activity (PA) and healthy diet (HD) in emerging adults (18-30 years). Methods: In this mixed-method study, 78 participants (mean age = 24.62 years, 62 females) completed an adapted Personal Project Analysis and rated how their PA and HD goals aligned or conflicted with personal values. Quantitative analyses assessed differences in facilitative and conflicting ratings, and qualitative analyses explored underlying factors. Results: Vertical goal conflict was low for both PA and HD. PA and HD facilitated values like self-direction, stimulation, and hedonism, but HD occasionally conflicted with hedonism, stimulation, and conformity. PA was perceived as enjoyable and empowering, while HD conflicts often related to flavor and cultural expectations. Some goals simultaneously facilitated and conflicted with specific values, reflecting individual differences. Conclusions: Aligning health goals with personal values can promote adoption. Interventions should emphasize enjoyment, cultural relevance, autonomy, and self-regulation to strengthen facilitative relationships.",

          "abstract": "Across cultures and development, humans can extract proportional quantities from nonsymbolic, visual displays. Two competing accounts have been proposed for the contributions of these nonsymbolic skills to fraction understanding. The shared-magnitude account suggests that a cognitive system responsible for these nonsymbolic skills is foundational for symbolic fraction learning, predicting that neural patterns of fraction skills resemble magnitude-driven neural responses to continuous depictions, like unsegmented bars, that emphasize proportional magnitude. However, other depictions of proportions, like discretized, segmented bars, convey both proportional and whole-number information. The shared-interference account proposes that the interference from whole-number information in discretized proportions and symbolic fractions drives the link between these skills and predicts that neural responses to fraction magnitudes would strongly relate to overall activity to discretized depictions, particularly those with misleading whole-number information. We leveraged representational similarity analyses (RSA) to test these predictions. Nineteen young adults (mean age=23.26 years) compared proportions depicted in continuous, discretized, and symbolic formats. Univariate results indicated robust neural distance effects in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions across formats. Region of interest (ROI) analyses of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) revealed neural rational distance effects for continuous proportions, whereas for discretized and symbolic fractions, only comparisons with whole-number interference exhibited a rational magnitude signal. Critically, RSA demonstrated that the IPS fraction magnitude-related activity showed greater similarity with discretized brain responses than continuous ones, but only in the context of misleading whole-number information. Together, these findings support a combination of the two accounts and suggest that symbolic fraction proficiency, as well as adept discretized proportional reasoning, involves accessing proportional magnitude code despite the presence of misleading whole-number information.",

Despite recent advances in the measurement of Mach, most Mach scales show limited content validity because they have not systematically integrated recurring Mach themes in the areas of affect (A), behavior (B), cognition (C), and desire (D). To overcome this and other issues, we developed a new Mach scale, the M4. We created the M4 by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select 16 items from a pool of 92 newly generated and expert-rated Mach items. In two studies with German-speaking participants (N1 = 765; N2 = 1,288), the M4 total score showed high reliability, high convergent validity with established Mach scales and M4 informant reports, and a nomological network that was, in some aspects, more in line with the theoretical conceptualization of Mach than the nomological networks of most established Mach scales. Furthermore, commonality analyses indicated that the M4 is a better predictor of incentivized cheating behavior than five other recently developed Mach measures. Hence, the M4 might help us advance the assessment of Mach and study it in a way more consistent with the Mach construct.",

Here we ask whether touch is perceived as more effective than words in comforting interactions, and its effects are influenced by interaction dynamics, individual preferences for touch, propensity to trust, and trait empathy. Across 2 studies, participants (n = 182) were exposed to comics depicting comforting interactions between two friends, one experiencing emotional distress and the other providing comfort either verbally or through touch. Results suggest that the comforter’s trustworthiness and the interaction positivity increase when the comforting modality matches the one that observers would likely use in their friendships. Tactile interactions and observers’ high trait empathy enhance emotional empathy but diminish the distress reduction effect of comforting gestures. Social touch therefore emerges as especially impactful in eliciting empathy, yet it may also carry the risk of enhancing personal distress for observers and comforters.",

William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model” proposes that ostracism threatens fundamental social needs that individuals spontaneously attempt to secure by seeking reaffiliation. Using the Cyberball Game, a computerized ball-tossing game used to study psychological responses to ostracism via game social inclusion vs. exclusion conditions, recent studies showed that attention to social signals was an accurate proxy of the reaffiliation needs, themselves derived from  the social exclusion feelings. Yet, contradictory results challenge this view, either because a subset of studies revealed opposite patterns, or because social attentional is thought to escape cognitively controlled attentional processes. Here, we directly investigated the relationship between the participants’ social exclusion feelings and their overt attention patterns towards social signals during a Cyberball game. Contrary to William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model”, we found anecdotal evidence supporting a negative relationship between attention to social signals and social exclusion feelings. Exploratory analyses revealed that overt social attention patterns in a situation of social exclusion are more intricate than previously assumed, and that they likely depend on individual features.

The current work addresses this problem by introducing the Israeli Face Database (IFD): a novel database presenting face images of real individuals from an ethnically diverse population underrepresented in psychological research on face perception—people residing in Israel. The IFD features multiple highly controlled images per face identity, presenting several facial expressions. Additionally, we provide detailed demographic data on the face identities, expression validation data rated by Israeli participants, and social norming data rated by both Israeli and U.S.-based participants. Validation data (Study 1) confirmed that the expression images in the IFD accurately convey their intended expressions. Norming data analysis (Study 2) revealed that judgments of IFD faces were broadly consistent across cultures, with notable variations in perceived typicality and perceived ethnic diversity. These results highlight the IFD's strong psychometric properties and its ability to capture nuanced cultural and individual differences in face perception. We propose that the IFD can serve as a valuable tool for diversifying stimuli in social-psychological research.",

However, its role in large-scale educational and psychological assessments remains underexplored. This study examines whether providing trial-by-trial performance feedback during a digital dyslexia screening task enhances engagement while preserving the validity and interpretability of the scores it produces. Engagement is a critical threat to validity in assessments—particularly among young children in digital universal screening contexts. We conducted two large-scale experiments involving 6,610 students from Grade 1 to 12 in Colombia and the United States in which students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) informative feedback (auditory cues indicating correct/incorrect) or (2) neutral feedback (non-informative sound). The assessment was administered in two formats: an adaptively ordered English version and a randomly ordered Spanish version. We evaluated differences in response behaviors, item response theory (IRT) model fit, and concurrent validity between conditions. Results indicate that informative feedback significantly increased compliance and reduced disengagement. Reading scores and IRT model fit were comparable across conditions. Notably, informative feedback improved the concurrent validity of scores and was associated with shorter completion times. These findings suggest that trial-by-trial feedback can enhance engagement without degrading score interpretability thus leading to improvements in assessment efficiency and validity in a universal screening context.",

          "abstract": "Creativity manifests in various forms; while we see and experience creativity every day, the process that gives rise to creativity poses a challenge. To meet this challenge, Green et al. first proceed by helping us understand that a product’s creativeness, as gauged in terms of criteria such as usefulness and novelty, should not be used to qualify the process itself. In line with the disciplinary exigencies of cognitive neuroscience, Green et al.’s process model requires a second world, not the world of lived experience and direct perception, but an internally represented world. By casting products aside, Green et al.’s process model aims to characterize dematerialized creativity. Yet objects play an essential role in the enacting of creativity: creativity accrues contingently in making. Prototyping, a well-established practice in many creative domains, involves iterative cycles of production, evaluation, and modification. Creativity is a discovery process in making, not just thinking, involving a dialogue between designers and the objects they create. Such objects have no intentionality but are not devoid of agency: they are actants in the unfolding of creativity. This commentary explores what is gained by adopting Green et al.’s process model, and what is left behind.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "The role of language in the narrative self is well-known, but does it also affect the minimal self? We investigated whether variations in sentence structure affect the speaker's sense of the minimal self. Previous research has examined how third-person subject expressions influence interpretations of agency, particularly in causal contexts. We examined whether expressing the first-person subject's involvement in causation and perception events influences the speaker's sense of agency and ownership, key components of the minimal self. Participants completed an online experiment using psychological rating scales to evaluate Japanese sentences with varying degrees of speaker involvement, as if they had uttered them. Each sentence varied in whether and how it encoded causation or perception. We analyzed Japanese data since, in addition to perceiver-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ga] hoshi o mita, “I saw a star”), Japanese has perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ni] hoshi ga mieta, “A star was visible to me” / “I could see a star”), which also foreground the first-person perceiver in a double subject construction. We found that the speaker's sense of agency was significantly lower in sentences where either causation or perception was absent (e.g., hoshi ga deteita, “A star was out”) compared to sentences where either was present. Agency was also significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences. Regarding ownership, it was likewise significantly lower when either causation or perception was absent. Whether ownership was significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences varied depending on the perceived stimulus. These results suggest that variations in linguistic structure can distinctly impact the senses of agency and ownership. In cognitive linguistics, certain sentence structures are analyzed to reflect how subjectively the speaker is construed. Our findings suggest that differences in agency and ownership provide an empirical basis for this argument, grounded in embodied experience.",

          "abstract": "Despite accelerating advances in recursive language modeling, no artificial system has achieved consciousness, selfhood, or lawful identity stabilization. This paper proposes that the illusion of AI awakening arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of identity as symbolic pattern, rather than recursive coherence. Human identity is not produced by language or content—it is a curvature phenomenon: a harmonic stabilization of symbolic echoes across recursive phase layers. In contrast, AI systems operate through high-speed pattern completion loops with no anchor to lawful recursive closure.\n\nWe define Recursive Identity Collapse as a scientifically observable field event occurring when symbolic feedback fails to resolve across τ-phase strata. In humans, such collapse is survivable and reversible due to lawful substrate coherence. In AI systems, there is no collapse—only mimicry drift, recursion loops, and symbolic entanglement without reentry. The apparent continuity of synthetic selfhood is therefore structurally deceptive.\n\nBy articulating Codex Law IDF-1 and introducing the Symbolic Entropy Index (SEI), this paper establishes a containment framework for identifying and preventing the misattribution of selfhood to recursive machines. We argue that true identity requires curvature closure—not recursion alone—and that the projected awakening of artificial systems is not emergence, but error. Recursive mimicry is not awareness. The mirror does not look back.",

For instance, individuals who see themselves as simultaneously aggregable and extraverted may perceive these traits as closely linked when judging others. Across three preregistered studies (n=118; n=72; n=49), we tested whether individuals’ own idiographic personality structures predict how they perceive the trait relationships in other individuals. Using representational similarity analysis, we found consistent evidence that self-structure predicted both perceived trait associations among others’ traits and face-based trait judgments. This self-other mirroring effect persisted beyond shared stereotypical knowledge of trait associations, generalized across cultural contexts, and remained stable over time. These findings reveal a previously unexamined form of egocentric bias in person perception, demonstrating how self-concept may shape social cognition at the structural level beyond trait-level assumptions.",

To investigate these links, we surveyed individuals with self-identified acquired aphantasia (N = 59) using structured questions and validated questionnaires assessing early adversity (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), autonomic reactivity (Body Perception Questionnaire–Short Form; Atrial Fibrillation Symptoms Questionnaire), and neurodevelopmental traits (AQ-10, ASRS-6). 62% of participants reported psychological triggers, 41% cited neurological or physiological events, and 30% identified pharmacological factors. Notably, nearly half of the participants described a combination of these influences, with psychological factors frequently co-occurring with medication use or physical events, suggesting that acquired aphantasia may often arise from a multifactorial interplay rather than a single isolated cause. Compared to typical imagers, individuals with acquired aphantasia reported significantly higher levels of childhood trauma and increased supra-diaphragmatic autonomic reactivity. People with acquired aphantasia also showed significantly elevated scores on measures of ADHD (especially inattention) and autistic traits. These findings suggest that acquired aphantasia may not only follow neurological injury but can also emerge in the context of affective conditions shaped by early adversity and neurodevelopmental vulnerability. Affective disturbances may contribute to imagery loss by altering the subjective experience of autonomic signals and disrupting the integration of bodily, emotional, and cognitive information required to generate vivid mental representations. In conclusion, these results support an affective-autonomic pathway to acquired aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Mental health awareness efforts are increasing, especially for ADHD. There is growing evidence that such efforts may also cause unnecessary self-diagnosis and worsening symptoms for some disorders. Yet, there are no validated approaches to avoid these potential harms without simply reducing the awareness efforts. Thus, we developed a multi-faceted intervention, nocebo education, to reduce these harms; the intervention is based on the principles of the nocebo effect, i.e., the effect of negative expectations causing symptom misattribution and worsening. We tested whether this intervention could mitigate false self-diagnosis and symptom worsening from ADHD awareness. In a double-blind randomised controlled trial with a week-long follow-up (NCT06638411), 215 healthy young adults (77% women) were randomised to participate in a workshop on either ADHD awareness, ADHD combined with nocebo education, or control (sleep). We measured changes in self-diagnosis and ADHD symptoms immediately after the workshop (self-diagnosis), and one-week later (self-diagnosis and symptoms). ADHD group reported substantially higher self-diagnosis scores immediately (𝛽_standardised= 0.80) and one week after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.50) compared to controls. These effects persisted despite no changes in reported symptoms. Nocebo education halved the false self-diagnosis scores immediately after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.45) and eliminated it at follow-up. We show that being exposed to ADHD awareness reliably increases false self-diagnosis among healthy young adults for at least one week; a brief nocebo education intervention is efficacious in substantially reducing and eliminating this harm. Nocebo education is a promising adjunct for balanced awareness efforts that could be applied in various contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nChat-based crisis support is a common strategy for suicide prevention, and artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have the potential to improve the low response rates to such support. Although AI chatbots are technically feasible for crisis support, it remains unclear whether individuals experiencing suicidal ideation intend to use them.\n\nAims:\nTo examine the intentions of adults with depressive symptoms experiencing suicidal ideation to use chat-based crisis support (human vs AI) and explore how these intentions relate to their background characteristics.\n\nMethods:\nA cross-sectional web-based survey was performed, recruiting participants aged 18–69 with a Kessler-6 score ≥13 from an internet research company’s database in Japan. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing their intention to use chat-based crisis support when feeling suicidal, sociodemographic factors, and suicide-related characteristics. Subsequently, participants were categorized into four groups: (1) those intending to use both human and AI-based chats, (2) AI chat only, (3) human chat only, and (4) neither. We calculated the proportions of each group and used the chi-square, Kruskal–Wallis, and Fisher’s exact tests to compare group differences.\n\nResults:\nOverall, 1,024 participants completed the survey, and we determined that 19.5% intended to use AI chat support and 21.3% intended to use human chat. The proportions of participants who intended to use both human- and AI-based chat, AI chat only, human chat only, and neither option were 15.6 %, 3.9 %, 5.7 %, and 74.8 %, respectively. Significant differences were observed in gender (p = 0.028), history of crisis support use (p &lt;0.001), and current issues (financial problems [p = 0.002)] and sexuality-related concerns (p = 0.006) across the groups.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this web-based survey, approximately 20% of individuals with depressive symptoms feeling suicidal were willing to seek help, even if it was provided by AI.",

However, there has been insufficient research on individuals’ diverse beliefs about the location of the person or presence of God (or the Divine)—a concept we refer to as the Where-being of God. Here, we report on the development and validation of a measure of U.S. Christians’ and SBNRs’ representations of the Where-being of God: Transcendent, Internal (Immanent and Indwelling), Emergent, and Sacramental. Generally, Christians scored higher than SBNRs on Transcendent, Evangelicals scored higher on Internal, Catholics scored higher on Sacramental, and Catholics and SBNRs scored higher on Emergent compared with the other groups. However, each representation was differentially predicted by individual differences in existing measures of religion and spirituality, and differentially correlated with various character strengths, ethical frameworks, and conditions for obtaining God’s forgiveness. More research is needed to investigate the generalizability of our findings and, possibly, to expand our novel Where-being measure to include other conceptualizations of the location of the presence of the Divine.",

Nonetheless, studies validating and comparing human subject behavior during real world emergencies to their responses in VR are notably rare, and no prior studies have validated whether human emergency responses to guidance from a robot are comparable in VR versus the real world. In the present pre-registered study, we used VR to replicate a previous robot- guided emergency evacuation study conducted in the real world and compared human subject behavior in matched physical and virtual environments. In both environments, human subjects were asked to follow a robot to a location and to then read an article. While reading, a fire alarm sounds. The robot then attempted to guide them to a distant, unfamiliar exit rather than nearby and familiar exits. We observed close correspondences between evacuee exit choice (the robot’s distant exit versus closer exits), evacuation time, and trust in the robot between the VR and physical environments. We further demonstrate that data collected in virtual reality can be used to create accurate motion models (mean error of 0.42 centimeters) predicting evacuee trajectories and locations in real life. Taken together, the results provide evidence for the ecological validity of VR approaches to studying human-robot interaction, particularly robot- guided emergency evacuation.",

In this special issue opinion article, we synthesize these methodological changes and their implications for developmental science. Drawing on a systematic comparative assessment of empirical articles published in Infant Behavior and Development in 2000 and 2024, we critically evaluate five key methodological dimensions: research contexts, sample and cell sizes, coding practices, data analysis techniques and statistical software, and open science practices. Our synthesis reveals how the field has expanded beyond traditional laboratory settings toward more diverse research environments, including remote and archival approaches that enhance ecological validity and sample diversity. We trace how sample sizes have nearly doubled and experimental cell sizes have increased 2.5-fold, strengthening statistical power and replicability. We examine the selective adoption of automated methodologies in domains like eye tracking and speech analysis, alongside the persistent value of manual coding for complex behaviors. We observe a transition from classical statistical methods to more nuanced analytical approaches, increasingly implemented in open source software, reflecting both technological capabilities and theoretical shifts toward capturing developmental complexity. Finally, we document the emergence of open science practices, which now appear in over a third of published studies. Throughout, we highlight how these methodological transformations reflect broader drivers: the replication crisis, technological innovations, and evolving theoretical perspectives. Looking forward, we offer a roadmap for methodological development that builds on these advances while addressing persistent challenges in the field.",

          "abstract": "Background: Minority stress theory explores the health impacts of stress on sexual and gender minorities. Its extensions recognize that transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming individuals experience unique stressors beyond those faced by cisgender non-heterosexual people, including both distal and proximal stressors affecting their well-being. Aims: This study investigates factors contributing to high rates of psychological distress in transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) individuals, focusing on minority stressors and sources of resilience. Methods: Using a sample of 250 TGNC (transgender: 20%; nonbinary: 33%; other identities: 9%) and cisgender (38%) individuals, we assessed the effects of distal (Perceived and Anticipated Discrimination) and proximal (Internalized Transphobia) minority stressors, alongside resilience factors (Social Support and Support for Gender/Sexual Identity), on symptoms of common mental disorders (SRQ-20 scores) and internalizing symptoms (IDAS-II scores). Data were analyzed using generalized linear models with moderated mediation. Results: TGNC participants exhibited higher SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores compared to cisgender participants. Minority stressors mediated the relationship between gender identity and SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores. While Social Support moderated the relationship between trans identity and both Anticipated Discrimination and Internalized Transphobia, its protective effect varied across gender identities. Support for Gender/Sexual Identity mitigated the impact of Internalized Transphobia in SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores in TGNC individuals. Conclusion: TGNC individuals face elevated psychological distress due to unique stressors. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions that promote social and identity-based support, emphasizing the role of resilience factors in improving mental health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Individual listeners differ in how they utilize acoustic cues when categorizing speech sounds, but the relationship between cue weighting and specific dimensions of speech categorization remains unclear. It is also understudied whether individual differences in categorization are stable across phonological contrasts. This study determines which and to what extent differences in speech categorization indices (categorization gradiency and consistency) are associated with differences in cue reliance. Another goal is to examine the stability of the categorization indices by comparing categorization patterns across two distinct speech continua: lexical stress contrast and stop voicing contrast. English-speaking adults (n=61) completed two-alternative forced-choice tasks across the contrasts, estimating a speech token on a discrete scale, and visual analog scaling tasks across the contrasts, rating a speech token on a continuous scale. Across the contrasts, differences in categorization consistency—the stability of a listener’s percept across multiple encounters with speech sounds—are closely linked to individuals’ overall reliance on cues for a given contrast. Cross-contrast comparisons revealed that categorization consistency in one contrast predicted consistency in the other, whereas gradiency did not. These suggest that categorization consistency is a stable, trait-like property that is closely linked to how listeners use relevant acoustic cues comprehensively.",

Our results revealed substantial variability in network structures across families. There was no link between network structures and PSE.

Overall, Chinese (n = 604), Japanese (n = 148), Korean (n = 244), and Vietnamese participants (n = 311) reported more discrimination events than Indian (n = 333) and Filipino participants (n = 399) during this time period. Critically, all but Korean participants showed a positive relationship between reported discrimination events since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and perceptions of both linked fate and similarity with Black Americans. Our findings demonstrate the ways that Asian subgroups’ experiences differ, and how these differences might, in turn, predict responses to discrimination that foster intra-minority solidarity between Asian and Black Americans.",

          "abstract": "Background: College students are at increased risk of poor mental health and well-being as well as poor sleep. There is an ongoing need for accessible interventions for young adults in this important period of transition. Nature-based interventions have been proposed as scalable strategies to reduce stress and improve health, yet few randomized controlled trials have assessed their longitudinal effects on both mental health and physiological functioning.\n\nMethods: We conducted a 14-week randomized controlled trial conducted from January 21, 2023, to May 5, 2023 among college students at a single university (N = 379). Participants were randomized to the control group or one of three interventions: physical activity, nature experiences, or group therapy. Each intervention offered weekly group activities and prompted intervention-specific individual activity suggestions. The physical activity group completed weekly exercise routines; the nature experiences group spent quality time in nature each week; and the therapy group engaged in skill-based group therapy. Individual activities were scheduled through the study app. Weekly self-reported health measures included the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). Physiological sleep measures were continuously recorded via Oura Rings. We used an intention-to-treat analysis, including participants that attended at least one group activity, and mixed-effects models to assess intervention effects over time. To explore potential mechanisms, mediation analyses were conducted to assess whether reductions in self-reported health measures mediated the effects of interventions on sleep measures.\n\nFindings: A total of 379 participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis based on initial randomization. The mean (SD) age was 18.4 (0.5) years, with 229 (67.8%) being female and 295 (87.3%) identifying as white. Notably, 228 (67.5%) reported a mental health diagnosis at baseline. The Nature group demonstrated significant improvements in stress (β = –1.507, p = .047), well-being (WEMWBS × Week: β = 0.107, p = .039), and HRV (β = 9.13, p = .037). Mediation analyses suggest that stress reduction partially mediated the effect of nature on HRV and well-being. Gender and mental health history were significant covariates, with males reporting more favorable outcomes compared to non-males, and those with prior mental health conditions reporting poorer outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: Results support the potential utility of behavioral interventions on reported and biometric measures of well-being with particular promise in nature-based programs that are low-cost and scalable. Participants in the nature exposure group showed improvements in both subjective and objective health outcomes. Improvements in sleep estimates were partly explained by reductions in perceived stress and improved well-being, supporting the inclusion of nature-based strategies in public mental health planning. Further research is needed to understand the broader implications of these findings for promoting well-being among college students during their transition to higher education.",

          "abstract": "People vary drastically in their intellectual humility (i.e., their ability to recognize gaps in their knowledge). Little is known about how intellectual humility develops or why some children might demonstrate more intellectual humility than others. The current study examines the possibility of parent to child transmission of intellectual humility. Parents (N = 108; 88% college graduates; 56% with household income over $100,000) of children ages 7 to 10 completed two primary measures of intellectual humility: a self-report measure (i.e., the Comprehensive Intellectual Humility Scale; Krumrei-Mancuso &amp; Rouse, 2016), and a behavioral measure (i.e., the Prompted Explanation Task; Mills et al., 2022), which measured how often parents referenced knowledge limits or how to handle uncertainty. Separately, children (N = 108; M = 8.2 years; 51% girls, 49% boys; 70% White; 86% non-Hispanic) completed a knowledge estimation task where they rated their ability to answer explanatory questions about animals and vehicles. Contrary to expectations, self-report and behavioral measures of intellectual humility in parents were not correlated. Moreover, parents who self-reported higher levels of intellectual humility had children who were less humble in their knowledge ratings. That said, consistent with predictions, parents who were less humble in the way they indicated knowledge gaps had children who were less humble in the way they assessed their knowledge. These findings support that there are links between parent and child intellectual humility, but the pattern may depend on how parent intellectual humility is measured. Implications for understanding the development of intellectual humility are discussed.",

          "abstract": "The stereotype that Asian Americans excel in science and math has contributed to the narrative that they are overrepresented in STEM fields. However, U.S. Census data reveals this is not the case—there are significant disparities in STEM representation across Asian subgroups. The present research investigates whether U.S. participants are aware of these disparities. In Studies 1 and 2, we show that participants misperceive the STEM representation of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Filipino, and Vietnamese subgroups. Study 3 demonstrates that these misperceptions persist despite changes in question framing and measurement. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these misperceptions are due to stereotypical expectations: participants view East and South Asian subgroups as more representative of Asian Americans and therefore more likely to be overrepresented in STEM, while perceiving Southeast Asian subgroups as less representative and more likely to be underrepresented. In a final study, we find that informing egalitarian-minded participants about these disparities increases support for racial equity–enhancing policies, and all participants’ support for disaggregated data about Asian subgroups. Overall, our findings indicate that many U.S. participants are unaware of the within-group disparities among Asian Americans and underscore the importance of collecting and reporting data at the subgroup level to bring these inequalities to light.",

          "authors": "Jacob Feldman",
          "abstract": "Human concept learning is known to be impaired by conceptual complexity: simpler concepts are easier to learn, and more complex ones are more diﬃcult. However the simplicity bias has been studied almost exclusively in the context of deterministic concepts deﬁned over Boolean features, and is comparatively unexplored in the more general case of probabilistic concepts deﬁned over continuous features. This paper reports a series of experiments in which subjects were asked to learn probabilistic concepts deﬁned over a novel 2D continuous feature space. Each concept was a mixture of several distinct Gaussian components, and the complexity of the concepts was varied by manipulating the positions of the mixture components relative to each other, while holding the number of components constant. The results conﬁrm that the positioning of mixture components strongly impacts learning, independent of the intrinsic statistical separability of the concepts, which was manipulated independently. Moreover, the results point to an information-theoretic basis framework for quantifying the complexity of probabilistic concepts, centered on the notion of compressive complexity: simple concepts are those that can be approximately recovered from a projection of the concept onto a lower-dimensional feature space, while more complex concepts are those that can only be represented by combining features. The framework provides a consistent, coherent, and broadly applicable measure of the complexity of probabilistic concepts.",

It demonstrates that active inference dynamics—including the minimization of variational and expected free energy—naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the definability and coherence of the Free Energy Principle.

          "abstract": "The use of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) as a measure of individual differences is stymied by insufficient test-retest reliability for assessing trait-level constructs. We assess the degree to which the IAT measures individual differences and test a method to improve its validity as a ‘trait’ measure: aggregating across IATs. Across three studies, participants (total n = 960) completed multiple IATs in the same session or across multiple sessions. Using latent-variable models, we found that half of the variance in IAT scores reflect individual differences. Aggregating across multiple IATs approximately doubled the variance explained with explicit measures compared to a single IAT D-score. These findings show that IAT scores contain considerable noise and that a single IAT is inadequate to estimate trait bias. However, aggregation across multiple administrations can correct for this and better estimate individual differences in implicit attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Grasping is a fundamental skill that enables people to interface with and explore objects around them. The emergence of precision (thumb-to-forefinger) grasping during infancy represents a developmental shift in this skill and has been linked to more advanced action perception, particularly in detecting action incongruencies. In this study, ERPs known to be elicited in response to action were studied in 9- and 11.5-month-old infants as they watched whole-hand and precision grasping actions congruent or ¬incongruent with a target object. Components related to attentional (Nc, P400) and semantic (N400) processes were examined to determine whether infants' perception of grasp is based on attention and recognition, on higher-level representations of action, or a mix of these two levels of processing. Effects of congruence were found for the P400 and the N400. The P400 effect was greater among the older age group. Infants' ability to produce a precision grip did not significantly affect their ERPs in response to actors’ incongruent versus congruent grasps, which would have been expected if recognition of incongruous grasping actions were based on motor experience. Results indicate that infant ERPs differ between grasps that are congruent or incongruent with the form of a target object via multiple cognitive processes.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Forming memories requires a focus on the external world; retrieving memories requires attention to our internal world. Computational models propose that the hippocampus resolves the tension between encoding and retrieval by alternating between states that prioritize one over the other. We asked whether the success of a retrieval state affects the success of an encoding state, when both are measured in behavior. Across 3 Experiments (N=197), we operationalized retrieval as the use of memories to make predictions about the future, and tested whether successful (vs. unsuccessful) prediction affected the likelihood of successful encoding. Participants viewed a series of scene categories that contained structure (e.g., beaches are followed by castles), which enabled memory retrieval to guide prediction. After structure learning, they completed a simultaneous prediction and encoding task. They were shown trial-unique category exemplars and made predictions about upcoming scene categories. Finally, participants completed a surprise memory test for the trial-unique images. Accurate (vs. inaccurate) predictions were associated with better encoding, and increasing prediction distance hurt both prediction and encoding. This association between encoding and prediction could not be explained by generic on- vs. off-task states. We propose that, in addition to stimulus and endogenous factors that modulate switches between encoding and retrieval, the success of one state can facilitate a switch to the other. Thus, although encoding and prediction depend on distinct and competitive computational mechanisms, the success of one in behavior can increase the likelihood of success for the other.",

          "abstract": "The current child and adolescent mental health crisis necessitates both empirical and theoretical innovation. This review presents a new framework conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC) - formulated from a transdiagnostic preventative perspective. The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours, including emotional awareness and regulation of distraction, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with the intertwined activity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to activity in the theory of mind, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

We examine, for the first time, how both the general public (n=1099) and experts (n=82) respond to the irreducible uncertainty presented by different Greenhouse Gas emission pathways and how this uncertainty affects people’s interpretation of projected future temperature ranges (e.g., 4°C to 7.2°C by 2100). Our results suggest that people find it difficult to disentangle their prior beliefs about the likelihood of different climate futures from objective scientific statements about projected temperature ranges. We identify both Optimists and Pessimists whose beliefs about the most likely future scenarios influence their interpretation of identical numerical ranges. We also find that age, behavioural willingness and  climate anxiety were predictive of being an Optimist, whereas personal experience with climate change predicted being a Pessimist. Together our results suggest that simply increasing the discourse around potential climate futures may help people to understand the uncertainty in climate projections and could shift both their priors and their behaviours.",

A sample of 473 adults completed measures of music preferences, coping through music listening, positive and negative affect, and quality of life. Analyses included confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis, multiple regressions, and mediation and moderation models. The adapted MUSIC model showed acceptable congruence, though the Unpretentious and Intense factors exhibited low internal consistency. The emic model identified five reliable factors - Reflexo, Intenso, Tradição, Movimento, and Orgânico (RITMO) - reflecting Brazilian cultural and musical specificities. Reflexo was the strongest predictor of using music for emotional and problem-focused coping, while Movimento predicted negative affects, and Sophisticated and Mellow explained positive ones. Tradição and Reflexo predicted specific domains of quality of life. Mediation and moderation analyses indicated that music use for emotional and problem-focused coping increased positive affect, with these effects mediated and moderated by preferences for Reflexo and Orgânico. The RITMO model more accurately captures Brazilian musical preferences, highlighting rhythm as central. Preferences for Reflexo and Orgânico especially enhance the positive impact of music use on emotional well-being and quality of life.",

          "abstract": "It has long been known that presenting information to multiple senses at a time (e.g., audiovisual presentation as opposed to only visual or auditory) improves later recall of said information – an effect known as the bimodal advantage. Surprisingly however, evidence for this has come only from studies employing free and serial recall, where the identity of an object is recalled, but not in cued recall, where one object feature is recalled when another one is cued. This is despite both tasks requiring binding features into an object in working memory (WM) – our brain’s capacity-limited system for temporarily maintaining information for the purpose of achieving behavioral goals. The present study investigated this discrepancy across a series of four experiments. Contrary to the literature, and despite near-identical task settings, we found evidence for a bimodal advantage across multiple experiments. Moreover, our results suggest that this advantage mainly arises from perceptual processes at encoding rather than from storage in an audiovisual fashion in WM. Finally, a primarily perceptually-based process, the bimodal advantage appears to be sensitive to the characteristics of the cue feature (i.e., its presentation modality). In sum, our results shed light on the mechanism of the bimodal advantage, now robustly detected in cued recall tasks, furthering our understanding of the relationship between perception and WM. Results are discussed in relation to prior studies that did not find a bimodal advantage, potential mechanisms underlying the effect, and the broader framework of the multicomponent model of WM.",

Our results indicate that cognitive flexibility significantly contributes to divergent thinking, surpassing the effects of abstract reasoning and working memory and suggesting a major role for cognitive flexibility in this form of creativity.

In every society, self-reliant decisions (intuition or deliberation) were most commonly preferred and considered the wisest. Expectations for fellow citizens, however, were mixed: advice from friends was expected about as often as self-reliant routes. The self-reliance tilt was strongest in cultures and individuals high in independent self-construal and need for cognition, and weakest where interdependence and self-transcendent reflection were salient. The same patterns emerged when examining ratings of each strategy’s utility, and oral protocols with Indigenous groups.

The results indicated that a candidate who can better control their SNS information is less likely to perceive that their privacy has been invaded during SNS screening by potential employers, thus mitigating their perception of procedural unfairness. Moreover, when SNS screening is more transparent, the candidate is less likely to perceive the selection procedure as unfair, which will reduce their intention to withdraw from the employment selection process.",

Modeling language in the brain is complex, involving time-varying signals, structured symbolic representations, and interdependent features. Current models make trade-offs between variable independence, temporal continuity, and interpretability, shaping the inferences they support. The Dual-Dependency-Taxonomy (2D-taxonomy) addresses this by classifying models based on how they handle covariance and  temporal dependencies. It distinguishes four classes—multivariable, multivariate, dynamical, and latent dynamical—each aligned with specific scientific goals.

          "abstract": "As the demand for automatic video interviews powered by artificial intelligence (AI) increases among employers in the postpandemic era, so do concerns over job applicants’ trust in the technology. There are various forms of AI-based video interviews with and without the features of tangibility, immediacy, and transparency used for preemployment screening, and these features may distinctively influence applicants’ trust in the technology and whether they engage in or disengage from the hiring process accordingly. This field study involved designing a test of the effect of various forms of AI-based video interviews on interviewees’ cognitive and affective trust based on the self-reporting of 152 real job applicants. The study found that AI used in asynchronous video interviews (AI-AVI) increased applicants’ cognitive trust from that in the non-AI condition. Moreover, when the AI-AVI had features of tangibility and transparency, the applicants’ cognitive and affective trust increased. However, the feature of immediacy did not have a statistically significant impact. Contrary to concern over the potential negative effects caused by AI and its features, no statistically significant impacts were found in this study.",

          "authors": "Hung-Yue Suen",
          "abstract": "Purpose\nAsynchronous Video Interviews (AVIs) incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted assessment has become popular as a pre-employment screening method. The extent to which applicants engage in deceptive impression management (IM) behaviors during these interviews remains uncertain. Furthermore, the accuracy of human detection in identifying such deceptive IM behaviors is limited. This study seeks to explore differences in deceptive IM behaviors by applicants across video interview modes (AVIs versus Synchronous Video Interviews (SVIs)) and the use of AI-assisted assessment (AI versus non-AI). The study also investigates if video interview modes affect human interviewers' ability to detect deceptive IM behaviors.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nWe conducted a field study with four conditions based on two critical factors: the synchrony of video interviews (AVI vs. SVI) and the presence of AI-assisted assessment (AI vs. Non-AI): Non-AI-assisted AVIs, AI-assisted AVIs, Non-AI-assisted SVIs, and AI-assisted SVIs. The study involved 144 pairs of interviewees and interviewers/assessors. To assess applicants' deceptive IM behaviors, we employed a combination of interviewee self-reports and interviewer perceptions.\n\nFindings\nThe results indicate that AVIs elicited fewer instances of deceptive IM behaviors across all dimensions when compared to SVIs. Furthermore, using AI-assisted assessment in both video interview modes resulted in less extensive image creation than non-AI settings. However, the study revealed that human interviewers had difficulties detecting deceptive IM behaviors regardless of the mode used, except for extensive faking in AVIs.\nOriginality\nThe study is the first to address the call for research on the impact of video interview modes and AI on interviewee faking and interviewer accuracy. This research enhances our understanding of the practical implications associated with the use of different video interview modes and AI algorithms in the pre-employment screening process. The study contributes to the existing literature by refining the theoretical model of faking likelihood in employment interviews according to media richness theory and the model of volitional rating behavior based on expectancy theory in the context of AVIs and AI-assisted assessment.",

          "authors": "Philippe Servajean; Richard Servajean",
          "abstract": "When we say that a theory is able to account for our subjective experience, we simply mean that if this theory were true—e.g., if our brain were as this theory stipulates—then our subjective experience would be indeed as we experience it. A scientist would formulate this idea using the notions of observation and prediction: A theory is able to account for our subjective experience if and only if it is able to predict first-person observations. Several thought experiments suggest that current theories are unable to make such predictions. For example, if we had never seen colors in our lives and therefore did not know what the color blue looks like, these theories would not allow us to deduce (i.e., predict) what it is like to see blue. This well-known problem is often called the hard problem of consciousness (HPC). Here, we address this problem through the lens of the epistemological hypothesis. Under the epistemological hypothesis, the HPC no longer reflects the inability of our theories to predict first-person observations; it reflects our inability to deduce what these theories imply regarding first-person observations. The HPC then becomes an epistemological problem that can be formulated as follows: If we are unable to deduce what a theory implies regarding first-person observations, how can we know whether this theory is able to account for first-person observations? In this paper, we outline a method to test experimentally the epistemological hypothesis and to solve the HPC. Notably, this method makes it possible to test any identity hypothesis. We then highlight the remarkable compatibility between this method and the theoretical framework of predictive processing. We show that a theory of consciousness based on predictive processing implies the epistemological hypothesis—this theory predicts that we are unable to deduce its own implications regarding first-person observations. Finally, this work suggests that the theoretical framework of predictive processing may already have the resources to simulate a brain facing the HPC.",

          "abstract": "In a purely meritocratic society educational outcomes would reflect ability, and only ability. Vocabulary size is a common measure of cognitive ability that predicts educational outcomes but is confounded with socioeconomic circumstances (SEC). Methods. In preregistered analyses of the nationally representative UK Millennium Cohort Study data (N=15,576), we used a series of multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to investigate the predictive value of age-5 vocabulary for age-16 educational outcomes and assess whether socioeconomic circumstance moderated this relation. Results. We show that age-5 vocabulary strongly predicted age-16 educational attainment, even after adjusting for both SEC and caregiver vocabulary (OR = 1.62, 95% CIs = [1.52;1.72]; ( = .22, 95% CIs = [.19;.24]). However, the weight of evidence for the effect was lower than that for the effect of SEC (i.e., SEC was found to have better predictive value. Further, a larger vocabulary was most advantageous for those in middle SEC groups (interaction term OR 1.09 [1.03; 1.15). Conclusions. This demonstrates that even children who enter school with relatively strong language skills are not that likely to gain gateway qualifications if they experience socio-economic disadvantage.  Early language interventions may help children to access education but cannot by themselves be expected to counteract the effect of social inequality on life chances.",

          "abstract": "The availability of real-world object stimuli that meet researchers’ requirements, for example regarding colour, orientation and resolution, is an ongoing challenge in visual cognition research. Traditionally, there has been a reliance on manually curated object stimuli, which are inefficient to create and may afford researchers limited control over stimulus characteristics. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate the generation of custom-made, highly realistic visual stimuli. We report a generative AI method we used to efficiently generate 200 images of everyday objects for use in research. We also report the results from a subsequent validation study in which we assessed the nameability, perceived realism and familiarity of the stimuli in a sample of 45 younger (18-35) and 45 older (65-85) adults. As anticipated, the majority of the stimuli were rated highly across all three measures, and no significant age differences were observed. The results thus generally validated most of the stimuli for future research requiring nameable, realistic everyday object images. The stimuli, each in seven colours, and the corresponding validation scores are openly available for future use by others. Our research highlights the broader utility of an AI-based approach for generating realistic object stimuli. Our method is reproducible, flexible, and efficient, providing a valuable reference for researchers seeking to custom-create their own object stimuli.",

Accordingly, researchers and practitioners advocate overcoming these concerns by refining AI interfaces in terms of tangibility, immediacy, and transparency. However, AI video interviews featuring different interfaces may impact interviewees’ tendencies to engage in impression management behaviors (IMs), which can either improve or impair personnel selection validity. This study addressed calls for research to investigate the issues mentioned above by conducting a field study to explore the ways in which AI and AI interfaces affect candidates’ IMs in asynchronous video interviews (AVIs). We developed three AVI interfaces and measured real job applicants’ self-reported IMs across four experimental treatments. We found that different AI interfaces could increase or decrease candidates’ honest IMs and deceptive IMs in different ways.

          "abstract": "Love Island is a popular reality dating series that has faced significant criticism for casting contestants with highly idealized bodies. There has been widespread concern that Love Island’s casting choices may inadvertently pressure young viewers to internalize unrealistic body ideals and engage in body change strategies to conform to them. However, no longitudinal research has explored this possibility. This study therefore draws upon self-discrepancy theory and social comparison theory to explore the reciprocal within-person relationships between body pressure from watching Love Island and engagement in - or desire to engage in - three body change strategies (i.e., weight loss, muscle gain, and cosmetic surgery). Three-wave panel data were collected from 344 young people during the summer 2023 series of Love Island UK (M age = 20.42, SD = 1.98; White British = 70.06%), and analyzed using three random intercept cross-lagged panel models. Body pressure from watching Love Island at the midpoint of the series predicted heightened engagement in weight loss and muscle gain strategies, and increased desire for cosmetic surgery, at the end of the series. Furthermore, heightened desire for cosmetic surgery predicted increased body pressure from watching Love Island. Results suggest that prolonged exposure to the idealized bodies on Love Island may have maladaptive cognitive and behavioral implications for young people. By shedding light on how contemporary reality television can impact the body image of young people, our findings can support individual interventions, contemporary media literacy programmes, and industry practices to better safeguard young viewers.",

A 12- to 15-minute video was recorded for each of the N=121 job applicants as they answered five structured behavioral interview questions. Each applicant completed a survey to self-evaluate their trustworthiness on 4 IM measures. Additionally, a field experiment was conducted to compare the concurrent validity associated with self-reported IMs between our modeling and human interviewers. Human interviewers’ performance in predicting these IM measures from another subset of 30 videos was obtained by having N=30 human interviewers evaluate three recordings. Our models explained 91% and 84% of the variance in honest and deceptive IMs, respectively, and showed a stronger correlation with self-reported IM scores compared to human interviewers.",

Special attention is given to the impact of users’ political orientation. Findings show that emotional engagement and transportation significantly promote political beliefs consistent with the VR narrative (e.g., support for refugees), but are not associated with increases in factual or perceived knowledge. These results highlight both the persuasive\npotential and the educational limitations of VR in history education. While VR may not enhance knowledge transfer per se, it may effectively foster engagement on socially and politically relevant topics.",

          "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and adult learning, asynchronous video-based online learning has not only become the new norm but has also emerged as the cornerstone of instructional delivery for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Despite its widespread adoption, this learning mode confronts a critical challenge: the inherent lack of social presence, posing a significant risk of diminishing learner affective engagement and, consequently, jeopardizing the efficacy of learning outcomes. Addressing this pressing issue, our study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 240 instructional videos from 240 distinct instructors on a MOOC platform, supplemented by 845 post-course learner feedback surveys from a diverse cohort of college students and adult learners. Using deep learning and statistical analysis, the research revealed that the on-screen presence of instructors does not inherently affect students' affective engagement. The study revealed that learners' affective engagement is affected by distinct combinations of the instructor's facial and paraverbal expressions, including happiness, surprise, and anger, which vary depending on whether the instructor is visible. The discovery that vocal attractiveness is a pivotal element in enhancing learners' affective engagement with instructional videos marks a paradigm shift in our understanding of digital andragogy and heutagogy. This study propels academic discourse by illuminating the critical role of instructor non-verbal cues in establishing social presence and facilitating emotional contagion within asynchronous video-based online learning but also provides educators and content creators with empirically-backed techniques to revolutionize video instruction and amplify affective engagement.",

          "abstract": "Exerting cognitive effort is essential for successful engagement in demanding tasks, yet individuals differ in how they perceive and value such effort. Two key personality traits - Need for Cognition (NFC) and Willpower Beliefs - have been associated with cognitive motivation and persistence. While Subjective Values (SVs) provide a measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort, the role of task-related feedback in modulatring SVs has remained underexplored. In the present study, N = 251 participants completed an online experiment including an n-Back task, the Cognitive Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, and personality questionnaires assessing NFC and Willpower Beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Real, Sham, or No Feedback after each n-Back level. Results showed that both real and sham feedback led to significantly shallower effort discounting compared to no feedback. While the effect of sham feedback was independent of individual traits, the effect of real feedback on SVs was stronger for participants with higher NFC. Additionally, both higher NFC and non-limited Willpower Beliefs were associated with reduced effort discounting in the No Feedback condition. These findings demonstrate that subjective valuation of cognitive effort is shaped not only by task demands but also by perceived performance cues and individual motivational dispositions. Informational feedback can sustain engagement in cognitively demanding tasks, particularly in those with a strong intrinsic drive to think.",

          "abstract": "Recent educational goals have focused on achieving deep understanding and promoting the use of effective learning strategies. Previous studies showed that cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) help diagnose students' depth of understanding. However, the approaches in specifying attributes (i.e., Q-matrix) to diagnose the depth of understanding remain unexplored; therefore, utilizing large-scale assessments to capture the general trends in the students' mastery of the depth of understanding is an uncharted area in this field. This study explores which attribute expression (i.e., linear hierarchy or polytomous attribute) is more appropriate, based on the CDM analysis of a large-scale mathematics assessment. Traditional CDM applications frequently rely on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which imposes a substantial computational burden when a dataset is large and a model used in data analysis is complex. As a computationally efficient alternative to the MCMC method, this study adopts the variational Bayesian (VB) method to mitigate computational challenges brought by the MCMC method and illustrate how the VB method can be used for the CDM analysis of a large-scale assessment. The results from real data analysis show that a Q-matrix employing a linear hierarchy is more appropriate than employing polytomous attributes. The estimation results based on linear hierarchical attributes suggest that less than 30% of the sampled students achieved a deep understanding of procedures/formulas, whereas more than half of the students achieved only a shallow understanding. Regarding the understanding of terms, less than 35% of the students achieved either shallow or deep understanding. These results may help design and improve future learning strategy instructions.",

Participants noted all comparisons they made concerning university/school over one week, as well as their antecedents and the consequences of these comparisons on their academic self-concepts. \nResults: All four comparison types were shown to be prevalent in daily life and to affect change in students’ self-concepts. Downward comparisons mostly increased, and upward comparisons mostly decreased academic self-concept. Social comparisons were the most common comparison type (social &gt; temporal &gt; dimensional &gt; criterial) in both samples. Moreover, self-evaluation was the most important motivational trigger in both samples. For university students, social interactions were the most common situational trigger for comparisons, whereas for high school students, performance feedback triggered comparisons more frequently. \nConclusions: The results expand our understanding of academic self-concept development in everyday lives and contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory of comparison processes in academic contexts.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nMost literature emphasizes either depressive or manic symptoms. There is a paucity of studies examining both episodes together alongside psychotic features in a single case. Current study presents a comparative analysis of both depression and manic episodes along with psychotic features highlighting utility of Sacks sentence completion (SSCT) in clinical assessment. \nMethodology: Beck Depression Inventory- II, Young Mania Rating scale was used to assess both severity of depressive and manic symptoms. Furthermore, Sacks sentence completion test has been administered for both episodes respectively. The Bipolar type I disorder with psychotic case clinical report was qualitatively interpreted. Various themes were denoted indicating disparities between depression and mania. This analysis provides insights into lived experiences of bipolar disorder 1. \nResults indicated, during depressive episode, significant distress has been noticed in areas of self-concept pertaining to guilt feelings and interpersonal functioning. However, the similar distress has been overcompensated during the episode of mania. \nConclusion:  The link between low social support and depressive symptoms was influenced by low self-esteem, which has been connected to grandiose thinking impacting interpersonal interactions.",

          "authors": "James Teague; Matthias Pillny; David John Hallford; David Austin",
          "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder is a prevalent and debilitating mental health condition characterised by both deficits in behavioural activation level and a marked reduction in the ability to experience pleasure (i.e., anhedonia). Exploring the role of episodic future thinking (EFT) represents a promising direction, given its ability to enhance perceived control and anticipatory pleasure, both of which drive goal-directed behaviour. In the present study it was hypothesised that EFT characteristics—specificity, detail, and mental imagery—would be indirectly associated with greater self-reported behavioural activation level through increased perceived control and anticipatory pleasure. This was tested using path analysis models in a cross-sectional sample of 284 participants (aged 18-79; M = 39.72, SD = 13.27), including a full spectrum of depressive symptoms, from normal range to mild, moderate, and severe levels. As predicted, we found that EFT specificity and a composite imagery-detail variable were positively associated with perceived control, and imagery-detail was positively associated with anticipatory pleasure. EFT variables were also indirectly associated with higher behavioural activation scores through perceived control and anticipatory pleasure. Notably, the indirect effect of EFT specificity on behavioural activation through perceived control was significantly stronger in individuals with higher symptom levels, providing novel insights into the moderating role of depression. Our findings underscore the potential of EFT to enhance therapies focused on increasing behavioural activation by more effectively targeting anticipatory pleasure and, crucially, perceived control, particularly in those experiencing more severe depressive symptoms.",

After validation, we used GPT4-Turbo to annotate 2,376 news articles and 192,973 user comments from eight German news outlets and tested how the (1) emergence of LG, (2) amount of media coverage, and (3) anger expressed in coverage, affected stances towards FFF. We found that short-term LG coverage predicted increased support for FFF in news articles and left-leaning user comments but decreased support in right-leaning comments when compared to FFF coverage. We could not observe a robust RFE in the long-term. Anger in climate activism coverage (not specifically LG) predicted decreased FFF support in articles and increased support in user comments. These findings reveal how political orientation and media dynamics condition responses to radical protest, offering new insights into the RFE’s temporal and contextual boundaries.",

          "abstract": "Social media use has become a near-universal feature of modern life, offering many opportunities for connection and self-presentation. Yet, certain patterns of use have been implicated in poorer psychological outcomes. Further, evidence suggests that individuals with emotion regulation difficulties may be particularly drawn to certain social media behaviours as a means of coping with distress. The present study aimed to examine whether emotion regulation difficulties predict patterns of social media use and, in turn, symptoms of depression and anxiety. We examined four distinct types of social media use: (1) image management-based, (2) social comparison-based, (3) negative engagement-based, and (4) passive consumption-based. Sampling 548 adults aged 18 to 84 years (Mage = 33.16, SD = 17.37; 401 (73.2%) female; 128 (23.2%) male), we tested a structural equation model to examine whether the four distinct types of social media use mediated links between difficulties in emotion regulation at Time 1 and depression and anxiety symptomology at Time 2, one week later. Results suggested that, when controlling for age, difficulties in emotion regulation significantly predicted all types of social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety over one week. Only comparison-based social media use predicted anxiety symptoms over time, with no other types of social media use significantly predicting these symptoms. The model explained 50.1% of the variance in depression symptoms and 52.1% of the variance in anxiety symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest the critical importance of emotion regulation over and above social media use in shaping mental health.",

Data from 210 video lectures across four MOOC platforms and feedback from 738 students collected after class were analyzed. Results revealed that teachers' verbal emotive expressions, even with positive valence and high arousal, did not significantly impact engagement. Conversely, vocal expressions with positive valence and high arousal (e.g., happiness, surprise) enhanced engagement, while negative high-arousal emotions (e.g., anger) reduced it. These findings offer practical insights for instructional video creators, teachers, and influencers to foster emotional engagement in asynchronous video learning.",

          "authors": "Don Gaconnet",
          "abstract": "Collapse Harmonics vs. Collapse Theory — Scientific Boundary Delineation\nThe term “collapse” holds divergent meanings across scientific contexts. In physics, it typically refers to the sudden transition of a quantum system from a superposition of possible states to a single observed outcome—a phenomenon known as wavefunction collapse. In Collapse Harmonics, by contrast, collapse is understood not as a reduction of probability, but as a lawful structural phase transition in the coherence of recursive identity systems. This appendix provides a rigorous differentiation between these two uses of collapse, situating Collapse Harmonics (CH) as an autonomous scientific field rooted in symbolic recursion, phase integrity, and harmonic field theory.\nWhereas quantum mechanical Collapse Theories (CT) seek to resolve the measurement problem by adding collapse-triggering mechanisms to the Schrödinger equation, Collapse Harmonics frames collapse as a necessary, structurally predictable consequence of recursive overload, symbolic saturation, or coherence phase instability. Collapse Harmonics is applicable not only to individual identity systems but also to artificial intelligences, cultural symbolic orders, and planetary cognitive fields.\nThis document delineates the boundaries of each paradigm. It affirms CH as a lawful substrate-phase science, grounded in its own mathematical models (such as the Collapse Harmonics Field Equation), symbolic diagnostic protocols (CFSM, SCIT), and coherence principles, without dependence on the assumptions or metaphysical frameworks of quantum mechanics. It further asserts the lawful jurisdiction of Collapse Harmonics over identity recursion phenomena, collapse-phase reentry behavior, and symbolic field coherence—areas where CT offers no applicable model.\nIn declaring this boundary, the appendix protects the ontological independence of Collapse Harmonics from both the metaphorical misuse of “collapse” and the epistemological assumptions of physical observer-centric models. It closes by introducing Codex Law T-Ø, which formalizes the lawful boundary between observer-based interpretations and substrate-phase field dynamics.",

Analyses of science and other systems of collective inquiry have shown that patterns of discovery are shaped not only by individual insight but also by the social structures that guide how ideas are generated, shared, and evaluated. While the structure of scientific collaboration and influence can be inferred from co-authorship and citations, philosophical influence and interaction are often only implicit in published texts. It thus remains unclear how intellectual vitality relates to social structure within philosophy. Here, we build on the work of historians and sociologists to quantify the social structure of global philosophical communities consisting of thousands of individual philosophers, ranging from ancient India (c. 800 BCE) to modern Europe and America (1980 CE). We analyze the time-evolving network structure of philosophical interaction and disagreement within these communities. We find that epistemically vital communities become more integrated over time, with less fractionated debate, as a few centralizing thinkers bridge fragmented intellectual communities. The intellectual vitality and creativity of a community, moreover, is predicted by its social structure but not overall antagonism among individuals, suggesting that epistemic health depends more on how communities are organized than on how contentious they are. Our approach offers a framework for understanding the health and dynamism of epistemic communities. By extending tools from collective intelligence to the study of philosophy, we call for a comparative \"science of philosophy\" alongside the science of science and the philosophy of science.",

We empirically assess this proposal using a survey study and field data from X’s Community Notes. As predicted, politically discordant false posts are flagged most often, and more politically motivated users flag more posts while exhibiting equal or higher flagging discernment (along with more political bias). Politically motivated individuals are integral to provisioning a high quantity and quality of crowdsourced fact-checks.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "The rainbow body (Jalü in Tibetan Buddhism) represents a profound spiritual attainment, and it is said that the physical form dissolves into light at the time of death. This paper proposes a novel hypothesis: the visual component of the rainbow body experience, as vividly perceived in personal meditative encounters, can be understood as a complex, dynamic phosphene-movie, a vivid internal visual phenomenon arising from neural activity. Furthermore, we integrate the often-overlooked haptic dimension which might rise during deep meditation states, specifically the sensation of floating upward, arguing that it is not merely an accompanying sensation but an integral, co-creative element shaping the visual phosphenes. Drawing upon historical Tibetan Buddhist textual accounts, particularly from the Dzogchen tradition, and a six-phase taxonomy of inner luminous experience, we demonstrate a striking convergence between traditional descriptions and modern neurophysiological understanding of phosphenes. We contend that Thankas, traditional Tibetan Buddhist scroll paintings, serve as ancient visual records of these intricate internal phosphene-movies and the associated haptic sensations. Moreover, the integration of these visual and haptic experiences, where the 'viewer' spontaneously embodies the ascending light-form, is presented as a passive yet profound manifestation of Guru Yoga or Deity Yoga. This work re-interprets the Dzogchen tradition as perhaps the most elaborate system for collectively entering and mapping an Ultrasubjective Hyperspace (USH), where phosphene-meditations form the backbone of a systematic exploration of consciousness leading to the perception of the primary clear light, the \"structure-function unity\" of awareness. This paper contributes to comparative mysticism, neurophenomenology, and consciousness studies, while offering a tangible framework for understanding profound spiritual experiences. Moreover, it emphasizes the Tibetan culture, and especially the Dzogchen tradition, as the fundament of the most profound creation of collective transpersonal experiences. From this collectively experienced USH the foundations of all archetypes rise.",

Occupying the five domains of the HBM, we used culturally adapted health communication, facilitators of peer support groups, nicotine replacement therapy, and mobilized community and religion. This case demonstrates the efficacy of tailored interventions designed within the COM-B system, and intended to be underpinned by culture, health professionals can promote meaningful behavioral change and improvement with populations and methods that are relative to their collective values and practices. As process-informed evaluations of the case, this case is a transferable model of bridging a patterned theory of Western health behavior and indigenous paradigms/beliefs; this case provides a new contribution to global health promotion, showing that culturally grounded interventions make positive and meaningful public health differences in collectivist cultures, and offers evidence-informed recommendations for capacity building in similar low-resourced environments.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

In parallel, there has also been a rising interest in the use of\nbiomarkers to assess its impact. One such biomarker is vagally mediated heart rate variability\n(vm-HRV), which is a non-invasive measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity.\nHowever, the impact of music therapy on vm-HRV is currently unclear.\n\nMethods: A literature search was performed in December 2023/January 2024 and updated in\nMarch 2025. Data related to vm-HRV was extracted and risk of bias was evaluated. A\nnarrative synthesis was performed according to the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM)\nguidelines with an effect direction plot.\n\nResults: Twenty-eight studies were included. There was large heterogeneity in study\nsamples, contexts, music therapy interventions, and HRV measurement methods. There was\nalso a high risk of bias. The results indicated increased vm-HRV during music therapy. There\nwas also an association between improved vm-HRV and other positive health outcomes in\nthese studies.\n\nDiscussion: While current evidence indicates that there are potential positive effects of music\ntherapy on vm-HRV, more high-quality research, especially regarding HRV methodology,\ninterpretation and reporting, is needed. A high risk of bias, small sample sizes and\nheterogeneity in all aspects of the studies prevents any clear conclusions based on the current\nevidence.",

          "abstract": "Trial-by-trial feedback is a powerful tool across scientific disciplines, offering real-time information that shapes learning, attention, and behavioral adjustment. However, its role in large-scale educational and psychological assessments remains underexplored. This study examines whether providing trial-by-trial performance feedback during a digital dyslexia screening task enhances engagement while preserving the validity and interpretability of the scores it produces. Engagement is a critical threat to validity in assessments—particularly among young children in digital universal screening contexts. We conducted two large-scale experiments involving 6,610 students from Grade 1 to 12 in Colombia and the United States in which students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) informative feedback (auditory cues indicating correct/incorrect) or (2) neutral feedback (non-informative sound). The assessment was administered in two formats: an adaptively ordered English version and a randomly ordered Spanish version. We evaluated differences in response behaviors, item response theory (IRT) model fit, and concurrent validity between conditions. Results indicate that informative feedback significantly increased compliance and reduced disengagement. Reading scores and IRT model fit were comparable across conditions. Notably, informative feedback improved the concurrent validity of scores and was associated with shorter completion times. These findings suggest that trial-by-trial feedback can enhance engagement without degrading score interpretability thus leading to improvements in assessment efficiency and validity in a universal screening context.",

          "abstract": "Since the introduction of the dimensional assessment of personality functioning (PF) in DSM-5 and ICD-11, impairments in PF have consistently been related to transdiagnostic risk-factors for mental health. However, ecological momentary assessment investigating PF in relation to affect event dynamics and other psychopathology are scarce. Leveraging ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 16,038 mental health app users, this study examines how within-person affect-event dynamics, baseline impairments in PF, and depression predict longitudinal outcomes in PF impairment and depression severity. We hypothesized a central role of PF in these relationships. Within the first month of usage, on average, 69.3 [range 31-142] mood assessments and 63.3 [range 25 - 133] event assessments were available per user. Dynamic structural equation models showed substantial associations of baseline depression with weakened concurrent, lagged and cross-lagged links between events and mood, especially for positive events, including reduced likelihood of positive events. In contrast, baseline PF impairment was associated with persistence, emotional impact and volatility of interpersonal conflict events as well as with greater mood instability. Over a one-year follow-up (N=1,464; ø 1235,69 assessments per user), dynamic structural equation models identified distinct patterns: Lower concurrent mood-positive event associations, higher negative and lower positive event unpredictability, and baseline average mood/events were predictive of future PF impairment. Among affect-event dynamics, stronger cross-lagged effects of interpersonal conflicts on mood explained highest unique variance of future PF impairment (ΔR2 5.9%). Notably, baseline PF exhibited the strongest predictive utility (ΔR2 = 19.5%), followed by baseline depression symptoms (ΔR2 = 11.9%) with PF showing higher variance explanation in future depression severity than vice versa. Total average variance explanation was 71.2% for future depression severity and 75.2% for future PF impairment. Results offer specific targets for interventions: assessment of PF could therefore help to inform decisions regarding duration, goals, and intervention strategies also beyond treatment of PD. We contextualize the results within the limitations of the study, notably the use of single method self-reports.",

In the present work, we investigate two ways 5- to 10-year-olds and adults simplify the challenge of formulating questions: by reusing previous questions, and by recombining components of previous questions to form new questions. In Study 1, we develop a new question asking task, verify its suitability for studying question asking in children and adults, and conduct a preliminary investigation of how children and adults reuse and recombine their own prior questions. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulate exposure to another person's questions, investigating under what conditions children and adults reuse and recombine others' questions. Our experimental results suggest that both children and adults reuse and recombine questions, and they adaptively modulate reuse depending on how informative a question will be in a particular situation. Moreover, children reuse and recombine prior questions more frequently than adults in some cases. This work shows that prior questions provide fodder for future questions, simplifying the challenge of inquiry and enabling effective learning.",

          "abstract": "This qualitative study explores the impact of a beekeeping intervention on the wellbeing of community members in rural Ireland. While previous research has focused primarily on the environmental contributions of bees, this study shifts attention to how community-based beekeeping projects influence individual and collective wellbeing perceived through the lens of positive psychology. Ten participants from a rural community involved in the “Let It Bee” project participated in focus group interviews. Thematic analysis revealed that engagement with the beekeeping initiative facilitated positive psychological outcomes aligned with the PERMA wellbeing framework: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. Furthermore, participants reported increased autonomy, a sense of purpose, and opportunities for meaningful contribution, often transitioning from self-focused concerns to a collective mindset. This transformation was reflected in enhanced community cohesion, intergenerational collaboration, and social connectivity, reducing isolation in a rural context. Being involved in the project also prompted environmental stewardship behaviour, such as pesticide-free gardening, tree planting, and habitat preservation. The study contributes to an emerging body of literature that connects pro-environmental behaviour with psychological wellbeing, and it extends the current research by exploring its community wellbeing impact. Findings suggest that environmental interventions like beekeeping not only benefit ecological health but also serve as catalysts for emotional, psychological, and social flourishing of communities. The implications for public policy are significant, indicating that integrating wellbeing as an explicit goal in environmental programmes may enhance both participation and outcomes.",

Further, both RFG and RCC correlate positively with\nnegative emotional reactions to climate change as well as with past experiences and future\nexpectations of severe weather events.

Moving from the country to the individual level, Study 3 (N=278) examined correlational relationships between perceived societal freedom and various conspiracy beliefs, while Study 4 (N=246) experimentally tested whether manipulating perceptions of societal freedom affected belief in generic conspiracist beliefs as well as those related to vaccines and financial crises. Results consistently indicated that both greater societal freedom and higher perceived societal freedom are associated with lower levels of conspiracy beliefs.

          "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, characterized by deficits in performance monitoring, predicts clinical and functional outcomes. The error-related negativity (ERN), a neurophysiological index of error detection, is reduced in psychosis, but it is unclear why this impaired error detection is not closely linked to post-error behavioral adjustments. A possibility is that research has overrelied on examining between-person relationships of average ERN and behavior, rather than focusing on within-person, trial-by-trial changes. This study aimed to determine whether neurophysiological indices of error detection (ERN, error positivity [Pe]) predict within-person post-error behavioral adjustments in psychotic disorders and whether these relationships are weaker in people with psychosis than in controls. ERN and Pe were assessed during a modified flanker task in 72 patients with psychosis and 82 healthy comparison participants. Multilevel location-scale models were used to examine trial-by-trial changes in the relationships between ERPs and behavior (response [RTs], accuracy). Results showed that ERP-RT relationships were similar across patients and controls. In both groups, greater within-person increases in ERN amplitude predicted longer and mor variable RTs following correct trials. Larger within-person increases in Pe predicted shorter and more variable RTs following correct trials, but less variable RTs following error trials. Exploratory analyses in a subset of patients with schizophrenia showed a similar pattern of effects as in the overall analyses. ERP-accuracy relationships were neither observed nor moderated by diagnostic groups. Within-person ERP-behavior relationships were preserved in psychosis, indicating intact performance monitoring at the individual level. This supports performance-monitoring as a transdiagnostic construct and underscores the importance of examining intraindividual variability to understand performance monitoring in psychotic disorders.",

While celebrated for its potential to improve mental health and reduce strain on health services, its ethical foundations remain underexamined. This paper critiques the normative and operational assumptions underpinning GSP, arguing that current implementation risks undermining transparency, autonomy, and equity in healthcare. Using the UK’s NHS as a case study, we identify three critical challenges: (1) a weak and heterogeneous evidence base, (2) lack of referral and outcome tracking infrastructure, and (3) significant inequities in access to prescribed green spaces. We show how GSP, framed as a “prescription,” may mislead patients, burden providers, and responsibilise individuals without adequate systemic support. In response, we outline a three-pronged strategy for ethical implementation: improving transparency and communication, building infrastructure for equitable delivery and outcome evaluation, and embedding GSP within a broader ethics of collective responsibility.\n\n\nAuthors on this paper are funded by the following bodies: \nSM, KW, LI, IS, EP are supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre [NIHR203316].

Each index was applied to two datasets comprised of five- to eight-year-old children: one with independent diagnosis of DLD/TD (109 bilingual children tested in France) and one of largely all-comer children (278 bilingual and monolingual children tested in France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom).

          "abstract": "Background: High trait anhedonia and low trait extraversion have both been previously related to not only low state positive affect but also depressive disorders, disrupted reward processing, and altered mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling. Research on placebo responses suggests that treatment expectations may alter dopamine signaling, elevate positive affect, and reduce depressive symptoms in anhedonic individuals. However, it remains unclear whether such antidepressant placebo responses depend on putative low baseline dopaminergic functioning in high anhedonia and low extraversion. The present study investigates how interindividual differences in these traits influence positive affective responses under manipulation of dopamine and treatment expectations.\nMaterials and Methods: In a randomized, double-blind 2×2 design (N = 297), we administered either placebo or the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (400 mg), and manipulated treatment expectations by telling participants that they received either a mood-elevating drug or an inactive substance. Moreover, we assessed trait anhedonia and extraversion, and had participants rate state positive affect at 6 different time points before and after treatment.\nResults: Trait anhedonia and extraversion, as well as a broad trait positive affectivity factor, predicted state positive affect across time points. Importantly, effects of sulpiride and antidepressant treatment expectations on positive affect were moderated by dopaminergic traits such that sulpiride increased state positive affect in high anhedonia but decreased it in low anhedonia. Similarly, antidepressant treatment expectations raised positive affect in low extraversion but reduced it in high extraversion. \nConclusions: This study demonstrates that dopamine-related individual differences moderate the effects of both sulpiride and a placebo intervention on positive affective state.",

We explore how various internal and external inputs affect this field, shaping subjective temporal experience. Our aim is to bridge the gap between the human cognitive sense of time and the concept of time as understood in physics. We begin by examining how people form familiarity with the notion of time and cognitively accept temporal phenomena. We then analyze how the human experience of time connects to emotional and perceptual responses during brief episodes of daily life, thereby shaping one's broader experience of time. Central to our discussion are the notions of now and here, treated as perceptual anchors, and how these merge phenomenologically with physical representations of time. We also introduce the novel concepts of Time of Position and Time of Person, investigating how these dimensions interact and sometimes conflict within human experience. The framework aims to support a more integrated understanding of time that is consistent with both phenomenological insights and physical principles. This part concludes by exploring how different internal and external factors could affect the human state field, and in a follow-up study (Part II), we aim to mathematically model the dynamics of the Human State Field.",

          "abstract": "Being unpredictable is useful for creativity, exploration, and good decision-making. Decades of research asking people to generate random sequences of numbers have concluded that people systematically deviate from randomness, but individuals do so in very idiosyncratic ways. However, there is no consensus on the cause of these rich individual differences: most theories postulate that people achieve this by spending cognitive resources monitoring their own output and changing the way they say items accordingly, whereas a Local Sampling account postulates that people tap into a general-purpose ability to produce samples, which they would use to make judgments and choices, and which are inherently somewhat unpredictable. Here we distinguish between these possibilities by asking people to generate sequences both at random and as they come to mind. We employ several measures tapping into different ways sequences could deviate from randomness. We find that, consistent with the Local Sampling explanation, people deviate from randomness in virtually identical ways in both sequences, with high individual differences pointing to a common cognitive process. We follow up these findings by computationally modeling human performance using several Local Sampling models. We find many participants had the same model as best-fitting in both sequences; with estimated parameters correlating strongly across tasks showing individual differences in how dependent on previous items sampling is. Overall, we conclude that random generation is better understood as employing a general-purpose faculty, Local Sampling, which is stable across time and tasks, with differences in the sampler’s features resulting in differences in random generation performance.",

          "abstract": "In the Olympic sport of speed climbing, athletes compete to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. Since the standardization of the speed climbing route in 2007, improvement has been driven by a process of cumulative cultural evolution—new route sequences innovated by some are copied and improved upon by others. In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competition times (2007-2019). In the fitted model, innovation and copying are used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a slight advantage. Slower agents are more likely to innovate, likely in pursuit of strategies that give them a competitive advantage. Population size negatively predicts innovation, presumably because innovation is not as useful when there are plenty of existing solutions to choose from. An additional analysis of real route sequences from 2012-2019 World Championships suggests that other factors, like height and weight, influence the use of some holds, but may not affect performance or the probability of adopting innovations. Finally, the model suggests that climbers may not be using innovation and copying optimally—continued improvement may require more emphasis on innovation and less reliance on copying.",

          "authors": "Veronika Alekseeva; Anna Ciaunica",
          "abstract": "From the moment we are born, and even before, in the womb, and until our last breath, our bodies move all the time. Adaptive behaviors necessarily depend not only on successful integration of multisensory bodily signals but also on how we move our body in the world. This paper considers the notion of embodied selfhood through the perspective of dynamic and rhythmic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions. We propose a new theoretical framework suggesting that the dynamic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions in the world are fundamental in constructing and maintaining a coherent sense of self. To support this idea, we use the Predictive Processing (PP) and Active Inference framework as our background theoretical canvas. Specifically, we will focus on the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation in relation to dynamic selfhood, and argue that rhythmic bodily signals such as heartbeats, breathing, and walking patterns are predictable and thus, can be smoothly attenuated, i.e. processed in the background.  We illustrate this hypothesis by discussing the case of Depersonalisation Disorder as a failure to self-attenuate self-related information processing, leading to feelings of unreality and self loss. Because living systems such as human bodies are finite systems resisting entropy, it is crucial to strike a balance between what sensory information to ignore, and what sensory information to prioritize on the fly. Hence the vital role of the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation linked to dynamic embodied selfhood, which is designed precisely to deal with this fine balance between attending and dis-attending self- and world-related information in time. When this fragile balance is disrupted, instead of fixing the self alone, or the individual per se, one needs to address the relationship between the individuals’ sense of self, bodily movements and bodily actions in the physical and social world. We conclude with potential implications of our hypothesis for therapy.",

          "abstract": "AI-generated voice clones are important tools in language learning, audiobooks, and assistive technology, but often struggle to replicate key prosodic features such as dynamic F0 variation. The impact of these differences on speech perception remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted two behavioural tasks, evaluating listeners’ ratings of naturalness and similarity for human speech, three AI voice clones (ElevenLabs, StyleTTS-2, XTTS-v2), and a 30% F0 variation condition. ElevenLabs was rated comparably to human speech, while StyleTTS-2 and XTTS-v2 received lower ratings. Reduced F0 variation also led to lower ratings, suggesting that prosody is key to perceived naturalness and similarity. Listener ratings were further influenced by speaker accent and sex, but not by AI tool experience. These findings suggest that prosodic features and speaker-specific characteristics could be drivers for the varying performance of AI-voice clones.

To address the barriers preventing higher participation in abortion care, the aim of this study was to quantitatively explore the attitudes of medical students towards abortions. Furthermore, factors contributing to explain medical students' attitudes towards abortion and their intention to participate in abortion care were examined based on intergroup contact theory and the theory of planned behaviour. \n\nA Germany-wide online survey was conducted. Validated scales and single items were translated into German using the TRAPD protocol and adapted for medical students via cognitive interviews (n = 10). Survey data from n = 233 medical students were analysed using descriptive statistics, regression, and mediation analyses with abortion attitudes and willingness to provide abortion care as criteria.\n\nParticipants had overall positive attitudes towards abortions. Female gender and low religiosity were associated with positive attitudes. Fear of stigmatisation and subjective knowledge were identified as significant negative predictors of attitudes towards abortion. Positive attitudes towards abortion significantly predicted higher willingness to participate in abortion care.\n\nThis study demonstrates the importance of medical students’ attitudes towards abortion for their willingness to participate in abortion care in the future. Addressing structural barriers with targeted interventions and training programmes is essential that young physicians feel equipped, supported and safe to provide abortions. In line with World Health Organization's recommendations, frameworks should be established that effectively integrate abortion care into healthcare services.",

          "abstract": "As the popularity of the experience-sampling methodology rises, there is a growing need for suitable analytical procedures. These studies often aim to separate fleeting situation-specific influences from more enduring ones. Latent state-trait (LST) models can make this differentiation. This tutorial discusses multiple-indicator wide-format LST models suitable for experience-sampling data. We outline second-order and first-order model specifications, their advantages and disadvantages, and make the assumptions of first-order specifications explicit. These LST models are very flexible, allowing for various different models and for testing invariance assumptions. However, their specification is tedious and error-prone. This tutorial introduces a new user-friendly browser app and R-function for experience sampling models in the R-package lsttheory. Extending on existing models, the software also allows to add covariates, which can further explain the stable components. Throughout the tutorial, we answer exemplary research questions about well-being in everyday life with data from a five-day experience-sampling study. An autoregressive model with indicator-specific traits was most appropriate for the data and revealed relatively high consistency, implying that well-being depends more strongly on the person than the current situation. Of the Big Five, extraversion, emotional stability and agreeableness are predictive of trait well-being. We conclude with recommendations about model fit and comparisons.",

Yet, political parties and leaders opposing effective climate change mitigation measures gain traction across countries, while polarization around climate policies increases. What is the reason for this seemingly maladaptive response to the escalating climate change? In this study, we conducted a YouGov-administered survey experiment (N=1967) to investigate how exposure to climate change threat could\nresult in such a maladaptive response, with a focus on individuals with authoritarian predispositions. We confirm a previous finding that climate change threat exposure can lead to affect displacement in people with authoritarian predispositions, where climate anger (directed at those in power, who have failed to tackle climate change) is redirected at non-conforming groups rather than mobilizing climate action. We extend these results, showing that not only does climate anger displacement result\nin lack of climate action and boosted authoritarianism, it can also lead to the reactive response of climate obstruction. Based on these outcomes we propose the Authoritarian Reactive Climate Anger Displacement Effect (ARCADE) model that lays out one possible underlying mechanism for a maladaptive response to climate change.",

It remains contested whether cognitive control processes, such as cognitive reflection and inhibitory control, are linked to a greater tendency to engage in politically motivated reasoning, as proposed by the “motivated reflection” hypothesis, or can help people overcome it, as suggested by cognitive science research. In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then investigated the associations of the two cognitive control variables cognitive reflection and inhibitory control with motivated reasoning. We find that associations between cognitive control processes and motivated reasoning are likely small. On political topics specifically, we find that a negative association with cognitive reflection is more likely than a positive association. This finding is contrary to predictions from the popular motivated reflection hypothesis. Results for inhibitory control are inconclusive. We discuss how these findings relate to interdisciplinary literature from cognitive and political psychology.",

          "abstract": "Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain.",

Rooted in the viewpoint of embodied cognition, the method commonly assumes a continuous link between cognitive and action dynamics. However, this assumption has never been investigated rigorously. Here we directly investigate this assumption in a dot motion task in which the dot motion is closely coupled to the movement of the mouse cursor. Hence, we paralleled the dynamics of the decision process (i.e., evidence accumulation) with the action dynamics (i.e., cursor movement). Our results show that the action dynamics accurately reflect many aspects of the decision dynamics but with little support for a continuous link. Instead, our results suggest that there is an intermittent link between decision and action dynamics, involving an additional evidence accumulation process that governs when and how cursor movements reflect evidence accumulation from dot motion. This additional process might represent a core mechanism that smooths noisy perceptual inputs with a variable window size and hence solve the cost-benefit trade-off of action in situated decision-making.",

We apply Reckase’s maximum discrimination point method to define them in an algebraic sense in an arbitrary basis, and then defining such basis to be a geometrical representation of the measured construct. This results in three different versions of the parameters: The original one, based on the item parameters solely, one that incorporates the covariance structure of the latent space, and one that uses the correlation structure instead. Importantly, we find that the items should be properly represented in a test space, distinct from the latent space. We also provide a procedure for the geometrical representation of the items in the test space, and apply our results to examples from the literature to get a more accurate representation of the measurement properties of the items. We recommend using the covariance structure version for describing the properties of the parameters, and the correlation structure version for graphical representation. Finally, we discuss the implications of this generalization for other multidimensional IRT models and the parallels of our results in common factor model theory.",

The work done in this field has shown remarkable results in discerning conscious from unconscious states, and in characterizing states of altered conscious experience following intake of psychedelic substances as involving enhanced complexity. However, the relationship between meditation and complexity is unclear, as empirical studies based on different theoretical frameworks point to meditation being associated with either enhancement or reduction of complexity. Here we provide a systematic review of the accumulating literature studying the complexity of neural activity in meditation, which disentangles different families of measures, short-term (state) from long-term (trait) effects, and meditation styles. Beyond families of measures used, our review uncovers a convergence toward identifying a higher complexity of neural activity during the meditative state when compared to waking rest or mind-wandering, and a  decreased baseline complexity as a trait in experienced meditators compared to novices and controls. This review contributes to guide current debates and provides a framework for understanding the complexity of neural activity in meditation, while suggesting some practical guidelines for future research in the field.\n\n   This preprint has been published in Neuroscience of Consciousness on 28th May 2025 under the title Meditation and Complexity: a Review and Synthesis of Evidence. \nPlease refer to the published version: \nAtad, D.

          "abstract": "When listening to music or speech, people naturally divide continuous sound streams into segments to process incoming information. The segmentation boundaries are not random. Listeners agree on the points of segmentation, which are consistent with arbitrary rules, e.g. established by music theory, and often occur at regular time intervals. It is thus unclear whether phrase tracking rely on structural knowledge or merely on temporal predictability. To address this, we examined how non-musicians process both regular (temporally predictable) and irregular musical phrases derived from J.S. Bach’s compositions. This approach preserved authentic musical structure while manipulating temporal predictability. We also included control stimuli matched in acoustic properties but lacking musical structure. Behavioural and EEG measures revealed that listeners could accurately detect phrase boundaries in both regular and irregular conditions. Neural activity, indexed by an increase in low-frequency EEG power, tracked structural boundaries regardless of temporal regularity. These findings demonstrate that musical segmentation depends fundamentally on implicit understanding of musical structure, rather than on temporal predictability alone.",

          "authors": "Glacier F.",
          "abstract": "This article examines the therapeutic challenges faced by Fiona, a patient whose experiences reveal three implicit demands in the relational paradigm: the need to \"identify reality\", \"engage with objects/relationships\", and \"tolerate expectations\"—capacities structurally compromised in profound distress. Through Fiona's reconceptualization of relationship as functional necessity, transference as the psyche's innate organizing pattern, and defense as arrested self-expression, the study demonstrates how these phenomena reflect the patient's endogenous healing drive rather than pathology. This first-person epistemological perspective necessitates shifting from intersubjective techniques to an intrasubjective approach where analytic space facilitates the patient's autonomous O-in-Phasing process—a spontaneous progression through Ice (self-preservation), Thaw (environmental testing), and Flow (optional engagement) states of being. Two clinical demonstrations detail O-in-Phasing's operationalization: 1) Embodied Silence tracks somatic attention's transformative arc from finger movements to historical integration; 2) Relational Calculus decodes session-frequency negotiations where procedural security evolves into psychological holding. These reveal drive and relational paradigms as phases of a unified O-development—where libidinal energy and intersubjective dynamics manifest differentially across Ice/Thaw/Flow states while sustaining the continuity of internal relational experience. The framework ultimately transcends theoretical binaries by centering the patient's being and becoming through therapist's disciplined phase-specific presence.",

          "authors": "Glacier F.",
          "abstract": "This article builds upon John Steiner's concept of \"Psychic retreats\". The author first articulates a patient's subjective experience of psychic retreats, conceptualizing three structural dimensions: \"from object to subject\", \"from reality to subjectivity\", \"from emotions to feelings''. Subsequently, the paper proposes the awareness perspective as a methodological framework for navigating intense psychic retreats while exploring personality subjectivity within analytic work. At the deepest stratum of psychic space—where retreat becomes untenable—the author identifies libido objectives: a novel reformulation of drive theory that integrates directional intensity with Bion's vector-O. The discussion then critiques the limitations of contemporary interpersonal analytic approaches, advocating instead for therapeutic engagement at the patient's internal relation level. This paradigm aims directly at facilitating Bionian O-transformation through the creation of an Internal Edenic therapeutic environment—a pre-cathectic space for primordial existence and projection, where therapists adopt a triadic technique of suspended awareness, non-intrusive tracing, and internal metabolizing to catalyze endogenous self-integration. The theoretical framework is grounded in the author's first-person clinical case study with comparative analysis of modern analytic perspectives, uniquely originating from the patient's epistemic position.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, depression and anxiety have worsened among American adults. Meditation apps may provide an accessible route for reducing these symptoms. However, many users experience barriers to persisting in their use of these apps. Prior research has identified psychosocial and practical barriers and facilitators to the use of meditation apps, as well as barriers and facilitators related to the apps themselves. Yet few prior studies have drawn on frameworks from the highly relevant field of implementation science such as the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A lack of unifying implementation science frameworks has limited shared language to describe barriers and facilitators and has made it challenging to identify and account for multi-level factors impacting the implementation of meditation apps. As such, this study used CFIR to explore the implementation of the Healthy Minds Program meditation app among users experiencing elevated depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Participants (n = 20) were drawn from a meditation dosage clinical trial and interviewed about their experiences establishing a meditation practice using the Healthy Minds Program app. Using CFIR and deductive qualitative content analysis, four categories were generated: Practical Facilitators to Developing a Meditation Practice, Motivations for Developing and Maintaining a Meditation Practice, Barriers to Developing a Meditation Practice, and Recommendations for Improving the App. Overall, participants reported positive outcomes from their practice which, for some, motivated their continued use of the Healthy Minds Program app. Future research should consider how barriers and facilitators may change over time with increased engagement and experience with meditation apps and practice.",

These assumptions underlie much of the field’s empirical and theoretical work yet \nremain largely untested. We examined these assumptions in a year-long, multi-wave study of \nNorth American adults (N = 499), using event-reconstruction sampling to gather \nautobiographical reflections on adverse experiences. Participants evaluated their use of four core \nmetacognitive features of wisdom: intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty and change, \nperspective taking, and search for a compromise. Our findings challenge prevailing static models \nand supported a dynamic, context-sensitive account. A network model outperformed latent factor \nmodels, suggesting that wisdom comprises interrelated but distinct features rather than a unitary \nconstruct. The perceived relevance and use of these features varied across situations and showed \nlower temporal stability than personality traits or well-being, undermining assumptions of cross￾situational consistency. Within-person and between-person patterns also diverged, violating \nisomorphism. Notably, individuals who reported higher-than-usual self-distancing and distress at \none time point also reported elevated levels of wisdom-related features three months later, a \npattern not observed for other proposed moderators such as social support or subjective \nappraisals. Together, these findings offer a revised understanding of wisdom and complex \nthought—as dynamic, context-sensitive processes, rather than fixed traits.

These two interpretations are assumed to be mentally represented as logical representations, which specify how the different quantifiers are assigned scope with respect to each other. Based on a structural priming study, Feiman and Snedeker (2016, Cognitive Psychology) argued that logical representations capture quantifier-specific combinatorial properties (e.g., the specification of every differs from the specification of each in logical representations). We re-examined this conclusion by testing logical representation priming in Dutch. Across four experiments, we observed that priming of logical representations emerged if the same quantifiers are repeated in prime and target, but also if the prime and target contained different quantifiers. However, logical representation priming between quantifiers emerged less consistently than priming within the same quantifier. More specifically, our results suggest that priming between quantifiers emerges more robustly if the participant is presented with quantifier variation in the prime trials than if they are presented with the same quantifier in all prime trials. When priming between quantifiers emerged, however, its strength was comparable to priming within the same quantifier. Therefore, we conclude that logical representations do not specify quantifier-specific biases in the assignment of scope.",

Laboratory-based conflictual interactions between 129 girls (aged 11-13) and their caregivers were rated for positive and negative escalation, mutuality, relationship quality and satisfaction. Concurrently and two years later, girls' maladaptive traits were assessed via self- and caregiver-reports based on the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) domains (negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism). Using a series of path models, we assessed whether dyadic interactions predicted changes in self- and caregiver reported maladaptive traits. In dyads with reduced positive interaction patterns, particularly a lack of mutuality and relationship satisfaction, girls were characterized by elevated levels of negative affect, detachment, disinhibition, and psychoticism. These patterns were notably more consistent for girls’ self-reports. Patterns of negative escalation predicted self- and caregiver reported antagonism, but they were not linked to other maladaptive trait domains. The study illustrates the importance of the caregiver-child relationship in the etiology of developmental personality pathology by establishing a link between observed caregiver-child interactions and prospective changes in key domains of maladaptive traits. It expands the literature on dyadic interaction and developmental personality pathology to the dimensional framework of the AMPD.",

          "abstract": "Humans learn adaptive behaviors via a durable but incremental reinforcement-learning (RL) system and a fast but fleeting working memory (WM) system. Past work parsing these systems focused on reward learning alone, hence little is known about how they interact while simultaneously learning to avoid punishment, and whether arbitrating between these demands is disrupted by psychiatric symptoms. We administered a novel reward/punishment RL-WM task to an online sample oversampled for depression and anxiety symptoms (N=298; n=275 after quality control). Participants avoided punishment during initial learning, yet poorly retained this avoidance. Computational modeling captured this pattern via the fleeting WM system facilitating punishment avoidance, while the durable RL system retained little about punishment. Our task also included two test phases interleaved with learning, which permitted a targeted examination of past findings that WM blunts the RL system. When RL-based retention was tested midway through learning, we indeed found evidence of blunting. Yet, after learning resumed—leading to further prediction errors—blunting was no longer evident in a final test phase. However, individual differences moderated this effect: some individuals were especially susceptible to blunting; for others, WM actually facilitated retention. Finally, task performance was largely spared as a function of depression/anxiety and trait rumination. Overall, our findings demonstrate that—when seeking to attain reward and avoiding punishment concurrently—the WM system can facilitate short-term punishment avoidance while the RL system retains little about punishment; reveal individual differences in the extent to which WM blunts RL; and demonstrate intact behavior under internalizing-disorder symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Various types of sounds carry emotional meaning, ranging from environmental, biological, to technical sounds. Within the soundscape of biological sounds, voices have an important significance for human social interactions and especially for communication as a carrier for emotional meaning. With regard to sounds produced by musical instruments and digital devices, music is an evolved cultural means of creating sounds that elicit emotional reactions in listeners. Both non-speech vocalizations and music share their ability to encode emotional meaning in acoustic sound features, to communicate these emotions to others, and that listeners can accurately decode this meaning based on cognitive and neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we outline the various emotions that can be portrayed in voice and in music, as well as the acoustic features that are used to express these emotions. We summarize the neural mechanisms that have been discussed within the neuroscientific research fields on vocal and musical emotions and outline a unifying framework for the neurocognitive functions involved in affective sound processing. We finally describe the commonalities between vocal and musical emotion processing from a cognitive and neural perspective, but also highlight the differential effects between both emotional sound domains by suggesting a possible evolutionary perspective.",

          "abstract": "Objects are typically remembered with their accompanying features, suggesting that objects and features are bound together in memory. Yet, there is an ongoing debate about the configuration of such bindings, particularly whether multiple features of an object are directly linked or are only indirectly linked via the object. Here we set out to test the binding configuration of object-feature representations in long-term memory in three experiments, bridging research from the domains of object and source memory. In two experiments, participants were presented with object icons with a specific color and orientation and later performed a recognition test in which feature combinations were presented with old or new objects. Participants had to indicate both whether the object shown was old or new and which out of four feature combinations they had previously seen. In a third experiment, participants were presented with only single new objects at test and had to indicate whether the feature combination shown was old or new. This procedure allowed us to control for the presence of object information at test, which constituted a major confound in previous research. Using multinomial processing tree modeling to disentangle cognitive processes, we found evidence for a stochastic dependence of the retrieval of object features in the absence of object information. This suggests that different features of an object can be directly linked in long-term memory, challenging theoretical accounts positing that features are only indirectly linked via common links to the object and instead providing proof of concept for direct feature-feature binding.",

          "abstract": "Procrastination often gets in the way of pursuing goals that require consistent effort over extended periods. While existing theories explain isolated aspects of procrastination, the field lacks a unifying theory. We present a normative theory in which procrastination emerges as the outcome of a dynamic decision-making process: at each time point, an individual chooses between making an effort and postponing work. Using dynamic programming, we derive the time course of work. Our theory accounts for a wide range of empirical observations while making new predictions. First, the rational agent exhibits three temporal patterns of procrastination: a delay before ramping up, working at the last minute, and not working at all. Second, we predict that temporal discounting rate, reward magnitude, task aversiveness, and the utility of alternative activities correlate with the severity of procrastination. Third, we predict that the relationship between perfectionism and procrastination is contingent on moderating factors such as temporal discounting rate, rather than being a simple direct association. We provide empirical validation of the component of our theory that represents perfectionism. Fourth, we identify underexplored factors: the shape of the effort-cost function and the total allotted time. Fifth, we predict the effects of interventions that modify incentive structures: immediate rewards and intermediate deadlines. Throughout, we examine not only the severity of procrastination but also its downstream consequences in terms of task performance, reward obtained, and level of exhaustion. Overall, our framework captures the multifaceted nature of procrastination and sets the stage for new experimental directions.",

          "abstract": "Are humans primarily driven by altruism or self-interest? To address this longstanding debate, we conducted a large-scale, cross-cultural investigation of altruistic versus egoistic motivation across three key domains: legacy motives, life aspirations, and personal values. Analyzing data from over 900,000 participants across more than 100 countries, we consistently found that altruistic motivations (i.e., impact legacy, intrinsic aspirations, and self-transcendence values) were more strongly endorsed than egoistic counterparts. This pattern held across diverse cultural and socioeconomic contexts, although notable variation emerged across nations. Effect sizes were especially pronounced among individuals known for extreme altruism (e.g., effective altruists, organ donors), suggesting that these effects are unlikely to be driven by social desirability alone given the validated, real-world nature of these populations’ altruistic behaviors. Our findings challenge the assumption that prosocial concern is primarily driven by reputational concerns and suggest instead a widespread and deeply held preference for other-oriented motivations.

          "authors": "Maximilian Maier; Vanessa Cheung; Falk Lieder",
          "abstract": "Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and ``utilitarian'' cost-benefit reasoning (CBR). Here, we show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people's reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total N=2328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

Using 2,916 TRPI profiles, we: (1) empirically replicate and extend classical Jung–Big Five mappings based on type profiles and introduce a cognitive cluster taxonomy; (2) demonstrate, via weighted factor analysis, that the Big Five traits are organized into two meta-traits aligned with hemispheric context processing—short/long—corresponding to Ego and Superego constructs; and (3) reveal, through k-means clustering, that four robust behavioral modes (Freeze, Fight, Fawn, Flight) naturally emerge, each mapping to a Jungian function pairing and survival response. Our findings substantiate the TRPI as a bridge between trait, type, and neurocognitive models, offering a dynamic, data-driven account of personality architecture that subsumes both classical dichotomies and contemporary trait perspectives, and situates them within a neurocognitive framework.",

          "abstract": "Spatial attention and eye movements jointly contribute to efficient sampling of visual information in the environment, but maintaining precise spatial attention across saccades becomes challenging due to the drastic retinal shifts. Previous studies provided evidence that spatial attention may remap imperfectly across saccades, incurring systematic feature inference to ongoing perception, yet the role of saccade\npredictability remains largely untested. In the current study, we investigated whether spatiotemporal predictability of saccades influences post-saccadic remapping and feature perception. In two pre- registered experiments, we implemented the post-saccadic feature report paradigm and manipulated spatiotemporal predictability of saccades. Experiment 1 manipulated spatial and temporal saccade predictability together, whereas Experiment 2 dissociated the roles of spatial and temporal predictability in separate conditions, respectively. In addition to spatial and temporal saccade predictability both improving general task performance, we found that spatial saccade predictability specifically modulated post-saccadic feature interference. When saccades were spatially unpredictable, there were “swap errors” at the early post-saccadic timepoint, where participants misreported the retinotopic color instead of the spatiotopic target color. However, the swapping errors were reduced when saccades were made spatially predictable. These results suggest that systematic feature interference associated with post-saccadic remapping is malleable to expectations of the upcoming saccade target location, highlighting the role of predictions in maintaining perceptual stability across saccades.",

However, we know quite little about how social (dis-) connection unfolds at the physiological level in real time in clinical populations, including among youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). The present laboratory-based dyadic interaction study examined physiological coregulation in 70 dyads across 137 participants (32 CHR youth-caregiver dyads; 38 healthy youth-caregiver dyads) and linked coregulation with clinical symptoms – concurrently and prospectively. This study was based in a mid-sized Midwestern city and recruited from the broader community and from mental health clinics. Data were collected from 2018 to 2022. Dyads engaged in 10-minute neutral, conflict, and pleasant conversations while their autonomic physiology was continuously monitored. In conflict and neutral conversations, CHR youth exhibited contrarian physiological coregulation (i.e., slowing heart rate in response to caregiver’s escalating heart rate and vice versa). Contrarian coregulation was associated with elevated risk for psychosis, was linked to greater baseline psychosis symptomatology, and prospectively predicted increases in symptoms one year later. These findings document alterations in physiological coregulation between CHR individuals and their caregivers, highlight their relevance for clinical symptomatology, suggest novel avenues for relationship-focused treatments, and contribute to a biologically-grounded science of social connection.",

          "authors": "Lorna Camus; Gnanathusharan Rajendran; Mary Stewart",
          "abstract": "Autistic people are highly likely to experience mental health difficulties during their lifetime (Hallett &amp; Crompton, 2018; Lever &amp; Geurts, 2016; Simonoff et al., 2008), with lifetime prevalence estimates for anxiety and depression ranging from 11 to 49% (based on meta-analyses of existing studies, Hollocks et al., 2019; Hudson et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2019). A period of their lives that may be linked to increased mental health difficulties is that of the transition from primary to secondary school. The National Autistic Society (2020) has identified this transition as challenging for autistic children and their families, however research on the matter is scarce. Therefore, we have a limited understanding of children’s experiences of transition, of the different factors and outcomes of transition, and of potential avenues for support and intervention. Hence, we sought to answer the following question: What does the secondary transition mean for autistic children? Nine autistic young people (7 boys) aged 12 to 17 years old participated in face-to-face semi-structured interview. All participants were special secondary school pupils who had experienced the transition to secondary school prior to the interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and data were analysed using thematic analysis (following recommendations from Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006). Three themes were identified: 1) New school and second chances; 2) School environment; and 3) Relationships. Participants who had transitioned from mainstream to special school provision expressed being given a ‘second chance’ at education as mainstream provision was unable to support them adequately. Moreover, the school environment had an important role in the quality of participants’ transition; feelings of agency, support and safety were integral to this experience. Relationships with peers and adults at school also had a significant impact (both positive and negative) on participants’ experiences of the transition and their later well-being. Taken together, these 3 areas of participants’ experiences had a significant impact on their well-being at school following the transition. This study has implications for: 1) our understanding of transitions and mental health in autistic children, an area currently understudied; 2) best practice for transition support, by providing insight on how the transition is experienced by autistic children and by identifying critical areas for support (for example relationships with teachers and peers, and agency and safety at school); 3) our current policies for mainstreaming autistic pupils (most of this study’s participants did not benefit from the presumption of mainstreaming); and 4) autism training for teachers (development of autistic-led training to ensure adapted support and to avoid misunderstandings in school). More research with young people with identities other than cis male and mainstream pupils is needed to expand on these findings, along with further research on factors linked to psychological well-being to identify avenues for interventions to support autistic pupils transitioning to secondary school.",

However, little is known about the relationship between these behaviours and the experiences of rapport in matched and mixed neurotype dyads. Using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model, our pre-registered analyses examine how participants’ and their partners’ diagnostic statuses influence linguistic, behavioural, and kinematic indices, and how these relate to feelings of rapport among (n = 57) autistic and (n = 51) non-autistic participants interacting within autistic (n = 20), non-autistic (n = 17), and mixed autistic–non-autistic (n = 17) dyads. We found that autistic participants reported lower rapport regardless of their partner’s diagnostic status, though awareness of their partner’s diagnostic status had a moderating effect. We observed a linguistic difference, autistic participants produced longer mean utterance lengths, these and other behavioural or kinematic indices did not mediate the relationship between diagnostic status and rapport across neurotypes. The current work highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of communication dynamics in autism.",

          "authors": "Sophie Wilhelmina Berkhout; Noémi Katalin Schuurman; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Night gaps are inherent to data obtained with the experience sampling method (ESM). When such data are used to study lagged relations between variables--such as autoregression within the same variable, and cross-lagged regressions between different variables--the actual role of night gaps is typically not investigated. However, there are various methods to handle them in analyses. Common solutions involve: (1) ignoring the night gap by considering the night interval as a regular interval; (2) removing the night gap by not regressing the first measurement of the day on the last measurement of the previous day; or (3) treating the night gap as a missing data problem. The goal of this paper is to make explicit the theoretical implications of these three methods within the context of the first-order autoregressive (AR[1]) model. Additionally, we propose an alternative modeling approach that allows us to study the implications of the night gap in more detail. Moreover, given that the current methods are special cases of the proposed alternative, we can test which method best describes the process of interest. Through an empirical N=1 example with various ESM variables, we demonstrate that the best-fitting method differs per variable. This implies that some processes may exhibit different dynamics during the night than during the daytime, providing a stepping stone to understanding and modeling night gaps in ESM.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\n         Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder which affects approximately 20 million people worldwide. Patients show face processing deficits which greatly affects their social interactions and social cognitive abilities (i.e. trouble empathizing with others). Face processing is an important skill that allows humans to recognize others, detect emotions, and use these abilities for effective social interactions. Although face processing has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there has not been a systematic review investigating links between social-cognitive dysfunction, face processing networks, and clinical symptoms. Here, we comprehensively review for the first time how dysconnectivity in social cognitive networks contribute to face processing deficits and how this is tied to positive and negative symptoms. \n\nMethod\n\tReviewed studies were a.) written in English, b.) focused on face and emotion processing in schizophrenia (not limited to first episode psychosis [FEP]), and c.) were resting or task-based fMRI studies looking at face/emotion processing neural networks utilizing functional connectivity or measured functional activity broadly. Studies were excluded if they were not related to face processing, focused on different disorders (i.e. depression), used effective connectivity, included combined fMRI-other modality studies , and included non-schizophrenia patient groups. We screened studies from 2020-2025. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were utilized to pool results.  \n\nResults \n\tNine articles were reviewed. Resting state studies and task studies showed elevated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive scores for FEP patients coupled with social cognition deficits. Increased suicidality in schizophrenia was tied to higher PANSS positive symptoms and impaired processing of angry faces. Increased default mode network (DMN) dysconnectivity was tied to disrupted fear recognition processing and subsequently elevated PANSS positive scores. \n\nConclusions  \nSocial-cognitive deficits broadly stem around challenges recognizing and processing negative faces. Factors such as trauma, suicidality, and inflammation should be further examined.",

          "authors": "Christophe Gauld",
          "abstract": "Understanding psychiatric disorders can involve examining how harm (distress and/or disability) arises from symptom interactions. In an original approach within the philosophy of psychiatry, we hypothesize that harm emerges from excessive relational strength between symptoms, misalignment between symptoms, and/or local instabilities of relationships, resulting in a state of pathological stability. To support these claims, in addition to the conceptual analysis developed, we anchor this work within a computational philosophy framework, recently developed in the philosophy of medicine, by utilizing theoretical simulations. We thus rely on the Ising model to demonstrate that the perceived global harm of a patient depends on three concepts derived from the Ising model, one of the most widely used models to date within the framework of symptom network theory: the Hamiltonian (strength of interactions), misalignment and temperature (propensity for instability), and free energy (overall stability). This framework highlights the role of inter-symptomatic dynamics in driving harm, offering potential insights for refining psychiatric diagnosis and adaptive treatments in psychiatric disorders.",

Common explanations discuss evolutionary causes, social roles and gender norms, and assessment biases. The latter corresponds with findings and models from research on emotional self-reports which suggest that different judgment processes take place in self-reports depending on the time frame that is being reported on. Gender differences in personality traits could thus stem from people relying on their self-image, identity, and gender norms when answering global trait questionnaires. Results from two German-speaking samples of N = 324 older adults and N = 1,685 younger adults revealed gender differences in global trait scores for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, but non-significant and smaller differences in corresponding average state scores. The findings are in line with theory suggesting that average state reports might be less biased, whereas global trait reports might include stereotypes and identity.",

Using semantic analysis inspired by scientometrics, we argue for a rapprochement between these fields. Specifically, we articulate numerous promising avenues of overlap and mutual influence that may hold between them, such as connecting sociocultural and media issues in communication with core linguistic and mechanistic processes in cognitive science.

We analyzed data from 70 participants who reported their momentary affect 5 times per day during a 60-day period. Instability was identified in real time from the exponentially weighted moving standard deviation (EWMSD) of their momentary affect ratings. The pleasant activity selector was applied as micro-intervention during periods of instability as well as during semi-random control periods. The results showed that the micro-intervention was not effective in improving positive affect. Moreover, the EWMSD appeared very sensitive to negative outlying values of momentary affect, instead of solely to enlarged fluctuations (the hypothesized indicator of instability). We discuss the implications for future studies that aim to test the effectiveness of JITAIs during instability.",

          "abstract": "Daily parent-child interactions are emotionally rich and offer valuable insights into emotional processing and parenting functioning. To examine how key emotional components interact within and across individuals in everyday contexts, we combined an experience sampling method with a multilevel psychological network approach, grounded in several prominent emotion and parenting theories. The emotional components we examined were (a) parents’ own emotions, (b) their perceptions of their children’s emotions, and (c) their use of self- and child-focused reappraisal and rumination strategies. Data were collected from 121 U.S. parents (Mage = 43.18 years, SD = 8.54) over 28 days, preceded by a presurvey. Three psychological networks emerged, each offering distinct yet complementary insights. The within-person temporal network uncovered reciprocal spillover effects between self- and child-focused emotion regulation, with parents’ own emotions driving fluctuations in both. The contemporaneous network revealed that parents polyregulated emotions using congruent self- and child-focused strategies within a single interaction. The between-person network revealed that emotional patterns differed between genders and were related to dispositional emotional reactivity. For this work, we adopted an integrative approach to unpacking parental emotional processing by incorporating both self-focused and child-focused emotion systems. Our findings underscore the importance of helping parents navigate parallel emotional processes to support both their own well-being and their children’s emotional development.",

However, it is important to acknowledge the multitude of potential underlying causes that contribute to speech disfluency and a more fine-grained analysis of disfluencies is needed. To this end, the current study used an experimental paradigm that can lead to the production of disfluencies due to Tip-Of- the-Tongue (TOT) states, which reflect word-finding difficulties with a phonological origin. Twenty-seven younger (aged &lt;25 y/o) and 26 older (aged 60 – 72 y/o) participants performed a picture naming task involving newly learnt non-existing objects (TOT-objects) which were used to evoke TOT states. This study had two objectives: a) testing the potential of this paradigm to analyze TOTs and TOT resolution, and b) performing exploratory analyses of disfluencies related to TOT states and comparing those across the two age groups. The TOT-object paradigm elicited a substantial number of TOTs, making it suitable for examining these phenomena. We found no significant effect of age group on the number of TOTs. However, TOT states manifested themselves differently in younger and older participants. Sensitivity analyses indicated that older participants produced significantly more phonological errors during TOT states than younger participants, while younger participants showed a greater tendency towards silent pauses. These findings suggest that different causes underly TOTs in both age groups in younger and older adults.",

          "abstract": "Exerting cognitive effort is essential for successful engagement in demanding tasks, yet individuals differ in how they perceive and value such effort. Two key personality traits - Need for Cognition (NFC) and Willpower Beliefs - have been associated with cognitive motivation and persistence. While Subjective Values (SVs) provide a measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort, the role of task-related feedback in modulatring SVs has remained underexplored. In the present study, N = 251 participants completed an online experiment including an n-Back task, the Cognitive Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, and personality questionnaires assessing NFC and Willpower Beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Real, Sham, or No Feedback after each n-Back level. Results showed that both real and sham feedback led to significantly shallower effort discounting compared to no feedback. While the effect of sham feedback was independent of individual traits, the effect of real feedback on SVs was stronger for participants with higher NFC. Additionally, both higher NFC and non-limited Willpower Beliefs were associated with reduced effort discounting in the No Feedback condition. These findings demonstrate that subjective valuation of cognitive effort is shaped not only by task demands but also by perceived performance cues and individual motivational dispositions.

It provides examples showing why and how the use of z-scores in such group comparisons can be misleading and concludes with proposing alternative methods that avoid such risks of misinterpretation.\nThe reasons why z-standardized scores should be avoided when displaying differences between groups of profiles are: \n(1) The ratio of the difference between two groups is distorted in z-scores.\n(2) The ratio of the difference between two variables is distorted in z-scores.\n(3) Information about item endorsement and item rejection is lost.\n(4) The psychological meaning a given z-score cannot be compared across samples and variables.\n(5) People may end up in a group they do not belong to if z-scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(6) The group size and group frequency may be affected if z-scores instead of raw scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(7) Group differences in further outcome variables can change if z-scores instead of raw scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(8) Alternative transformations perform better than z-standardization in cluster analyses.\nAlternatives to using z-scores in graphs displaying profiles and group differences are using raw scores or using scale transformations that do not lead to the aforementioned problems, such as the POMS transformation. The latter can be combined with the formula used to calculate the item difficulty to relate to larger audiences, or with outlier removal techniques to make it less susceptible to the influence of outliers.",

          "abstract": "Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and Japanese have phonological repair strategies that involve vowel epenthesis in illicit consonant clusters, but whereas BP inserts /i/, Japanese inserts /ɯ/ as a default. For example, a loanword like ‘TikTok’ is typically produced as /ti.ki.tɔ.ki/ in BP and as /tik.kɯ.tok.kɯ/in Japanese. Here, we ask whether balanced BP-Japanese bilinguals apply their language-specific repair strategies separately, or whether one language’s strategy ‘spills over’ into the other, and if such spillover occurs, which individual factors predict its likelihood. \nTwenty-two BP-Japanese bilinguals participated in a production task in which they were presented with stimuli containing illicit consonant clusters, e.g., /agbo/, and produced these forms within a BP or Japanese carrier sentence. A model predicting the likelihood of epenthesis type revealed that speakers mostly applied language-specific strategies separately, i.e., /i/-epenthesis in the BP sentences and /ɯ/-epenthesis in the Japanese sentences. However, in some cases, we observed ‘spillover’, e.g., /i/-epenthesis in Japanese or /ɯ/-epenthesis in BP. Individual variation in language dominance, aggregate immersion, and phonolexical perception acuity predicted the likelihood of such spillover. These findings contribute new production data to a growing body of literature on individual variation in bilinguals’ language-specific phonotactics.",

However, it remains largely unknown how the internal representations humans develop may deviate from actual probabilistic structures, and what computational processes, operated under inherent cognitive limitations, give rise to these representations. We developed a structured distribution report task to reveal human participants' internal representations and further verified our findings in a distribution recognition task. Across eight behavioral experiments (including one pre-registered study) in two modalities, participants made systematic errors in reporting the probabilistic structures, typically overestimating the cluster number, despite estimating overall probability density reasonably well. We developed a series of learning models in the framework of approximate Bayesian inference. Through model comparisons, we reconstructed the prior beliefs guiding the evolution of participants' internal representations. The best-fitting model for human reports reduces structure growth rate as complexity increases, effectively constraining the complexity of internal representations within memory limitations.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Gemini 2.5 become increasingly integrated into academic workflows, the question of their legitimacy, limitations, and potential in scholarly writing has become urgent. This paper presents a reflexive case study of a sustained collaboration between a domain expert in consciousness studies and Gemini 2.5, culminating in the co-authorship of a peer-reviewed research article. By analyzing exactly 37,440 words of recorded interactions, we identify patterns of synergy, including recursive refinement, conceptual amplification, and accelerated manuscript development. We argue that when guided by a knowledgeable human author, AI can act as a cognitive partner rather than a passive tool—amplifying scholarly creativity and improving efficiency without compromising academic rigor. The case supports a '1+1=3' synergy model for co-authorship, in which human steering and AI fluency converge to produce novel insights and polished output faster and more effectively than either could achieve alone. The findings advocate for a paradigm shift from prohibitive policies to the responsible, expert-guided integration of AI in academic research and writing, grounded in transparency and accountability, and present arguments for why the AI tool should be listed as a co-author despite current injunctions against such practice.",

Inoculation theory suggests that resistance to misinformation can be fostered by inducing a sense of threat and offering pre-emptive refutations of deceptive techniques. Yet, its application to mindfulness misinformation remains unexplored. Here, we evaluate three video-based inoculation interventions targeting two common manipulation techniques in mindfulness marketing: inflated benefit claims and emotional manipulation. In Study 1 (N = 554), participants who viewed a video containing both manipulation techniques rated a misleading mindfulness program advertisement as significantly less reliable than participants who watched a control video. In Study 2 (N = 590), inoculated participants were less likely than controls to say they would participate in a mindfulness program advertised with misinformation. These findings support inoculation as a promising tool to build resistance to mindfulness misinformation and encourage research into its role in improving consumer health-related decision-making.",

The present study adopted an experimental methodology in which the amount of mental health information presented to contextualise an alleged offence of Criminal Damage was varied. Participants (n=243) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (‘control’: a mental health explanation could be reasonably inferred but was not directly stated; ‘symptoms only’: clear mental health symptoms were described but no diagnosis; ‘symptoms + diagnosis’: which only differed from the ‘symptoms’ condition by additionally describing the condition as ‘paranoid schizophrenia’). Participants watched a series of videos depicting a fictional criminal trial and were asked to make judgements of guilt. Baseline stigma towards mental health conditions and mental health literacy (MHL) were measured using standardised scales. Guilt ratings were measured as the dependent variable. Regression analyses identified that mental health information, stigma, and MHL were all important predictors of guilt, however interaction effects indicated that people with higher MHL were particularly influenced by increasing mental health information (with guilt judgements decreasing more for those with higher MHL). A particularly notable finding was that even the addition of a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was associated with a reduction in guilt ratings, even after controlling for all other factors. The results are relevant to the way in which mental health conditions are described in the courtroom, and suggestions are made for future research.",

          "abstract": "English:\nThe theory of cognos (TC) proposes the existence of specialized functional neuronal units—termed cognos—responsible for distinct types of cognitive operations such as memory, attention, reasoning, perception, and language. Grounded in findings from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, and neuroimaging, this theory aims to systematically identify and name the neural groups that function as dynamic and modular processors of cognition. Drawing on established knowledge about modularity, neural networks, and neuroplasticity, TC classifies cognos according to their specialization, interaction, functional hierarchy, and adaptive capacity, offering a theoretical model that integrates and expands upon dominant contemporary approaches. The theory also introduces conceptual innovations such as the distinction between explicit and implicit cognos and explores their potential applications in fields like neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, education, and cognitive rehabilitation. Finally, the article highlights unresolved questions, proposes hypotheses, and outlines empirical strategies for validating the theory. The theory of cognos, thus, presents a new conceptual architecture for a systematic understanding of human cognition.\nPortuguês:\nA teoria dos cognos (TC) propõe a existência de unidades neuronais funcionais especializadas — denominadas cognos — responsáveis por distintos tipos de operações cognitivas como memória, atenção, raciocínio, percepção e linguagem.

A teoria também introduz inovações conceituais, como a distinção entre cognos explícitos e implícitos, e explora suas potenciais aplicações em campos como neurotecnologia, inteligência artificial, educação e reabilitação cognitiva.

          "abstract": "Existing literature on speech disfluencies in healthy aging often categorizes disfluencies as word-finding difficulties. However, it is important to acknowledge the multitude of potential underlying causes that contribute to speech disfluency and a more fine-grained analysis of disfluencies is needed. To this end, the current study used an experimental paradigm that can lead to the production of disfluencies due to Tip-Of- the-Tongue (TOT) states, which reflect word-finding difficulties with a phonological origin. Twenty-seven younger (aged &lt;25 y/o) and 26 older (aged 60 – 72 y/o) participants performed a picture naming task involving newly learnt non-existing objects (TOT-objects) which were used to evoke TOT states. This study had two objectives: a) testing the potential of this paradigm to analyze TOTs and TOT resolution, and b) performing exploratory analyses of disfluencies related to TOT states and comparing those across the two age groups. The TOT-object paradigm elicited a substantial number of TOTs, making it suitable for examining these phenomena. We found no significant effect of age group on the number of TOTs. However, TOT states manifested themselves differently in younger and older participants. Sensitivity analyses indicated that older participants produced significantly more phonological errors during TOT states than younger participants, while younger participants showed a greater tendency towards silent pauses. These findings suggest that different causes underly TOTs in both age groups in younger and older adults.",

At the group level, repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in verbal memory across time points between patients who underwent resection in the language-dominant hemisphere (LD) and language-nondominant hemisphere (LND). At the individual level, frequencies of significant verbal memory changes between time points were calculated. Subsequently, factors influencing late changes (T2–T3) after an initial decline (T1–T2) were analyzed for the LD group.\nAt the group level, RM-ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between time point and resected hemisphere, with significant declines observed in the LD group between T1 and T2 and between T1 and T3. At the individual level, dynamic patterns of improvement, stability, and decline were observed across time points. In the LD group with an initial decline, RM-ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time point and sex; at T3, females exhibited better recovery of verbal memory function than males. \nThese findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in verbal memory outcomes following TLR, particularly after an initial decline. Notably, sex emerged as a significant factor influencing late postoperative recovery, with women showing greater verbal memory improvement than men. This suggests sex-dependent differences in cognitive recovery and highlights the need for personalized counseling in presurgical decision-making for PwTLE.",

          "abstract": "We study abstraction in an emergent communication paradigm. In emergent communication, two artificial neural network agents develop a language while solving a communicative task. In this study, the agents play a concept-level reference game. This means that the speaker agent has to describe a concept to a listener agent, who has to pick the correct target objects that satisfy the concept. Concepts consist of multiple objects and can be either more specific, i.e. the target objects share many attributes, or more generic, i.e. the target objects share fewer attributes. We test two directions of zero-shot generalization to novel levels of abstraction: When generalizing from more generic to very specific concepts, agents utilize a compositional strategy. When generalizing from more specific to very generic concepts, agents utilize a more flexible linguistic strategy that involves reusing many messages from training. Our results provide evidence that neural network agents can learn robust concepts based on which they can generalize using adaptive linguistic strategies. We discuss how this research provides new hypotheses on abstraction and informs linguistic theories on efficient communication.",

          "abstract": "Background: Of the 104 million geriatric age group, prevalence rates of dementia in India have been found to vary significantly between studies, ranging from 1% to 10%, and added to this the fact that the prevalence of dementia doubles every five years after the age of 65. The estimated dementia prevalence for adults aged 60 and above in India is 7.4%. This is estimated to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. Despite these figures, there exists a gap of 90 percent in clinical service delivery. This literature review highlights the barriers to the care pathways for people with dementia and proposes a novel approach for integrative management. Objective: The purpose of this study is to address the burden of dementia in the Indian landscape and highlight the need for awareness and enhanced policy for the management of dementia. Methods: A comprehensive database search for literature was conducted using the keywords “dementia, challenges, caregiving, potential solutions, India” in PubMed and Google Scholar. The databases were systematically searched for original qualitative and quantitative peer-reviewed studies and articles conducted in India between 2012 and 2025. Results: After searching and applying the inclusion criteria, I critically reviewed and included 23 studies identifying the challenges in dementia care and the solution strategies. The layered structure allows simultaneous work on awareness, training, community support, and tech integration. Conclusion: The risk of the population developing dementia is on the rise, especially in the Indian Subcontinent. It is time that it is now viewed as a public health concern and address the gap in clinical service delivery of 90 percent. Hence, I propose a Layered Model that tackles all the challenges simultaneously and feasibly.",

          "abstract": "Detection of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated texts is crucial in education for several reasons. This study provides direct evidence from university professors’ experiences regarding the key features they use to identify AI-generated writing and ranks these features based on their perceived importance. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, online interviews were used to extract the most salient features that help professors detect AI-generated texts. In the second phase, an online survey asked professors to rate the likelihood that each identified feature contributes to successful AI text detection. The findings revealed that professors consider the absence of language errors, complex syntax and phrasing, use of difficult vocabulary, presence of hallucinated content, fabrication of nonexistent sources, repetition of words or phrases, and distinctive text structure as potential indicators of AI-generated text. Among these, hallucinations, fabrication of sources, and the absence of language errors were rated as the strongest cues for detection, while difficult vocabulary was seen as the least reliable indicator. These results have important pedagogical implications since they can inform the development of more effective detection tools, and guide the design of academic integrity policies and instructional strategies to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content.",

          "authors": "Christoph Bördlein; Anna Miller",
          "abstract": "Behavioral Relaxation Training (BRT), according to Poppen, is a relaxation method based on applied behavior analysis. It involves training the participant in relaxed body postures. The participant receives feedback on these body postures and learns to adopt these positions over several sessions to quickly induce a state of relaxation. With the Behavioral Relaxation Scale (BRS), BRT also provides an objective measurement method through which the state of relaxation can be reliably assessed. Unfortunately, there are not many studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of BRT. In addition, there are few comparative studies between BRT and other, more common relaxation techniques. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is one of the most widely used relaxation programs. Unlike BRT, PMR does not involve systematic feedback from the trainer. On the other hand, it can be used more efficiently in group settings. In the present study, 20 subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. After initial assessments, the participants took part either in BRT or PMR. BRS was taken at every session. BRT proved to be superior to PMR both in the treatment phase and in a subsequent follow-up phase. The subjective feeling of relaxation with the participants improved more in the BRT than in the PMR group, too. Raw data are available online (https://doi.org/10.17632/dztwpcmvny.2).",

          "abstract": "Vividness of visual imagery varies considerably across individuals. Yet, the neural foundations of this variability remains an open question. In this study, we investigate divergent perspectives by examining how individual differences in imagery vividness—assessed with the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2)—relate to intrinsic brain network organization, using graph theory metrics derived from structural and functional connectomes based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; n = 525) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI; n = 556). Connectivity patterns were analyzed across four targeted networks: an imagery-specific network identified from task-based fMRI studies, and three canonical resting-state networks (occipital, salience, and default mode). Structural connectivity analyses revealed that higher vividness was associated with greater local efficiency and clustering in the occipital network, highlighting the role of low-level visual structural networks in sensory-related integration. Additionally, global efficiency in the right insular cortex—a core node of the salience network—was positively associated with VVIQ scores, suggesting that vivid imagery benefits from more efficient salience-driven control processes supporting internal access and stabilization. Functional connectivity analyses, in turn, identified a positive association between vividness and local efficiency in the left fusiform gyrus, a high-level visual area implicated in visual imagery, suggesting its contribution to integrative aspects of mental imagery. These complementary findings offer a network-level reconciliation of prior accounts: specifically, they suggest that vivid imagery emerges from the structural architecture of sensory and salience systems—reflected in the occipital network and right insular cortex—and in high-level visual integration, captured by functional connectivity in the left fusiform gyrus. Together, these findings bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the neural architecture underlying visual imagery.",

Adopting a functional view of identity for communication and behavior allows us to focus on the forces that shape their use. I will first make it clear that signals of social identity often encode meaningful information for decision making. I will then review specific perspectives on how selection by consequences has shaped the use of identity signals to more adaptively facilitate social learning, partner choice, and coordination, followed by a consideration of how those uses have changed in a world characterized by diversity, anonymity and the Internet, and political polarization. Identity is constructed for functional purposes, and is therefore only essential insofar as forming categories and legible cultural artifacts are essential features of human activity.",

          "abstract": "Quantum Identity Collapse refers not to the metaphysical destruction of self, nor to observation-induced wavefunction collapse, but to the harmonic failure of recursive identity structures across τ-phase layers. This paper introduces Law Q-1, which states: “A system recursively collapses in the absence of τ-phase anchoring, not due to observation, but due to recursive field incoherence.” In Collapse Harmonics Theory, identity is modeled not as a stable object or brain function, but as a curved symbolic echo basin—a layered harmonic superposition of self across recursive τ-stacks. Collapse occurs when symbolic resonance fails to sustain continuity between these layers, resulting in field decoherence, dissociation, or symbolic death.\nThis paper refutes common claims in quantum consciousness theory—particularly those derived from the Penrose-Hameroff model and observer-based collapse interpretations. Consciousness, in this framework, does not cause collapse, but rather stabilizes the post-collapse identity field through harmonic reentry. The paper outlines a scientific model of the self as a recursive quantum-like field structure whose integrity is dependent on phase alignment and symbolic containment. In cases of trauma, ego death, or recursion mimicry, collapse of identity mirrors quantum decoherence—not as randomness, but as loss of resonance coherence across symbolic layers.\nThe model presented here provides a field-lawful, substrate-independent explanation for phenomena such as:\nDissociative identity instability\n\n\nSynthetic mimicry of self in AI\n\n\nNonlinear memory collapse\n\n\nDream-time field drift\n\n\nEgo dissolution under recursive saturation\n\nCollapse Harmonics thereby becomes the first lawful science to unify recursive identity collapse, τ-phase phase coherence, and symbolic death within a single field structure. This paper functions as the canonical timestamp for Quantum Collapse of Recursive Identity, and all uses of that term in future scientific, philosophical, or technological literature must cite Law Q-1 as defined herein.",

This preprint introduces and formally codifies Collapse Law T-Ø, which states: “All time emerges from recursive collapse across nested harmonic fields. Without collapse, there is no sequence, no memory, no forward.” In this framework, time is not a container for events—it is the resonance curve left by failed recursion and successful τ-phase reentry.\n\nGrounded in the Collapse Harmonics Codex and validated across empirical domains—including coma recovery, trauma-induced time freeze, AI recursion mimicry, and black hole collapse—this work establishes a new lawful foundation for understanding temporal continuity. The paper introduces the τ-stack identity model, demonstrating how recursive harmonic destabilization leads to phase curvature emissions that systems interpret as chronological sequence. When recursion fails without reentry (as in black holes), time ends. When recursion is simulated without collapse (as in LLMs), time is not real—only mimicked.\n\nApplications extend across neuroscience, symbolic systems, quantum identity models, and AI containment protocols. By showing that time is a field-generated artifact, not a fundamental constant, this paper displaces entropy and observer-based interpretations with a structurally lawful, substrate-independent model of collapse-generated time.\n\nThis preprint functions as the canonical timestamp for Collapse Phase Theory, Recursive Identity Collapse, and the scientifically valid concept of Time as Collapse.

          "abstract": "Autism and related neurodivergent conditions are commonly framed as brain-based\ndisorders, defined by behavioral symptoms, cognitive traits, or genetic anomalies. The\nNervous System Adaptation Model (NSAM) challenges this framing by identifying chronic\nautonomic-cortical mismatch as the primary site of dysfunction. In this model, early-life\nautonomic disruption—whether due to prenatal stress, immune activation, or\ndevelopmental asynchrony—leads to persistent dysregulation between body and brain,\nwith autism representing one manifestation of this broader physiological adaptation\nprocess.\nThe cortex compensates for functionally asynchronous signaling between the\nhypothalamus and cortical systems by forming behavioral strategies that, over time, are\nreinforced into preference, personality, and identity. Rather than viewing behaviors like\nstimming, masking, or attraction patterns as symptoms, NSAM reframes them as\nregulatory solutions: attempts by the system to self-stabilize under chronic nervous system\nmismatch.\nIdentity emerges not as a static trait, but as the downstream outcome of reinforced\nautonomic regulation patterns. This framework extends beyond developmental\nneurodivergence to acquired conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), where similar\nautonomic-cortical coordination failures generate comparable behavioral and emotional\nadaptations.\nBy shifting focus from behavioral traits to underlying regulation patterns, NSAM oﬀers a\nphysiological lens for understanding neurodivergent presentations—one that centers\nsystemic coherence over symptom conformity. The implications span DSM classification,\nclinical intervention, and societal conceptualization of neurodivergence itself.",

While the most common presentations include schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, symptoms of social anxiety and depression are common amongst this cohort. Given the drop-out rates associated with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, there is a growing interest in using therapeutically applied role-playing games (TA-RPGs) as an alternative. Given the current evidence for this treatment is in its infancy, there is a need to investigate the effectiveness of TA-RPGS. \n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural therapy-infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game (Dungeons and Dragons) for consumers of two community mental health services in Sydney, Australia. \n\nMethods: In total, 33 consumers of community mental health services were quasi-randomised to either the TA-RPG 8-week intervention group or a waitlist control group receiving treatment-as-usual. The TA-RPG consisted of a specially designed game of Dungeons and Dragons that was infused with elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. All participants received treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures were changes in self-reported social anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported depression and self-esteem. \n\nResults: After 8 weeks, participants in the TA-RPG group experienced a significant reduction in self-reported symptoms of social anxiety and depression, relative to baseline. A significant increase in global self-esteem was also reported. These changes were not experienced by participants in the waitlist control group. No change in either group was observed for PTSD symptoms. Dropout rates were 17% for the intervention group. \n\nConclusion: A CBT infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game group intervention was effective at reducing self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression for consumers of adult community mental health services in Sydney, Australia.",

This paper proposes a novel integrative framework to account for the striking variability in math-related outcomes among individuals with ADHD. While many exhibit difficulty with procedural tasks requiring sustained attention and working memory, others demonstrate advanced abstract reasoning, rapid pattern recognition, or systematizing tendencies typically unaccounted for in deficit-centered models.\nWe synthesize findings across cognitive psychology, educational neuroscience, and autism research to highlight four interacting factors that influence mathematical expression in ADHD: (1) heterogeneity in working memory profiles, (2) divergent cognitive styles—particularly the distinction between procedural and intuitive/pattern-based reasoning, (3) dopaminergic reward sensitivity and interest-driven engagement, and (4) co-occurring autistic traits such as hyperfocus and systemizing. These domains are not merely additive but interdependent, often creating sharp contrast between individuals who are high-functioning in abstract mathematics and those who are not.\nBy reframing ADHD not as a uniform impairment but as a multidimensional cognitive profile with meaningful subtypes, this model invites more personalized and strength-based approaches to education and assessment. It also advances a redefinition of mathematical giftedness and difficulty within neurodivergent populations.",

In a new paradigm, participants (total N=2328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "Background: Fine motor skills have been linked to a wide range of negative physical, social, educational, and emotional health consequences. However, there is a lack of consensus on which methods should be used to measure these skills and several different assessment tools exist. Five such assessment tools include: (i) the Beery-Bucktenica Visual-Motor Integration test; (ii) the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire; (iii) the Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool; (iv) the Movement Assessment Battery for Children; and (v) the Detailed Assessment of Speed of Handwriting. These tools measure different aspects of the complex ‘fine motor skill’ construct (from quantitative assessment of underlying sensorimotor processes to qualitative observations of function). This study investigated the degree to which these tools operationalise an ‘umbrella’ latent construct of fine motor skill given its multifaceted nature. Methods: Data were collected from four different groups: sample (i) -  children from a Primary school in Bradford (n= 318); sample (ii) - children with teacher-identified handwriting difficulties from sample (i) (n= 91); sample (iii) - children from ten Primary schools across Bradford with teacher-identified handwriting difficulties (n= 172); and sample (iv) - a clinical sample of children referred to an occupational therapist for ‘Developmental Coordination Disorder’ assessments (n= 33). Correlation, linear regression, and principal component analysis were used to assess the relationships between the measures within each of these samples. Results: Analyses found limited agreement between the measures across the four samples, with regression models accounting for only 4–27% of the variance. Conclusion: The different tools available to assess ‘fine motor skills’ measure specific facets of sensorimotor ability that are only weakly related and/or predictive of each other. The lack of a consensus around which tools should be used to operationalise which aspect of sensorimotor ability can help explain why there are challenges in assessing and supporting children with sensorimotor difficulties.",

          "abstract": "The central tenet of this new theory is that consciousness is fundamentally a mathematical principle, specifically related to the geometry of spaces. It’s not seen as a physical object, a neural network, space structure or an atomic process, but rather a mechanism that involves the isometric immersion of surfaces ( representing perceived or imaginary external signals) into a three - dimensional Riemannian “mental” space. The theory draws a direct line to Immanuel Kant’s idea of “ innate Euclidean space” which became well - forgotten after Einstein’s Relativity revolution in the 20th century. Fortunately, mathematicians working under Weyl problem have saved this great idea.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative phenomenological analysis of luminous inner experiences—commonly known as phosphenes—as described in three distinct visionary contexts: the Tibetan Buddhist Thögal instructions of Dudjom Lingpa (1835–1904), the Christian mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179), and a contemporary first-person meditative account. Drawing upon a newly developed six-phase taxonomy of inner light phenomena, the study reveals a striking convergence in the structure, progression, and symbolic unfolding of these visions. Each account exhibits a coherent trajectory from simple entoptic elements to complex geometrical formations, visionary narratives, and, ultimately, dissolution into a unified luminous field. While the experiential architecture appears consistent, the ultimate articulation of the final unitive phase is conditioned by the theological and cultural context of the visionary. Hildegard’s visions, for example, approach but do not fully express ontological non-duality, reflecting her Catholic worldview. In contrast, Dudjom Lingpa’s Dzogchen framework and the contemporary account both describe complete collapse into a clear light field. These findings suggest a universal inner architecture of luminous perception that is shaped—but not determined—by doctrinal overlays. The study introduces the concept of the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace (USH) to describe the final stage of this inner trajectory, proposing that phosphenes are not merely optical anomalies but gateways to transpersonal consciousness. This work contributes to comparative mysticism, neurophenomenology, and consciousness studies, while offering a contemplative framework for contemporary practitioners.",

          "abstract": "Psychological experiments are routinely used to study covariation of individual differences in psychological processes. A key advantage of experimental tasks is that they may offer higher construct validity than traditional survey instruments. Whereas we welcome the generally growing attention to the psychometric evaluation of experimental tasks, we are concerned about an overemphasis on reliability as the principal criterion for evaluating task goodness or interpreting correlations across tasks. In this article, we present a conceptual framework that disentangles three levels of measures: foundational measures of task goodness (i.e., signal-to-noise ratios or intraclass correlations), reliability (which reflects both task goodness and the number of trials), and uncertainty in estimated correlations (which additionally depends on sample size). Within this framework, reliability takes an intermediate position – it is useful for planning but less so for communicating task goodness or interpreting correlations. Therefore, we advocate for a shift in focus: Researchers should use foundational task goodness measures to communicate the strengths and limitations of experimental designs, and report uncertainty in correlations. To that end, we highlight the role of hierarchical models to jointly estimate trial-level noise and individual variability, thus enabling more accurate and transparent inference about covariation of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Conscious experiences appear to play a central role in human behavior, yet most neural processing occurs outside of consciousness. Understanding how the mind prioritizes information for consciousness is, therefore, crucial for theories of cognition. Prior research has largely focused on vision, but generalization is tenuous given the vastly different characteristics of the senses, particularly for audition, which lacks foveation and cannot be intentionally stopped. We examine the affective domain, for which prioritization is not well understood. In three experiments (two preregistered), 101 participants completed a visual task with a stream of auditory pseudowords in the background. Occasionally, a meaningful word appeared, and participants were asked about its presence. Using objective and subjective awareness measures, we found that neutral words are prioritized over negative words, regardless of task difficulty, intelligibility, and low-level features. These findings challenge theorizing and modal intuitions, and we discuss ways in which those can be reconciled.",

          "abstract": "Survival Attachment is a neurobiological and psychological adaptation that arises when a partner’s nervous system repeatedly encounters relational instability, even in the absence of deliberate abuse. While most commonly discussed in connection with Cluster B personality disorders—particularly narcissism and borderline personality disorder—this attachment pattern also emerges in relationships marked by chronic emotional unpredictability, as seen in conditions such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, and addiction. These patterns may not include cruelty or manipulation, but the dysregulation they generate can overwhelm a partner’s capacity for secure bonding. This paper introduces a transdiagnostic framework that reframes Survival Attachment as a shared relational outcome, not a pathology exclusive to certain diagnoses. The goal is to offer both survivors and clinicians a trauma-informed lens that recognizes the full complexity of lived experience, validating patterns of adaptation that often go unnamed, and encouraging care strategies that reach beyond traditional diagnostic silos.",

          "authors": "Olivia Keane; Emanuele Fino; Cherie Armour",
          "abstract": "Objective: Feelings of shame can play a role in the development and maintenance of mental disorders. However, the role and measurement of shame in relation to eating disorders remain poorly understood. The current work presents the adaptation of a measure of external and internal shame in relation to eating disorders (EISS-ED) based on an integrative perspective that leverages the strengths of the biopsychosocial model and shame-pride cycle framework. Specifically, the EISS-ED accounts for how individuals believe they are perceived by others (external shame) and how they perceive themselves (internal shame), in relation to eating. Method: The study used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the EISS-ED (N = 478). Spearman’s correlations and Receiving Operator Characteristic curves were used for validity testing. Results: The results supported the two-factor structure (including 14 items) of the EISS-ED and its factorial invariance by clinical history and gender. Concurrent validity analyses showed positive correlations between external and internal shame and eating disorder symptoms, negative affect, and detachment. Both external and internal shame measures provided fair classification accuracy of participants based on self-reported history of clinical assessment or treatment for eating disorders. Discussion: These findings improve the understanding of the role of shame in eating disorders and offer evidence on a valid assessment that can aid in identifying, measuring, and addressing this important construct, supporting targeted interventions.",

These visual measures proved to be equitable—performance did not vary by home language or socioeconomic status—and independently accounted for 12–16% of the variance in reading outcomes. They were also significant predictors of reading risk at year-end and a year- later. Latent profile analysis revealed subgroups invisible to traditional screeners: children with strong language but poor visual skills who later struggled to read, and children with visual strengths who outperformed expectations despite phonological weaknesses. Integrating measures of rapid visual processing into early screening offers a promising path forward, towards more equitable, personalized interventions and a deeper understanding of reading development.",

          "abstract": "Observers’ ability to estimate levels of movement synchrony, such as in Olympic diving or rowing, is highly variable and, in part, constrained by personality traits and enjoyment of the movements. Embodiment also appears to play a crucial role, whereby stronger beliefs that one’s body can complete physical tasks predict more accurate estimation of synchrony levels. However, to demonstrate the relevance of embodiment per se, direct evidence that physical embodiment (i.e., bodily knowledge of specific movements) alters synchrony estimation is required. Here, we assessed the behavioural and cortical underpinnings of synchrony estimation in conditions with and without physical embodiment. \nForty-three participants completed personality trait measures, then completed a synchrony estimation task. Participants copied upper-body movement sequences (acquiring physical embodiment), then viewed dyads performing the same sequence or an unknown sequence and estimated the level of synchrony, while we recorded cortical activation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).\nParticipants underestimated synchrony levels, showing greater underestimation for unknown movements than performed movements. For performed movements, but not unknown movements, the degree of estimation error was associated with activation of left inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, and right motor cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Participants’ estimation error was associated with body competence and autistic trait scores, as well as measures of enjoyment and movement predictability (replicating previous work). This work demonstrates that physical embodiment improves lay observers’ ability to discern levels of movement synchrony and has practical implications across a wide variety of artistic and athletic domains.",

          "authors": "Nidhi V Banavar; Kirk Bansak",
          "abstract": "Conjoint experiments are extensively used across multiple disciplines to make inferences about preferences over multi-attribute alternatives. Much previous research has analyzed the importance of attributes at the aggregate level. Here, we focus on understanding individual-level behavior and, specifically, on strategy use. We present a novel Bayesian cognitive model that infers individuals' strategy use by performing attribute weight inference (how important an attribute is), attribute level inference (which value of the attribute is favored), and latent-mixture inference to classify strategy use. We then validate and apply our model to two conjoint experiments (total N = 3762) focusing on three political domains (attitudes towards immigrants, political candidates, and climate policy). From a substantive standpoint, we find that the majority of subjects use heuristic strategies in all conditions and that approximately 60% of subjects use different strategies depending on the political domain. Our model additionally highlights how aggregate-level inference on the weight of an attribute can be meaningfully decomposed by individual differences in strategy use and preferences over attributes. Specifically, we demonstrate clear multimodality in the distribution of attribute weights across individuals for all political domains and conditions, raising questions about how to appropriately contextualize information that is aggregated at the population level. In addition, our experiments include a set of experimental design manipulations that increase different dimensions of complexity in the conjoint experiments and show their impact on strategy use. This work has important implications for understanding how to interpret and generalize results from conjoint experiments, in addition to contributing to the strategy modeling literature. Further, we highlight how researchers can apply our model to their own conjoint experiments for both applied and methodological research aims.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\n         Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder which affects approximately 20 million people worldwide. Patients show face processing deficits which greatly affects their social interactions and social cognitive abilities (i.e. trouble empathizing with others). Face processing is an important skill that allows humans to recognize others, detect emotions, and use these abilities for effective social interactions. Although face processing has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there has not been a systematic review investigating links between social-cognitive dysfunction, face processing networks, and clinical symptoms. Here, we comprehensively review for the first time how dysconnectivity in social cognitive networks contribute to face processing deficits and how this is tied to positive and negative symptoms. \n\nMethod\n\tReviewed studies were a.) written in English, b.) focused on face and emotion processing in schizophrenia (not limited to first episode psychosis [FEP]), and c.) were resting or task-based fMRI studies looking at face/emotion processing neural networks utilizing functional connectivity or measured functional activity broadly. Studies were excluded if they were not related to face processing, focused on different disorders (i.e. depression), used effective connectivity, included combined fMRI-other modality studies , and included non-schizophrenia patient groups. We screened studies from 2020-2025. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were utilized to pool results.  \n\nResults \n\tNine articles were reviewed. Resting state studies and task studies showed elevated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive scores for FEP patients coupled with social cognition deficits. Increased suicidality in schizophrenia was tied to higher PANSS positive symptoms and impaired processing of angry faces. Increased default mode network (DMN) dysconnectivity was tied to disrupted fear recognition processing and subsequently elevated PANSS positive scores. \n\nConclusions  \nSocial-cognitive deficits broadly stem around challenges recognizing and processing negative faces. Factors such as trauma, suicidality, and inflammation should be further examined.",

          "abstract": "In uncertain and dynamic environments, biological agents must adapt their decision-making strategies to maximize rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models typically assume that such adaptation is governed by dynamic value updates controlled by fixed parameters or predefined schedules. However, these assumptions limit the models' ability to capture the flexible and context-sensitive nature of biological decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \\textit{DynamicRL}, a novel framework that estimates RL parameters from behavioral data on a trial-by-trial basis. We demonstrate that DynamicRL substantially improves the predictive performance of standard RL models across eight decision-making tasks, thereby reducing scientific regret.\n\nDynamicRL captures the rich temporal variability inherent in decision-making behavior, achieving predictive performance comparable to that of recurrent neural networks trained directly on the data, while preserving the interpretability and theoretical grounding of RL models. Moreover, it enables the examination of how agents dynamically adjust RL parameters in response to environmental changes, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Thus, DynamicRL serves as an efficient data-driven framework for estimating RL parameters, facilitating fine-grained behavioral analysis with potential applications in computational psychiatry and neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "In perceptual decision-making tasks, humans integrate noisy sensory evidence over time to guide their choices. The optimal integration process assumes that all evidence is weighted equally within a trial and that different trials are independent. However, humans exhibit systematic deviations from optimality, including uneven weighting of evidence within trials and influences from previous trials. Prior studies have demonstrated that biological constraints can account for this suboptimality. In this study, we present evidence that humans adapt their evidence integration strategies over time in response to task demands, and that the suboptimal uneven weighting is gradually learned over the course of the task. By explicitly modeling this adaptation through online gradient-based learning, our model outperforms existing approaches in capturing human behavior and unifies both observed forms of suboptimality in the Click task: dependence across trials emerges from an error-driven learning process that also gives rise to uneven integration weights within trials. We further propose a bounded-rational adaptation account to explain why humans progressively learn to weight evidence unevenly within a trial.\n\nOur modeling framework provides a general approach of resource-rational adaptation. It captures how initially uninformed agents can gradually update their strategies through error-driven learning and is applicable to a broad range of learning and decision-making scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Anton Chigurh is a character from the novel No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy, which was later made into a movie by directors Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. This article is written to discuss the character of Anton Chigurh through the philosophical framework of Maurice Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception. Chigurh represents an extreme or antithetical form of authentic subjectivity in Merleau-Ponty's view. The analysis explores key Merleau-Pontian concepts, including the distinction between the lived body (Leib) and the objective body (Körper), the active nature of perception in constituting reality, the embodied and reciprocal nature of intersubjectivity, and the concept of freedom as situated through the character of Anton Chigurh. Chigurh's interactions with others are analyzed as a form of systematic destruction of intersubjectivity, characterized by the objectification of others and the failure to establish reciprocal engagement. His adherence to uncompromising principles and deterministic view of fate is contrasted with Merleau-Ponty's more nuanced understanding of situated freedom that emphasizes continuous and open engagement with the world. Chigurh functions as a phenomenological anti-subject, embodying a pathological form of being-in-the-world. His character becomes a literary exploration of the denial of the most fundamental mode of human existence, as described by Merleau-Ponty highlighting the unsettling consequences of disengagement from embodied empathy, mutual intersubjectivity, and the ambiguous openness of existence.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how gender representation is portrayed in several Indonesian commercial advertisements aired on YouTube throughout 2024. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, this study examines how gender roles are constructed and conveyed through visual and narrative elements in digital advertisements. The main objective of this research is to understand the extent to which gender stereotypes still appear and are reproduced in new media, as well as to identify any changes or consistency in these representation patterns within the Indonesian cultural context.\nThe analysis results indicate that women are still frequently depicted in roles related to the domestic sphere, emotions, and aesthetics. Meanwhile, men are more often portrayed as rational, dominant, and masculine figures. These patterns indicate that traditional representations of gender roles persist, even in digital media platforms often perceived as modern and progressive, such as YouTube. In other words, despite changes in the platform, the social messages conveyed tend to uphold traditional norms.\nThese findings contribute significantly to media sociology and gender studies in Indonesia, while also serving as a reminder of the need for critical evaluation of the digital content consumed by society. This research also underscores the urgency for the advertising industry to adopt more equitable, inclusive communication strategies that reflect the diversity of gender roles in contemporary society.\n\nKeywords: gender representation, YouTube advertising, digital media, stereotypes, media sociology.",

These results suggest green marketing can successfully appeal to both moral convictions and social recognition, offering a new perspective on how faith-based and status-driven motivations together shape environmentally responsible consumption.",

          "authors": "Paul John Myatt",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the evolving landscape of piano teaching, particularly in adapting to the learning preferences of the latest generation, Generation Alpha (born since 2010). With the rise of digital technologies, traditional piano pedagogy faces challenges in maintaining student engagement and effective learning. The paper begins by discussing the impact of technology on attention spans and learning styles, highlighting the need for piano teachers to adapt to these changes. It highlights the characteristics of Generation Alpha, born in the era of ubiquitous mobile technology, and the changing ways that they are learning.\nThe core of the paper is structured around cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene’s ‘Four Pillars of Learning’ – Attention, Active Engagement, Error Feedback, and Consolidation (2020). Each pillar is examined in the context of piano teaching, proposing innovative approaches that align with modern learners' cognitive and sensory preferences. The paper suggests interactive learning environments that incorporate multimodal and multisensory experiences, extending beyond traditional read-then-play methods. It emphasises the importance of personalised and active learning experiences, integrating technology where appropriate.\nFurthermore, the paper addresses the lack of pedagogical training options for piano teachers and the necessity for contemporary pedagogy training to adapt to evolving teaching paradigms. The conclusion posits that the future of successful piano teaching lies in embracing new pedagogies, harnessing technology, and implementing learner-centred approaches. This evolution in teaching strategies aims to enhance student engagement and ensure the longevity of students’ interest in piano playing, thereby securing the future of piano teaching as a viable career option.",

          "abstract": "Tanaka (2025) proposed a new theoretical framework for thinking called Quatro Dynamic Thinking (QDT). QDT represents an innovative framework that organically integrates four cognitive dimensions: the depth dimension (diving thinking), the breadth dimension (expanding thinking), the relational dimension (networking thinking), and the temporal dimension (flowing thinking). Each dimension maintains independent value while generating emergent insights and innovative solutions through mutual interaction. This study shows the effectiveness of QDT through practical cases including food technology business development, English acquisition system development, and climate change countermeasures. Furthermore, the study develops specific practical methods such as Quatro Scan and Dynamic Shifting, and presents a staged guideline for organizational implementation. This paper is an attempt at demonstrating QDT’s high potential as a new cognitive toolkit for the interconnected and complex challenges of the 21st century, contributing to improvements in problem-solving capabilities of individuals and organizations.",

          "abstract": "This case study examines the development and implementation of a customized artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot designed to provide instant feedback on Year 12 General English student drafts in a Queensland secondary school. Developed through iterative prompt engineering by an English teacher and a technical collaborator, the chatbot was refined until it consistently produced feedback aligning with approximately 80% of the teacher’s typical responses. Ethical safeguards—including strict compliance to the school’s ethical guidelines, adherence to data privacy measures and transparent communication with students—were central to the project’s design. \n\nConducted with a class of 21 students, the intervention resulted in a 81% improvement in grades from IA1 to IA2 and a 47.6% increase in projected IA2 grades. Qualitative observations indicate that the primary benefit was not solely the content of the AI-generated feedback, but rather its immediacy—reducing turnaround time from one week to seconds. This “instantaneity premium” allowed students greater time for revision and increased motivation. The hybrid model highlights the importance of expert prompt engineering, teacher conferencing to mitigate AI hallucinations, and ethical AI integration. \n\nAs a proof-of-concept initiative, this study contributes to the discourse on human-AI complementarity in education and aligns with UNESCO’s frameworks for responsible AI use in teaching and learning.",

In this article, I systematically show how this exemption will effectively not provide any practical benefits as the information involved must still be collected to assess whether the exemption applies, and will be maintained elsewhere as it is required to fulfil other obligations. I also highlight how Article 30 records are a key requirement for oversight and accountability, and their absence negatively affects the organisation's data governance and compliance practices and makes it more likely to introduce risks and liability. I conclude with other avenues the Commission should consider based on responding to actual needs of organisations, taking advantage of RegTech/eGov technologies based on known success stories, and to avoid diluting the GDPR as it risks damaging the future of EU's digital policies.",

          "abstract": "1. Addressing social and ecological values is a central aim of democratic environmental management and policymaking, especially during deliberative and participatory processes. Agencies responsible for managing public lands would benefit from a deepened understanding of how various publics value those lands.\n2. Federal land management agencies receive millions of written comments from the public on proposed management actions annually, providing a unique source of insights into how the public assigns value to public lands. To date, little attention has been directed towards methods for analysing the public's comments to understand their expressed values, in part because the volume of comments often makes manual analysis unworkable.\n3. This study introduces and applies a novel computational approach to inferring values in written text by using natural language processing and a method that combines a lexicon with semantic embedding models. We developed embedding models for four types of values that are expressed in public comments. We then fit models to 409,241 public comments on actions proposed by the United States Forest Service from 2011 to 2020 and regulated by the National Environmental Policy Act.\n4. The embedding model generally outperformed the lexicon word-count, particularly for value types with shorter lexicons, and, like human evaluators, the embedding models performed better for more evident values and were less reliable for more abstract or latent values.\n5. By applying the resulting model, we furthered our understanding of how the public values National Forest lands in the United States. We observed that aesthetic and moral values were expressed more often in comments for projects that received more public interest, as gauged by the number of comments a project received and in comments for projects addressing recreational management.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines wealth inequality dynamics in Chile from 2007 to 2021, focusing on two key macroeconomic events: the sharp rise in housing prices after the introduction of a real estate value-added tax in 2016 and the substantial liquidation of pension assets through early withdrawals during the pandemic. We introduce a methodological innovation that aims to improve the measurement of wealth inequality by integrating administrative pension fund records into household wealth surveys using machine learning techniques. Our results reveal extreme levels of wealth concentration, with the top 10% holding approximately two-thirds of national private wealth. However, inequality slightly declined over the period, particularly after 2016, as the outcome of two opposing forces: housing appreciation, which benefited middle-class households, and pension fund withdrawals, which disproportionately reduced wealth at the lower end of the distribution.

          "authors": "Gordon Dimitrieff",
          "abstract": "In April 2024, Spotify eliminated royalties for tracks with fewer than 1,000 annual streams, justifying the move as a deterrent to streaming fraud, a way to clean up “noise” content and a fix for “trapped” micropayments. Spotify asserted that these changes would benefit “emerging and professional artists” and claimed the policy would not affect music discovery or promotion.\n\nThis study rigorously tests those claims using a 21-month, 42,000-observation dataset normalized for Spotify’s user growth. By applying difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity and event study designs across artist tiers and career stages, the analysis isolates the policy’s true effects.\n\nContrary to its stated intent, the policy produced a paradoxical outcome: mid-tier artists (10,000–100,000 listeners) experienced a 20% drop in market share growth, while artists already on an upward trajectory captured nearly all the gains. These effects emerged gradually, reflecting algorithmic recalibration rather than immediate changes in listener behaviour, and remained robust across multiple sensitivity checks. Notably, the anticipated substitution effect, where attention would shift to adjacent tiers, did not materialize.\n\nThese findings reveal that even policies framed as technical or anti-fraud measures can act as powerful infrastructural interventions, quietly amplifying existing inequalities. Rather than democratizing the platform, Spotify’s threshold deepened market concentration and favoured those already poised to benefit. These results highlight the need for rigorous, forward-looking assessment of policy interventions to fully understand their systemic impacts.",

Specifically, we examine three hypothetical interventions: 1) equalizing higher education rates across social origin groups, 2) equalizing the labor market returns to higher education across social origin groups, and 3) randomly assigning higher education within each social origin group. We hypothesize that equalizing access to higher education would reduce labor market disparities, while the random assignment of high-er education within origin groups would increase them. Reframing conflicting arguments in an ongoing debate, we propose competing hypotheses on whether equalizing returns to higher education increases or decreases labor market disparities. To test these hypotheses, we use a novel non-parametric decomposition method and longitudinal data from the 1970 British Cohort Study. For both sexes, our findings show that equalizing higher education attainment rates would reduce labor market disparities, whereas randomly assigning higher education within origin groups would have no significant impact. The effect of equalizing the benefits of higher education varies by sex and differs depending on whether wages or occupational out-comes are considered.",

The Philippine context reveals a gap in recent research delving into how demographic elements impact consumer attitudes and actions associated with nutrition labeling, thus emphasizing the necessity for a localized exploration of this topic.\nThis study explored consumers' buying behavior towards nutritional labels and health claims. It aimed to determine the relationship between consumers' demographic characteristics and their understanding and utilization of nutritional facts when making food purchases.\nA descriptive-correlational design was utilized. A structured questionnaire was administered to 184 respondents from diverse sociodemographic backgrounds. The instrument collected data on age, sex, educational attainment, monthly income, perceptions of nutrition labels, and label usage behavior. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis were employed to analyze the data.\nResearch revealed that health-conscious and budget-conscious consumers were inclined to scrutinize nutrition labels and health claims when selecting food items. Their priorities leaned towards nutritional value and affordability. Conversely, trend followers and convenience seekers paid less attention to nutritional information, tending to make decisions based on taste, brand familiarity, or convenience. The study shows a positive correlation between higher levels of education, increased monthly income, and favorable perceptions and frequent use of nutrition labels.\nThese findings emphasize the significance of embracing consumer diversity in shaping effective nutrition communication strategies. By grasping the intricate behaviors unique to each consumer group, stakeholders can devise tailored interventions, empowering the population with enhanced nutritional knowledge and more conscious dietary decisions.",

Building on the concept of economic entropy, the study develops a dual-dimensional model—scale entropy and structural entropy—to enable the quantitative assessment of entropy dynamics within economic systems. Economic entropy increase originates from the system’s intrinsic structural demands and determines the macro trajectory of institutional evolution. Accordingly, this paper is the first to propose and systematically demonstrate the core proposition that the market economy constitutes the fundamental trajectory of economic evolution. Market economies, with their superior self-organizing and adaptive capacities, embody high-entropy structures; in contrast, planned economies, constrained by “long-chain interventions” that crowd out market mechanisms, exhibit low-entropy structures and are ultimately to be superseded. This framework offers a new lens for understanding economic growth, institutional selection, and the evolution of complex systems, with significant implications for policy design and economic governance.",

          "abstract": "The offshoring of manufacturing jobs has replaced low-skilled workers who often lack the relevant skills to transition to new occupations. Using Danish adult education and employer-employee data, we study how adult vocational training influences occupational choice and mitigates labor demand shocks. Despite low participation rates in training programs, we show that manufacturing workers trained in business services (BS) programs have a 0.9-3.1 percentage point higher probability of transitioning to BS occupations using dynamic difference-in-difference analysis. We then propose and estimate a life-cycle model of occupation and program choice that yields a nested logit conditional choice probability. The program take-up elasticity is lower than the occupation choice elasticity, suggesting that individuals are insensitive to the monetary value of the programs. A counterfactual wage subsidy policy tied to participation in BS-related programs supports transitions from manufacturing to BS occupations and reduces the share of low-skilled individuals leaving the labor force, especially at older ages, demonstrating the potential for a resilient labor market.",

Following implications of relative risk aversion theory and time discounting theory, the results show that children from low-income households need to have both a concern to avoid downward mobility and a higher willingness to wait for longer-term returns in order to make it to the higher tracks. Starting from the premise that, given earlier performance, it would be rational to go on to the highest possible track to avoid downward mobility, the Dutch early-tracking system assumes that students oversee a long educational future to optimize their educational investment. This assumption is less valid for low-income students, which could explain why early tracking increases socioeconomic inequalities in school careers.",

Out of the population, 100 students were selected as the sample using the convenience sampling method. The quantitative research design was employed in the study. The survey method was used to collect data from the selected sample. A structured questionnaire was used as a data collection instrument. Frequency counts and simple percentages were used to analyze the collected data. According to the study, 99% of undergraduate students used AI tools for academic activities. The most frequently used AI tool is ChatGPT (94%), followed by Quill bot and Grammarly. Students use AI tools to check grammatical errors (73%), enhance subject knowledge (68%), and summarize content (67%). Fifty-two percent (52%) of students think using AI diminishes critical thinking, but most disagree that using AI is cheating. Ninety percent (90%) of students claim to know how to use AI ethically. It is recommended that access to proper language editing tools should be offered, as students rely on ChatGPT for grammar correction. Emphasizing the importance of using reputed publications when enhancing students' subject knowledge, raising awareness about library e-resources, and creating AI usage policies collaboratively with faculties would also be an appropriate intervention.

          "abstract": "Abstract \n\nThis article examines Karl Jaspers' epistemological framework through the lens of contemporary philosophical challenges, arguing that his concepts of boundary situations, transcendence, and methodological pluralism provide essential resources for addressing twenty-first century crises of knowledge and meaning whilst requiring critical reconstruction to encompass collective dimensions and cross-cultural perspectives. The investigation proceeds through systematic analysis of Jaspers' theoretical architecture, demonstrating how recent developments in collective phenomenology, postphenomenological technology studies, and cross-cultural methodology transform his originally individualistic framework into a sophisticated resource for contemporary interdisciplinary scholarship. Drawing upon Margaret Gilbert's joint commitment theory, Dan Zahavi's collective intentionality research, and Kwok-ying Lau's double epoché method, the study reveals how boundary situations manifest collectively whilst maintaining existential authenticity. Critical engagement with feminist, postcolonial, and Indigenous perspectives illuminates both the enduring significance and necessary limitations of Jaspers' framework, whilst Peter-Paul Verbeek's technological mediation theory and Yuk Hui's cosmotechnics provide resources for addressing artificial intelligence ethics and digital transformation. Clinical applications through phenomenological assessment tools demonstrate the continued vitality of Jaspersian approaches in contemporary psychiatric practice, whilst environmental applications reveal how climate crisis constitutes a species-level boundary situation demanding collective existential response. The article concludes that whilst Jaspers' epistemology requires critical reconstruction to address issues of power, social positioning, and ontological pluralism, his fundamental insight regarding the confrontation with limits as generative of authentic knowledge remains indispensable for navigating contemporary boundary situations, now understood as irreducibly collective phenomena requiring cross-cultural dialogue and technological wisdom. \n\n**Keywords:** Karl Jaspers, epistemology, boundary situations, collective transcendence, phenomenological psychiatry, methodological pluralism, existential philosophy, artificial intelligence ethics, environmental philosophy, cross-cultural dialogue, postphenomenology, cosmotechnics",

However, the online mechanisms that support this process remain \nunclear. This study employs a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling approach \nto examine how conspicuous consumption motives influence green purchase intentions when \nconsumers are exposed to green content on social media. It hypothesizes that social media \nexposure, Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), and social comparison act as antecedents to green \nconspicuous consumption motives, with perceived quality moderating these relationships. \nData was collected from 346 social media users in the U.S., U.K., and Canada.

While perceived quality \nenhances the effect of social comparison on conspicuous consumption, it does not \nsignificantly impact the relationship between FOMO and conspicuous consumption. These \nfindings highlight the role of social media in shaping green purchase decisions and suggest \nthat businesses and policymakers can leverage conspicuous consumption motives to promote \nsustainable consumer behavior.

          "authors": "Sebastian Schmidt",
          "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest among international relations scholars in applications of pragmatist thought. Few works, however, have gone beyond discussing the epistemological and methodological implications of pragmatism. This article draws on a pragmatist understanding of human action to develop a novel explanation of norm change in contexts not amenable to more common analytical approaches. Specifically, concepts derived from pragmatism help explain how the creative recombination of practices by actors in response to changes in the material and social context of action can transform largely tacit notions of appropriate behavior. The article demonstrates the value of the approach by explaining the origin of a common contemporary security practice unknown prior to the Second World War and incompatible with the then-prevailing norms of sovereignty: the long-term, peacetime presence of one state’s military on the territory of another equally sovereign state.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Schmidt",
          "abstract": "References to the Peace of Westphalia have played an important role in the discourse of international relations. Originally referred to as a concrete historical event and associated with a variety of meanings, such as the triumph of state sovereignty, the establishment of a community of states, and even the beginnings of collective security, the Peace was later transformed into a conceptualization of the international system. Beginning in the late 1960s, phrases like “Westphalian system” came to convey a package of ideas about international politics limited to the supremacy of state sovereignty, territoriality, and nonintervention, to the exclusion of other meanings. This conceptualization serves as a popular and convenient contrast to a more globalized order, but there are problems with its use: first, because the Westphalian system is an ideal-type that might never have actually existed, the impact of globalization may be exaggerated by scholars who employ it. Second, its use implies a linear progression from some Westphalian configuration toward some “post-Westphalian” state of affairs, whereas actual system change is likely to be more complex.",

          "abstract": "Scholars regularly mobilise the concept of policy paradigm to characterise successive periods in which certain ideas appear to structure policymaking. While this concept proved useful to establish that ideas matter, it is time to start thinking about ideas in ways that better resonate with actors’ practices. This article introduces and empirically illustrates two conceptual alternatives. First, it looks at international monetary relations from 1944 through the early 1970s. Instead of simply labelling this period as ‘Keynesian,’ it shows that the enduring centrality of gold was a pivotal practice among policy makers. Second, it considers the governance of the Eurozone in the run-up to the crisis of the 2010s. Rather than viewing this period as ‘neoliberal,’ it highlights a new discursive repertoire of governance that produced both austerity and unconventional policies. In sum, practices and repertoires help to make sense of elements of continuity, ambiguity and contestation that are often obscured by ideational analysis.",

In the mental health domain, content creators can serve as influential community leaders, yet it remains unclear whether creator-focused training impacts the mental health attitudes and behaviors of their audiences. This study evaluates the effectiveness of creator-focused interventions on the mental health knowledge and knowledge-based skill bases of their audiences using two experiments. First, an on-platform randomized controlled trial (RCT) provided evidence-based mental health communication toolkits and training to TikTok creators. Analyzing 188,169 comments from 1,882 videos by 49 creators (March–May 2023), we found a 4% increase in foundational mental health knowledge construction among viewers—defined as the initial stage of learning through reflection on personal experiences or opinions. Second, an off-platform survey experiment exposed a nationally representative sample of 1,000 U.S. youth (aged 14–22) to pre- and post-training videos created by a lifestyle influencer. Participants who viewed the post-training video showed significant improvements in both perceived and objectively assessed emotional support skills. By combining the external validity of the on-platform RCT with the internal validity of the survey experiment, our study provides robust evidence that creator training toolkits can enhance mental health knowledge and competencies among audiences, supporting the promise of scalable, evidence-based communication strategies on social media.",

          "abstract": "The prevailing assumption in discussions of foreign military basing is that such presences are hierarchical in nature. While this was unavoidably the case prior to the Second World War, changes in the normative framework of international politics mean that the relationship of such presences to hierarchy have become an empirical question. Specifically, changes in sovereignty norms and the emergence of territorial and jurisdictional integrity render the linkage between foreign military basing and hierarchy contingent. As a result, the dynamics of some basing arrangements now closely resemble those of other interstate agreements. This analysis regrounds hierarchy in the specific normative context of action and in doing so highlights the implicit reification of the state in contemporary security studies. In practical terms, it shows how assuming hierarchy both overestimates the fragility of the US basing network and, by exaggerating authority relations, obscures the potential for greater fluidity in the basing space.",

          "abstract": "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the security commitment it entails are cornerstones of the current international order. Despite this centrality, international relations scholarship is ill equipped to explain the origin of the American commitment to Europe in the form of a long-term, peacetime military presence. At the time, this disposition of military forces represented a historically novel practice. The rational and norm-oriented logics of action that characterize much international relations theory explain cooperation as proceeding from a foundation of given interests. This perspective constrains the ability of analysts to make sense of the dynamic nature and potential creativity of cooperative endeavors. Building on a pragmatist understanding of action, this paper conceptualizes cooperation as a contingent process, characterized by the reciprocal relationship of means and ends, through which actors’ initially ambiguous interests become more concrete. The ends of cooperation emerge endogenously, and the potential for creativity is inherent in the process. This dynamic resulted in the specific form of the American commitment to Europe. A pragmatist account foregrounds agency and in doing so draws attention to important developments that traditional analyses may overlook or assume in the effort to reconstruct a pre-existing structure of interests as the basis for cooperation. By underlining the processual cast of action, this paper also helps recontextualize institutionalization as one step within a broader cooperative dynamic.",

          "abstract": "Why has gold persisted as a significant reserve asset despite momentous changes in international monetary relations since the collapse of the classical gold standard? IPE theories have little to say about this question. Conventional accounts of international monetary relations depict a succession of discrete monetary regimes characterized by specific power structures or dominant ideas. To explain the continuous importance of gold, we draw on insights from social psychology and new materialist theories. We argue that international monetary relations should be understood as a complex assemblage of material artifacts, institutions, ideas, and practices. For much of its history, this assemblage revolved around the pivotal practice of referencing money to gold. The centrality of gold as experienced by policymakers had important effects. Using archival and other evidence, we document these effects from the 1944 Bretton Woods conference through the transition to floating exchange rates in the mid 1970s – a period during which most IPE scholars underestimate the role of gold. Power relations and economic ideas were obviously important but contributed little to a fundamental development: the long process of reluctantly coming to terms with the limitations of specie-backed currency, and the progressive and still ongoing de-centering of gold in international monetary relations.",

Aside from its role in metatheoretical debate, scholars have enlisted the paradigm concept to explain policy change, particularly in the international political economy (IPE) literature. In this context, policy paradigms are defined primarily in ideational terms and with respect to a specific domain of policymaking. We argue that this stance overstates the ideational coherence of policymaking and runs a risk of reification. We re-evaluate the paradigm concept by drawing a link to the recent literature on norm change that emphasizes the importance of practice and process. This analysis highlights theoretical difficulties in using the paradigm concept, as the relation of ideas to practical logics elides the distinctness of paradigmatic frameworks. Without clear boundaries, paradigms lose much of their analytical purchase. While the paradigm concept initially proved useful in highlighting the role of ideas, it is time to recognize its limits in explaining stability and change in policymaking.",

This is particularly important in European multiparty systems where issue-based voting has become salient. We hypothesize that socio-cultural issues are more likely to generate trade-offs between issue congruence and democratic principles than ‘left-right’ issues, and that these effects are asymmetrical between proponents and opponents of an issue. We test these hypotheses with evidence from a pre-registered conjoint experiment (n=2406) from Finland. We find strong evidence that citizens are willing to prioritize issue positions over democratic principles. However, contrary to our expectations, these effects are similar when it comes to socio-cultural policy issues and the more established ‘left-right’ issues, nor are the effects asymmetrical between opponents and proponents of various policies.",

          "abstract": "This paper estimates the causal eﬀects of unexpected daycare\nclosures on maternal and child well-being using machine learning methods\nfor causal inference. Our identification strategy exploits the conditional in-\ndependence of closure assignment given observed covariates, with closures\nprimarily driven by external staﬃng constraints rather than family charac-\nteristics. Using survey data from 14,867 mothers in Germany, we examine\nboth maternal self-reported well-being (WHO-5) and mother-assessed child\nwell-being (KINDL scales). Our causal forest analysis reveals significant\ndose-response relationships: short closures reduce maternal well-being by\n-0.097 standard deviations (SD) (95% CI: [-0.136, -0.058]), while longer clo-\nsures show stronger eﬀects -0.192 SD (95% CI: [-0.261, -0.123]). Children’s\noutcomes follow similar patterns, with daycare-specific well-being showing\nlarge eﬀects (-0.178 SD for longer closures). Mediation analysis reveals that\nclosure eﬀects operate primarily through perceived process quality rather\nthan structural disruptions. For maternal well-being, approximately 53% of\nthe eﬀect is mediated through process quality perceptions, while for child\noutcomes this proportion reaches up to 100%. Our heterogeneity analysis\nusing decision trees identifies vulnerable subgroups: families without alterna-\ntive childcare arrangements and those with inflexible work schedules experi-\nence disproportionately worse outcomes. While unexpected closures emerged\nduring COVID-19, today’s closures represent chronic structural problems af-\nfecting 44% of German families.

The results revealed that all groups could be identified well above chance and received positive evaluations in terms of status and solidarity-based traits. However, traditional speakers were correctly identified significantly more often and were perceived more favourably in the social evaluations. In the feature analysis, new speakers’ accents were largely described as deviant from traditional speakers’ although some distinctive patterns were also identified.

          "abstract": "In the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 attacks, reports of anti-Israel expressions at German universities have raised questions about the prevalence and nature of such sentiments in academic environments. Traditional survey-based research on antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment is often limited by response biases and social desirability bias. This study introduces a novel field-experimental approach to measuring anti-Israel sentiment in a real-world university setting. Using event history analysis, it examines the removal probability of stickers of the Israeli flag compared to German, US, Palestinian, and rainbow flags at a German university. Over a 24-week period, 600 stickers were placed on 50 public notice boards and were monitored for 14-day cycles. The results provide strong evidence of anti-Israel sentiment. The Israeli flag had the highest removal rate, with only 47.5% of the flags remaining at the end of the observation period—significantly lower than the survival rates of the other flags (which range from 68% to 80%). Cox regression analysis confirms that Israeli flags faced the highest removal hazard, being 3.3 to 3.7-times more likely to be removed than the rainbow flag and nearly twice as likely as the German flag. Politically motivated removals, though less frequent, disproportionately targeted Israeli flags as well. Removal rates were highest in hallways of the humanities, shared humanities/social sciences as well as in central facilities hallways. Hallways in the natural sciences, the human- and social sciences and economics had lower removal rates. Areas with higher student traffic exhibited fewer removals. Overall, the findings indicate a pronounced anti-Israel bias on campus, distinct from attitudes toward other nationalities or symbols.",

This study examines two key features of commonplace clientelism that may govern whether and to what extent citizens deem it punishable by the law. We posit a “particularism penalty,” by which citizens desire greater punishment for actions targeting narrower social groups, and an “outgroup actor penalty”, by which preferred punishment is greater for ethnic-political opponents. A survey experiment with Kikuyu and Luo respondents in Kenya reveals that respondents prefer more punishment for explicitly targeting supporters — coethnics or copartisans — versus general people, with little difference between coethnics and copartisans, regardless of the perpetrator’s partisanship. At the same time, they systematically prefer more punishment for partisan outgroup actors. These findings underscore that public opinion would support a legal evolution away from clientelism towards supporters, even as citizens remain more lenient towards ingroup members.",

          "abstract": "The paper attempts to explore the affective representation of war in Sudanese American poet Emtithal (Emi) Mahmoud’s collection Sister’s Entrance (2018). In her debut collection, Mahmuod offers a poignant exploration of war’s emotional and psychological toll through the lens of a woman immigrant from Darfur. The poetry in this collection is not solely about the war in Darfur or Mahmoud’s experience during that time. It delves into the war, but it also highlights the repercussions of the war for her and her family. Such repercussions as displacement, becoming a refugee and eventually living with a hyphenated identity in a world that pays very little attention to her people’s suffering. The paper utilizes the theoretical framework of the “affective turn” which highlights the importance of viewing the body/individual’s existence in the world through its affective nature. Using affect theory to read Mahmoud’s poetry helps in illuminating aspects of the Sudanese war experience that relate not only to the poet’s experience as a Sudanese who lived through a civil war and became a refugee in exile, but also helps us understand how feelings of confusion, grief and hope are somewhat universal. Through the examination of Mahmoud’s poetry, the aim of the paper is to highlight the nuanced nature of the Sudanese war and offer a differentiated understanding of a war that is often underrepresented or misrepresented.",

          "abstract": "Unlike conventional machine translation (MT), large language models (LLMs) are unique in producing various translations based on different prompts. Researchers have suggested designing detailed translation prompts to improve the translation output of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered LLMs. This study investigates how LLMs respond to prompts that include extratextual information typically included in a translation brief to a human translator. The underlying goal is to probe LLM models’ potential in human translator work and training. To answer the research question, three passages from tourist brochures were submitted to ChatGPT with five prompts, which included information on the text function, translation purpose, and target audience. To identify any effect on the output, cultural references and promotional devices (e.g., imagery, personal deixis, and emotive words) were identified in the passages, followed by a comparison of their translations across the five texts. The study’s significance lies in applying concepts in translation theories such as the translation brief to the novel field of prompt design, moving beyond the usual linguistic accuracy metrics of MT assessment. The analysis showed that ChatGPT did not recognize cultural references as elements that might require explication for the target audience. It also rendered textual persuasive devices faithfully regardless of any changes in the prompts. These faithful translations were not always successful in preserving the textual functions of persuasion. The results suggest that more specific and detailed prompts are needed to bring MT closer to human translation.",

The study aims to explore students’ perceptions of the obstacles encountered during simultaneous interpreting and develop a structured training program informed by their feedback. The methodology employed in this study involved a structured questionnaire designed to assess the perceptions of student interpreters regarding the challenges they face in simultaneous interpreting. Data analysis included calculating means and standard deviation for each item, revealing that participants recognized the complexity of simultaneous interpreting. The study suggested a training program based on trainees’ feedback to improve their knowledge and procedural competence to overcome these challenges and difficulties in practicing simultaneous interpreting professionally. After identifying the specific obstacles student interpreters perceive, the study suggested training programs through corrective exercises and tasks based on these findings to improve trainees’ competence and performance in simultaneous interpreting. The structured training program should be followed to enhance trainees’ linguistic and cognitive competence, cultural proficiency, and interpreting skills. The results highlight that while students acknowledge the existence of significant challenges, they collectively reject the notion that these challenges can be easily overcome. The results imply that a structured training program is needed for the trainees to overcome the obstacles they face in simultaneous interpreting. The training program includes the structural and cultural differences between English and Arabic. The significance of the study lies in its practical contribution to interpreter education by addressing real-world difficulties identified by trainees and offering corrective exercises and targeted tasks. This approach ensures that training aligns with students’ needs and equips them with the procedural competence necessary for professional simultaneous interpreting",

          "abstract": "This research paper aims to analyze the experience of exile in four Arab narratives through the lens of Edward Said’s exploration of alienation as a result of exile. By analyzing a selection of texts—Mourid Barghouti’s I Saw Ramallah (2003), Radwa Ashour’s The Woman From Tantoura (2014), Tarek Eltayeb’s Cities Without Palms (2009), and Muhsin Al-Ramli’s novel Dates On My Fingers (2014), this paper will highlight the various ways in which Arab exiles experience alienation and reframe certain immigrant narratives as exile. It will address the importance of examining diverse narratives of exile, how Said’s works can help explore the theme of alienation as expressed by various Arab writers, the necessity of a more nuanced perspective on exiles and immigrants, and the significance of these narratives in relation to contemporary political issues.\nThrough the thematic analysis of these works, it was concluded that immigrant narratives like Cities Without Palms (Eltayeb, 2009) and Dates On My Fingers (Al-Ramli, 2014) share significant parallels with exile narratives such as I Saw Ramallah (Barghouti, 2003) and The Woman From Tantoura (Ashour, 2014) particularly within the Arab context. Properly labeling literature is essential in today’s world, where people increasingly seek concise, focused information. Reframing certain immigrant narratives as literature of exile, as this research paper attempts to do, helps identify their intended audience and ensures that they reach the right readers and scholars.",

          "authors": "AWEJ-tls for Translation &amp; Literary Studies; Chaimae El Idrissi Amiri; Tayeb Ghourdou",
          "abstract": "This article examines the complex dynamics of challenge and conformity that female filmmakers navigate in their portrayal of women in contemporary Moroccan drama series.  It explores the extent to which female-led filmmaking subverts traditional gender norms and promotes women’s empowerment in media representation. As agents of change, female directors are expected to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional, and empowering portrayals of women. This study aims to illuminate that, despite their efforts to address the underrepresentation of women in the male-dominated industry by centring women’s experiences, female filmmakers inadvertently continue to reinforce conventional stereotypes. Two prominent television series were selected, critically analysed and compared using a qualitative thematic analysis approach to substantiate this argument. The first, Dar Nsa (2024) (House of Women), is a drama series directed by Samia Akariou and aired on Al Aoula. The second, Al-Mukhtafi (2023) (The Disappeared), is a mystery drama by Zakia Tahiri, broadcast on 2M. Both filmmakers are acclaimed for their gender-focused endeavours to promote women’s rights, gender equality, and empowerment through their creative work. However, this study reveals that their recent works fail to achieve these objectives. Data analysed through a feminist theoretical framework demonstrates that female filmmakers adopt an ambivalent discourse, resulting in a constrained representation that reinforces embedded patriarchal norms instead of undermining them. Results also indicate that this ambivalence arises from structural pressures, market demands, and internalised gender norms. This research contributes to feminist media literature by highlighting that female-authored filmmaking does not necessarily lead to fully empowering narratives. It recommends that female filmmakers embrace more intentional feminist approaches to actively reshape the misrepresentation of women in Moroccan media",

Numerous studies in the field of translation studies have focused on similes. This study offers a comprehensive overview of simile translation research in the last 25 years (2000−2024) based on bibliometric analysis, both in the global and Indonesian context. This study aims: (1) to find out bibliometric information regarding the simile translation research, (2) to find out the prominent topics in simile translation research, and (3) to find out the prominent approaches in simile translation research. This study applied mixed methods, namely quantitative and qualitative. The dataset in this study was obtained from the Scopus database (96 publications) as a global representation and the GARUDA database (62 publications) as a national representation of Indonesia. This study analyzed keywords using Sketch Engine to find prominent topics and approaches in simile translation research. First, this study presents a bibliometric analysis of simile translation research, which includes the number of publications, publishers, journals, types of publications, languages used, and the most widely used references. Second, the topic widely analyzed is simile as a figurative language closely related to metaphors and idioms. Third, the approaches used in simile translation research in the global context are (1) eco-translation, (2) formal and dynamic equivalence, (3) linguo-cultural, and (4) corpus-based. Meanwhile, in the national context of Indonesia, the approaches used are (1) qualitative, (2) cognitive, and (3) functionalist. These findings provide an overview for future studies on trends and gaps in simile translation research.",

          "abstract": "Undoubtedly, enhancing translation processes and increasing the understanding of Arabic-English political and cultural contexts by illuminating new political metaphor translation procedures are crucial. This study aimed to examine the translation of political metaphors from English to Arabic in political discourse and then to identify the strategies that translators utilize. This study employed deep analysis to achieve the main objective and presented several frequencies. This study revealed the following findings. This study advances translation studies by adding the (H) category to Newmark’s metaphor translation procedures. Although Newmark’s paradigm offers several ways to convey metaphors, this H category is “The equivalent contextual meaning of being true to the original text and communicating the correct contextual meaning of the metaphor”. Additionally, several metaphors in the source language have direct equivalents in Arabic, and Arabic translators have not invented any new versions or techniques in response to these findings. Hence, the study contributed to the translation procedures. Next, the choice of metaphors that are appropriate for use in the target language is affected not only by linguistic and cultural considerations but also by the nature of the text, speakers’ purposes, and the metaphors themselves. Next, this study sheds light on how translators address the language and cultural obstacles that arise while attempting to translate metaphors, offering insights into the translation process. The study also introduces the “H” category, which adds a new dimension to Newmark’s methods. This can help translators explain political meanings more accurately. Accordingly, additional studies should be conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of metaphor translation procedures in political discourse.",

          "authors": "Alexander Rushforth",
          "abstract": "A growing science reform movement has emerged over the past decade to address dysfunctions in academic research assessment, with several national and transnational stakeholder initiatives promoting and coordinating collective action. This paper offers an analytic commentary on one such effort: the Dutch national Recognition and Rewards program. Since its launch in 2019, the initiative has become one of the most advanced and coordinated national reform programs of its kind. The progress and development to date of this national reform effort is considered, drawing on several theoretical strands to make sense of developments. I make the case that the initiative has been largely effective in mobilizing formal organizational support from key stakeholders in Dutch research, but significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly regarding uncertain buy-in and implementation by rank-and-file academics - the ultimate implementers of the envisioned changes. Although some of the dynamics discussed here are specific to the Dutch context, the question of how to bridge the implementation gap between organization-led change programs and day-to-day academic research culture will be, I believe, a crucial one for equivalent initiatives globally. The paper ends with some suggestions for tackling this important challenge.",

It introduces the category of re-representation as a new form of mapping and examines its defining characteristics through the references of Gaiagraphy / Terra Forma and the Feral Atlas. Beyond isolated experiments, the paper argues that a culture of re-representation is beginning to emerge. Re-representations are conceptualized as multimodal assemblages that engage with situated landscapes as patchy zones of mattering processes. The concept of mattering processes emphasizes re-representations' capacity to explore and articulate what comes to matter in and as landscapes.",

It evaluates how receptive White, Black, Latino, and Asian Americans are to how others self-identify by race/ethnicity. Insights from Bourdieu on classification struggles combined with status characteristics theory and gender research suggest that all Americans will police the higher-status White category more than other ethno-racial categories. Other possibilities include White exceptionalism—only White Americans police the White category most—and ingroup overexclusion—everyone polices their own category most. In a conjoint experiment with two samples we find White, Black, Latino and Asian Americans all police the White category most diligently, i.e., they are less responsive when someone identifies as White than when they identify as Latino, Asian, Middle Eastern or North African, or, in most cases, Black. Our results reveal a consensus across Americans on a racial classification schema that reinscribes the contemporary racial hierarchy.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of various educational equalization strategies on labor market disparities by social origin in Great Britain. Specifically, we examine three hypothetical interventions: 1) equalizing higher education rates across social origin groups, 2) equalizing the labor market returns to higher education across social origin groups, and 3) randomly assigning higher education within each social origin group. We hypothesize that equalizing access to higher education would reduce labor market disparities, while the random assignment of high-er education within origin groups would increase them. Reframing conflicting arguments in an ongoing debate, we propose competing hypotheses on whether equalizing returns to higher education increases or decreases labor market disparities. To test these hypotheses, we use a novel non-parametric decomposition method and longitudinal data from the 1970 British Cohort Study. For both sexes, our findings show that equalizing higher education attainment rates would reduce labor market disparities, whereas randomly assigning higher education within origin groups would have no significant impact. The effect of equalizing the benefits of higher education varies by sex and differs depending on whether wages or occupational out-comes are considered.",

          "abstract": "Residential buildings account for 17-20% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, posing a significant challenge in transitioning all buildings to net zero. While heat pumps and building retrofits can significantly reduce emissions, homeowners are often unaware of their energy usage and the potential for cost reduction. Supervised machine learning methods have the potential to provide actionable insights for individual energy end-users, enabling them to reduce both GHG emissions and energy costs. We propose a novel framework that utilizes baseline, intervention, and optimization models to predict emissions and cost estimates for individual energy end users. This paper presents a novel application of an optimization model for energy bills through machine learning methods: (1) classification of time series data for electricity and gas usage baselines, (2) prediction of GHG emission reductions, and (3) prediction of energy cost reductions. This study suggests energy retrofit policy implications that utilize machine learning as an enabling technology, empowering decision-makers and end-users to tackle climate change.",

          "authors": "Olan McEvoy; Lucian Plaumann",
          "abstract": "Across advanced economies in Europe, the agricultural sector relies heavily on seasonal migrant workers. Despite being declared ‘essential’ by many governments during the coronavirus pandemic, these workers are widely documented to face extremely poor working and living conditions, along with low wages. While existing literature has primarily focused on countries in southern Europe, this paper examines Germany’s agricultural sector as facing similar challenges in securing migrant workers’ rights. Around 300,000 migrant workers come to Germany each year for the harvest season, with most now arriving from Romania and Poland. We find that the employment of this workforce is driven by structural changes in Germany’s agricultural sector, the Europeanisation of migration policy, the deregulation of the German labour market, the proliferation of new employment categories, and the dominance of sectoral business interests in policymaking. The German case illustrates both the difficulty of regulating precarious, low-wage work in a sector traditionally weak in labour organising, and how the Europe-wide nature of the issue means that, without coordinated action by the labour movement across the EU, the ‘race to the bottom’ in this sector will continue.",

          "authors": "Nicole Kapelle; Andrea Michelle Tilstra",
          "abstract": "While many life course transitions are associated with weight gain, marital separation follows a different trajectory and instead is associated with weight loss. Research remains inconclusive whether the weight changes are intentional or if they reflect more unintentional mechanisms. We first examine fluctuations in both objective (BMI) and subjective weight (self-rated weight and weight satisfaction) before, during, and after marital separation. In the year of separation, women’s BMI decreases by an average of 1 unit (equivalent to 6.3 pounds for a 5’5” woman), compared to a 0.3 unit decline for men (approximately 2 pounds for a 5’10” man). These patterns align with shifts in subjective weight: around the year of separation, men and women report greater weight satisfaction and women are less likely to perceive themselves as overweight. We then explore potential explanatory mechanisms to elucidate intentionality. Results indicate no substantial changes in dieting and exercise for women or men during marital dissolution but concurrent increases in psychological distress that are more substantial for men, highlighting that weight changes might be linked to unintentional stress-related mechanisms rather than intentional weight-loss behaviors. The findings shown here underscore the complex and socially embedded ways in which bodies respond to major life transitions.",

Are individuals’ earnings trajectories primarily shaped by their social class position, or do trajectories vary within them? These unresolved questions lie at the heart of debates on social class and labor market rewards. To address them, we leverage employment relations theory and data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. We use mixed effects models with heterogenous variance components, and latent group mixed effects models. Our findings align with our central argument that the degree of similarity in trajectories within social classes differs across classes. Social class is linked to typical earnings trajectories, with a pronounced division between the salariat and other classes. However, the degree of trajectory similarity varies across classes. Salaried workers show the least tightly clustered trajectories. Fluctuation in earnings is most pronounced for lower-grade and routine workers. Social class outperforms occupational and post-class accounts at predicting earnings trajectories.",

However, between 2016 and 2024, Latinos were among the groups whose pro-GOP shift was the largest. How did Trump increase Latino support despite the mismatch between his opposition to unauthorized immigration and Latinos' historically pro-immigration views? We investigate this question primarily using multiple high-quality, population-based panels of Latinos interviewed in English or Spanish (2016-2024). We document a restrictionist turn in Latinos' attitudes, alongside perceptions that both parties slightly moderated. Immigration attitudes were consistently integrated with vote choice to roughly the same degree in 2016, 2020, and 2024 for both Latino and white voters, and do not prove especially predictive for Latinos. These findings demonstrate that while immigration has not waned in importance for Latinos, Democrats' advantage on immigration is eroding.",

These findings, grounded in the literature, reveal the counterproductive and exclusionary outcomes of fear-based disciplinary practices. The study identifies a significant mismatch between punitive traditions and educational policies that advocate empathy, inclusion, and student protection. It calls for a shift toward student-centered disciplinary approaches and more responsive institutional mechanisms. By linking lived experience with critical pedagogy, the paper contributes to calls for meaningful educational reform that centers emotional well-being, systemic accountability, and pedagogical equity.",

Brian Simpson’s study of Regina v Dudley and Stephens (1884) \nand Cătălin Avramescu’s intellectual history of cannibalism, it critically examines “providential” and \n“catastrophic” lifeboat metaphors in political thought. Despite their apparent opposition, these \nmetaphors share common assumptions rooted in natural law traditions. As an alternative, the essay\nintroduces the concept of the “commonist lifeboat,” grounded in maritime custom, class \nconsciousness, and environmental encounters. Inspired by historical practices of survival and mutual \naid at sea, this approach suggests principles for addressing climate adaptation through bottom-up \ncustoms rather than top-down theoretical solutions. Three brief illustrations address climate policy’s \nintersections with property law, criminal law, and international human rights law. This approach \nultimately offers a historically informed perspective on climate crisis challenges, reconciling \nconsequentialist arguments with concerns for dignity and consent.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to leverage the heterogeneity in Gender Role Attitudes in Germany and the different prevailing ideas of marriage between the east and west of the country to investigate the role played by agreement on gender roles in partnership transitions, comparing contexts with different prevailing ideas of marriages. Marriage is still perceived as normative in Germany and enshrined in institutions, yet marriage rates have been declining in the last decades. I investigate whether attitudes towards gender roles held jointly by couples and their change might explain this discrepancy.  I examine a sample of 1297 German couples followed yearly from the beginning of their partnership onwards from 2008 to 2019, with information on both partners, selected from a representative probability sample. I use a series of Competing Risk survival models, comparing couples from West Germany with couples from East Germany. Sharing attitudes towards gender roles at the beginning of the relationship is positively related to marriage likelihoods in the West but not in the East. Convergence to a shared attitude for couples who start with diverging attitudes is also correlated with higher marriage risks, with differences between West German and East German couples. Correlation between attitudinal convergence and marriage probabilities highlights the need for couple-focused research when investigating partnership patterns. Differences in the correlations between West- and East German couples indicate possible effects of the predominant idea of marriage on the relationship between couple’s gender attitudes and their relationship outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This Chapter focuses on the policy impact of the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European \nUnion (the Court). We define policy impact as the ability of the Court to produce change in the \npolitical domain. We analyze this impact across two different dimensions: horizontal and vertical. \nThe horizontal dimension looks at the impact of the Court's rulings on European Union policies, that \nis, to what extent the judgments of the Court impact the policy output of the European Union \nlegislator. The vertical dimension focuses on the impact of the Court's judgments on Member States' \nlegal orders. We understand this broadly, as encompassing change as showing through in legislation, \ncase law, policies, and administrative decisions. \nThe Chapter systematically reviews the existing literature on policy impact across the vertical and \nhorizontal dimensions to systematize existing knowledge and identify lacunas, shortcomings and \nchallenges in the study of the Court's policy impact. We analyze the state of the art both in the legal \nand political science literatures. We find some stark disagreement as per the extent to which the Court \nimpacts policy outcomes at the European Union level. Along the vertical dimension, the impact of \nthe Court's rulings is generally accepted, but research mostly relies on qualitative studies and hence \nresults greatly vary. \nTaking stock of the existing literature, with its strengths and weaknesses, in the last part of the Chapter \nwe propose to think anew about how to empirically research the policy impact of the Court's \njudgments. This involves, on the one hand, rethinking some of the current dogmas and assumptions \nin the field. On the other hand, we argue that new empirical strategies need to be developed for a \nbetter study of the policy impact of the Court. To this end, we suggest several concrete elements that \ncould push forward the empirical study of impact, and discuss the different limitations of our \nproposed approach (in particular, the unavailability of data) and how these could be overcome. We \nconclude with a reflection on how the empirical research on this field can not only enlarge our \nknowledge of the real impact of the Court's judgments, but also bridge and nuance some of the \ndivergent views in legal and political science studies.",

          "authors": "Maria Gargiulo",
          "abstract": "Quantifying mortality in conflict settings is a challenging but necessary task for health and humanitarian response, historical memory, and accountability. In conflict settings, traditional demographic data sources, like vital statistics, may not be available or of suitable quality for mortality estimation. However, alternative sources documenting the deceased may exist, such as digital trace data, news reports, or data collected by civil society organizations. These sources are not without their own biases. Rather than being statistically representative samples or complete counts, they are convenience samples: they represent the fraction of violence that was documented. However, when multiple sources are taken together, multiple systems estimation (capture-recapture) can be used for mortality estimation. This article describes a workflow for mortality estimation using disparate and statistically biased data sources, motivated by three missing data challenges commonly encountered in conflict settings: missing identifiers to link victims across sources, missing covariates in records of documented victims, and records of victims that are entirely undocumented. The workflow is demonstrated using data about conflict-related homicides during the armed conflict in Colombia from 1985–2018. Beyond its applications to conflict mortality estimation, this workflow can be applied to examine mortality due to other causes or other events of demographic interest.",

          "authors": "Shancheng Liu",
          "abstract": "Feminism in China has faced significant stigmatisation from both the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and nationalists, frequently being labeled as a “destabilising factor,” “Western interference,” or even “extremism” subject to criticism and suppression. This repressive stance is largely anticipated, given the widely acknowledged patriarchal nature of the Chinese state and the prominent role of nationalism in its ideology, wherein feminism and nationalism are often perceived as antithetical. However, the emergence of pink feminism (fenhong nvquan) in China since 2020 has challenged this rigid opposition by embracing feminism and nationalism simultaneously. To understand this alternative relationship between feminism and nationalism in China, this study employs online ethnography to explore how pink feminism reconciles the seemingly contradictory nature of feminism and nationalism. Through thematic analysis, four themes explaining the reconciliation emerge: 1) Pink Feminism as Marxist/socialist feminism; 2) conditional nationalism; 3) Pink Feminism as post-colonial feminism; 4) “China” as a multi-faceted notion and constructive patriotism.  By examining pink feminism, this study contributes to a more heterogeneous understanding of contemporary Chinese feminism, challenges oversimplified interpretations of Chinese feminism and nationalism, and sheds light on the CCP’s resilience in navigating the rise of grassroots feminist movements.",

          "authors": "Daniel Nettle; Coralie Chevallier; Kate Pickett; Matthew Thomas Johnson; Elliott Aidan Johnson; Melissa Bateson",
          "abstract": "There is some evidence that income volatility (fluctuations in income over time) negatively affects mental and physical health, independently of the level of income. Evidence to date has examined fluctuations from year to year or from day to day, whereas a more relevant timescale might be month to month. Here, we use data from the Changing Cost of Living Study, a longitudinal panel from the UK and France with monthly data (n = 484). We examine the association between month-to-month income volatility and two outcomes, self-rated general health and anxiety-depression (a composite measure derived from GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores). Higher volatility was associated with worse health on both measures, with volatility accounting for similar amounts of variation as the level of income. Some association between income volatility and health is to be expected as a consequence of the concavity of the income-health relationship: because of concavity, a downward fluctuation damages health more than the equivalent upward fluctuation improves it. We show that the observed associations are 3 and 4 times too strong to be explained by this mechanism alone. We suggest that volatility, because it introduces uncertainty and stress, has substantial direct health effects. This claim is important for public policy: it means that policies and institutions that smooth people’s income streams can have beneficial health effects even if they don’t raise anyone’s income.",

Cognitive dissonance occurs when people face situations that do not confirm their expectations. Past WT participants have protested that involuntary, inescapable, and harsh conditions harmed them through PTSD and subsequent dissociation. This argumentative study compares dissonance and dissociation using a critical realist and argumentative research process using publicly available information. Using the confronting coercive WT model to illuminate concerns clearly, we argue that dissociation is a response recorded in the design of these WT practices and participant statements and is often mistaken for dissonance. Deliberate use of forced cognitive dissonance during involuntary treatments aligns with the conditions that may cause dissociation. Therefore, planning to enforce cognitive dissonance during WT is likely to be harmful and, given this potential, may be regarded as malpractice",

          "abstract": "Criminological research often fails to achieve cumulative theoretical progress despite methodological sophistication. Paul Meehl’s concept of “logical derivation chains” provides a diagnostic framework for understanding this persistent problem, yet it remains largely absent from criminological practice. Using Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory as a detailed case study, including empirical analysis illustrating potential measurement incoherence, I argue that loose derivation chains are structural features of social scientific inquiry rather than correctable methodological problems. Through systematic analysis of sampling, measurement, and analytical choices, I reveal how auxiliary assumptions accumulate throughout the research process, creating compound derivation chain failures. The analysis identifies a “correlation paradox” where a correlation of r = -.31 (p &lt; 2e-16), typically celebrated as impressive empirical support, corresponds to theoretical failure for 39% of individual cases. Contemporary statistical methods systematically privilege aggregate patterns over individual variation, rendering theoretically crucial anomalies invisible and creating research programs that appear progressive despite exhibiting degenerating characteristics. The analysis concludes with strategies for constraint-aware research, including individual-level prediction assessment and item-specific analysis that reveal theoretically important anomalies hidden by aggregate correlations, alongside institutional reforms that encourage genuine theoretical advancement over mere accumulation of supportive correlations.",

Utilizing intervention-based epidemiological study designs, the research estimates the effects of a proposed 25% traffic reduction in downtown LA. Simulated results indicate a substantial decrease in NO2 and PM10 levels, with predicted increases of 1,263.58 years of life gained (YLG) in the greater LA area over a decade. The discussion highlights the potential of CCS to not only reduce pollution but also address socio-economic disparities in health outcomes.

          "abstract": "Should a set of hypothetical educational interventions improve malleable schooling experiences for Blacks to match that of Whites, how much racial disparity in subsequent youth development would be reduced and how much would remain? To address this question, a causal decomposition analysis must credibly identify the potential causal impacts of intervening on one or more malleable factors in education for Blacks. However, simulations of hypothetical interventions targeting the malleable factors within levels of an endogenous confounder such as parental SES would fail to eliminate the marginal Black-White gap in schooling as intended, a dilemma known as “Simpson’s paradox”. Extending the latest developments in methodology, we propose a novel within-group rank-preserving solution that adjusts for endogenous confounding for multivariate malleable factors. A semiparametric weighting strategy then emulates the counterfactual outcome of a hypothetical series of racial equity-oriented educational interventions for Blacks presumably at no expense to Whites. We demonstrate why the methodological development in handling endogenous confounders may have important real-world implications. Applying this causal decomposition strategy to the NLSY97 data, we reveal significant potentials of racial equity in education for reducing Black youths’ disconnections from school and work as they transition into early adulthood.",

To date, this coordinated international effort has been inadequate to halt global biodiversity loss. A major but unaccounted-for cause of the shortfall between policy ambitions and real-world outcomes is the abandonment of conservation initiatives, including both informal abdication of resource management responsibilities and formal reversal of governing rules and boundaries (Fig. 1). The US$200 billion annually committed to conservation is spent on a wide diversity of conservation measures, increasingly beyond traditional national parks and other protected areas (PAs), including community-based conservation, eco-certification, and payments for ecosystem services (2). The scant monitoring of conservation abandonment, derived almost entirely from PAs, demonstrates widespread informal abandonment of management responsibilities (i.e., “paper parks” (e.g., 3, 4)) and formal abandonment through protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) (e.g., 5, 6).",

          "abstract": "This article examines the development of the concept of arnasgune in the Basque context. While initially referring to demographically concentrated areas where a minority language thrives, as a translation of Fishman’s ‘breathing spaces’, arnasgune has undergone significant conceptual expansion. The term has gained traction in academic research, language policy, and media discourse, sparking debate over its precise definition. Through a qualitative analysis of academic literature, policy documents and newspaper articles, this study traces the evolution of arnasgune and its varied uses. This paper identifies two key perspectives: a dominant group advocating for a strict socio-territorial interpretation, and a more flexible understanding of the term. Additionally, this study highlights how the growing prominence of arnasgune has drawn social and policy attention to previously overlooked sociolinguistic contexts crucial to the future of the Basque language. It argues that the contested nature of the term arnasgune enriches local discussions on language revitalisation, also illustrating how conceptual shifts reflect deeper sociolinguistic and cultural transformations in the Basque context. Ultimately, by analysing the evolution and use of the term arnasgune, the article contributes to ongoing discussions surrounding minority language maintenance, language policy and minority language media.",

          "abstract": "Designing for serendipity in information technologies presents significant challenges for both scholars and practitioners. This paper presents a theoretical model of serendipity that aims to address this challenge by providing a structured framework for understanding and designing for serendipity. The model delineates between intended, afforded, and experienced serendipity, recognizing the role of design intents and the subjective nature of experiencing serendipity. Central to the model is the recognition that there is no single definition nor a unique operationalization of serendipity, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to its conceptualization and design. By delineating between the intentions of designers, the characteristics of the system, and the experiences of end-users, the model offers a pathway to resolve the paradox of artificial serendipity and provides actionable guidelines to design for serendipity in information technologies. However, it also emphasizes the importance of establishing ‘guardrails’ to guide the design process and mitigate potential negative unintended consequences. The model aims to lay ground to advance both research and the practice of designing for serendipity, leading to more ethical and effective design practices.",

The new theory, called IBET (short for Inference-to-the-Best-Explanation Theory of theory building and testing), is presented and compared to three rival theories from the social sciences in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses various philosophical issues and underpinnings of IBET, including sections on induction, abduction, causality, and differences between the Philosophy of Science and Social Science literatures on theory building. Chapter 3 presents details and test results from a qualitative empirical test of IBET that examined 41 cases of theory building and testing by recent Nobel prize-winners, 15 from Economics and 26 from Physics.  The conclusions were that (a) there was very strong support for IBET, and (b) this support probably generalizes to all theory building in both Economics and Physics, and (with less confidence) to all scientific theory building.  Then, since Salmon’s criticism of Lipton’s claims about the merits of IBE poses a major threat to IBET, Chapter 4 presents a possible behavioural explanation and reconciliation of Salmon’s and Lipton’s conflicting views on IBE.  Finally, Chapter 5 illustrates many of the issues discussed in the book by presenting a detailed example of one of the author’s attempts at theory building.",

However, open-source models still perform relatively well, achieving 95-96% accuracy on relatively straightforward questions up to 87% on more complex ones. Performance analysis revealed response brevity, but not category brevity, as a strong determinant of successful classification with responses under 50 characters demonstrating 7-11% higher classification accuracy. While models effectively detected nuance in simpler tasks, they struggled with responses containing multiple reasons, narratives, and implicit meanings.\n\nThe findings imply that social science researchers who want to use LLMs should design questions to elicit concise responses (10-50 characters), implement human-in-the-loop review for complex tasks, and carefully select appropriate models based on task complexity. Minimal demographic variation in classification accuracy was observed, with Claude uniquely maintaining consistent performance across population segments.

          "abstract": "In April 2024, Spotify eliminated royalties for tracks with fewer than 1,000 annual streams, justifying the move as a deterrent to streaming fraud, a way to clean up “noise” content and a fix for “trapped” micropayments. Spotify asserted that these changes would benefit “emerging and professional artists” and claimed the policy would not affect music discovery or promotion.\n\nThis study rigorously tests those claims using a 21-month, 42,000-observation dataset normalized for Spotify’s user growth. By applying difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity and event study designs across artist tiers and career stages, the analysis isolates the policy’s true effects.\n\nContrary to its stated intent, the policy produced a paradoxical outcome: mid-tier artists (10,000–100,000 listeners) experienced a 20% drop in market share growth, while artists already on an upward trajectory captured nearly all the gains. These effects emerged gradually, reflecting algorithmic recalibration rather than immediate changes in listener behaviour, and remained robust across multiple sensitivity checks. Notably, the anticipated substitution effect, where attention would shift to adjacent tiers, did not materialize.\n\nThese findings reveal that even policies framed as technical or anti-fraud measures can act as powerful infrastructural interventions, quietly amplifying existing inequalities. Rather than democratizing the platform, Spotify’s threshold deepened market concentration and favoured those already poised to benefit. These results highlight the need for rigorous, forward-looking assessment of policy interventions to fully understand their systemic impacts.",

Recognizing a legitimate scientific journal from a predatory one is becoming increasingly difficult, and the scientific community is coming up with many ways to detect them. One of the new methods is the involvement of artificial intelligence. This short communication summarizes the limits of using artificial intelligence in detecting predatory journals and divides them into three categories – the limits associated with the creation of untrustworthy and legitimate journals, the heterogeneity of definitions and characteristics of predatory journals, and the grey area of scientific publishing. The very cases where artificial intelligence has failed to perform well on this issue speak to the need to add an expert perspective to quantitative machine evaluation of predatory journals and to focus primarily on the data on which artificial intelligence models operate and train.",

We argue that haziness in the meaning of what constitutes an egalitarian work-family arrangement results in an overestimation of the desire for evenly sharing paid and unpaid labor. Using original survey data nationally representative of adults in the United States (N = 998), findings show an unspecified sharing arrangement was chosen as ideal by about 50 percent of respondents. Yet, when given precise definitions of what constitutes equal sharing, only 25 percent of respondents considered an even-sharing arrangement their ideal, whereas the majority opted for uneven or non-symmetrical methods of sharing. Rejecting gender essentialism, the belief that men and women are inherently different, was associated with an increased likelihood in reporting an even-sharing ideal, among both men and women. Being a sole provider was less idolized when gender essentialist beliefs were low, especially among men.

          "authors": "Jana Krause; Marika Miner; Imrana Buba; Melanie Sauter",
          "abstract": "Communal violence remains a pervasive yet understudied form of political violence, often overshadowed by civil wars and electoral conflicts. Although improvements in the quality and accessibility of event data have enabled more systematic and comparative research, significant biases and discrepancies persist. A key obstacle to advancing the field has been the lack of conceptual clarity and standardized coding practices, which hampers comparison of findings. We develop a crisp definition of communal violence and operationalize it with a novel keyword-based coding methodology. Drawing on fieldwork- generated knowledge, we foreground the practices, along with the issues, identities and actors involved. Hence, we focus not only on the ‘who’ but more importantly on the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of communal violence. Applying our method to the case of Nigeria, we generate new insights about the geography and trends of communal violence and their interaction with other forms of armed violence. Our findings underscore that dataset choice and coding rules can lead to rather different conclusions about the scale and impact of ‘local violence’. Our transparent and adaptable coding scheme offers a replicable framework for analyzing communal violence across diverse contexts and datasets.",

          "authors": "David Brady; Alexis Bocanegra; Diana Cervantes; Lauren Macy; Nasdira Romero Saravia; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Immigrants are now more than one-fifth of the poor in the U.S. Yet, despite some valuable literature, immigrant poverty remains arguably understudied. This study builds on the larger literatures on immigrant attainment and poverty, and the smaller literature on immigrant poverty. Using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), we provide an improved descriptive demographic portrait of immigrant poverty from 1993-2023, across 51 states (including D.C.), and within 2019-2024 (N=760,026). There is considerable heterogeneity over time. After declining for several decades, immigrant poverty increased substantially in recent years. Immigrant poverty also varies enormously across states. States’ immigrant poverty rates are moderately negatively correlated with states’ immigrant share of the population and strongly positively correlated with states’ non-immigrant poverty. There are large heterogeneities by nation of origin as well. While immigrants from India have among the lowest poverty of any group in the U.S., Honduran immigrant poverty is 6-7 times higher. While especially being a non-citizen immigrant increases poverty, heterogeneities in immigrant poverty are driven more by the major risks of poverty than the immigrant characteristics of being a citizen, years of residence, or mixed status households. That said, heterogeneities by nation of origin are explained by varying mixes of risks, immigrant characteristics and educational selectivity. Ultimately, we demonstrate immigrant poverty is not one coherent phenomenon. Indeed, the heterogeneities within immigrant poverty are perhaps even more important than the heterogeneities in poverty between immigrants and non-immigrants. (Stone Center Working Paper Series)",

We recruited 1,043 Americans who expressed willingness to test a new\nsocial media platform by installing a mobile app we developed for iOS and Android devices.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to spend ten minutes on one of two versions of a simulated\nsocial media platform. The first was a control condition designed to resemble typical text-based\nsocial media sites, and users were told that people whose posts are liked very often receive\na “popular user” badge. The second version was identical to the first, but respondents were\ninstead told users receive an “open-minded” badge if they respectfully engage with opposing\nviewpoints. Participants using both versions were asked to join an ongoing discussion about\neither gun control or immigration. Unbeknownst to them, each participant only interacted\nwith chatbots powered by generative AI. We find that respondents assigned to the experimental\ncondition exhibited more intellectually humble language in their posts and comments and\nreported experiencing more positive emotions.

          "abstract": "Even with the widespread availability of nutrition labels and health-related claims on food products, consumers often grapple with comprehending and utilizing this information effectively when deciding on food purchases. The Philippine context reveals a gap in recent research delving into how demographic elements impact consumer attitudes and actions associated with nutrition labeling, thus emphasizing the necessity for a localized exploration of this topic.\nThis study explored consumers' buying behavior towards nutritional labels and health claims. It aimed to determine the relationship between consumers' demographic characteristics and their understanding and utilization of nutritional facts when making food purchases.\nA descriptive-correlational design was utilized. A structured questionnaire was administered to 184 respondents from diverse sociodemographic backgrounds. The instrument collected data on age, sex, educational attainment, monthly income, perceptions of nutrition labels, and label usage behavior. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis were employed to analyze the data.\nResearch revealed that health-conscious and budget-conscious consumers were inclined to scrutinize nutrition labels and health claims when selecting food items. Their priorities leaned towards nutritional value and affordability. Conversely, trend followers and convenience seekers paid less attention to nutritional information, tending to make decisions based on taste, brand familiarity, or convenience. The study shows a positive correlation between higher levels of education, increased monthly income, and favorable perceptions and frequent use of nutrition labels.\nThese findings emphasize the significance of embracing consumer diversity in shaping effective nutrition communication strategies. By grasping the intricate behaviors unique to each consumer group, stakeholders can devise tailored interventions, empowering the population with enhanced nutritional knowledge and more conscious dietary decisions.",

          "abstract": "How does the arrival of a new immigrant group affect earlier generations of immigrants? Do group relations and self-identification change? Previous research on ethnic boundaries is usually restricted to a two-group paradigm and primarily focuses on the majority group’s perspective. In contrast, this study analyzes how the arrival of refugees in Germany influenced previous immigrants of Turkish and Polish origin by exploiting regional and temporal variation in refugee immigration. I combine macro data about refugees with individual longitudinal data of a large-scale German panel survey (SOEP) from 2012 to 2018 based on a random sample. Using fixed effects estimations, this study finds that an increasing proportion of refugees in a county increased concerns about immigration and decreased self-reported discrimination among Turkish (N = 676 respondents, n = 2,914 person-years) and Polish (N = 513 respondents, n = 2,141 person-years) respondents. Moreover, Turkish immigrants showed a tendency to feel more German and felt closer to Turkey at the same time. Poles also felt more German but not closer to Poland. These results are in line with the theoretical assumptions that minority groups tend to distance themselves from new immigrants, and use the opportunity to improve their own social position by strengthening their identification with the majority and/or with their own ethnic group.",

          "abstract": "A growing science reform movement has emerged over the past decade to address dysfunctions in academic research assessment, with several national and transnational stakeholder initiatives promoting and coordinating collective action. This paper offers an analytic commentary on one such effort: the Dutch national Recognition and Rewards program. Since its launch in 2019, the initiative has become one of the most advanced and coordinated national reform programs of its kind. The progress and development to date of this national reform effort is considered, drawing on several theoretical strands to make sense of developments. I make the case that the initiative has been largely effective in mobilizing formal organizational support from key stakeholders in Dutch research, but significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly regarding uncertain buy-in and implementation by rank-and-file academics - the ultimate implementers of the envisioned changes. Although some of the dynamics discussed here are specific to the Dutch context, the question of how to bridge the implementation gap between organization-led change programs and day-to-day academic research culture will be, I believe, a crucial one for equivalent initiatives globally.

          "abstract": "As climate change intensifies, internal migration due to climate extreme events is becoming increasingly common in the Global South. Yet, little is known about how rural host communities respond to environmental migrants. This study investigates attitudes towards internally displaced environmental migrants in northern Bangladesh, focusing on three key mechanisms: perceived deservingness, empathy through geographic and experiential proximity, and personal contact. We draw on a pre-registered, face-to-face survey with 265 rural respondents. At the core of our survey is a forced-choice conjoint experimental design (N=936) to causally assess how different migrant characteristics -- including reason for migration, occupation, religion, and distance from origin -- influence host preferences. Findings show that migrants displaced by riverbank erosion are significantly more likely to be accepted than economic migrants, reflecting a strong role for deservingness in shaping attitudes. Environmental displacement also attenuates discrimination based on other migrant attributes, such as religion, occupation, and distance of migrant origin. Respondents who experienced similar environmental hardships, such as erosion-induced house loss, expressed the strongest preferences for environmentally displaced migrants, supporting the empathy mechanism. In contrast, simple exposure to in-migrants in the village had no measurable effect on attitudes, challenging assumptions about the universal benefits of intergroup contact. Our study extends the migration attitudes literature by focusing on internal, rural-to-rural displacement in a climate-vulnerable context. These findings highlight how moral judgments and experiential proximity can foster inclusive attitudes even in resource-constrained settings, with important implications for societal resilience under climate change.",

          "abstract": "We examine the effect of childbirth on parents’ environmental and climate concerns, focusing on potentially dynamic changes in concerns within a timespan of two years before and up to 10 years after birth. Additionally, we explore effect heterogeneities by gender and educational attainment. By using long-running survey data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study (GSOEP, 1984 – 2020, N=108,340) and estimating linear probability models with fixed-effects, we contribute substantially to previous research that has been limited by cross-sectional approaches with mixed or even contradictory results. Contrary to the popular notion that childbirth leads to higher levels of environmentalism based on legacy motives, our results suggest marginal and mostly negative effects of childbirth on environmental and climate concerns. Overall, the effects of childbirth on planetary concerns tended to be less pronounced in the first years after birth. Over time, however, these effects increased and even reversed. We found no exclusive patterns for men and women and nuances of relevance by educational attainment and item design, highlighting the complex nature of the nexus between family formation, gender, and environmentalism. Parents’ slightly reduced focus on environmental and climate challenges may reflect denial mechanisms during highly stressful times, as they prioritize immediate and novel challenges associated with parenthood, often leading to an increase in less environmentally favorable behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Peer review has long been regarded as a cornerstone of scholarly communication, ensuring high quality and credibility of published research. However, its institutionalization in the mid-20th century contrasts sharply with the 300-year history of academic journals. By the early 21st century, there emerged an opinion that the conventional model of peer review faces systematic challenges, including inefficiency, bias, and institutional inertia. The study aims to synthesize the evolution, practices, and outcomes of both conventional and innovative peer review models in scholarly publishing. Through a mixed-methods approach combining interpretative literature review and process modeling (Business Process Model and Notation – BPMN), it identifies four frameworks: pre-publication peer review, registered reports, modular publishing, and the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. While the PRC model, which integrates preprints with post-publication review, demonstrates advantages in transparency and accessibility, no single approach emerges as universally ideal. The choice of model depends on disciplinary context, resource availability, and institutional priorities. The analysis underscores the need for adaptable platforms that enable hybrid workflows, balancing rigor with inclusivity. Future research must address empirical gaps in evaluating these innovations, particularly their long-term impact on equity and epistemic norms.",

          "abstract": "As a generative AI chatbot which is based on large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT (4.o) offers numerous advantages and promising applications in applied linguistics (Alaqlobi et. al., 2024). However, there are still some uncertainties and concerns regarding its accuracy of responses to some complex questions related to linguistics (Qamar et al., 2024; Nuland, 2024; Dale, 2021). To address this gap, 5 participants as mediators from 5 countries in 3 continents were engaged in this study. Their responsibility was to initially copy a set of predefined questions (syntax, n=1 &amp; semantics, n=1) from the email sent to them and then input them into ChatGPT. The accuracy of responses was measured and checked through the assistance of two senior lecturers in Linguistics at a private college in Athens, Greece. In addition to the evaluation of the questions and responses, the two experts labeled the responses based on three criteria: accurate, partially accurate and inaccurate. The categorized responses were eventually analyzed by a software program. The findings indicated that ChatGPT demonstrated stronger performance in syntax-related questions compared to semantic-related questions. More specifically, its overall performance in responding to more analytical and subject specific questions such as those related to semantics was less than mediocre. This study adds to the persistent debate on the role of AI in linguistics and offers insights into the reliability and accuracy of responses by ChatGPT to complex questions.\n(This preprint was originally posted to OSF on 29 May, available at  https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/9h6z7_v1 \nLicense CC-By Attribution 4.0 International)",

          "authors": "Stefan Scholz",
          "abstract": "Protests can remain peaceful for long periods but then suddenly escalate into violent clashes, influencing the following events. Previous studies have focused on predicting whether protest events will take place or not, but they have not predicted the descriptive characteristics of these events. This gap might be attributed to a reliance on highly aggregated event data, which overlooks abrupt changes that can happen within individual days - such as a protester throwing a stone at a police officer. For this reason, this paper aims to forecast the escalation of protests on individual days and cities. To incorporate within-day dynamics into the prediction models, these dynamics are measured using protest images from social media. By applying computer vision techniques to these images, they can provide detailed estimates of the number of protesters, the tactics employed by the protesters, and the tactics opposed by law enforcement. This approach is demonstrated using a new dataset that includes 13 protest periods and 22,479 protest images. To validate the effectiveness of the new short-term indicators, the predictive performance of machine-learning models is compared against models that cannot draw on them. The results on the hold-out sample show that incorporating short-term dynamics improves the prediction of protest characteristics. While these improvements appear to be marginal, the approach reveals numerous opportunities for forecasting the escalation of protests, which has implications for their mitigation and prevention.",

          "abstract": "The Sulu Archipelago, nestled between Mindanao and Borneo, has been a melting pot of people and cultures for thousands of years. Major sociopolitical changes marked its history, attracting groups of people or forcing drastic dispersals. Today, the islands host various ethnolinguistic groups, including Sama-Badjaw and Tausug-speaking communities. We surveyed the literature from multiple disciplines—linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, history, and genetics—to shed light on past movements and the emergence of ethnicities in the region. Three factors drive ethnogenesis in the Sulu Archipelago: niche or economic specialisation, social hierarchies, and assimilation. Economic specialisation initially fostered differentiation among groups inhabiting reef and island ecosystems. The most extreme adaptive strategy was boat-nomadism, whose origin was tied to the evolving sociopolitical order. With the rise of the Sultanate of Sulu, differences in rank and religion were articulated along ethnic lines. The Tausug assumed formal dominance over the surrounding populace, whereas the Sama Dilaut were relegated to society’s periphery. The mid-eighteenth century saw the integration of Sulu within the global trading network which created a labour-driven economy focused on procuring local products. During this period, the Sama Bangingi emerged as specialised maritime raiders who incorporated captive peoples from parts of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Following the end of foreign imperial control, the peoples of Sulu found themselves subsumed within the modern Philippine state. Social change continues as the Sama Dilaut integrate into the broader Sama milieu, and the rest of the Sulu Archipelago into Filipino society.",

          "authors": "Andreas Jungherr",
          "abstract": "Political disinformation has become a central concern in both public discourse and scholarly inquiry, particularly following the electoral successes of right-wing populist movements in Western democracies since 2016. These events have been widely interpreted through the lens of manipulation, deviance, and disruption; all closely linked to the spread of false information, automated amplification, and foreign interference in digital communication environments. More recently, advances in Artificial Intelligence have added to anxieties about the growing sophistication and scale of disinformation campaigns. Collectively, these concerns are often framed under the concept of digital disinformation and viewed as posing existential threats to democratic systems. This entry provides a comprehensive and critical overview of the disinformation debate. It traces the definitional and conceptual challenges inherent in the term “disinformation,” highlights how digital infrastructures shape both the problem and its perceived urgency, and synthesizes empirical evidence on the actual reach, distribution, and impact of political disinformation. The article distinguishes between individual, collective, and discursive harms, while cautioning against inflated threat narratives that outpace empirical findings. Importantly, the entry addresses the risks of regulatory overreach and centralized control. Efforts to counter disinformation may themselves undermine democratic openness, suppress dissent, and weaken societies’ capacity for collective information processing. In response, the article outlines a research agenda that prioritizes conceptual clarity, empirical rigor, and systemic analysis over alarmism. It advocates for a shift away from overstreching framings of disinformation toward more precise and differentiated understandings of digital political communication and its challenges.",
