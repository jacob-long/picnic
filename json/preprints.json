          "title": "The Influence of Age Structure on Cancer Mortality: Evidence from Italy and Europe, 2020-2022. A Methodological Note",
          "authors": "Leonardo Ventura",
          "abstract": "In epidemiology, standardization is an essential tool when comparing mortality between populations\nwith different age structures. Using Italy, one of the oldest countries in the European Union, and the\nEU-27 aggregate as a case study, this methodological note demonstrates how comparisons between\ncrude mortality rates can give misleading interpretations of disease burden. While crude rates\nsuggested a higher mortality in Italy (≈280 per 100 000) compared to the EU-27 (≈259 per 100\n000), standardized rates showed the reverse pattern (≈224 vs ≈239 per 100 000). A Kitagawa\ndecomposition confirmed that the excess in crude mortality rates for Italy is almost entirely\nexplained by the effect of age structure rather than true etiological factors.\nThis methodological note illustrates the necessity of proper standardization in cancer epidemiology.\nAll the instructions to download the official datasets and the Python scripts for the analysis are\nopenly available on Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.17251977), offering both an educational example\nand a methodological reference for standardization to support students, policymakers, and\nresearchers in applying these techniques.",

          "authors": "Emilio Miguel Bruna",
          "abstract": "Departments and agencies of the United States federal government conduct research on topics ranging from nuclear technology to economic policy. Using the Scopus bibliographic database, I quantified the number of publications by US federal government authors from January 2019--July 2025. I found that the number of articles and book chapters published from January-July 2025 was 14%-19% lower than during the same time period of 2024, resulting in publication deficit of 2,638-6,489 articles. Changes in executive branch policy related to the funding and staffing of federal agencies have led to warnings of an imminent and potentially catastrophic decline in the scientific preeminence of the United States. The results presented here suggest that this decline has already been set in motion.",

          "authors": "Wanpeng Tan",
          "abstract": "This article analyzes the deep, systemic flaws within the current sociological structures in basic research. From peer review and publication culture to funding allocation and the tenure system, we reveal a structural crisis defined by broken feedback loops, perverse incentives, and the rise of academic monopolies. We argue that incremental fixes are insufficient and that a complete reform is now warranted. To this end, we present the vision for a novel Community-driven Open Research Ecosystem (CORE), a new paradigm or constitution for the entire community guided by the overarching Diversity Principle. The CORE is a dynamic, balanced, and self-regulating ecosystem designed to promote meritocracy and diversity, offering equal opportunity to all members while simultaneously applying monopoly-breaking measures against the top and securing a safety net for the bottom. By thoughtfully navigating its implementation challenges, a CORE can ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency via its dual evaluation system in knowledge dissemination, resource allocation, and career advancement, creating the conditions for a new era of innovation in basic research.",

          "title": "An Emmanuel Levinas Critique of Social Science Research Practice",
          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Historically, academic research has been structured around the supremacy of methodology. Neutrality, replicability, and objectivity are generally regarded as the fundamental principles of scholarly legitimacy, whereas ethics is considered a secondary issue, typically managed through institutional review processes or compliance mechanisms. This order suggests that research can be planned, carried out, and defended mostly through strict methods, with ethical reflection added later as a form of regulation. Nevertheless, this configuration jeopardises the reduction of ethics to mere procedure and participants to mere subjects of examination. This article critiques the method-first paradigm through Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy, especially his assertion that ethics constitutes “first philosophy.” Levinas posits that responsibility to the Other precedes ontology, cognition, and categorisation. The face of the Other presents the researcher with an inescapable demand that cannot be mitigated by objectivity or methodological detachment. From this perspective, the traditional subject–object relationship central to research practice is undermined: participants are not mere data to be handled but individuals whose distinctiveness by necessity demands accountability. Consequently, ethics cannot be perceived merely as a procedural adjunct to methodology; rather, it constitutes the foundational basis from which scholarly inquiry must emerge. Methodologically, the article integrates a critical conceptual analysis of Levinas’s writings with a normative critique of current research practices. This method allows the argument to transition from mere scholarly commentary to a prescriptive assertion: research should be reconceptualised as an ethical engagement rooted in accountability for the Other, rather than as a dispassionate process of knowledge creation. The conclusion suggests that an ethics-first approach, defined by humility, attentiveness, and responsiveness, provides a foundational reorientation of scholarship. In this recontextualization, ethics is not an external limitation but the foundational condition of academic inquiry itself.",

          "abstract": "This is a critical commentary about an RCT known as the Euthyroid Women with Thyroid Autoimmunity after Levothyroxine (POSTAL) study. Using the Trustworthiness in Randomised Clinical Trials (TRACT) checklist, five concerns in 5 domains out of 7 were identified. Four concerns are considered major due to retrospective registration, significance and inconsistencies in summary data presented, fast recruitment of patients and major discrepancies in data as well as methodology that exist between the conference abstract and the published trail. These serious and multiple concerns suggest the urgent need for reliable investigation of the trustworthiness of the POSTAL study.

          "abstract": "Objectives\nCalls to compensate patient partners for contributions to the health sector are increasing. The BMJ invites patients and the public (P&amp;P) to review manuscripts alongside academic reviewers and recently introduced remuneration. We surveyed P&amp;P reviewers to capture perspectives on remuneration and overall reviewing experience.\n\nDesign/setting\nTwo cross-sectional surveys administered via SurveyMonkey. \n\nParticipants\nSurvey 1 targeted P&amp;P reviewers who had completed a review in the past 3 years; Survey 2 included those invited to review but who had not completed a review within that period. \n\nResults\nSurvey 1 received 183/267 (69%) responses; Survey 2 received 100/493 (20%) responses. Most respondents were based in the UK or US. Overall, 71% (202/283) rated their review experience as “very good” or “good.” Half (51%, 143/283) said a £50 payment would make them more likely to review (48% Survey 1, 56% Survey 2). One-third (32%, 91/283) said a subscription to a selection of BMJ journals would make them more likely to review (32% Survey 1, 33% Survey 2). However, 29% (82/283) said £50 would not influence them (33% Survey 1, 22% Survey 2) and 40% (114/283) said the same about a subscription (39% Survey 1, 43% Survey 2). . Views on remuneration varied - some saw it as recognition of value, others viewed it as unnecessary, and some felt it was inadequate compensation. While 59% (166/283) had no concerns about introducing payment; 18% (52) had concerns, and 17% (49) were unsure. Concerns included potentially changing reviewers’ motivations and the quality of reviews, administrative burden and tax implications, impact on income received from benefits, and a need to evaluate the initiative. Respondents emphasised the importance of offering optional incentives to accommodate individual preferences.\n\nConclusions \nThe BMJ’s P&amp;P reviewers hold diverse views on remuneration. Flexible, optional incentives may help support broader engagement while respecting individual needs and values.",

          "title": "Enhancing Feasibility and Integrity in Health Research: The S-FIPR Platform",
          "authors": "Gabriela Dârzan",
          "abstract": "Modern health and social science research faces well-documented challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and practical feasibility. A significant proportion of studies cannot be replicated, and incomplete reporting leads to wasted resources. Equally, many promising interventions fail to translate into practice due to unrecognized feasibility obstacles in planning and implementation. This article introduces S-FIPR (Software for Feasibility and Integrity of Research Projects), which is an integrated digital platform designed to improve research project rigor, transparency, and viability from inception to dissemination. We outline the background reproducibility and feasibility gaps that motivate the development of S-FIPR, then describe the platform’s concept, including its user roles, workflows, and core functional blocks. A central innovation is the Feasibility Index (F-Index), a composite score assessing proposals across multiple domains with full auditability and explainability. We detail S-FIPR’s approach to responsible AI governance, such as model cards and bias mitigation, ensuring AI features remain transparent and advisory. The platform’s alignment with international standards - CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, FAIR data principles, and GDPR - is mapped, underscoring compliance with best practices in reporting, data management, and privacy. An evaluation plan is presented, leveraging usability scales and technology acceptance frameworks (TAM/UTAUT) to assess user experience and key adoption metrics. We discuss ethical and legal considerations, including research ethics oversight and data protection. Finally, we address current limitations and outline a roadmap from a minimum viable product (MVP) through pilot studies to broader scale-up. By embedding evidence-based safeguards and guidance into the research lifecycle, S-FIPR aims to bolster the integrity and feasibility of health research projects in the digital era. \nKeywords: Research integrity, Feasibility, Reproducibility, Digital platform, F-Index, AI governance, CONSORT, FAIR data, Usability, Health research",

          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer",
          "abstract": "The importance of open research information, particularly publication metadata, is widely recognised. Crossref is one of the most important infrastructures for registering open metadata as part of DOI record registration. It is widely known, however, that the metadata of many publications is far from complete, with many publishers making certain metadata openly available, but failing to do so for other metadata elements. \n\nOf course, publishers' ability to register this metadata with Crossref depends on their capacity to capture and retain this data in their production workflows. Manuscript submission systems are an important, yet largely overlooked, factor in the extent to which publishers make metadata available through Crossref. \n\nIn this paper, we present the results of an analysis investigating the correlation between the level of metadata that publishers deposit with Crossref and the submission systems that they deploy for their journals. We have looked at the 153 publishers with the largest amounts of publications in Crossref and concentrate on the four most commonly used systems: Editorial Manager, ScholarOne, Open Journal Systems (OJS) and eJournalPress. \n\nWe show that some submission systems appear better suited to capturing certain metadata elements. However, there are always cases where publishers using the same system differ widely in the level of metadata they register, suggesting that technology is not the only prohibiting factor and other considerations are at play.",

          "abstract": "Incivility is largely denounced; yet, our focus on its ills has inhibited our ability to determine when incivility could garner rewards. We propose that retaliatory incivility – i.e., incivility in response to someone else’s incivility — is seen as more virtuous than instigatory incivility, and consequently generates more social rewards for actors. To test these hypotheses, we used observational data from Reddit (2,252,607 comments) to compare how many social rewards users were granted when they responded uncivilly to civil or uncivil posts from other users. We then experimentally confirm our hypotheses in a sample of Reddit users, as well as five samples of participants from different contexts of group incivility; hockey fans, baseball fans, employees, workplace teams. Together, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: retaliatory incivility can be a surprising path to social rewards. Thus, as incivility rises internationally, our findings have far-reaching theoretical and practical implications.",

          "abstract": "A growing share of youth now have “online-only” friends that they have never interacted with in-person, yet little is known about the quality of these friendships or how closely they mirror in-person friendships. This study explores the (1) prevalence, (2) quality of in-person and online-only friendships, and (3) age and gender differences in these characteristics among Latin American youth. In Study 1, 5159 students between 10–17 years of age from Peru reported on the prevalence and perceived positive qualities of online-only and in-person friendships. In Study 2, 3154 students from Bolivia and Uruguay reported on the prevalence and positive and negative qualities of their in-person and online-only friendship(s). We analyzed cross-sectional trends in friendship quality (Studies 1 and 2) and, for a subset of youth with available data in Study 2 (N = 506), changes in the prevalence and quality of friendships between two data waves. More than one-third of participants reported having an online-only friend and, on average, declared twice as many in-person friends. Best in-person friendships involved both greater closeness but also greater discord than best online-only friendships. There were no differences in exclusion. Boys reported greater intensity of overall discord towards their best in-person friends and online-only friends compared to girls. In contrast, girls reported stronger closeness towards their best in-person friends than boys. Older adolescents reported stronger closeness towards their best online-only friends than younger adolescents. The findings indicate that adolescents rely on in-person friends for positive friendship support to a greater extent than online-only friends. However, despite overwhelming emphasis on the psychological drawbacks of online friendships, our findings suggest these friendships may also be associated with less negative qualities and do not necessarily discourage formation of in-person friendships.",

          "abstract": "Speech recognition recruits the auditory-language brain system for accurate segregation and integration of complex linguistic information that consists of various acoustic signals with various timescales. However, whether and how such multi-timescale auditory information processing is linked with the neural timescale of the auditory-language system remains unclear. To answer this, we compared behavioural performance on a speech-in-noise recognition test with the intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) of the auditory-language system. We found that the speech recognition ability was not correlated with the INT of the entire auditory-language network but was enhanced when the INT of the frontotemporal sub-system in the auditory-language network was close to that of the inferior colliculus, an auditory midbrain region. Moreover, this cortico-subcortical INT similarity was associated with the task-related neural activity in the frontotemporal sub-system. These findings indicate that the better cortico-subcortical INT alignment facilitates the activation of the auditory-language cortical system, resulting in accurate speech processing.",

          "abstract": "Executive function (EF) refers to a set of cognitive skills essential for self-regulation, problem\nsolving, and goal-directed behavior. Although EF’s relationship with co-occurring\npsychopathology is well established in autistic individuals without intellectual disability, its role\nin autistic individuals with higher support needs, including those with intellectual disability,\nremains underexplored, particularly beyond childhood. The present study addresses this gap by\nexamining associations between three EF components (flexibility, emotion regulation, and\ninhibitory control) and symptoms of anxiety and depression in 486 autistic adults with higher\nsupport needs (ages 18–68; M = 31.07), recruited through the Simons Powering Autism\nResearch (SPARK) Research Match service.

Hierarchical linear regressions, controlling for age, sex assigned at birth, and co-\noccurring intellectual disability, revealed that greater difficulties with flexibility and emotion\nregulation were significantly associated with elevated anxiety and depression symptoms,\nwhereas inhibitory control difficulties were not. These findings identify flexibility and emotion\nregulation as key correlates of internalizing symptoms in autistic adults with higher support\nneeds, highlighting their potential as targets for interventions aimed at improving mental health\noutcomes in this group.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent suicide is a public health emergency with interpersonal factors playing a critical role in risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). This study examined whether smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys capturing stress and social context could enhance the identification of youth at risk for STB. Adolescents ages 13-18-years-old (N=207, 166 female sex) reporting depressive, anxiety, and/or substance use disorders were recruited from psychiatric outpatient programs, emergency departments, medical research registries, and social media. Participants with STB history were oversampled; 66% reported current suicidal ideation and 27% had a past-year attempt. Assessments of suicidal events (attempts, emergency department visits, hospitalizations for suicide concerns) were completed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments. EMA probed momentary stress severity, affect, and recent social context (time spent with peers, family, or alone) 4-7x/day. Compared to psychiatric controls (N=64), adolescents with STB history (N=143) were more likely to report spending time alone (aOR=1.75, 95% CI=[1.15, 2.39]), less time with family (aOR=0.59, 95% CI=[0.31, 0.91]), and higher stress (d=0.28). Further, EMA of stress (aOR=1.86, 95% CI=[1.11, 3.26]) and negative affect (aOR=2.32, 95% CI=[1.34, 4.36]) were prospectively associated with suicidal events above and beyond prior STB history. Broadly, results were similar between EMA measures of stress and negative affect, indicating such responses may reflect shared underlying processes. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating dynamic family and peer contact among adolescents at risk for STB and highlight EMA as a potential tool for assessing interpersonal exposures related to STB risk.",

          "authors": "Darius Krutzek; Florian Paulus; Kimberly Heinecke; Emily Klose; Lena Kipper",
          "abstract": "Background\n\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed nootropic worldwide and is frequently used to temporarily enhance cognitive performance. However, caffeine-induced effects on physiological arousal are also associated with side effects, which can exacerbate psychological stress symptoms in social performance situations. The amino acid L-theanine has shown potential to modulate these adverse effects of caffeine by reducing caffeine-augmented stress responses without impairing its desired cognitive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous modulatory effects of L-theanine on caffeine-enhanced stress in acute social stress situations.\n\nMethod\n\nA total of 46 healthy participants (83% female, aged 18–30 years) were examined for differences in stress reactivity during a standardized psychological stress test (Trier Social Stress Test for Groups, TSST-G). The study compared the effects of a single dose of caffeine alone versus a combination of caffeine and L-theanine. Specific stress constituents including subjective stress, anxiety, physical discomfort, desire to leave the situation, tension, and perceived control were assessed. Furthermore, group effects, trait anxiety, caffeine consumption, and temporal changes in reported stress were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with covariates.\nResults\nThe combination of caffeine and L-theanine resulted in a spontaneous attenuation of tension in social stress situations compared to caffeine alone. \n\nConclusions\n\nResults suggest that L-theanine attenuates certain stress effects of caffeine in acute social stress situations. This highlights the potential of the L-theanine and caffeine combination as a dual nootropic agent, offering both stress-reducing effects and the practicality of a substance suitable for cognitive performance enhancement. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects by incorporating physiological markers such as cortisol and cognitive performance tests.",

The Moderate Risk class overrepresented racialized people compared to the High Risk class, p = .017, which overrepresented 2SLGBTQIA+ people compared to either of the other classes, ps &lt; .001. Intersectional differences emerged but were nonsignificant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. \n\nConclusion: Our study improves knowledge about patterns of suicide ideation and suicide-related behaviour, and differences in their prevalence based on major axes and intersections of social identity.",

          "abstract": "Understanding when and why social interaction improves human judgment is a central question in the behavioural sciences. We examine whether accuracy increases when groups break problems into parts and generate approximate solutions, a process we call Collective Fermi Estimation. We tested this idea across three studies by analysing over 1,000 online group deliberations in text chatrooms. Study 1 (N=500) shows that greater use of problem decomposition in group discussions predicts lower error. Study 2 (N=240) provides causal evidence: instructing groups to apply problem decomposition leads to higher accuracy than combining initial estimates. Study 3 (N=160) shows the advantage arises when applied collectively rather than by individuals working alone. We also introduce a scalable natural language method to detect problem decomposition in deliberation text and predict collective accuracy. These findings identify problem decomposition as a key mechanism behind the wisdom of deliberative crowds and provide tools to detect and promote it.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between everyday cognitive strategy use and subjective cognition is unclear, but may be driven by an active, compensatory process in response to experiencing cognitive difficulties. However, the available evidence tends to focus on specific age groups, and on relationships with general cognition or memory performance only. We uniquely investigated the influence of age, cognitive strategy use, and their potential interaction, on the everyday cognitive difficulties of 606 United Kingdom-based adults aged 18-86. Participants completed self-report measures of everyday cognitive difficulties across specific domains (attention, visual-perceptual ability, verbal and visual-spatial memory, and language) and strategy use, both memory-specific and generalized (e.g. setting an alarm to help remember something or breaking down complex tasks). Age was negatively associated with frequency of strategy use, such that younger adults reported greater strategy use. Moderated regression models, with strategy use as a predictor of cognitive difficulty and age as the moderator, revealed that more frequent use of memory-specific cognitive strategies, rather than generalized strategy use, was the most robust, unique predictor of greater difficulties across the majority of cognitive domains. Importantly, there was no interaction between age and cognitive strategy use for any cognitive domain, highlighting that cognitive strategy use is pervasive across the adult lifespan, and is related to a range of subjective cognitive difficulties. The findings underscore the significant, apparently compensatory relationship between strategy use and subjective cognition. They also reveal scope for older adults to incorporate more frequent use of cognitive strategies in everyday life.",

A comprehensive search of English and French publications was conducted up to July 11, 2023, across PUBMED, Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. Of 5,910 unique references, 32 articles met the final inclusion criteria: 16 on media literacy and 16 on science literacy. Fifteen media literacy tools were identified, focusing on traditional and digital media. Most used Likert-scale items, with some incorporating open-ended responses. These tools assessed skills such as critical thinking, digital proficiency, and awareness of the socio-political context of media content. Twelve tools assessed science literacy, covering general knowledge, environmental health, and specific scientific domains. They measured cognitive, behavioural, and attitudinal dimensions using various formats, including Likert scales, multiple-choice, and open-ended items. This review highlights diverse approaches to media and science literacy assessment and calls for interdisciplinary, digitally responsive tools co-developed with educators, experts, and underrepresented communities.",

          "authors": "Lara Pearson; Thomas Nuttall; Wim Pouw",
          "abstract": "In music performance contexts, vocalists tend to gesture with hand and upper body movements as they sing. But how does this gesturing relate to the sung phrases, and how do singers’ gesturing styles differ from each other? In this study, we present a quantitative analysis and visualization pipeline that characterizes the multidimensional co-structuring of body movements and vocalizations in vocal performers. We apply this to a dataset of performances within the Karnatak music tradition of South India, including audio and motion tracking data of 44 performances by three expert Karnatak vocalists, openly published with this report. Our results show that time-varying features of head and hand gestures tend to be more similar when the concurrent vocal time-varying features are also more similar. While for each performer we find clear co-structuring of sound and movement, they each show their own characteristic salient dimensions (e.g., hand position, head acceleration) on which movement co-structures with singing. Our time-series analyses thereby provide a computational approach to characterizing individual vocalists’ unique multimodal vocal-gesture co-structuring profiles. We also show that co-structuring clearly reduces degrees of freedom of the multimodal performance such that motifs that sound alike tend to co-structure with gestures that move alike. The current method can be applied to any multimodally ensembled signals in both human and non-human communication, to determine co-structuring profiles and explore any reduction in degrees of freedom. In the context of Karnatak singing performance, the current analysis is an important starting point for further experimental study of gesture-vocal synergies.",

          "abstract": "We demonstrate how e-values simplify both experimental design and the inference process. With e-values researchers can perform anytime-valid tests and construct confidence intervals that maintain type I error control regardless of the sample size. This enables real-time monitoring of evidence as data are collected, permitting early termination of experiments without intolerably inflating the risk of false discoveries. Early stopping not only con- serves resources, but also mitigates risk for participants in clinical settings. Anytime-valid tests allow for optional continuation, that is, the extension of an experiment, for instance if more funds become available, or even if the evidence looks promising and the funding agency, a reviewer, or an editor urges the experimenter to collect more data. Analogously, a researcher can be assured that a 95% anytime-valid confidence interval will, with at least 95% probability, cover the true effect size regardless of how, or even if, data collection is stopped. We use the free and open-source software package safestats implemented in R to illustrate the practical benefits of this novel inference framework.",

          "authors": "Darius Krutzek; Florian Paulus; Kimberly Heinecke; Emily Klose; Lena Kipper",
          "abstract": "Background\n\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed nootropic worldwide and is frequently used to temporarily enhance cognitive performance. However, caffeine-induced effects on physiological arousal are also associated with side effects, which can exacerbate psychological stress symptoms in social performance situations. The amino acid L-theanine has shown potential to modulate these adverse effects of caffeine by reducing caffeine-augmented stress responses without impairing its desired cognitive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous modulatory effects of L-theanine on caffeine-enhanced stress in acute social stress situations.\n\nMethod\n\nA total of 46 healthy participants (83% female, aged 18–30 years) were examined for differences in stress reactivity during a standardized psychological stress test (Trier Social Stress Test for Groups, TSST-G). The study compared the effects of a single dose of caffeine alone versus a combination of caffeine and L-theanine. Specific stress constituents including subjective stress, anxiety, physical discomfort, desire to leave the situation, tension, and perceived control were assessed. Furthermore, group effects, trait anxiety, caffeine consumption, and temporal changes in reported stress were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with covariates.\nResults\nThe combination of caffeine and L-theanine resulted in a spontaneous attenuation of tension in social stress situations compared to caffeine alone. \n\nConclusions\n\nResults suggest that L-theanine attenuates certain stress effects of caffeine in acute social stress situations. This highlights the potential of the L-theanine and caffeine combination as a dual nootropic agent, offering both stress-reducing effects and the practicality of a substance suitable for cognitive performance enhancement. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects by incorporating physiological markers such as cortisol and cognitive performance tests.",

We examined the potential benefits of neuroticism (fear/frustration) across a wide range of outcomes between ages 11 to 19 (e.g., substance abuse, friend nominations) using two “mirrored” samples of Dutch adolescents followed between ages 11 to 19, one population (n=2229, 51%♀) and one clinic-referred (n=543, 34%♀) cohort. High neuroticism conveyed heightened risk but four key observations refine this picture: (1) higher fear also related to more social skills and prosocial behavior among adolescents in the clinic-referred sample; (2) fear generally related to fewer risks than frustration; (3) controlling for childhood adversity (e.g., low socioeconomic status, parental divorce) removed links between fear and most detrimental outcomes; (4) both fear and frustration were consistently associated with parent-rated social behavior problems, while other associations varied across these two scales and measurement points. Altogether, we provide initial evidence that, under certain conditions, neuroticism can also be beneficial in adolescence. Neuroticism benefits are most likely found among vulnerable individuals and in the social domain.",

          "authors": "Povilas Karvelis; Andreea Oliviana Diaconescu",
          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

          "abstract": "Background: Abnormal reward processing has been considered as a core feature of severe mental illness (SMI), such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Deficits in this domain can have severe implications in daily functioning, such as a decreased motivation to engage in social activities or make healthy lifestyle choices. The Online Positive Valence Study aimed to assess reward processing in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Positive Valence Systems (PVS) framework in an online task-based study. Recruitment and study adherence fell short of expectations.\nObjective: The current paper critically evaluates the used methodology and shares the lessons learned of conducting an online task-based study of reward processing in a severe mental illness sample.\nMethods: Participants were recruited mainly via email from two existing cohorts. The research team consisted of a part-time research assistant, a part-time postdoctoral researcher and the principal investigators. The study was built using several software packages and comprised a number of questionnaires and three reward tasks, the monetary incentive delay task (MID), effort expenditure of rewards task (EEfRT) and a social and coin version of the Bandit task. From 2023 onwards, the research team accepted that the initial recruitment goal would not be attained.\nResults: Participants who were additionally called were over four times more likely to respond “no” and more than twice as likely to respond “yes” versus no response compared to those who received only emails. Personal salutations in invitation mails reduced the likelihood of participation compared to nonpersonal salutations. Reward task performance was largely similar between the in-lab MRI and online groups, though online participants showed longer reaction times on the MID task and lower win-stay rates on both Bandit tasks.\nConclusion: It is advised to carefully consider recruiting from existing cohorts, hire full-time dedicated personnel and use personal approaches to recruitment, like phone calls, and adjust recruitment to the target population(s). Furthermore, participation should be technically as simple as possible, using for example browser-based presentation of tasks, after checking their consistency across the most common browsers. Attrition during the course of the study can be limited even more by shortening the duration of participation and/or adding gamification. \nKeywords: Positive Valence System; reward processing; bipolar disorder; schizophrenia; online study",

          "abstract": "Emotional memories enrich our lives by anchoring us to meaningful past events, but they can also become intrusive and distressing, particularly in psychiatric conditions. This chapter discusses retrieval stopping, a memory control process through which individuals actively stop or cancel the retrieval of unwanted memories when confronted with reminders. We synthesize findings from retrieval stopping studies focussing on how people suppress the retrieval of emotional memories and the resulting consequences for both memory and emotion. Our review reveals that retrieval stopping consistently impairs recall of emotional memories in healthy populations, though this capacity is compromised in clinical groups and under conditions that impair inhibitory control, such as acute stress and sleep deprivation. Neuroimaging evidence demonstrates that suppressing emotional memories engages a fronto-temporal inhibitory control pathway, with increased activation in right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex alongside decreased activity in hippocampus and amygdala. Retrieval stopping induces mixed after-effects on subjective reports of valence of the suppressed content, but more reliably reduces self-reported and physiological indicators of arousal. We propose a theoretical model suggesting that retrieval and affect stopping are co-engaged processes when dealing with unwanted emotional memories and thoughts, both relying on shared inhibitory control mechanisms to prevent neural reinstatement of the original trace. This integrated perspective emphasizes that regulating emotional memories requires interrupting the neural reinstatement of both their mnemonic and affective components. By framing inhibitory control as a central mechanism linking the regulation of memory and emotion, the model offers a unifying account for understanding how individuals manage unwanted memories and the emotional distress they evoke.",

These outcomes may differ between men/boys and women/girls with ADHD, but whether these differences are more pronounced in ADHD or similar to those in the general population remains unclear. Method. In an 18-year follow-up of 283 children it was assessed if sex moderated a variety of long-term outcomes across seven domains in those with ADHD, 50 women (Mage = 27.36) and 104 men (Mage = 29.40), and without ADHD, 77 women (Mage = 28.32) and 52 men (Mage = 27.94). Additional analyses explored the role of gender-expression. Results. Sex interacted with group for social functioning, where men with ADHD were more likely to show lower social functioning compared to women with ADHD and controls. There were no sex differences on the other outcomes. As sex and gender-expression were highly similar (r = .94), specific effects of gender-expression could not be studied. Conclusions. Generally, sex did not have a more pronounced effect on long-term outcomes of childhood ADHD in individuals with ADHD compared to the general population. Gender-expression could not be studied in our predominantly cis-gendered sample.",

          "abstract": "Faced with uncertainty in decision making, individuals often turn to their social networks to inform their decisions. In consequence, these networks become central to how new products and behaviors spread. A key structural feature of networks is the presence of long ties, which connect individuals who share few mutual contacts. Under what conditions do long ties facilitate or hinder diffusion? The literature provides conflicting results, largely due to differing assumptions about individual decision-making. We reinvestigate the role of long ties by experimentally measuring adoption decisions under social influence for products with uncertain payoffs and embedding these decisions in network simulations. At the individual level, we find that higher payoff uncertainty increases the average reliance on social influence. However, personal traits such as risk preferences and attitudes toward uncertainty lead to substantial heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence. At the collective level, the observed individual heterogeneity ensures that long ties consistently promote diffusion, but their positive effect weakens as uncertainty increases. Our results reveal that the effect of long ties is not determined by whether the aggregate process is a simple or complex contagion, but by the extent of heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how acceptance, rejection, and repetition of social feedback shape implicit physiological responses and subjective stress evaluations in a naturalistic, fictional setting. Thirty-nine student teachers performed dyadic “Yes, And” (acceptance) and “Yes, But” (rejection) theatre improvisation exercises while heart rate (HR), skin conductance responses (SCR), electrodermal activity (EDA), facial muscle activity (zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii), electroencephalographic activity (EEG alpha asymmetry), and self-reported stress were recorded. Across all improvised dialogue exercises, transient HR deceleration indicated a robust orienting response, while rejection elicited pre-stimulus slowing of HR, suggesting anticipatory threat processing. Zygomaticus major activity was higher in acceptance than rejection. Zygomaticus major activity, anticipatory HR, and self-reported stress decreased with repeated exercise.  Together, the findings of this psychophysiological investigation of the “Yes, And” principle of theatre improvisation demonstrated that fictional social interactions evoke psychophysiological responses, and that repeated exposure of improvisation exercises can partially attenuate them. These findings contribute to improvisation pedagogy and experimental paradigms in social neuroscience, and may also be applied to therapeutic applications by mapping how social encounters modulate embodied responses and self-reported stress in a fictional, psychologically safe context.",

The total sample was then split into training and test datasets. Structurally testing the previous models and a data driven model in the training dataset. The results yielded unacceptable fit indices for the MSTAT-II's previous models, so the 4-item data driven one was used on the test dataset.

Associations between household chaos and educational achievement were consistently negative, bidirectional, and of small effect sizes across ages. These associations were best explained by genetic and environmental confounding. Family SES accounted for most of the confounding in the predictions from achievement to chaos; for the reverse, environments shared within families but distinct from SES were implied.

In three experiments, participants carried out spatial actions, which produced the movement of a box wherein an image was presented. The box either moved spatially congruent or incongruent with the participants’ action. Memory for images was later tested in a recognition test and we additionally probed whether participants retrieved the action used to produce an image when being cued with said image. In a fourth experiment, we kept the spatial effect component constant to directly investigate bindings between action and effect features. We found evidence for a facilitating influence of congruency on declarative memory for effect content and on action retrieval by perceived effect content. Moreover, if effect content was enriched with a spatial feature, such retrieval was only observed if that feature was spatially congruent rather than incongruent to the action which had produced that content. Thus, features of single action-effect episodes can be integrated and represented in long-term memory and the formation of these representations is facilitated by control. We propose that feature bindings can be conceptualized as source memory, representing how environmental effects were produced.",

          "abstract": "Environmental sensitivity, defined as the capacity to perceive and process information from both supportive and adverse environmental experiences, plays an important role in socio-emotional and behavioral development. However, existing research has predominantly focused on childhood, leaving a gap in our understanding of environmental sensitivity during adolescence. To bridge this gap, we conducted three studies using self-report data from 2,375 Japanese adolescents aged 10–14 years and their mothers. First, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of adolescent sensory processing sensitivity (referred to as trait sensitivity) by applying the 21-item Highly Sensitive Child scale to Japanese adolescents (Studies 1 and 2). Second, using three-wave longitudinal data, we examined how trait sensitivity interacts with various environmental contexts (i.e., negative/positive parenting and peer relationships) to predict adolescents’ socio-emotional and behavioral development (Study 3). Results showed that adolescent trait sensitivity was characterized by a general factor reflecting sensitivity to a broad range of negative and positive stimuli, as well as two specific domains: Ease of Excitation–Low Sensory Threshold and Aesthetic Sensitivity (i.e., bifactor model). Trait sensitivity was positively correlated with other temperament and personality traits, including negative emotionality, behavioral inhibition, neuroticism, and openness. Trait sensitivity and environmental factors independently predicted internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as prosocial behavior. Notably, trait sensitivity was a significant positive predictor of both internalizing problems and prosocial behavior. These findings suggest partial continuity in the structure and developmental functions of trait sensitivity from childhood to adolescence.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Risco; Devin J. Mills",
          "abstract": "Parasocial relationships (PRs), one-sided imaginary relationships with media personae, have only recently been explored in the video gaming context, where they appear to influence players’ thoughts and behaviors. They are often assumed to arise from less connection and greater ostracism in day-to-day life, but this hypothesis has not been empirically tested. Further, no study has considered potential differences in interpersonal difficulties that players with PRs may have compared to those without PRs. The present study addresses these gaps using online data from 584 video gamers (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male) recruited from various Reddit gaming communities. Participants completed measures assessing interpersonal difficulties (e.g., vindictiveness, social avoidance, exploitableness, nonassertiveness), satisfaction and frustration needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as well as problematic video gaming (PVG), and video gaming motivations. Results did not support the loneliness and ostracized hypothesis in that players with and without PRs did not differ in connection to others or feeling rejected in their day-to-day life. However, compared to players without PRs, players with PRs report greater interpersonal difficulties. Thus, PRs do not appear to compensate for loneliness or rejection. Rather, it may be that individuals with PRs may experience interpersonal difficulties leading them to turn to PRs to fulfill social needs. Additional findings include players with PRs reporting greater hours of video gaming as well as more severe PVG and stronger fantasy gaming motives. These findings are discussed within the context of broader literature and avenues for further study are provided.",

          "abstract": "As video games increasingly incorporate gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes and gacha microtransactions, concern has grown over their association with problematic video gaming (PVG) and mental health outcomes. This study explores how parasocial relationships (PRs) with fictional characters, a growing phenomenon in video gaming, may influence the negative effects of in-game gambling on depression. A sample of 584 players (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male), recruited from Reddit forums centered on video games featuring gacha, completed scales assessing risky loot box and gacha use, PVG, depressive symptoms, and whether they had a PR. Using structural equation modeling, mediation and moderated mediation models were tested. Results show that having PR is indirectly linked to depression via PVG, and that while risky in-game gambling behaviors alone did not predict depression via PVG in the general sample, PRs significantly altered this dynamic. Specifically, for individuals who reported having a PR, both risky loot box and gacha engagement indirectly predicted depression through PVG. These associations were absent, or even negative, among participants without a PR. Findings suggest that PRs with fictional characters may exacerbate gaming-related harms by increasing emotional investment and gameplay frequency, particularly in games designed to foster emotional attachment or feature in-game gambling. This study highlights PRs as a key psychological mechanism linking in-game gambling to poor mental health, reinforcing the importance of considering player–character relationships in future research and policy efforts on gaming disorder and digital spending risks.",

          "abstract": "When studying latent outcomes in causal inference, causal effects can occur not only on the mean of the latent variable, but on all parts of the measurement model: the mean and residual variance of the latent variable, as well as the item parameters. This paper proposes causal parameter moderation, the application of moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) to causal inference with latent outcomes. The proposed MNLFA-based approach is presented in contrast to another method for handling item-level deviations from a main treatment effect, item-level heterogeneous treatment effect (IL-HTE) analysis. The models are best suited to handle different types of DIF, and thus the circumstances under which each is appropriate differ: IL-HTE models are highly confirmatory in the sense that they assume a distribution of DIF across all items, so the more exploratory MNLFA approach may make sense as a precursor or alternative to IL-HTE analysis, especially when there is reason to believe that a subset of items on the outcome might be particularly sensitive to the treatment. Because MNLFA can handle an arbitrary number of continuous or categorical covariates, it is also uniquely well-suited to handling heterogenous treatment effects; this is demonstrated in a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of a reading intervention’s effects on science vocabulary where there is substantial evidence of both a main effect on the latent variable and additional effects on a subset of items.",

          "authors": "Sirke Seppänen; Benjamin Ultan Cowley; Andrei Rodionov",
          "abstract": "Background: Theatre improvisation provides a psychologically safe environment for practicing adaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can enhance interpersonal competence and reduce psychosocial stress. Interpersonal synchrony (IPS)—the temporal alignment of neural, cardiac, and behavioural activity during joint task performance—may represent a putative physiological mechanism underlying these beneficial effects. The ImproSynchrony project aims to investigate whether IPS mediates the effects of improvisation training and to examine how IPS varies across age and levels of improvisation expertise. By combining neural, cardiac, behavioural, and self-report measures, the study aims to uncover the mechanisms through which improvisation training supports social functioning across the lifespan. \n\n\nMethods and analysis: The study is a 12-week controlled intervention study with a 12-month follow-up, designed to investigate the effects of improvisation training on IPS and social interaction competence across age groups (n = 200, ages 18–80). Prior to the intervention, differences in IPS will be examined by comparing groups of improvisation experts and novices. IPS will be assessed using electrophysiological measures (electroencephalography, EEG and electrocardiography, ECG), behavioural data (video recordings), self-reports, and qualitative data from learning diaries. These multimodal data will be collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up to evaluate both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention. \n\n\nDiscussion: The expected findings will clarify how improvisation training influences physiological and behavioural synchrony and social interaction quality. By including older adults, the study addresses a significant gap in improvisation research, with implications for enhancing social connectedness and mental health in ageing populations. The results will contribute to understanding how improvisation fosters empathy, cooperation, and effective interaction, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners.",

It is multi-threaded in that it emerges as a by-product of addressing multiple goals while engaging in social interactions. It is multi-mechanism in that children integrate multiple information sources to infer what is meant and what to say next. These information sources include contextual and social cues as well as cognitive mechanisms. Focusing on early word learning, this paper reviews information sources, how children might sensitively adapt to them, and how we can model their integration using Bayesian inference over multiple probability distributions. We argue that, to advance our understanding of language learning, we must jointly study how children learn from multiple information sources across diverse developmental settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: This project evaluates the psychometric properties of a German translation of the Revised Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI-R). Previous measures of autistic traits are often based on a male-referenced conceptualisation of autism, which may underestimate autistic traits in other genders. Additionally, these measures tend to rely on neurotypical language, which can make it difficult for autistic people to respond and may reinforce stigma. To address these shortcomings, the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI) was originally developed as an alternative to traditional measures, including subscales that capture traits particularly relevant to autistic women. Building on this, we collaborated with members of the autism community to revise the CATI (CATI-R), ensuring more inclusive, respectful, and accessible language and concepts across all genders. In the present study, we translated this revised measure into German and validated it in a large sample of female, male, and non-binary participants. This study explores if the German translation of the CATI-R measures autistic traits fairly across genders and identifies potential differences in trait expression.  Methods: To validate the German CATI-R, we analysed data from a large sample (n = 1057), comprising German native speakers with a self-reported autism diagnosis (n = 29), people who self-identified as autistic (n = 84), and non-autistic participants (n = 944).  Results: We successfully validated a German translation of the CATI-R. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the six-subscale structure (Two-Factor Bifactor Model: Chi-squared = 2402.85, p &lt; .001, RMSEA = .045, SRMR = .047, CFI = .99, TLI = .99). With Spearman’s rank correlations, we showed positive relationships between all subscales (all rs &gt; .37, ps &lt;.001). Moreover, we demonstrated convergent validity with significant correlations between the German versions of the CATI-R, AQ and BAPQ: the AQ (rho = .69, p &lt; .01) and BAPQ (rho = .77, p &lt; .01). Finally, a measurement invariance analysis indicated that total-scale scores can be compared across genders and across the English and German CATI-R.  Conclusions: This study replicates findings for the English CATI-R. To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a measure of autistic traits in German that has been developed together with people from the community.",

One promising tool for investigating novel biological pathways is via mobile neuroimaging techniques, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which can be collected in naturalistic settings. The current pilot study uses fNIRS, cognitive task data, and survey-based measures of well-being and environmental exposures in a sample of children attending a nature-based school at the start of the academic year, and tests the feasibility of collecting fNIRS-based metrics of healthy neurocognition in situ. Fifteen children between the ages of 8 and 13 participated in the fNIRS sessions, and activation in the prefrontal cortex was successfully demonstrated during a 1-back working memory task for older children, but not younger children, who struggled to do the task. Importantly, the study enabled the measurement of a novel brain-based biomarker of healthy cognition (the Hurst exponent, H). In line with prior research showing that H is associated with better psychological well-being, we found that higher H was indeed correlated with lower psychological stress and better performance on a cognitive flexibility task. Additionally, H was higher for those who engaged in more physical activity and with more neighborhood greenspace access, highlighting a potential novel mechanism linking nature exposure, exercise, and psychological well-being in childhood.",

About half of the variation in language and reading outcomes is explained by genetic differences. Yet genes and environments are intertwined — for example, children’s early language exposure is partly shaped by their parents’ genetically influenced traits. Neuroimaging studies show that language and reading disorders involve not only domain-specific brain regions but also subcortical systems supporting learning in general. In cognition, a move beyond identifying core deficits toward understanding how children actively learn offers new insights into diverse developmental pathways. We highlight how interventions not only draw from but also contribute to theory, by revealing the mechanisms that drive change. Throughout, we emphasise how longitudinal and intervention studies have helped us distinguish which neural and cognitive characteristics are stable traits versus those that are responsive to intervention. We advocate for developmentally sensitive, large-scale studies and open, interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers and practitioners to advance our understanding of reading and language disorders and improve children’s outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Contemporary trauma therapies often target cognitive schemas and explicit memories, potentially neglecting the disruption of evolutionarily conserved instinctual systems by early adverse experiences. This study provides a preliminary evaluation of Instinctual Refinement Therapy (IRT), a novel protocol designed to directly address these instinctual disruptions.\nMethod: A retrospective case series analysis was conducted on 30 clinical cases (70% female; Mage = 32.4 years) with diverse, often treatment-resistant presentations (e.g., anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders). IRT integrates predictive processing and memory reconsolidation frameworks to recalibrate maladaptive instinctual pathways. Treatment response was assessed via pre-post clinical measures and rates of clinical improvement.\nResults: Preliminary analysis indicated a high rate of clinical improvement (94%; 28/30 cases), achieved over a mean of 54.2 sessions. Large pre-post effect sizes were observed across standardized measures, with a mean aggregate effect size of *d* = 2.1. Therapeutic gains were maintained at follow-up in 80% of assessed cases. The distribution of anxiety disorders, more prevalent in females (71%), aligned with epidemiological trends.\nConclusion and Implications: These preliminary findings suggest IRT is a feasible and potentially effective intervention for complex, treatment-resistant trauma presentations. The results warrant systematic investigation to establish its efficacy. This paper provides a detailed description of the IRT protocol, initial clinical data, and a essential research roadmap to guide future controlled trials and neurobiological investigations into its proposed mechanisms of action.\nKeywords: Instinctual Refinement Therapy, complex trauma, predictive processing, memory reconsolidation, case series, transdiagnostic, treatment development.",

Past work has examined a limited set of virtue pairs (e.g., honesty vs. compassion, fairness vs. loyalty) and focused on situations where tradeoffs are likely to occur. Across two Day Reconstruction Method studies featuring representative U.S. samples, we describe the frequency and experience of tradeoffs among 12 virtues in everyday life. In Study 1, 377 participants reported virtue conflicts during 12,385 episodes across one week. In Study 2, 608 participants provided detailed information about one tradeoff episode. Tradeoffs most often involved honesty and courage, and qualitative codings showed that many (but not all) tradeoffs reflected a general tension between benevolence and integrity. Overall, however, prevalence estimates suggested that virtue enactments tend to be largely compatible in everyday life. People felt less happy when they experienced a virtue conflict or tradeoff, but it also mattered how they resolved them. People most often prioritized one virtue over the other (57%). Occasionally (12%), however, people were able to overcome the tradeoff by showing high levels of both virtues, and were most satisfied with their decision when they were able to do so. Finally, there was a general mismatch between people’s proclaimed virtue preferences and which virtues they actually prioritized when they experienced an everyday tradeoff. These findings highlight the importance of studying moral decision making in ecologically valid contexts and have implications for moral education.",

After screening the articles using Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal methods, 23 articles investigating decision fatigue across various domains were selected. The selected articles were investigated through root cause analysis and thematic synthesis. Findings revealed eight causes of decision fatigue which were classified as individual, organizational, and external causes, and four primary effects and seven secondary effects of decision fatigue. Using these findings, a conceptual framework that offers a comprehensive understanding of decision fatigue across diverse domains was developed. This study contributes to the concept of decision fatigue within organizational settings to enhance organizational behavior, psychology and, offering implications for improving decision-making processes in diverse professional domains.

Across four daily life studies (Total N = 1,663 people from\nNorth America, Germany, and China; 90,002 observations), we revisit the everyday relevance of\nmorality by examining how often people perceive opportunities to express 12 moral virtues (e.g.,\nhonesty, kindness), 12 corresponding vices (e.g., dishonesty, unkindness), and (im)morality.\nParticipants perceived opportunities to express at least one of the 12 virtues &gt; 49% of the time.\nHowever, they rarely perceived these opportunities to express virtues as opportunities to be\n“(im)moral” (&lt; 8% in North America and Germany; 26% in China). Patience, responsibility, and\nrespectfulness were most often relevant, whereas forgiveness, courage, and loyalty were least\noften relevant. We conclude that conceptualizing morality in more concrete terms reveals a\nplethora of morally relevant situations that have gone unnoticed in previous studies.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 40% of children worldwide learn to read in a language other than their home language or in two languages simultaneously. Evidence suggests that instruction in one language can enhance literacy outcomes in the other; however, the existence and longevity of these cross-language effects in poorer readers is unclear.  This study used a cross-over randomised controlled trial design. Initially, 129 children (mean age = 111.44 months, SD = 12.23) participated in a 15-week Welsh literacy intervention, while 128 children (mean age = 110.62 months, SD = 12.34) served as a wait-list control group and did not receive the intervention during this period. After the first intervention phase, the wait-list control group then participated in the same 15-week Welsh literacy intervention. Welsh and English reading efficiency were assessed at three time points: baseline (t1; prior to intervention), posttest (t2; immediately after the initial intervention phase for the first group), and follow-up (t3; approximately 3-months after t2). We found that training poorer bilingual readers using a language-rich literacy intervention in Welsh improved word decoding skills in both Welsh and English. These effects were sustained in the longer term for the trained language, Welsh, but were short-lived for the untrained language, English. Our findings suggest that targeted intervention in one language enhances cognitive processes underlying literacy in both languages, and that bilingual students struggling with reading skills can make short-term literacy gains from a monolingual intervention that transfer to a language where there has not been explicit training.",

          "abstract": "Coping effectively with affective distress is a critical developmental task expected to support affective health over the lifespan, with parents likely shaping coping skill development. Yet, naturalistic variation in coping skill development is poorly understood and it remains unclear whether: (1) gender-specific and parental support enrich coping skill development and (2) differences in naturalistic coping skill trajectories differentiate psychopathology outcomes thereafter. Using longitudinal data from a large, nationally-representative U.S. adolescent study (n = 831), the current study applied a longitudinal multilevel modeling approach to track growth in acceptance and cognitive restructuring coping skill use over 7 years spanning adolescence through young adulthood. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVAs and Dunn’s post-hoc tests were applied to estimate trajectory differences based on within-gender variation, between adolescent parental support, and psychosocial consequences in adulthood. Greater parental support acted as an enrichment factor for coping skill development over time, with trajectories further differentiated as by gender. Adolescent coping patterns differentiated psychosocial impairment in early adulthood, with evidence of gender-specific linkages between coping and impairment, particularly for women. Characterizing specific coping repertoires and the context in which they develop is likely support understanding of whether coping skill development contributes to psychopathology onset.",

          "abstract": "Tactile sensitivity is typically reduced during voluntary movements, a phenomenon known as tactile suppression. While affective context is known to modulate tactile processing, it remains unclear how it influences tactile suppression. In a virtual reality (VR) environment, we investigated tactile sensitivity during movements to avoid threatening (spider) or approach non-threatening (rabbit) stimuli, involving arm flexion or extension, and during the limb at rest (baseline). Tactile sensitivity was measured using brief vibrations delivered through the VR controller. Detection thresholds were higher during movement than baseline, confirming tactile suppression. Both affective context and movement type modulated suppression: avoiding threatening stimuli and extending the arm, each increased suppression. A control experiment using neutral, geometric objects showed comparable effects of arm extension and flexion. These findings demonstrate that affective context shapes tactile suppression during movement.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To test a conditional process in which perceived stress (PSS) mediates the link between academic involution (INV) and sleep health (SQ), with psychological resilience (RE) buffering the INV→PSS, PSS→SQ, and INV→SQ paths among Chinese vocational students.\nMethods: A cross-sectional online survey at a public vocational college yielded N=663 complete responses (forced-response). Measures included an 18-item INV scale, PSS-4, a multidimensional sleep-health index (SQ), and BRS-6. Analyses comprised descriptives, group tests, correlations, and PROCESS Model 59 with 5,000 bias-corrected bootstraps; sex, grade, and place of origin were covariates.\nResults: INV correlated positively with PSS and negatively with SQ; PSS correlated negatively with SQ; RE correlated positively with SQ and negatively with PSS. In PROCESS, INV→SQ (B=−1.028, p&lt;.001) and PSS→SQ (B=−2.555, p&lt;.001) were negative, and INV→PSS positive (B=.522, p&lt;.001). All three interactions supported buffering by RE: INV×RE→PSS (B=−.072, p=.021), PSS×RE→SQ (B=.452, p&lt;.001), INV×RE→SQ (B=.190, p=.033). The direct INV→SQ effect weakened from Low/Mean/High RE (B=−.584/−.394/−.204), becoming nonsignificant around +1 SD (Johnson–Neyman). The indirect effect INV→PSS→SQ also decreased with higher RE.\nConclusion: Academic involution relates to poorer sleep partly through elevated perceived stress. Resilience systematically attenuates these associations, indicating a modifiable protective target for campus health initiatives aimed at safeguarding students’ sleep.",

Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward\ncriticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of\nmeditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the\n“jhānas”, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and\nphysiological data during these practices and quantified the signal’s dynamical properties using\nLempel–Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In\naddition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch\nnegativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhāna was associated with\npronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across\nmultiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites.\nSpectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic 1/f component and a frequency-specific reorganization\nof long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and\nheightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during\njhāna. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhāna with minimal phenomenal\nexperiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness.\nAccordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the\nabsorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

          "abstract": "Perceiving a brief visual stimulus depends on both its intensity and its exposure duration.\nThese two parameters are in a reciprocal relationship, such that doubling the duration and\nhalving the intensity of a stimulus leads to equivalent perceptual performance. This\nrelationship is known as Bloch’s law. Despite numerous demonstrations of the validity of\nBloch’s law, recent evidence shows violations for exposures ranging from few microseconds\nto tens of milliseconds. The main goal of this work was to reassess the law’s validity on the\nperception of simple geometric shapes. The latter were presented for durations between\n0.15 and 100 ms thanks to a modern LCD-based tachistoscope. We successfully replicated\nthe reciprocal relationship between intensity and duration across five different tasks\ninvolving detection, shape discrimination and subjective visibility judgements. In accordance\nwith past literature, we report reciprocity only for stimuli shorter than a maximum critical\nduration (between 15 and 36 ms, depending on the task). We discuss these results in\ncomparison with the aforementioned violations of Bloch’s law, and identify potential causes\nof the latter.

          "abstract": "We present a fast, score-based test to detecting model misspecification in item response theory (IRT) models, that remains valid when person parameters are treated as fixed effects, as may be used for very large data sets. The new approximation (i) eliminates the need to pre-specify ability groups or priors for person abilities, (ii) does not require explicit functional form assumptions, (iii) works with two estimators designed for very high item / person counts -- constrained joint maximum likelihood (CJML) and joint maximum a posteriori (JMAP) -- and (iv) requires only a single model fit, making DIF-screening faster and simpler than alternatives based on model comparisons. A spline-based residualisation step further suppresses spurious Type I error when the ordering covariate is correlated with ability. Simulations with the two-parameter logistic model show nominal error rates and high power once examinees contribute 15–20 responses; only extremely short tests (10 items) still pose challenges under strong impact. An application to 1602 reading items and 57684 students from the Mindsteps platform demonstrates scalability and practical value, flagging 13% of items for gender-related DIF and correlating highly with conventional approaches of explicitly modelling DIF. Together, these results position the proposed test as a robust, computation-light diagnostic for large-scale assessments when classical random-effects approaches are infeasible, ability group structure is unknown or complex, or the shape of DIF effects is unknown or complex.",

In other words, users might actively search for content that aggravates, rather than alleviates, distress. Drawing on self-verification theory and other scholarship on self-defeating tendencies, we argue that when negative self-concepts are salient, users may gravitate toward media messages that validate these self-views, even at the expense of their well-being. We propose a research agenda to systematically examine maladaptive media exposure patterns and their psychological effects. To guide this line of inquiry, we propose an extension of the established Selective Exposure Self- and Affect-Management model to better conceptualize the complex motivations driving contemporary media use.",

          "abstract": "Social connection and grit are critical socio-emotional skills associated with resilience and success among college students. Honors programs, which offer specialized academic and community-oriented experiences, may foster enhanced social connection and consequently greater grit as part of a high-achieving community. This study examined whether participation in a university honors program moderates the relationship between social connection and grit. College students (n = 421, 66% White, 64% female, 17% Honors) participated in a cross-sectional online survey conducted between March 2023 and May 2025. Moderation effects were tested using multiple regression with honors program participation as a moderator. Social connection was positively correlated with grit among the full sample (r = .315, p &lt; .001). Honors students exhibited a trend toward higher grit scores than non-honors students (p = .092, d = .27), while social connection scores did not significantly differ between groups (p = .753). Contrary to predictions, honors participation did not moderate the significant positive relationship between social connection and grit (interaction term β = .161, p = .468). These findings indicate that stronger social connection is a consistent predictor of higher grittiness among college students, irrespective of honors program participation. The absence of a moderating effect suggests that a university’s comprehensive support services may equally foster social connectedness and resilience across student groups, potentially matching the social, emotional, and motivational structures characteristic of an honors program. This study underscores the broader institutional value of cultivating supportive social environments to enhance students’ socio-emotional skills.",

Objective: This study evaluated whether a brief, 4-session Mindfulness Skills Course (MSC) for university employees, covered by the institution’s wellness benefits, was effective in reducing stress, increasing mindfulness, improving feelings toward oneself and others, and increasing work performance. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study design. Participants completed self-report surveys before and after the MSC. Class attendance and home mindfulness practice were recorded to assess feasibility and adherence. Paired t-tests and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate program effectiveness and predictors of change. Results: 190 employees enrolled during the first year of roll-out. Of those, 164 (86%) completed pre-course surveys, 134 (82%) attended at least three class sessions, and 123 (75%) completed the post-course surveys and program evaluation. Paired samples t-tests showed improvements for perceived stress, mindfulness, and relational wellbeing with moderate to large effect sizes (d=.44 - .78; p’s&lt; .001). Self-perceived work performance increased with a small effect (d=.33; p&lt; .001). More frequent home meditation practice was positively correlated with a larger increase in mindfulness (r=.20; p&lt; .05). Increased mindfulness correlated with reduced stress (r=-.55), greater positive emotions towards self (r=.38) and reduced negative emotions towards self (r=-.40) and others (r=-.42) (all p’s&lt; .001). Reduced stress was correlated with increased perceived work performance (r=-.22; p&lt; .05). Higher baseline stress levels predicted greater increases in mindfulness (β= .37, R2= .14, p&lt;.001), while lower baseline mindfulness predicted greater reduction in stress (β= .27, R2= .07, p&lt;.01). Conclusion: Taken together, these results support the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief, 4-wk, employer-sponsored mindfulness skills course, which may be most helpful for individuals with higher stress and lower trait mindfulness.",

Multiple group structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test whether the impact of trait mindfulness on perceived stress and sleep-related impairment was moderated by gender or race. Results: Across gender (cisgender male, cisgender female) and race (white, people of color), there were significant indirect effects of higher trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering on less sleep-related impairment via lower perceived stress (all p’s&lt;.001). However, there was no evidence of moderation. The multiple group models explained 26%-39% of the variance in perceived stress (R2 = .26 to .39) and 25%-40% of the variance in sleep-related impairment (R2 = .25 to .40); large magnitude effects.  Conclusions: The mediating effect of three core mindfulness qualities on sleep impairment and daytime functioning through lower levels of stress was consistent across gender and race.

The multivariable path model explained 24% of the variance in well-being and 42% in distress. Conclusion: Social connection may be more important than mindfulness or self-compassion in buffering perfectionism's negative impact on mental health. Interventions aiming to enhance well-being and reduce distress among perfectionistic individuals may benefit from prioritizing social connectedness and belonging, rather than mindfulness or compassion in isolation.",

          "abstract": "Analytical flexibility describes the multiple defensible data analytic options researchers can pursue in a given study. Analytical flexibility can include practices like applying different methods for data cleaning, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests. Analytical flexibility is increasingly important for students to learn about because it impacts low replicability and credibility. Registered reports reduce analytical flexibility by submitting a manuscript to a journal in two stages, where journals provide an in-principle acceptance after Stage 1, committing to publishing the results. We describe and demonstrate an activity for psychology undergraduate courses to explore analytical flexibility within a registered report. Students read a first-stage registered report, received the data, and implemented the analysis plan as described. Analysts generate a product summarizing their results, and compare with the final Stage 2 and other analysts. This activity helps students to achieve multiple important learning outcomes focused on the impact of analytical flexibility on research conclusions, advantages and limitations of open science practice, and implementation of statistical methods in a real data context. This type of project could be an excellent option for a final project in an advanced undergraduate research methods or statistics course.",

Motivated by the mixed empirical findings concerning the effect and long-standing criticisms on estimating and interpreting interaction effects, I used a computational modeling approach to evaluate whether the habit-intention interaction effect estimated from statistical analysis is adequate for inferring the underlying cognitive mechanism assumed by contemporary habit theories. By manipulating the presence or absence of a habit-moderating mechanism in the data-generating model, statistical analyses were performed on the simulated data to examine the correspondence of the estimated interaction effect to the manipulation. Results suggest that while the conventional statistical approach can be indicative of the underlying mechanism, the direction and size of the estimated effect are often misleading in relation to the substantive theory. I identified the cause of the problem from a causal perspective (i.e., intention as a common cause of habit strength and behavior) and discussed potential remedies.",

It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week.

Although children are theorized to rely heavily on their auditory feedback, previous experimental studies are inconsistent, suggesting that additional factors may be at play. This study examines the role of individual differences in attention and sensory processing abilities on auditory feedback control of speech in children. To this end, 53 children ages 4-11 completed a frequency altered feedback (FAF) task where the pitch of their auditory feedback was manipulated and responses to the manipulation were measured to provide an index of the child’s reliance on their auditory feedback. To measure attention and sensory processing abilities, children completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), and their parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) parent-report, respectively. Overall SSP scores, and scores in auditory, tactile, and sensory seeking domains were found to be associated with larger compensatory responses to FAF, while poorer SART performance was associated with slower vocal responses to down shifts. These results suggest that for children, greater sensory processing differences may promote increased reliance on auditory feedback for speech motor control, while attentional differences may be more important in the temporal processing of FAF.",

To trace the beginnings of these tendencies, the current study investigated whether 6- to 12-year-old U.S. children use political markers, such as political party affiliation and support for presidential candidates, to guide their social preferences. We also examined children’s ability to report their political affiliation, whether their political affiliation matched their parents’, how accurate they are at reporting their parents’ political affiliations, and whether having parent-child conversations about politics predicted children’s political affiliation and social preferences. We found that children as young as 6 years of age showed ingroup preferences for individuals who shared their own or their parents' political affiliations – especially based on support for presidential candidates. Notably, even if children could not report their own presidential candidate choice or were inaccurate at predicting their parents' presidential candidate choice, children still preferred people who supported the same presidential candidate as their parents. Further, children who had conversations with their parents about politics were more likely to prefer people who matched their parents’ political affiliations. This study provides the first empirical evidence that 6- to 12-year-old children are using political markers to form ingroup preferences and show rudimentary forms of political partisanship.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive psychologists have long been interested in the intersection of emotion and memory given that the emotions associated with a stimulus affect its memorability. Theoretical perspectives within cognitive science have guided research on how affective dimensions such as valence and arousal impact aspects of memory such as accuracy, subjective vividness, consolidation, and retrieval. Here we argue that well-established theories of emotion from affective science represent a fruitful source of ideas whose implications for episodic memory have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we propose a model of emotional memory inspired by psychological constructionist theories of emotion that builds upon existing perspectives in this area while generating several novel hypotheses and avenues of investigation. Following psychological constructionism, we conceive of emotions as emergent phenomena constructed when perceivers use conceptual knowledge to make sense of affective sensations in context. The Constructionist Model of Emotional Memory (CMEM) highlights new directions for future emotional memory research, such as investigating the mnemonic consequences of conceptual emotion knowledge, and considering the effects of variability in emotion construction at the situational, individual, and cultural levels.",

In principle, the RCI provides common criteria for evaluating individual change. However, current practices use sample-specific estimates to create these criteria. Because sample estimates are subject to sampling error, these criteria are also subject to sampling error and therefore differ across studies. We illustrate how current practices can lead to differing criteria for reliable change and use simulations to identify the impact of sampling error on the RCI. Excessive error in the RCI began for the average sample when N &lt; 30, and samples only comfortably avoided the risk of excessive error when N &gt; 100. Finally, small errors in estimating a measure’s reliability sometimes had profound effects on the RCI. Recommendations on use of the RCI are provided.",

          "abstract": "Background: Individuals with schizophrenia have prominent impairments in social cognition that contribute to poor functional outcomes. Gaze processing – the social-cognitive ability to accurately perceive human eye gaze direction – is similarly abnormal in schizophrenia and associated with social functioning. Though gaze processing has known neural underpinnings in cerebral social-processing brain regions, emerging data suggest that the posterior cerebellum plays a key but often neglected role in social-cognitive function. Elucidating the bi-directional cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics underlying social cognition is critical to identifying a novel treatment target.  \n\nMethods: 39 individuals with schizophrenia and 33 non-clinical control (NCC) participants completed an eye-contact detection task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dynamic causal modeling was used to delineate the dynamics between posterior cerebellum (Crus II) and three cerebral social processing nodes (inferior parietal lobule, anterior insula, and fusiform gyrus) regions and to quantify abnormal effective connectivity in SZ. A confirmatory replication analysis using an independent sample (SZ=27, NCC=22) was conducted to confirm the results. \n\nResults: Model structure comparison revealed overwhelming evidence that cerebellar connections to cerebral social processing nodes are vital to explaining gaze processing in NCC (ln(BF)=98.84) and SZ (ln(BF)=46.85). Relative to NCC, SZ showed less upregulation of cerebellar outputs during gaze processing (t(68)=2.853, p=.006) and this decreased upregulation was associated with social dysfunction (ρ=-.251, p=.034). These results were replicated in the independent sample.\n\nConclusions: Replicated across two independent samples, people with schizophrenia have altered cerebellum-cerebrum dynamics during gaze processing that is linked to social functioning. Given the accessibility of the cerebellum from the scalp for non-invasive brain stimulation relative to many cerebral social-cognitive regions, our findings have critical implications for translational interventions.",

However, data linking early inflammatory biomarkers with later ADHD symptoms remain scarce. The acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) is a key marker of systemic inflammation. To date, no studies have examined the association between CRP levels in cord blood (reflecting neonatal inflammation) and subsequent childhood ADHD symptoms. Here, we aimed to investigate whether elevated cord blood CRP concentrations are associated with child’s ADHD symptoms at age 5. \nMethods: We analyzed data from 1019 and 831 mother–child pairs enrolled in the ELFE and EDEN prospective birth cohorts, respectively. CRP levels in cord blood were measured using an immunoassay. ADHD symptoms were assessed at age 5 using the hyperactivity–inattention subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Outcomes included both continuous scores and categorical thresholds: borderline (≥6) and abnormal (≥7) hyperactivity–inattention symptoms. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were conducted within each cohort to assess associations between elevated CRP levels (≥75th percentile) and ADHD symptoms. Results were then pooled using meta-analytic methods.\nResults: Borderline hyperactivity–inattention scores were observed in 21% of children in the ELFE cohort and 14% in EDEN. After adjusting for maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and pregnancy-related factors, as well as child characteristics at birth, elevated cord blood CRP was significantly associated with higher odds of ADHD symptoms: borderline scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08–1.86), abnormal scores (aOR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.06–2.08), and increased continuous symptom scores (β = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.04–0.54). \nConclusions: Higher CRP concentrations in cord blood are associated with greater ADHD symptom severity at age 5. These findings support the hypothesis that early-life inflammation may contribute to the developmental origins of ADHD and suggest that CRP could serve as a potential early biomarker of neurodevelopmental vulnerability.",

          "abstract": "Visual stimuli are known to vary in their perceived duration, with a variety of features, including both high and low level, shaping temporal responses. For example, the size, memorability, or numerosity of stimuli lead to longer perceived intervals, thus highlighting the malleability of time perception. However, little is known about how stimulus shape may influence temporal perception.  This feature is critical, as shape morphometry forms a general basis by which these other features may exert their influence on perceived duration.  To investigate this, we conducted a series of three experiments looking at how specific characteristics of shapes are significant factors in the manipulation of time perception.  We initially observed that greater shape angularity led to more precise time estimates, independent of shape identity.  Next, we found that shapes and symbols with greater edginess, vertical asymmetry, and thickness led to longer perceived durations.  Finally, we discovered that shapes built with higher numbers of geometrical primitives were perceived as longer, more precisely, and responded to more quickly, and were influenced by how subjectively meaningful they were to individual participants.  Our findings suggest that certain aspects of shapes are able to manipulate time perception due to innate geometric qualities within the visual cortex itself.",

The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted.

          "abstract": "Background: Successful peer interactions impact the well-being of autistic and non-autistic youth. Social gaze is important in social interactions as it facilitates detecting information from and signaling information to the social partner. However, while previous work has identified differences between autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze patterns while viewing social videos, no work to-date has directly measured differences in autistic and non-autistic youth in gaze during face-to-face peer interactions.\nMethods: Autistic and non-autistic youth ages 11-15 years completed a face-to-face social interaction with a novel peer while wearing mobile eye-tracking glasses to measure gaze. The interaction consisted of three tasks: a getting-to-know-you conversation, a vacation-planning task, and a video-watching task. Fixations to the face were compared between autistic and non-autistic youth across the three contexts.\nResults: Autistic youth fixated less on their partner’s face than non-autistic youth, and these gaze differences varied across interaction contexts. Gaze differences between autistic and non-autistic youth were most pronounced during the unstructured initial getting-to-know-you conversation and absent during the structured video-watching task.\nConclusions: Context impacts gaze for autistic and non-autistic youth, such that the social attention patterns of autistic youth differ the most from their non-autistic peers during unstructured initial conversations. These gaze differences provide autistic youth with reduced opportunities to sense and signal information about their social environments, emphasizing that supports for peer interactions may be especially crucial when navigating these initial, unstructured meetings. In turn, reduced gaze signaling may also impact peers’ understanding of autistic youth, with implications for the development of autism acceptance programming that incorporates acknowledging and accepting potential gaze differences.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to fitspiration content on social media has been linked to increased body dissatisfaction and negative mood. Although often portrayed as a healthier alternative to thinspiration, fitspiration frequently features slim, toned bodies and may reinforce appearance-related concerns. A recent trend, curvy fitspiration—featuring curvier women promoting physical activity and a healthy lifestyle—has shown promise in reducing body dissatisfaction. The present study aimed to investigate differences in the effect of Fitspiration content on weight concern, feeling fat, body dissatisfaction and negative mood depending on the body shape being observed (thin or curvy). Participants included 71 women who completed, before and after the exposure to images, 4 visuoanalogical scales. The variable feeling of fatness increased after exposure to fitspiration content featuring thin bodies and decreased after exposure to curvyfitspiration. Body dissatisfaction showed a significant time effect, increasing after exposure regardless of the experimental condition. Weight concern didn´t have a significant effect after exposure. Mood was significantly higher in the fitspiration condition with a slim body, regardless of the time of measurement. These results suggest that fitspiration's influence is shaped not only by body type but by its emphasis on appearance and the dynamics of social comparison and digital validation.",

          "abstract": "Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees. Study 2 replicated these findings in a preregistered study. Study 3 experimentally manipulated these four signals in a novel context using a conjoint design. We found that codification and moral wrongness most strongly influence rule concepts. This work goes beyond purely legalistic or formalist accounts of rules, showing that people’s intuitions about rule violations are shaped not only by codification but also by descriptive normativity, moral wrongness, and perceived legitimacy of enforcement.",

Traditional cognitive assessments often lack reliability and require lengthy in-person visits, limiting scalability for younger, trial-ready populations.\nObjectives: To evaluate the feasibility, reliability, and validity of high-frequency remote digital cognitive assessments in individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD).\nParticipants: 162 mutation carriers and non-carriers from DIAN-TU from 20 international sites (Ages 19-69 years).\nMeasurements: Participants completed remote assessments via personal smartphones, prompted four times daily for seven days (approximately 3 minutes per session), and conventional in-clinic cognitive testing at baseline. Adherence, test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]), construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), and sensitivity to clinical impairment were evaluated.\nResults: Average adherence was 41%. Despite this, remote measures demonstrated excellent reliability (ICCs &gt; 0.90 after 10 sessions) and strong construct validity, with tasks loading onto memory, attention, and executive function domains. Model fit was poorer in symptomatic individuals (CDR &gt; 0), consistent with cognitive dedifferentiation during disease progression. Both remote and traditional composites were sensitive to clinical impairment, with similar effect sizes and increasing group differences near expected symptom onset.\nConclusions: High-frequency remote cognitive assessment is feasible, reliable, and valid in a relatively young international ADAD cohort. This approach offers substantial advantages for clinical trials, including reduced participant burden, improved accessibility, and enhanced reliability, supporting its integration into early-intervention studies.",

          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen as allowing a person not only to live by good and just principles but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should place on moral pursuits or “moral primacy.” The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,909) suggest that people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

          "abstract": "Background\nGambling-related harm is increasingly recognised as a complex, multi-dimensional public health problem which variably impacts health, relationships, resources, and broader social functioning. Existing measures – often focused on diagnostic “problem gambler” thresholds – typically fail to capture the breadth of such harms. Moreover, there are very few instruments designed to capture the perspective of those harmed by someone else’s gambling – ‘affected others’ (AOs). \nAims\nThis study reports the content development and validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and GHSI for affected others (GHSI-AO-10); co-designed, person-centred, non-stigmatising instruments designed to assess impacts, severity and changes in gambling-related harm across diverse contexts and populations.\nDesign, setting and participants\nWe employed a multi-phase, mixed-methods design informed by best practice guidelines for patient-reported outcome development. Conceptualisation was constructed on a ‘holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery,’ derived from structured literature reviews and qualitative research. Item generation and refinement were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, AOs, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation was conducted via a convenience paid-for online sample from the UK (n= 3,315 for people that gamble; n= 3,017 for AOs). \nMeasurements\nStatistical validation of GHSI-10 and GSHI-AO-10 involved a combination of classical test statistics (CTT) and Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), alongside convergent validity versus existing measures of harm (e.g. PGSI) and divergence from measures of wellbeing (e.g. ICECAP-A).\nFindings\nItems were co-developed to assess harms across multiple components: wellbeing (mental, physical), relationships (personal, social/community), and resources (financial, occupational, ethical). This process refined the instrument to be non-stigmatising, person-centred and reflecting the language of lived experience, to reduce biases related to denial and social desirability, with a 3-month recall period, and a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways, rather than static, unchangeable harms (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy).Quantitative validation supported unidimensional measurement, good reliability (GHSI-10 α = 0.94, GHSI-AO-10 α = 0.95), convergent validity with existing measures (rho &gt; .7), and criterion-related validity with measures of wellbeing (GHSI-10 rho &lt; -.3, GHSI-AO-10 rho &lt; -.23). Both GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 met all RMT fit criteria, did not display infit or outfit, had well-ordered and fitting response options, and rationally ordered item locations. \nConclusions\nThe GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10 are psychometrically valid tools, co-designed to support research, service commissioning, and outcome evaluation across the gambling treatment and support ecosystem. They are grounded in diverse lived experience and aligned with public health principles.",

          "abstract": "In adverse listening conditions, speech recognition scores are generally higher when listeners can also see the talker’s mouth. Because bilinguals tend to be more detrimentally affected than monolinguals in audio-only noisy conditions, they may stand to benefit more than monolinguals from a second modality. At the same time, the ability to leverage visual cues may be limited by the amount of exposure a listener has to the target language, which varies among bilinguals. In this study, we aimed to understand whether the benefit of audiovisual speech cues is modulated by listeners’ language experiences. To that end, we measured speech recognition accuracy in noise in both audiovisual and audio-only modalities among monolingual and bilingual listeners. We also collected subjective effort and subjective mental fatigue ratings from participants throughout the experiment to evaluate the relationship between audiovisual speech perception and listening effort for different listeners. Our results show that more active use of another language results in less accurate speech recognition in noise for English, but does not modulate the benefit of the audiovisual speech signal.",

This preregistered, seven-day experience-sampling study examined how perceived appropriateness varies across situations. One hundred forty-two adults completed three surveys per day (2,670 surveys total; 3,821 vocalisations), rating appropriateness alongside situational cues and psychological situation characteristics. The results showed that laughter and sighs were most often judged appropriate, whereas screams and retches were least. Appropriateness was higher at home and in social places (e.g., parties) than in work/school or public settings (e.g., library), and higher with close ties than with weak ties or strangers. Psychological characteristics showed that formality and power were associated with lower appropriateness, whereas sociality and positivity were associated with higher appropriateness. Effects were vocalisation-specific: for example, laughter was considered more appropriate in positive, social, and brisk contexts, but less appropriate in formal and high-power contexts. By charting when and where vocalisations are judged acceptable, these findings outline situational principles of vocal display rules in everyday life.",

          "abstract": "Would a penchant for animal cruelty influence how much someone is blamed for lying on a tax return? While extant literature shows that evaluations of someone's moral character can affect subsequent moral judgments, there is contradictory evidence on whether character information affects judgments in a way that is domain-general or domain-specific. Does receiving information about any morally bad character trait increase blame, or only information about traits that are similar to the subsequent act?  In two experiments (preregistered; N = 1320), we investigated how incidental information about an agent's moral character can influence moral and causal judgments. We consistently found that participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more of a cause, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect of character was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Overall, our findings support an account of moral judgment in which character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments of a subsequent act, challenging the domain-specific view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act should influence blame.",

The resulting 12-item Decision Process Scale (DPS) can be used to measure how much people rely on rules versus cost-benefit reasoning and how much they rely on intuition versus deliberation in the specific moral dilemmas they face in a laboratory experiment or in the real world.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) often includes heterogenous items, as when one uses it while assembling a desk from sets of boards, knobs, bolts, and washers. Here we investigate how WM capacity is limited when recalling multiple sets of items, for which performance surpasses the usual limits observed in single-set procedures. We presented participants (N = 181) with up to four sets of items for serial recall, usually of different stimulus types in the same trial (colors, characters, locations, and/or shapes). Conditions differed in the total number of items, the number of sets, and/or item types across sets in a trial. For uniformity in analyses, Set 1 was kept constant at three items of a type and was usually recalled first, free of output interference. In Experiment 1, recall of Set 1 was not only limited by the total number of items, but also by the number of sets in a trial. Experiment 2 ruled out interference as an alternative explanation. Experiments 3-4 showed the dependency of the results on clearly grouped presentation of the sets. The results suggest that groups of items are associated as newly-formed, often incomplete chunks offloaded from the focus of attention (FoA) to an activated portion of long-term memory (aLTM) for later retrieval. This offloading process would spare capacity but not without cost; a fraction of an item was lost from Set 1 for each subsequent item recalled. We present a dual-stage theory in which pointers held in the capacity-limited FoA allow retrieval of chunks from aLTM.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "authors": "Ahmad Lotfi; Reza Ebrahimpour; Sajjad Zabbah",
          "abstract": "Perceptual decisions often rely on integrating multiple discrete pieces of sensory evidence over time. Previous studies have shown that these integration strategies are dynamic and can give rise to temporal biases such as the recency effect, where more recent information receives greater weight in the decision process. While some have attributed the recency effect to memory leak, recent findings suggest it may instead reflect a strategic modulation of attention. In this study, we investigated whether attention increases uniformly over time or selectively in response to the amount of accumulated evidence. Using a direction discrimination task with single-, double-, and triple-pulse random dot motion stimuli, we tested competing models of evidence integration and attentional allocation. Consistent with prior work, we observed marginally better performance in weak-strong double-pulse trials compared to strong-weak ones. Notably, in triple-pulse trials, improved performance was evident only when considering the first and third pulses, but not the first two or last two, arguing against a uniform time-based increase in attention. Crucially, when the first two pulses were treated as a unit, a weak-strong pattern relative to the third pulse produced significantly higher accuracy. These findings support a model in which attention increases not over time, but over evidence: reduced early evidence leads to increased attentional allocation to later samples. Our results provide further insight into the adaptive nature of perceptual decision-making and the role of online attentional strategies in optimizing performance in environments with discrete, time-separated sensory events.",

          "abstract": "Preclinical studies suggest that fasting may attenuate spontaneous pain and pain-related behaviors, such as licking and paw withdrawal, during inflammation in animals; however, evidence of the analgesic effects of fasting in patients suffering from chronic pain remains inconclusive. In two studies, we investigated the potentially protective effects of fasting on the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in healthy human volunteers following experimentally induced sensitization of nociceptive fibers through painful cutaneous electrical stimulation. In the first experiment (N = 33), participants underwent the painful electrical stimulation protocol twice: once after a 12-hour fast and once after consuming a standard breakfast. In a follow-up experiment (N = 52), participants were randomized to receive either the painful electrical stimulation protocol after a 16-hour fast or after their usual morning meal. In both experiments, we assessed the intensity, unpleasantness, and spatial extent of secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, as well as emotional state and hunger levels. Fasting increased hunger and negative affect in both studies. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, participants in the fasted condition reported significantly less mechanical hypersensitivity compared to the breakfast condition. In both experiments, fasting did not reduce the pain intensity reported during the painful electrical stimulation. These findings provide behavioral evidence that a 16-hour fast may reduce the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. These results in humans align with preclinical evidence showing that fasting affects mechanical hypersensitivity, without necessarily affecting the perceived intensity of acute painful stimuli. Our findings suggest that metabolic state may modulate mechanical hypersensitivity in humans.",

          "abstract": "Declines in cognitive control impact older adults’ daily life and independence. Cognitive control frameworks distinguish different subcomponents, such as inhibition, updating, shifting, proactive and reactive control. A comprehensive overview of how these subcomponents develop in aging is lacking, with research typically focusing on small samples treated as a homogenous age group, targeting a single subcomponent, or using heterogenous tasks across studies. In the current study, young adults (N=75) and three cohorts of older adults (N=231) completed an extensive test battery assessing multiple subcomponents of cognitive control. Results showed improved response inhibition and interference control in older vs. young adults, decreased updating and shifting with age, and preserved proactive control in older adults. These findings show that changes in cognitive control subcomponents follow different onsets and trajectories, highlighting the importance of including them in cognitive aging research. Longitudinal follow-up studies can help uncover inter- and intra-individual changes in subcomponents with aging.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nGambling-related harms affect people’s finances, their health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and community life. They impact not only people who gamble but their families and others around them. Public health models require a harm-based approach that moves beyond clinical thresholds and recognises the wider determinants and distributions of harm across populations. Existing gambling harms frameworks are somewhat generic in scope, have rarely involved lived experience and affected others, and generally equate recovery with abstinence.  This study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling harm and recovery, rooted in lived experience and tailored to the cultural and policy context of Great Britain.\nMethods\nThe study proceeded in two stages. Stage 1 comprised a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of academic and grey literature on gambling-related harm and recovery, supplemented by analysis of harm and recovery frameworks from adjacent sectors (alcohol and other drugs). Stage 2 involved 40 semi-structured qualitative interviews with people who had experienced gambling harms directly or as affected others. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify, refine and validate components of harm and recovery that were brought together in a new holistic framework. Stakeholder co-production and iterative validation informed each stage of framework development. \nResults\nThe new holistic framework encompasses three broad components of harm—resources, wellbeing, and relationships—each comprising sub-components reflecting financial, emotional, relational, and community-level impacts. The framework also captures how identity, culture, and context can shape harm experiences. It conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, all underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership of gambling behaviours. \nConclusions\nThis holistic framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery. It provides a foundation for more inclusive harm reduction strategies, recovery-oriented interventions, and person-centred measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "The rise of generative AI has made it easier than ever to produce hyperrealistic but entirely false imagery. One especially harmful use is the creation of non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes depicting real people. While such content clearly violates privacy, its broader political implications remain underexplored. This paper investigates how sexually explicit AI-generated imagery affects\npublic perceptions of politicians and broader democratic outcomes. Drawing on a pre-registered survey experiment in the U.S. (N = 1904), we exposed participants to either explicit, private, or control images of a fictitious male or female politician embedded in a mock social media feed. The results indicate that explicit deepfakes significantly diminish candidate evaluations, particularly with respect to affect, trustworthiness, perceived competence, and leadership qualities. Exposure to AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) further leads to lower voting intentions for the targeted politician, illustrating how reputational harm can translate into electoral consequences. Contrary to expectations, male politicians were more strongly affected by these negative shifts in perception. However, we find no evidence that exposure to such content reduces participants’ own political ambition. These findings highlight the reputational risks posed by synthetic intimate media and highlight the urgent need to mitigate its potential threats to democratic processes.",

          "authors": "Anthony Montgomery",
          "abstract": "Organizational psychology has traditionally focused on internal dynamics, neglecting the broader social structures in which organizations are embedded. This limitation is particularly evident in research on job burnout. While burnout is often framed as a symptom of organizational dysfunction, it also reflects wider systemic forces—economic instability, political regulation, cultural expectations, and ecological stressors—that influence how individuals navigate the competing demands of performance and wellbeing. Current models underestimate these contextual and historical influences due to their peripheral position in organizational analysis. This paper introduces a new open systems theory of burnout that delineates how sublethal forces interact with organizational processes to deplete employee energy and increase burnout. It proposes nine core propositions through which external environmental factors shape burnout experiences and argues for a paradigm shift toward systemic, context-aware models. The paper concludes by presenting a theoretical framework and challenges for future research.",

          "abstract": "Homophone errors (e.g., there/their) are not uncommon in typing, but it is debated whether they simply reveal poor spelling knowledge or signal competition in the production system. We tested the idea that competition underlies the greater difficulty associated with producing homophone, compared to non-homophone, targets. Using computational simulations, we showed that competition alone is sufficient to produce interference during homophone production, and that such interference is exacerbated by increasing lexical competition. These predictions were confirmed in two experiments, a typing-to-dictation task (Experiment 1) and a question-answering task (Experiment 2). We further showed the homophone effect was insensitive to the syntactic category: we found a robust homophone interference effect of a comparable magnitude for same-category (e.g., flower-flour) and different-category (e.g., idol-idle) homophones. Collectively, these results show that lexical selection in typing is similar to speaking in terms of the processes arising from representational overlap, but distinct from it in terms of the influence of syntax.",

          "abstract": "Learning to recognize and produce foreign speech sounds can be challenging, particularly when only subtle differences distinguish these new sounds from phonemes in the native language. Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows us to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

          "abstract": "Trust in science plays a crucial role in addressing major societal challenges, from climate change to global health. In a wide range of countries, most people tend to trust science. However this trust might seem irrational, since people tend to know little about science. Here, we argue that people need not possess much knowledge or understanding of science to rationally trust it. We propose a cognitive model of trust in science—the rational impression account—according to which people come to trust science by relying on a suite of basic cognitive mechanisms: First, people infer competence from possessing rare knowledge; Second, people infer accuracy from consensus; Third, people’s impressions can persist after they forget what generated them. The rational impression account stresses the importance of science education and communication in fostering public trust in science.",

          "abstract": "Giving people more time between encoding information elements into working memory im-proves immediate (i.e., working memory) and delayed (i.e., long-term memory) retrieval. This free-time benefit is often assumed to arise from processes that counteract forgetting of the just encoded item in working memory, suggesting that time has a retroactive effect. Contrary to these predictions, a few studies showed that free time between two items in a serial-recall task benefits only the subsequent (to-be-encoded) items, yielding a proactive benefit in work-ing memory. Here, we investigate whether working memory and long-term memory benefit from free time in the same way. In three experiments, we show that free time benefits the to-be encoded items in working memory (proactive effect) with only a local retroactive effect for recently encoded items, whereas it mainly benefits already encoded items in long-term memory (retroactive benefit). These results challenge a single explanation of the free-time benefit for memory retention across short and long intervals.",

However, how the magnitude of this Cognate Facilitation Effect (CFE) changes with age and its task-dependent manifestations remain unclear. Clarifying these patterns may benefit educators with evidence-based strategies to support learners across different stages and tasks. This systematic review synthesizes studies on CFE in school-aged second and foreign language learners between 1987 and 2024 (n = 36). The results showed that, firstly, the CFE follows an inverted U-shaped trajectory. It increases during early literacy (ages 6–9), peaking in middle childhood (ages 9–10), and declining thereafter. Secondly, facilitation is robust in comprehension tasks but more variable in production, where overlap can induce interference. Furthermore, we evaluate psycholinguistic models and propose integrating speech-production models to account for the interference effect of cognate production. These findings suggest educational implications: cognates can help support vocabulary development in early literacy, but more refined strategies are needed as learners advance.\n\nKeywords: cognates; cross-linguistic transfer; literacy development; psycholinguistics",

          "abstract": "Background: Practitioner ratings of their adherence to evidence-based psychotherapy or counseling practices in working with autistic youth could be an efficient method for tracking the success of efforts to implement effective practices in community behavioral health service settings. Tools of this sort that generalize across multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) have not been developed to date. In this study, a practitioner self-report measure of adherence to EBPs for autistic youth was developed and evaluated. Method: A multiple baseline study of seven behavioral health practitioners was conducted to determine if internet-based self-directed training on Modular EBPs for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA; meya.ucla.edu), a free internet-based practitioner training app, would facilitate an increase in clinician adherence to EBP techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral intervention practices. Practitioners made self-ratings on the MEYA Integrity Scale-Practitioner Version (MEYA-IS-PV). Expert coders unaware of phase or study hypotheses also rated the therapists’ adherence to EBPs for each session. Caregivers rated youth outcomes at each session on the Youth Top Problems scale. Results: Linear mixed models showed that MEYA-IS-PV scores corresponded to expert ratings of adherence, increased following the onset of training in EBPs, and predicted improvements in youth behavioral health. Visual analysis of the multiple baseline data confirmed that 5 of 7 practitioners increased their self-reported adherence in EBPs once training began. Conclusion: Self-ratings of adherence are promising for examining adherence to EBPs in psychotherapy or counseling for autistic youth.",

          "abstract": "Autistic youth experience high rates of co-occurring mental health concerns, yet empirically supported practices (ESPs) are rarely implemented with fidelity in community care due to barriers in training, scalability, and workflow integration. The Modular Evidence-Based Practices for Youth on the Autism Spectrum (MEYA) platform was developed as a free, open-access digital tool that provides just-in-time therapist training, modular cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies, and caregiver-supported goal monitoring. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, seven community clinicians implemented MEYA following a baseline phase of usual care. Platform use was tracked through analytics, and six clinicians participated in qualitative exit interviews. Results: Directed content analysis revealed five overarching themes: MEYA was perceived as useful, flexible, and clinically relevant; therapists valued the CBT content and caregiver goal charts; feasibility was supported by its accessibility but limited by workflow demands; underutilization of measurement-based care (MBC) features and a resulting impact on the personalization of care were noted barriers. Engagement data showed moderate-to-high uptake across modules. Conclusion: Overall, MEYA was feasible and acceptable across diverse providers, with strengths in usability and fidelity support. Findings identify priorities for refinement, particularly in automating measurement-based care features and creating push-out guidance via email to clinicians who need to conserve time and effort. These results provide preliminary evidence for MEYA as a scalable platform to increase access to ESPs for autistic youth.",

          "authors": "Olivia Fischer; Renato Frey",
          "abstract": "Polarization has become a major concern in behavioral science and popular media, as it may affect many important areas of life. For instance, how polarized are people's perceptions of risks, such as regarding (not) imposing mitigation measures during a pandemic? Answering this question is surprisingly challenging: Whereas multiple theoretical views of polarization and their respective mathematical operationalizations coexist, the latter are often used interchangebly as measures of \"polarization\". This may be indicative of a jingle fallacy, because it is unknown whether the diverse ways of quantifying polarization in people's perceptions of important societal matters empirically converge. In study 1 we thus ran a reanalysis of a large dataset from the World Values Survey covering diverse topics of societal relevance (N = 93,214), finding only moderate empirical convergence between six operationalizations of polarization. In study 2 we applied the same approach focusing specifically on people's risk perceptions of COVID-19 mitigation measures (N = 768), and found a similar pattern of low convergence between different operationalizations of polarization. Yet, according to one operationalization with a clear threshold for polarization, risk perceptions were polarized in 11 out of 12 experimental conditions. Our findings emphasize the need to carefully consider how polarization is operationalized to avoid broad generalizations, keeping in mind that some operationalizations may speak to specific theoretical conceptualizations. To raise awareness for this concern and support behavioral science researchers in conducting similar analyses with their own datasets, we provide a novel online tool available at https://shiny.cbdr-lab.net/polarization.",

While we were interested in re-formulating from a humanistic psychological perspective, after Rogers’ original conditions of worth concept (1957, 1959), the behavioral formulation of conditional regard, we also tested and provided evidence for the hypothesis that autistic people experience heightened conditions of worth relative to non-autistic people. We validated through a brief online survey (n = 162, including 109 autistic and 53 non-autistic individuals) two distinct sets of items, one retrospective for the adolescent period between ages 12 and 17 and the other for adulthood, to assess the extent to which individuals perceive conditions of worth. The items were then correlated with an array of individual difference variables. Perceived emotional safety recalled as an adolescent and felt as an adult, perceived psychological control of one’s parental figure when an adolescent, adult fear of criticism and rejection, adult masking or camouflaging of parts of oneself, adult incongruence or inauthenticity, adult acceptance of external influence, and adult self-alienation were all positively correlated in support of the measures’ convergent and predictive validity. Adult self-esteem, unconditional positive self-regard, adolescence-perceived parental autonomy support, authentic adult living, and congruence or authenticity were all, with some exceptions, negatively correlated in theoretically expected directions. Perfectionism was also variously correlated. Implications and applications are offered for academics as well as mental health practitioners.",

Free-text responses from 3,272 participants were analysed using inductive thematic analysis, with relational analysis identifying interconnected patterns across emotional, cognitive, and behavioural domains.\nYoung people from Australia reported diverse responses to climate change, including feelings of anxiety, sadness, and hope; thoughts about future impacts, personal responsibility, and systemic failure; and behaviours ranging from pro-environmental actions to disengagement. Based on overlapping feelings, thinking, and behaviour, seven archetypes of response were identified: the Hopeless Helper, Nervous Navigator, Furious Fighter, Guilty Guardian, Wounded Witness, Detached Drifter, and Determined Doer.\nFindings highlight the complex and interconnected ways young people respond to climate change across emotions, thoughts, and behaviours. Archetypes provide a framework for understanding both risks and resilience, emphasising that distress often stems from systemic inaction.

We found a wisdom of the crowd within effect in both experiments, which was significant after two responses, and larger with three. Surprisingly, the delay did not offer additional benefit.

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

It challenges rational choice theories by showing that preference can change by having an irrelevant option in the choice set. The attraction effect is typically studied in situations where individuals have full access to option information during choice. However, in many real-life situations, people must make choices based on their memory of the options. In three experiments (N = 379), we investigated the attraction effect when people had to rely on their memory when making choices. We show initially that relying on memory eliminated the attraction effect, but also that the attraction effect was recovered with improvements in memory. The results suggest that memory accuracy may be a boundary condition of the attraction effect. We also observed improvements in decoy avoidance and choice accuracy with improvements in memory. Our results are consistent with the representational noise hypothesis (Spektor et al., 2021) where noise (e.g., due to forgetting) disrupts how people represent the relationships among options.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire such as PHQ-2, PHQ-8, and PHQ-9 are among the leading assessment tools for depression in research and clinical practice. However, important questions remain about its validity, particularly whether responses reflect symptom frequency or the degree to which symptoms are bothersome.\nObjective: To investigate how participants respond to the PHQ, described as a “severity” measure by its developers, with instructions about “being bothered by symptoms”, and response options focused on symptom “frequency”.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62; Male=253, Female=245, Transgender=3, Other=2) and a clinical sample with medium to high depression from the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.44, SD=12.23; Male=120, Female=216, Transgender=5, Other=8). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ-8, participants’ interpretation of instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on symptom frequency, being bothered by symptoms, or both; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future, based on these same three options.\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (n=275; MTurk) and 15.5% (n=53; OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ as instructed (i.e., the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they had responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% (n=107) and 11.7% (n=40) of participants interpreted the instructions as instructed, and only 22.3% (n=112) and 9.9% (n=34) reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation. The current study also found that the PHQ-8 validity varies depending on how participants interpret its instructions. \nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings identify widespread misinterpretation of the PHQ instructions across community and clinical samples, raising doubts about its validity for both research and clinical decision-making.\n Keywords: PHQ, depression, assessment, validity",

          "abstract": "This study investigated effects of content format and instructional framing on knowledge attainment, situational interest, and academic emotions in digital history learning. In a 2 (format: game versus text) × 2 (instruction: learning versus fun) between-subjects design, 143 university students engaged with either a historically accurate video game on the Roman Empire or a structurally aligned interactive text application, each paired with instructions to focus on learning or fun. Both formats presented the same historical content through main narratives, optional missions, and supplemental historical information in the form of codex entries. The findings revealed that participants in the game condition reported higher enjoyment and greater triggered situational interest, indicating that the game enhances the positive affective experience of engaging with historical content and sparks learners’ interest. However, our hypothesis that knowledge test performance would be higher in the game condition was not supported. Instead, knowledge test scores were higher in the text condition. No statistically significant effects emerged for instructional framing or for the interaction between format and framing on the outcomes. Additional analyses of behavioural data showed that text participants engaged more extensively with codex entries, and that codex engagement strongly predicted knowledge outcomes across both formats. This suggests that knowledge outcomes depend on the visibility and integration of supplemental materials, and learners’ engagement with them. Overall, this study contributes to research on digital history learning by offering a controlled comparison of identical content delivered through game and text and shedding light on the role of instructional framing.",

          "abstract": "Revising explanations allows learners to develop a coherent understanding of scientific phenomena by integrating different ideas, a key learning outcome according to the Knowledge Integration (KI) Framework. We explored the design of critique activities and analyzed how peer critique helps 1305 middle school students to revise science explanations. Students wrote a science explanation about thermodynamics in an online learning environment, critiqued the explanation of a fictitious peer and then, revised their own explanation. For the critique activity, they were randomly assigned to three conditions that differed in the characteristics of the fictitious peer’s explanation. Specifically, students either critiqued a peer’s explanation that describes intuitive ideas (intuitive), combines intuitive and scientifically normative ideas (partial), or connects several scientifically normative ideas (linked). We found that critique was valuable in each condition as students showed more integrated understanding in their revised responses to the explanation question compared to their initial response. Students in the linked condition received the highest KI scores. Students who started with a higher KI score had an advantage over those with a lower KI score in all conditions. This difference was strongest in the intuitive condition, indicating that the intuitive condition was the least beneficial for students with lower prior knowledge. Qualitative analysis of the types of revisions students made revealed that, in all conditions, students often adopted ideas from the answer they critiqued. When they adopted the intuitive idea, they were less likely to improve their explanation than when they adopted the link. These results illustrate the importance of critique for promoting integrated understanding. They reveal the need for more frequent and more powerful instruction to build skepticism when confronted with potentially unreliable information, e.g. by comparing two explanations with contrasting ideas.",

          "authors": "Vanessa Radtke; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their sensation of task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested if pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty- and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.",

We tested this idea across three studies by analysing over 1,000 online group deliberations in text chatrooms. Study 1 (N=500) shows that greater use of problem decomposition in group discussions predicts lower error. Study 2 (N=240) provides causal evidence: instructing groups to apply problem decomposition leads to higher accuracy than combining initial estimates. Study 3 (N=160) shows the advantage arises when applied collectively rather than by individuals working alone. We also introduce a scalable natural language method to detect problem decomposition in deliberation text and predict collective accuracy. These findings identify problem decomposition as a key mechanism behind the wisdom of deliberative crowds and provide tools to detect and promote it.",

          "abstract": "Speech categorization is a gateway for downstream language processes. Recent work using \nthe Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task underscores the critical role of categorization consistency \n(trial-by-trial response variability around the mean response function) as a critical predictor of \nreal-world outcomes such as language and reading abilities. Yet, the mechanisms that \ncontribute to categorization consistency remain unknown. One hypothesis is that higher-level \nlinguistic factors, such as lexical knowledge, may stabilize the percept by cleaning up lower-\nlevel perceptual noise. The first aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by examining \nwhether categorization consistency is modulated by lexicality (word vs. nonword). Forty-eight \nadult American English listeners completed a VAS task involving both word (e.g., batch-patch) \nand matched nonword (e.g., bazg-pazg) continua. Listeners’ categorization consistency for the \nword continua was significantly higher than for the nonword continua. This suggests that \ncategorization consistency is, indeed, affected by higher-level linguistic factors. The second aim \nwas to investigate whether individuals’ broader language abilities influence their reliance on \nlexical information during speech categorization. Although individuals with greater language \nability showed more consistent categorization, language scores did not modulate the lexical \neffect on categorization consistency. Together, these findings demonstrate the roles of top-down \nknowledge and language knowledge in stabilizing speech categorization.",

          "abstract": "Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between heritable and acquired traits. In a large-scale study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between sleep deprivation and political polarization through two experimental protocols. We conducted an 8-hour total sleep deprivation (TSD) experiment (n=20) and a 4-hour partial sleep deprivation (PSD) experiment (n=44) to examine their effects on ideological extremism and affective polarization. Results revealed a significant increase in ideological extremism following TSD in between-subjects analysis (Cohen's f² = 0.48), while no significant effects were observed with the PSD protocol compared to the regular sleep (RS) condition. Importantly, moderation analyses revealed that political orientation significantly influenced susceptibility to sleep deprivation effects, with different patterns emerging in between-subjects versus within-subjects analyses. Left-wing participants showed greater vulnerability to increased ideological extremism under sleep deprivation in between-subjects comparisons, while this effect was found for right-leaning individuals in within-subjects analyses. No significant effects were observed on affective polarization in either protocol. These findings provide initial evidence that sleep deprivation can contribute to political polarization by increasing ideological extremism, particularly when considering political orientation as a moderating factor. The study provides novel insights into the complex relationship between sleep and political cognition in distinct sociopolitical contexts.",

          "abstract": "Children’s participation in neuroscience and neuroimaging research is often limited, especially when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is involved, due to confined spaces, loud noises, and the need for prolonged immobility. Distraction techniques informed by child psychology professionals and MRI technicians can alleviate anxiety and fear. When distraction is insufficient, sedation or anesthesia may be required, increasing costs, posing potential side effects (e.g., adverse reactions to sedation or anesthesia), and limiting research inclusivity. Moreover, children often exhibit increased head motion in the scanner, compromising image quality and potentially leading to diagnostic errors or unusable data. Our project outlines the development of Mission Control, an innovative virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to address the challenges of pediatric brain MRI procedures by familiarizing children aged 6 to 12 years with the MRI environment. Mission Control aims to reduce anxiety and teach children to remain still during scans, and is freely available, addressing the limited availability of VR MRI applications outside of research settings. The simulation features a rocket landing mission on the moon, where children must maintain stillness to reach their destination. Head tracking is used to train stillness, while audiovisual cues and narration transform the MRI experience into an engaging adventure. To ensure content appropriateness, we replicated MRI procedures and facilities from our Cerebral Imaging Centre, and consulted MRI specialists, designers, and mental health researchers during the design phase. Future directions include conducting a pilot study to evaluate the accessibility, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the simulation in a research setting.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Supporting wellbeing within education settings is vital. Whole school approaches present a holistic and integrated mechanism that recognise school staff, the school community and pupils. The Well Schools whole school approach to supporting teacher and pupil wellbeing provides a framework that guides planning, policy and practice while allowing for bespoke and socially valid approaches suitable for each school community. \nMethod. A case study approach explored how schools adopted the Well Schools framework, and what practices and provision schools were offering as part of Well Schools. Second, it aimed to identify the perceived impact of embedding the Well Schools approach for schools, teachers and pupils. 10 case study schools were recruited that were implementing Well Schools and that represented diversity in setting type, varying locations across the UK and school demographics. Data was collected via interviews (n = 16) with school leaders and class teachers that focused on their experiences and engagement with the whole school approach with particular attention to the process of implementation. \nFindings. Six themes were identified covering how Well Schools was being implemented, what drove this and the impact it was having: 1) staff enrichment, 2) pupil enrichment, 3) motivation, 4) capability, 5) awareness and engagement, and 6) sustainability. Findings suggest the value of supporting staff and pupil wellbeing were central to an effective learning environment that supported wellbeing. Well Schools offered the opportunity for schools to build relationships, collaborate and learn from a network of schools. This network and the engagement with like-minded schools was identified as a reason why some schools were attracted to the whole school approach.\nConclusion. Promoting Well Schools can help other schools adopt better practices for health, wellbeing and identify ways of developing holistic wellbeing at the school, teacher and pupil levels. Such continued engagement further exemplifies the feasibility, acceptability and positive impact the case study schools reported regarding Well Schools.",

          "authors": "Samuel Poelker-Wells; Danielle Fearon-Drake; Francesca Filbey",
          "abstract": "Background: The primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis interacts with the endocannabinoid system (eCB), which declines with age, potentially reducing its ability to regulate homeostasis and altering responses to cannabis. Indeed, animal studies suggest age-related differences in response to cannabis that result in mixed effects in older individuals. Importantly, biological sex modifies the eCB system, which complicates interpreting these effects. Objective: The goal of this study was to understand how individual variation in human endocannabinoid system function due to age and sex influences cannabis’s effects in middle-aged and older adults. Methods:  Self-reported measures of cannabis use behaviors, memory, mental and physical health, cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptom severity, and sleep quality were collected from 107 adults (age range= 35-78, 54 females) who use cannabis. Partial correlations examined associations between age and outcomes controlling for years of use. Biological sex was assessed as a moderator. Results: Regression analyses revealed a significant age × sex interaction for CUD symptoms and mental health scores. Specifically, CUD symptom severity decreased, and mental health scores improved with age in females but not in males. Sensitivity analysis suggested that participants who reported medical-only use exhibited a steeper decline in CUD symptom severity with age than recreational-only or hybrid-use participants. Conclusions: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on cannabis use in aging populations and underscores the need to consider age, sex, and reason for use when evaluating cannabis-related outcomes such as CUD risk in the emerging demographic of middle-aged and older adults who use cannabis.",

          "abstract": "Speeding can be conceptualised as a social dilemma that requires attention to engineering factors such as traffic and roadway conditions as well as psychological traits and individual attributes. These traits and attributes shape whether regulatory and physical signals are internalised as binding constraints, yet most existing studies overlook them. In particular, drivers’ Social Value Orientation (SVO) can substantially influence speeding and moderate the effects of other factors. To address this gap, we examined stated preferences to exceed speed limits, and their determinants including SVO, across urban scenarios in the West Midlands (WM), Athens, and Valencia. We used an ordered discrete choice model with random parameters and heterogeneity in means to capture unobserved and latent psychological heterogeneity. Results indicated that road design, traffic density, and speed enforcement were associated with self-reported speeding, with effects varying by context and driver traits. Higher SVO was linked to greater compliance in the WM, mixed effects in Valencia, and norm-congruent behaviour in Athens that could legitimise moderate speeding. Older drivers in Athens reported greater responsiveness to cameras. Age moderated self-reports: in WM and Athens, the stated likelihood of speeding linked to drivers’ violation history declined with age; the gender gap widened with age in WM but narrowed in Athens. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the effects of engineering and enforcement are not uniform across all drivers. Their impact is mediated by local norms, perceived credibility, and socially embedded understandings of considerate driving, underscoring the need to integrate social and psychological dimensions into traffic safety interventions.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia, the strong diminution or complete absence of mental imagery, challenges long-standing views of imagery as central to cognition. Competing accounts variously explain the phenomenon as a failure of sensory reactivation or as unconscious mental imagery. Here, we propose a new framework, the integration model of aphantasia, which argues that reactivated sensory information must undergo multi-stage integration to yield imagery experience. Against unconscious imagery accounts, we argue that the neural activations observed in aphantasics are not imagery but sensory precursors: rudimentary sensory codes that lack perceptual status. Only when sensory precursors are locally integrated do they become perceptual representations, and only when these are further integrated with interoceptive signals do they give rise to conscious imagery experience. We present the integration model as a dual-stream framework that unifies recent attention- and interoception-based accounts, situate the model within existing theories of mental imagery and aphantasia, and highlight its clinical relevance. In doing so, we reframe the debate on unconscious imagery and draw attention to the role of multi-stage integration as a key mechanism underlying mental imagery and its absence across different subtypes of aphantasia.",

Specifically, we show evidence that within-session retest correlations: (1) provide the common upper-limit of internal consistency and retest reliability estimates, and consequently (2) are considerably less susceptible to producing disattenuated correlations greater than 1 in magnitude; (3) better track variation in scale validity correlations than common reliability estimators such as coefficient alpha; and (4) can be estimated for single-item measures. We illustrate this using data collected from several samples on two personality inventories, the Inventory of Individual Differences in the Lexicon (IIDL; Wood, Nye, &amp; Saucier, 2010) and Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2; Soto &amp; John, 2017).  Results suggest that reliability is typically underestimated and thus overadjusted for in meta-analytic and structural equation modeling contexts, and that greater use of these estimates is thus likely to slow the momentum toward broader constructs and provide sturdier psychometric ground for the measurement of narrower constructs or nuances. More generally, we detail how within-session retest correlations draw better attention to the crucial role of the time interval separating measurements toward determining the appropriate estimates to use when adjusting for the measurement unreliability affecting zero-order correlations.",

          "abstract": "Most people believe that social media discourse is negative and divisive. Here we show how this negativity can evolve even when users are not motivated to be negative. We propose that social media users seek to differentiate themselves from other users, and it is easier to differentiate oneself through negativity than positivity because negative information is more heterogeneous and counter-normative than positive information. This makes users increasingly likely to post negative comments as a conversation unfolds and it becomes more challenging to make unique contributions. Analyzing 2.05 billion comments from 2,150 Reddit communities shows that comments become more negative over time, both within threads and community histories. This trend towards negativity is mediated by the semantic uniqueness of comments, suggesting that it arises from users differentiating themselves. This trend is strongest when initial dialogue is positive, making negative comments highly counter-normative. We replicate these patterns in a multigenerational experiment simulating social media dialogue (n = 4,000). Participants become more negative over time, but only when incentivized to be unique, and especially when dialogue begins positively. These findings suggest that the structure of social media platforms interacts with human motivation to foster a drift towards negativity over time in online discourse.",

          "authors": "Isaac T. Petersen; Zachary Demko; Philipp Doebler; Loreen Sabel; Jacob Oleson; Robert Krueger",
          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

          "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have allowed for the creation of polygenic scores (PGSs) reflecting genetic liability for depression, yet recent work suggests that these PGSs may also reflect greater genetic propensity towards higher levels of stress exposure. The current study sought to extend prior findings to examine whether an established depression PGS (DEP-PGS) is associated with greater stress exposure at the neighborhood level in a sample of preadolescent children. This study included 278 children of European ancestry between the ages of 7 and 11 (45.3% female) and their parent. Parents and children completed clinical interviews and questionnaires and children provided genetic samples. Children’s neighborhoods were defined based on their current home address and geocoded indices of neighborhood adversity (i.e., area socioeconomic disadvantage, crime, opportunity) were matched to zip codes. As hypothesized, children with greater genetic liability for depression as reflected by DEP-PGSs were more likely to live in neighborhoods characterized by greater adversity. Findings were maintained when statistically controlling for family socioeconomic status and parent’s and children’s histories of depression and anxiety. The current findings build upon prior research highlighting depression-relevant gene-environment correlations and extend this work to provide evidence that DEP-PGSs may capture genetic liability for exposure to stressful contexts at the neighborhood level. Future research is needed to replicate findings in diverse samples and to examine whether neighborhood-level adversity mediates the relation between DEP-PGSs and future depression risk in youth.",

This ecological, multimodal study combines functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning with detailed behavioural and physiological measures in 27 unconstrained social learning interactions. Learning was supported by teacher-learner inter-brain synchrony (INS), over regions important for mutual understanding (temporo-parietal junction, TPJ) and communicative coordination (ventral premotor, PMv). Joint attention and mutual gaze modulated the INS-learning association in oppositive ways, motivating a dual-process model: during knowledge-building phases, learning is supported by informational uptake dynamic, with high joint attention, low INS in regions for mutual understanding (TPJ) and coordination (right PMv), and high INS in language-related areas (left PMv). In contrast, during moments of mutual grounding, learning is supported by high mutual gaze and high INS over TPJ. Cross-brain general linear modelling (xGLM) revealed asymmetric neural dependencies linked to speaking and teaching roles in the left-hemisphere language network. These effects remained after controlling for nodding, gaze, and breathing, indicating that INS reflects true social-cognitive alignment beyond sensorimotor coupling. Taken together, this study shows that successful learning arises from coordinated and nonlinear brain–body dynamics and positions INS as a marker of mutual prediction during communicative social interaction.",

However, the neural basis of stable, trait-level differences in attention control remains unclear. Prior research has emphasized momentary fluctuations in attentional engagement, often overlooking enduring individual differences. Here, we applied the quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis of infraslow fMRI dynamics in a large sample (N = 191) to test whether trait attention control is reflected in network-level brain activity as well as the locus coeruleus. Using latent-variable measures of attention control, working memory capacity, and fluid intelligence, we isolated the unique contribution of attention control across rest, 1-back, and 3-back conditions. Under heightened cognitive demand, individuals with higher attention control exhibited more flexible coordination of the frontoparietal control network (FPCN): they showed stronger decoupling from the default mode network (DMN), enhanced coupling with the dorsal attention network (DAN), and greater engagement with the locus coeruleus (LC). Even at rest, high attention individuals demonstrated stronger FPCN-DAN coupling, and little to no correlation between FPCN-DMN, indicating that attentional capacity is reflected in both task-evoked reconfiguration and baseline network architecture. These findings reveal how attention control, as a trait, is instantiated in the brain’s dynamic architecture.",

          "abstract": "Math anxiety and math achievement are reciprocally related, which likely impacts individuals’ agency; their educational and career trajectories in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; and countries’ economic growth in these areas. Previous meta-analyses on this relationship have faced limitations from studies using small convenience samples and have encountered methodological issues, such as variance restriction, low statistical power, and ecological bias. To address these challenges, the present research synthesis is the first to use a comprehensive collection of representative individual participant data (IPD) from International Large-Scale Assessments (ILSAs). This analysis incorporated cumulative evidence from 1980 to 2022, including 452 probability samples from 90 countries, and covered student and adult populations. The meta-analytic average correlation between math anxiety and math achievement was r = –.26. Moderator analyses revealed novel evidence that this relationship is sensitive to construct characteristics as well as individual and contextual factors. Specifically, the negative relationship was weaker for the worry facet of math anxiety compared with its affective facet and its cognitive interference facet, and it was weaker following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Additionally, the negative relationship was stronger for individuals with average and high levels of math achievement and in countries with higher Gross Domestic Product per capita. Gender differences in the relationship were largely negligible after 2010, although female individuals exhibited a stronger negative relationship in the 1980s and 1990s than male individuals. In summary, synthesizing IPD from ILSAs provided novel, nuanced, and robust evidence for research, practice, and policy.",

          "abstract": "Background\nHealth-enhancing behaviours have been linked to long-term subjective wellbeing. However, less research has examined experiential wellbeing (how people feel in the moment). By directly comparing experiential wellbeing during different health-enhancing behaviours, we could learn which dimensions of behaviours are most important for health.\n\nMethods\nWe included 11,144 participants who completed the American Time Use Survey Wellbeing Module, engaged in a health-enhancing behaviour on the previous day, and reported levels of positive (happiness) and negative (sadness, stress, tiredness, pain) affect during this behaviour. Multilevel linear regression models tested how affect differed during eight health-enhancing behaviours. We also tested whether associations differed according to the social context, location, and meaningfulness of each activity.\n\nResults\nSocial engagement was most common, followed by reading and physical activity. Attending sports events was least common. The most consistent associations were for pain and tiredness, which were higher during physical activity than other health-enhancing behaviours. Happiness was highest when doing receptive arts and lowest when volunteering and reading. Results for sadness and stress were more variable. Activities that were done with others, outside the home, and that were very meaningful were associated with most positive and less negative affect.\n\nConclusions\nOur findings demonstrate that health-enhancing behaviours can evoke complex emotional reactions, with positive and negative affect experienced simultaneously. Currently, recommendations around health-enhancing leisure activities in Western countries focus on physical activity, but our findings support calls for recommendations to include a wider range of activities and guidance on the context in which people engage.",

          "abstract": "Creativity in human societies is sustained not by isolated minds but by embodied, collective intelligence. Using music as a model system, we show that creativity rests on the dynamic tuning of uncertainty: moderate, time-varying surprise—often felt as internal bodily sensations—sparks exploration, while group synchrony stabilizes what is new. Because creativity itself is value-neutral, its fate depends on the co-occurrence of ethics, morality, and empathy. Ethical norms bound admissible deviation, and empathic perspective-taking—amplified by bodily and physiological coupling—acts as a social “precision weight” that admits, reshapes, or rejects novelty. From these ingredients emerges field-level intelligence: a process in which groups preserve diversity, selectively integrate deviations, and maintain “just-right” uncertainty under partially connected social structures. This framing explains the resilience of creativity across generations and sets an agenda for empirical work: quantify uncertainty dynamics in embodied interaction, test how ethical and empathic cues regulate admissibility, and identify network conditions that best sustain socially shared creativity. This framing clarifies why creativity endures and suggests a concrete empirical agenda.",

In particular, we show that group judgments are more accurate than the average of a comparable number of individual judgments, and that group judgments can be as accurate as the judgments of the best individual member of the nominal groups (i.e., the person with the lowest judgment error). Additionally, our meta-analytic results substantiate two different mechanisms that lead to synergy in quantitative group judgment. On the one hand, group members can learn from each other and, thereby, increase their individual accuracy (G-I transfer). On the other hand, when controlling for G-I transfer, group members are also able to identify the more accurate judgments and assign more weight to them (differential weighting).",

          "abstract": "While modern large language models (LLMs) increasingly pass short-form Turing tests and are sometimes rated as more human than humans, whether LLMs themselves can act as evaluators in this setting remains poorly investigated. We designed an interactive reverse Turing test in which seven LLMs (ChatGPT 4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro, Mistral Large 2.1, Grok 3, DeepSeek V3, and Llama 4 Maverick) served as evaluators. Each LLM autonomously posed up to ten questions to hidden participants, who were either humans or other LLMs instructed with minimal or structured prompts. Thematic analysis was applied to both the questions and the reasons underlying final verdicts. Across 238 reverse Turing tests comprising 1,714 questions, AI evaluators identified AI participants as AI in only three tests. AI participants were judged more human than humans (mean probability of being human: 0.88 in AI participants vs 0.78 in humans; p&lt;0.001). Thematic analysis of questioning strategies revealed emphasis on emotions/feelings (14%), memory (13%) and behaviours (11%), with distinct model-specific patterns: e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet emphasised on mind and reasoning, Gemini 2.5 Pro focused on abstraction and creativity and ChatGPT 4.5 focused on socio-emotional dimensions. Reasons cited for final verdict most often referred to authenticity of personality (26%) and veracity of emotions (25%). Among tests with human participants : questions were rated by participants moderately difficult to answer (mean 4.65 out of 10), question relevance was rated higher (mean 6.84), and mean duration was 18.7 minutes (12.4). In conclusion, current AI-based conversational screening appears insufficient for ensuring authenticity in dialogue. Future studies may explore longer, multimodal interactions, richer evaluator prompts co-designed with cognitive experts, and hybrid committees of human and AI evaluators.",

However, important questions remain about its validity, particularly whether responses reflect symptom frequency or the degree to which symptoms are bothersome.\nObjective: To investigate how participants respond to the PHQ, described as a “severity” measure by its developers, with instructions about “being bothered by symptoms”, and response options focused on symptom “frequency”.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62; Male=253, Female=245, Transgender=3, Other=2) and a clinical sample with medium to high depression from the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.44, SD=12.23; Male=120, Female=216, Transgender=5, Other=8). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ-8, participants’ interpretation of instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on symptom frequency, being bothered by symptoms, or both; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future, based on these same three options.\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (n=275; MTurk) and 15.5% (n=53; OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ as instructed (i.e., the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they had responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% (n=107) and 11.7% (n=40) of participants interpreted the instructions as instructed, and only 22.3% (n=112) and 9.9% (n=34) reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation. The current study also found that the PHQ-8 validity varies depending on how participants interpret its instructions. \nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings identify widespread misinterpretation of the PHQ instructions across community and clinical samples, raising doubts about its validity for both research and clinical decision-making.\n Keywords: PHQ, depression, assessment, validity",

The current consensus, rooted in computational functionalism, proposes that consciousness should be ascribed based on a principle of computational equivalence. The objective of this opinion piece is to criticize this current approach and argue in favor of an alternative “behavioral inference principle”, whereby consciousness is attributed if it is useful to explain (and predict) a given set of behavioral observations.

          "abstract": "Social norms influence a wide spectrum of behaviors, yet their role in motivating political action remains underexplored. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes three norm types: (1) social approval of activists’ goals, (2) social approval of their actions, and (3) social engagement in those actions. We test how these norms and their consistent or inconsistent combinations shape willingness to participate in political action and perceptions of the cause’s importance and feasibility. Six preregistered experiments examined these effects in both hypothetical and real-world contexts, in Poland and the U.S., using between-person and within-person designs. Study 1 showed that information about one norm type spilled over to inferences about the others, underscoring the need to examine norms in combination. Across Studies 2–6, consistently high levels across all three norm types in most cases produced the strongest action intentions, while consistently low levels produced the weakest. Inconsistent combinations yielded more nuanced effects, with reduced approval of goals especially likely to undermine action intentions, and withdrawal of action approval playing a comparatively weaker role. Manipulations of social norms also influenced perceived importance and expectancy of the cause, which mediated their effects on collective action intentions. Taken together, these findings integrate normative and motivational theories and offer practical suggestions for implementing norm-based interventions in social campaigns.",

To address this gap, structural equation modelling was used to model the association between these constructs in a sample of kidney transplant recipients (n=354) and a non-CKD comparison group (n=400). Results showed that ‘maladaptive’ perfectionism significantly predicted lower levels of self-compassion, coping, intuitive eating and health-related quality of life, and higher levels of stress. However, self-compassion was found to buffer this effect, demonstrating that higher levels of this positive self-attitude could help to ameliorate the negative associations between maladaptive perfectionism and health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive biases play a critical role in the maintenance of specific phobias, yet reliable assessment tools remain scarce. This study examined the psychometric properties of three novel measures designed to evaluate interpretational processing biases in acrophobia: the Scrambled Sentences Task (SST), the Encoding Recognition Test (ERT), and the German version of the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). Using an online cross-sectional design, the convergent and divergent validity as well as the reliability of these tasks were assessed. The sample included N = 286 participants with mild to severe acrophobia. Overall, all measures demonstrated good convergent validity, and their weak associations with non-acrophobia-related questionnaires support divergent validity. The measures also showed high internal consistency and moderate to high parallel forms of reliability, indicating strong reliability overall. Consistent intercorrelations among the tasks further support their coherence in assessing interpretation bias. Finally, regression analyses revealed that the SST and HIQ were the strongest predictors of acrophobic symptoms, suggesting that each task may tap into distinct facets of interpretation bias despite their overlap. These findings offer empirically grounded insights that can inform future research, especially within intervention contexts. For example, embedding these bias measures in randomized controlled trials could illuminate their role in identifying and precisely tracking cognitive markers during therapy, enabling more targeted interventions in acrophobia treatment.",

          "abstract": "In popular discourse, voices repeatedly claim that personal success is largely a matter of mindset. In psychological science, such claims correspond to self-related core beliefs—generalized self-representations. Yet the absence of a comprehensive framework has prevented systematic study of their links to socioeconomic inequality. Building on the CorBel model—an integrative taxonomy of 97 belief nuances derived via natural language processing—we analyzed two preregistered, SES-representative national samples (Germany: N = 435, UK: N = 266). Across countries, positive beliefs (e.g., competence, autonomy, trust) were associated with higher SES, whereas negative beliefs (e.g., insecurity, unworthiness, pessimism) were linked to lower SES. These associations replicated across SES indicators (education, income, wealth) and explained up to 20% of variance in SES outcomes. This study provides the first systematic mapping of how socioeconomic inequalities are mirrored in individuals’ innermost psychological constitution, identifying beliefs as potential targets for interventions with societal and policy relevance.",

          "abstract": "Mental imagery refers to the cognitive capacity to reproduce representations similar to those formed during perception. Aphantasic individuals experience a complete absence or significant difficulties in generating visual mental imagery. Their inner perceptual experiences differ notably from those of the general population. However, these experiences have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we employed a Virtual Reality (VR) drawing task using OpenBrush to investigate perceptual differences among aphantasic individuals. Four participants (aged 21–29; two male, two female) completed the drawing task in a VR environment. We used qualitative reflective thematic analysis to identify patterns in the data, supported by three supplementary questionnaires: the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), and the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ). Three key themes emerged: (1) black in the mind; (2) stick to the specific references; and (3) influences from trained drawing skills. Further individual differences were revealed through participants’ drawing outputs. The VR drawing task proved effective in directly accessing and representing inner perceptual experiences. By offering an immersive, first-person perspective, Virtual Reality allowed participants to externalize their internal worlds. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the perceptual experiences of aphantasic individuals.",

          "authors": "Deniz Duman; Suvi Saarikallio",
          "abstract": "Human behaviour is largely driven by the desire to maximize pleasure. Music, in both perception and production, is a uniquely powerful source of pleasure, engaging cognitive, bodily, psychological, and social processes. This paper focuses on groove, an everyday, effortless form of sensorimotor musical experience. While previous studies have solely  examined groove as pleasurable urge to move, this paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding groove as a multidimensional source of musical pleasure. Extending beyond prior two-dimensional accounts, the framework incorporates immersive and social aspects of the experience. Gathering research findings across disciplines, four sources of pleasure are identified, operating at the cognitive, psychological, behavioural, and social levels: (1) pleasure arising from processing of the music, especially linked to the balance of prediction and surprise in musical structure; (2) immersive pleasure associated with a flow-like, altered attentional experience; (3) movement pleasure generated through (desire for) bodily synchronization and sensorimotor reward; and (4) pleasure rooted in social connection, synchrony, bonding, and collective participation. These interconnected levels are supported by neurochemical mechanisms that modulate attention, arousal, timing, and reward, anchoring the pleasures of groove in embodied brain–body dynamics and reflecting its biopsychosocial nature. This framework offers a more nuanced account of why groove is such a powerful, rewarding and everyday human experience. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the current work informs applied domains by highlighting various sources of pleasure that provide internal motivation, offering insights for designing music-based interventions in therapy, education, and well-being, and suggesting directions for future empirical testing.",

          "abstract": "Identity fusion – a construct that captures extreme ingroup commitment – has traditionally been associated with intergroup violence. However, recent research suggests that identity fusion is also associated with feelings of security that promote intergroup interactions. This apparent contradiction was explored by examining moderators of the relationship between identity fusion and positive intergroup relations across two studies. Study 1, a pre-registered study on intergroup relations in the turbulent Bangsamoro region of the Philippines (N = 816), found that identity fusion was positively associated with outgroup trust when the outgroup was perceived positively. Study 2 (N = 1,576) replicated these results across Gambia (n = 236), Pakistan (n = 505), Tanzania (n = 337), and Uganda (n = 498) , while also finding that perceptions of the relationship itself (e.g., whether cooperation was judged beneficial to the ingroup) similarly moderated the effect of identity fusion on willingness to cooperate. These results suggest that identity fusion can have positive consequences for intergroup relations, depending on contextual perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Procrastination is a widespread phenomenon that occurs across multiple domains. Current theoretical accounts invoke specific structures of preference or cost to elucidate the occurrence of procrastination. We propose a theoretical model of procrastination that does not invoke a specific structure of preference, and instead relies on an unavoidable aspect of any projection into the future, namely, that the time it takes to complete a task is variable. This model captures the basic phenomenology of procrastination and predicts a phenomenon that we demonstrate empirically, the \"deadline-time-arrival effect\": decision makers (DMs) who live closer to their destinations (e.g., schools or offices) tend to arrive later than those who live farther. The same theory explains other instantiations of procrastination, such as repeatedly postponing the initiation of a task as the deadline for completion approaches—e.g., delaying the planned drafting of a grant application. Our framework thus puts forth a unified view of procrastination in which its various manifestations reflect an optimal adaptation to environmental statistics.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral insomnia of the limit-setting type is very common. It is characterized by delayed sleep onset due to oppositional behavior at bedtime and the child's dependence on parental presence to fall asleep. This condition reduces the child's total sleep time, increases daytime irritability, and lowers frustration tolerance. It also leads to parental exhaustion, as parents are deprived of their evening time and are frequently required to wake during the night. This article presents a standardized clinical protocol for children over 3 years of age, incorporating a token economy system, reinforcement strategies, and the use of a symbolic mediator.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, increasing skepticism regarding oxytocin’s (OT) influence on social behavior arose. Low power, HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known), and replication failures have clouded the field. Here, we directly address these concerns with a high-powered, preregistered study that offers robust evidence for a causal effect of OT on trust among individuals with a low disposition to trust. We recruited 359 low-trusting individuals who participated in a trust game under strict anonymity conditions. Results show that OT administration significantly increased trusting behavior by roughly 15%, with consistent effects across regression models with and without controls for personality traits. A pooled data analysis incorporating a previous sample (n=219) of low-trusting individuals further strengthens this conclusion, yielding a statistically significant 16.9% increase in trust. Crucially, no interaction effect was found between OT and the degree of dispositional trust, suggesting OT’s effect is uniform across the low-trusting spectrum. These findings present a strong case for OT’s selective trust-enhancing role. By isolating OT’s impact within a well-defined subpopulation and experimental context, this study provides a critical pivot in the debate over neurobiological mechanisms of trust.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how individuals form beliefs about their own creativity – referred to as the creative self-concept (CSC) – requires examining the informational sources that shape these self-assessments. In this paper, we introduce and validate the Sources of Creative Self-Concept Scale (SoCSC), a questionnaire adapted from self-efficacy research, designed to assess four theorized sources of CSC: mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological and emotional states. A sample of 558 adults completed measures of CSC (both global and trait-like) and the SoCSC. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor model aligned with the proposed sources. All sources were significantly associated with CSC, with social persuasion emerging as the strongest individual predictor. However, structural equation modeling revealed that a general factor – reflecting shared variance across all sources – accounted for the majority of the variance in CSC. This finding suggests a dynamic interplay between personal experiences, observed models, social feedback, and affective responses in shaping creative self-perceptions. The results are discussed in the context of Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy.",

Sign-trackers (ST) attribute both incentive and predictive values to these cues, while goal-trackers (GT) assign solely predictive value, orienting their attention rapidly toward the forthcoming reward. Although animal studies report sign-tracking and goal-tracking as stable, trait-like learning styles often related to maladaptive behaviors, human research has produced inconsistent results, raising questions about the reliability and the stability of this behavior. To address these issues, we investigated the test-retest reliability and stability of the classification over a four-month period of the eye-gaze index most commonly used in human sign- and goal-tracking literature. Our findings revealed good capacity for detecting sign-tracking behavior, but limited consistency in identifying goal-tracking behavior, resulting in suboptimal overall reliability. These results raise the possibility that goal-tracking may be either genuinely rare in the population or poorly captured by the current index. Overall, while the gaze index holds promise for identifying ST behavior, methodological refinements or alternative approaches may be needed to reliably detect GT behavior and improve the utility of this measure in future research.",

          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "abstract": "Background: Workplace gaslighting is an underexplored psychosocial stressor that may exacerbate burnout and turnover among employees. Aim: This study examined associations between gaslighting, job burnout, and turnover intention in Greek workers using a cross-sectional design. Methods: The study was conducted in January 2025 with a sample (N = 291) of workers based on convenience sampling. Data from networking via professional social media Information was obtained using an online survey shared among professional social media groups. Workplace gaslighting was assessed using the Gaslighting at Work Scale (GWS), job burnout using the Single-Item Burnout Measure, and turnover intention on a reliable six-point Likert scale. Demographic information consisted of gender, age, education level, and years of work experience (potential confounders). Linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between workplace gaslighting and the two outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Results: Participants were mainly female (77%), and the mean age was 42.2 years (SD = 10.3), with a mean duration of work experience of 16.7 years (SD = 9.5). High job burnout (mean = 6.8) and turnover intentions (mean = 3.1) were reported. There were significant positive correlations between workplace gaslighting and burnout (r = 0.230, p &lt; 0.01) and workplace gaslighting and turnover intention (r = 0.385, p &lt; 0.01). In multivariable regression analyses, workplace gaslighting was positively associated with job burnout (b = 0.616, 95% CI = 0.466–0.765, p &lt; 0.001) and turnover intention (b = 0.581, 95% CI = 0.414–0.748, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Workplace gaslighting was strongly associated with both burnout and turnover intention in workers. These results highlight the negative effects of gaslighting at work, and direct to the relevance of organizational interventions geared to prevent gaslighting in order to achieve employee well-being while diminishing staff turnover.",

          "abstract": "Pupil dilation responses are reliable physiological markers of arousal in reaction to unexpected events across sensory modalities. However, a direct comparison across modalities has not yet been conducted. In this study, we address this gap by examining pupil responses to regular and random sequences of visual dots and auditory tones, as well as transitions between these sequences. In Experiment 1, we showed dilation responses when a regular sequence of visual dots changed to a random sequence, but not to the reverse transition. A transition between two different regular sequences led to less dilation on average. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings, confirming the reliability of the observed dilation patterns. In Experiment 3, we compared the pupil responses when sequences and transitions were presented in visual versus auditory modalities. We observed strong cross-modal similarity in pupil sizes, particularly for transitions between regular and random sequences. Notably, these similarities persisted even during baseline trials, when no explicit transition occurred. We also decomposed the time-series pupil size to approximate phasic pupil dilation events. The patterns of dilation events aligned with the overall dilation, with modality-specific dilation event size differences primarily in the context of transitions between different regular sequences. Overall, our findings suggest that pupil-linked arousal reflects imperfect inference of statistical structure and its violations, exhibiting substantial similarity across modalities.",

          "abstract": "Millions of people now use AI-powered chatbots to support their mental health, yet little is known about whether such interactions can effectively enhance psychological well-being. We conducted a preregistered experiment on a large, diverse sample (N = 2,922) to test four AI chatbots, each prompted to employ a multi-step strategy drawn from prior psychological research on sources of happiness and meaning in life. Chatbots encouraged participants to either (a) savor positive life experiences, (b) express gratitude toward a friend or family member, (c) reflect on sources of meaning in their life, or, (d) reframe their life story as a “hero’s journey.” All four chatbots led to improvements on a broad range of psychological well-being outcomes – including affective well-being, meaning in life, life satisfaction, anxiety, and depressed mood – relative to a control chatbot condition. These results generalized to key subpopulations, including those with high baseline levels of anxiety or depression. Chatbot interactions increased interest in seeing a human therapist, including among those who were previously unwilling or had never attended therapy. A separate, nationally representative survey (N = 3,056) found that half of U.S. adults expressed interest in using empirically validated AI chatbots for mental health support. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven well-being chatbots grounded in psychological research offer a scalable and effective way to produce short-term increases in several aspects of psychological well-being.

While greater coupling is often associated with learning and collaborative problem-solving, recent perspectives suggest that the dynamics of interpersonal coupling are more complex, arising from the interplay of two opposing forces – integration and individualization – which define social interaction as a metastable system. This study examined how these dynamics influence performance and solution insight in a two-person problem-solving game with a latent solution that, when discovered, enables superior performance. Using multidimensional cross-recurrence quantification analysis (MdCRQA), participants who discovered and exploited the latent solution exhibited greater perceptual-motor coupling during the pre-discovery period than non-discoverers. Coupling declined after discovery, with further reductions linked to successful task performance, consistent with the metastable view of social interaction. Finally, we demonstrate that AI agents embodying the decision policies of pre-discoverers can, when working with novice human participants, scaffold environments that increases the likelihood of participants discovering the latent solution. These findings are discussed in the context of designing human-compatible AI agents that facilitate the self-organization of adaptive behaviors in humans.",

Prior studies have commonly used the max–min expected utility (MMEU) model to interpret ambiguity-related decisions, but MMEU confounds preferences with beliefs by focusing on the range of possible probabilities rather than how individuals form them. We conducted two experiments (N = 53; N = 298) using a Linked Colored Lottery Task to evaluate whether ambiguity avoidance reflects stable preferences or beliefs about outcome distributions. Participants first learned to associate colors with distinct outcome distributions by sampling from them and then made incentivized choices between options that varied in ambiguity. This design allowed us to observe how beliefs about distributional variance influenced decisions and to distinguish whether choices reflected belief construction processes versus uncertainty evaluation. We compared models based on MMEU and on subjective recursive expected utility (SREU), which explicitly separates beliefs from preferences. In both experiments, model comparison favored SREU, and participants with more dispersed inferred beliefs were more likely to avoid ambiguous options. Sampling patterns and memory for outcomes showed similar effects. Apparent age-related differences in ambiguity avoidance were also better explained by belief variance than by preferences. These results suggest that ambiguity avoidance often reflects perceived imprecision in learned beliefs rather than an inherent aversion to uncertainty–a cognitive rather than affective phenomenon. This distinction clarifies whether individual differences in choice behavior stem from how people form beliefs or from how they evaluate outcomes, with implications for understanding decision-making across learning, memory, and uncertainty processing domains.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing debate in the study of cognitive aging concerns whether aging results in a selective deficit in inhibitory control beyond a general slowing of cognitive processing. Previous studies have obtained mixed findings, in part because the typical free response time paradigm lacks the specificity required to disentangle component processes underlying inhibitory control. Here, we apply a novel forced-response paradigm and a computational model to disentangle these processes to test if aging results in overall speed differences or a selective deficit in inhibitory control. 50 older adults and 57 younger adults completed a “forced-response” arrow flanker task. We find strong evidence that older adults demonstrate a global slowing of processing, without any selective deficit in inhibitory control. Furthermore, we demonstrate global slowing is sufficient to explain the mixed findings in previous free RT studies. Overall, these results highlight the utility of using a theory-informed, fine-grained approach to study inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "Current attempts to test whether AI systems are conscious fall into two families: (i) theory-driven criteria imported from cognitive or neuroscientific models (e.g., global broadcasting, higher-order representation, integrated information), and (ii) behavioral or verbal-report tests in the spirit of the Turing paradigm. The former are theory-dependent namely, their verdicts presuppose the correctness of contested explanatory accounts and thus cannot independently ground attributions of phenomenal consciousness. The latter are counterfeit-vulnerable. For example,  advanced language models can mimic first-person discourse, inviting anthropomorphic bias without evidencing phenomenality. We propose a substrate-independent sufficiency criterion that avoids both pitfalls by operating under informational control. If a system trained without any explicit or implicit consciousness-related data can, nonetheless, when prompted, articulate the defining properties of phenomenal consciousness including ineffability, physical irreducibility, intentionality, and unity, then we should attribute consciousness to it with the same degree of confidence we attribute to other humans. We operationalize this criterion for large language models via a test framework comprising: (1) training-data filtering to remove consciousness leakage; (2) a staged evaluation with prerequisite semantic checks and two options for probing (structured property-specific tasks or an open-ended prompt for high-ability models); and (3) a baseline comparison between restricted and unrestricted models under expert judgment, preceded by an intelligence pre-check to avoid confounds. Our proposal does not claim necessary conditions or solve the hard problem. It offers a logically rigorous, counterfeit-resistant path to empirically adjudicate attributions of phenomenal consciousness in artificial systems.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Understanding the factors that lead to participation in psychedelic clinical trials is essential for assessing potential biases in enrollment and ensuring the generalizability of findings. Psychedelic treatment is thought to impact personality traits, psychological flexibility, and expectations, however these non-pharmacological variables may also influence the initial decision to participate. This study aimed to identify factors associated with the willingness to participate in a psychedelic trial. \nMethods: A cohort of chronic pain patients (N = 988) completed a survey assessing their interest in participating in a psychedelic clinical trial and the Big Five personality traits. A subset (N = 235) were re-surveyed for additional data on psychological flexibility and outcome expectations. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to measure the associations between these factors and participants’ willingness to participate.\nResults: Trait openness to experience, and positive outcome expectations, were associated with a greater likelihood of willingness to participate, while negative outcome expectations predicted lower willingness. When controlling for all variables, negative expectancy emerged as the strongest and only significant predictor.\nConclusions: The results show that negative outcome expectations play a role in who chooses to participate in psychedelic clinical trials, suggesting that current trials are biased toward including participants who are more risk tolerant. As psychedelic therapies enter mainstream medical practice, broader populations undergoing psychedelic treatment may not see the same therapeutic outcomes observed in current trials. These findings highlight the need to account for expectancy effects in study enrollment to prevent overestimation of efficacy and improve generalizability.\nKeywords: psychedelics, willingness to participate, expectations, personality, openness",

Much work has linked personality traits to life outcomes, but little has linked person-specific personality dynamics to life outcomes to provide a more nuanced approach that tracks with daily behavior. Yet, previous studies linking personality dynamics to outcomes only examined these associations cross-sectionally, making it unclear whether person-specific dynamics also predict more distal outcomes. In this exploratory study, we investigated prospective associations between individual differences in person-specific dynamics, conceptualized as personality network parameters, with 13 life outcomes over two years. Our findings indicated that node and edge properties in the network were the most robust predictors of distal outcomes, hinting that the accumulation of specific node dynamics over time may link personality traits to outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings for personality theory and for policy and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Incels (involuntary celibates) are a misogynistic online subculture whose members define themselves by a perceived inability to form sexual or romantic relationships. Despite rare but high-profile instances of ideological violence, most empirical research shows that they struggle primarily with poor mental health rather than engage in organized extremism. Yet the group commands disproportionate public attention, illustrated most recently by Netflix’s Adolescence, which quickly became the platform’s most-watched mini-series of all time and sparked intense political discussion despite being fictional. Beyond this, the incel motif recurs in artistic depictions across film and musical lyrics and has entered common parlance as a popular insult directed at men. Why are incels so captivating? Drawing on cultural attraction theory and evolutionary psychology, we argue that incel narratives resonate with evolved cognitive biases that make them particularly “sticky.” These include biases towards sex-related content, moral violations, negativity, coalitional threat, protectiveness of women, and morbid curiosity toward dangerous young men. Incels also qualify as minimally counterintuitive, violating gendered expectations by centering their identity on male sexual exclusion. These features render incel discourse especially memorable and transmissible. We conclude by considering the implications of this cultural virality for media, policy-makers, and public discourse, highlighting the risks of letting cultural attraction rather than empirical accuracy shape responses to incels.",

We argue that transparency is an ethical as well as methodological imperative and propose a competency-based model for embedding open science principles into doctoral education.

This study, grounded in Media Multiplexity Theory, investigates how communication channels are used during everyday meaningful social interactions and their impact on close friendships. Using data from an intensive longitudinal field study (N = 1,423 young adults; 27,644 experience sampling observations), we found that young adults used more communication channels during meaningful interactions within their strong tie relationships (e.g., close friends, friends, romantic partners), and tended to have such interactions with strong ties via phone calls or direct messages. In contrast, meaningful interactions with weak ties tended to occur in-person or via video calls. Findings from a social network survey indicated that the odds of the friendship being maintained several months later were higher for those who used more communication channels when having meaningful interactions with their close friends. Overall, the findings support and extend Media Multiplexity Theory by examining communication channels use within dyadic relationships for high quality social interactions and its impact on the maintenance of close friendships, which has implications for how people navigate social connections in an increasingly digital environment.",

Largely unexamined is the therapeutic potential of humor to support recovery from addiction, despite the increasing prevalence of narratives in culture and media (stand-up comedy, TV shows) involving recovery and comedy. The therapeutic potential of humor and key therapeutic targets of recovery (i.e., cognitive, reward, and social) may possess a powerful synergy that could garner enjoyment, cognitive flexibility, and meaning during recovery. The goal of this Think Piece is to describe key processes involved in recovery, link these processes to key processes involved in humor, and then describe existing humor interventions that could be adapted for recovery. Key processes include cognitive deficits and bias in addiction and cognitive reframing and cognitive flexibility through humor; the importance of nondrug reward in recovery and the uniquely rewarding properties of humor (like an “aha!” moment); the importance of social connectedness in recovery and the unique social function of humor in camaraderie and belonging. Humor interventions could be adapted for recovery, including humor-coping training to reframe difficult situations, humor induction (e.g., stand-up comedy clips) to uplift mood, the use of humor to boost effects of other treatments (i.e. Contingency Management, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), and to enhance engagement with interventions. We conclude with areas of investigation such as understanding heterogeneity in the types of comedy people prefer, disentangling therapeutic and non-therapeutic humor styles, technology-delivered humor interventions, dynamic and context-dependent aspects of humor, and the timing of therapeutic humor during recovery.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual disfluency, induced by blurring or difficult-to-read typefaces, can sometimes enhance memory retention, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, we manipulated blurring levels (clear, low blur, high blur) during encoding and assessed recognition performance in a surprise memory test. In Experiments 1A and 1B, response latencies from a lexical decision task were analyzed using ex-Gaussian distribution modeling and drift diffusion modeling. Results showed that blurring differentially influenced parameters of the model, with high blur affecting both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily influenced early-stage processes. Recognition test results further revealed that high blur words were remembered better than both clear and low blurred words. Experiment 2 employed a semantic categorization task with word frequency manipulation to further examine the locus of the perceptual disfluency effect. Similar to Experiments 1A and 1B, high blur influenced both early and late-stage processes, while low blur primarily affected early-stage processes. Low-frequency words exhibited greater shifting and skewing in distributional parameters, yet only high-frequency, highly blurred words demonstrated an enhanced memory effect. These findings suggest that both early and late cognitive processes contribute to the mnemonic benefits associated with perceptual disfluency. Overall, this study demonstrates that distributional and computational analyses provide powerful tools for dissecting encoding mechanisms and their effects on memory, offering valuable insights into models of perceptual disfluency",

This pre-registered study directly compares human-human and human-AI collaboration dynamics across two creative tasks: the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) and creative short story writing. Participants were randomly assigned to pairs in either human-human (N = 68 pairs) or human-AI (GPT-4o; N = 72 pairs) conditions, with partners alternating turns as first responders to examine how initiation order shapes the creative process over time. Our findings reveal that the apparent \"AI advantage\" in creative collaboration is illusory, driven primarily by increased AI verbosity rather than enhanced creativity. Critically, collaboration with AI partners negatively impacted humans' own creative responses compared to human-human partnerships, with human-AI collaboration failing to enhance idea originality or diversity relative to human-human collaboration. Human partners demonstrated superior collaborative effectiveness that strengthened over time, indicating that current generative AI systems, while producing more verbose outputs, do not replicate the collective creativity characteristic of human-human collaboration. These results challenge assumptions about AI’s creative potential, with direct implications for AI system design and collaborative creative practice.",

          "abstract": "The term \"immersion\" is frequently used to describe and evaluate technologies within the field of extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Over the past few decades, extensive research has been conducted on immersion. However, there remains a lack of consistency in how the term is defined and applied in the literature. Additionally, there is no clear and consistent conceptual hierarchy of related terms across different measurement models. To address these issues, this paper explores the multidimensionality of immersion, as well as associated concepts such as presence and involvement. From this, a unified conceptual model of immersive experience is proposed for future studies in XR. The model defines physical presence, social presence, self presence and involvement as the core dimensions of an immersive experience, which arise from sensorimotor, task/motor and narrative engagement. Plausibility, interactivity, and interestingness are identified as key properties of immersive systems and content that fascilitate engagement, each of which is influenced by subjective factors: internal reference, skills/knowledge and personal preference, respectively. This model provides a comprensive framework for researchers to measure immersive experiences more consistently and build a coherent body of research in XR.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Focused Attention (FA) and Open Monitoring (OM) meditation are theorized to confer distinct neurobehavioral influences, yet the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study leveraged computational modeling to formally test and distinguish how these two distinctive mindfulness states modulate theoretical processes of attention control. Methods: Specifically, we analyzed flanker task data from a prior study in which twenty-nine novice non-meditating participants completed a fully within-subject crossover protocol, involving brief state inductions of FA, OM, and active control. We then fit a Shrinking Spotlight (SSP) computational model to quantify parameters of attentional scope, decision thresholds, and non-decision related processing. Results: As hypothesized, FA decreased the maximum “width” of the attentional spotlight compared to both OM and control conditions, while slowing the rate of narrowing. In contrast, open monitoring accelerated the rate of attention narrowing and increased nondecision time. Conclusions: These results indicate that FA narrows attentional scope, possibly reducing initial distraction but with limitations to rapidly recalibrate attention beyond the initial scope of focus. In contrast, OM appears to improve the speed of selecting relevant targets, while slowing the speed of perceptual-motor encoding and motor execution. Together, these findings provide model-based evidence for the distinct attentional mechanisms of FA and OM and illustrate the utility of computational cognitive modeling for testing key theories within mindfulness science.",

Additionally, the extent to which mood symptoms that frequently co-occur with apathy also contribute to biases in decision making is unclear. To address these gaps, we developed a novel online task completed by 158 older adults who rated everyday activities (e.g., watching TV, going to the park) across 19 value attributes (e.g., enjoyment, social obligation), and made a series of choices between different activities. A factor analysis of attribute ratings identified three latent factors representing reward, effort, and obligation, which strongly predicted choices and choice response times. Apathy was selectively associated with an overweighting of effort-related attributes while controlling for impulsivity and depression, with no effect on the weighting of reward or obligation. Interestingly, impulsivity, which correlated positively with apathy, was associated with an underweighting of effort. Hierarchical drift diffusion modelling supported these findings: apathy and impulsivity modulated the influence of effort on drift rate in opposite directions, altering evidence accumulation toward or away from high-effort options.

Overall, these results suggest that decisions about everyday activities rely on the integration of a wide range of value attributes and that apathy is selectively associated with an overweighting of the effort dimension of value, driving choices away from activities that require greater effort.",

          "abstract": "*Background*: MMR vaccination rates are declining in the U.S. (1), contributing to recent measles outbreaks. If the decline continues, we risk the return of endemic measles, along with other vaccine- preventable diseases. Evidence-based, scalable approaches to support hesitant parents are needed.\n\n*Methods*: We ran a preregistered two-arm online randomized controlled trial (Prolific, August- September 2025) among MMR-hesitant U.S. parents. Participants with baseline intention ≤ 6 (1–7 scale) were randomized 1:1 to: (i) Experimental, a timer-gated four-panel MMR carousel followed by an LLM-guided motivational interview, or (ii) Active Control, a format-matched car seat safety carousel and chat. The primary outcome was post-intervention MMR intention adjusted for baseline using ANCOVA (HC3 robust SEs). Sensitivity included a rank-inverse-normal (RIN) transform and exclusion of two borderline low-quality cases. An exploratory analysis of the durability of the effect used delayed post-intent from a follow-up survey on a separate sample of participants.\n\n*Results*: Among N = 180 randomized participants, the adjusted arm effect (Treatment vs Control) was β ≈ 1.03 points (95% CI 0.72–1.34) on the 1–7 scale. In the follow-up sample (N = 66), the adjusted effect was positive and of similar magnitude (β ≈ 1.09; 95% CI 0.52–1.66). Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent inferences.\n\n*Conclusions*: A brief appointment-framed MMR content review plus LLM conversation produced a clear increase in vaccination intention relative to a structure-matched active control, with encouraging signs of short-term durability. These findings motivate pragmatic trials testing real-world vaccination uptake.",

          "abstract": "Friendships help people achieve many fundamental adaptive functions. As such, one might theorize that humans are designed to seek out and maintain as many friendships as possible. However, with time and energy as finite resources, humans face a unique challenge in determining the number of friendships they can sustain - do they prioritize maximizing friendship quantity (potentially at the expense of investment in each friend, thus compromising friendship quality), or do they prioritize friendship quality (potentially at the expense of friendship quantity)? Here, we introduce the novel concept of friendship promiscuity – an individual difference in preference for a wide friendship network and desire for friendship intimacy – and develop a tool for measuring this trait. Across 5 studies (NTotal = 5,707), we created and confirmed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale’s factor structure, its test-retest reliability, and construct and discriminant validity. Critically, we demonstrate that the scale achieves measurement invariance across three geographically diverse countries and is associated with friend-seeking motivation and behaviors beyond relevant controls. The scale offers a novel method for assessing an unexplored aspe",

          "abstract": "Counterfactual thinking -- thinking about how things could have gone differently -- is a fundamental cognitive capacity that underlies many aspects of our everyday lives; it allows us to learn from past mistakes, evaluate our own and others' actions, and imagine a world beyond the here and now. Yet, prior work has yielded a strikingly wide developmental window for the onset of counterfactual thinking: as early as 2, and as late as 12. There are at least two reasons for this: reliance on counterfactual language (which can underestimate children's competence), and a failure to distinguish counterfactual thinking from hypothetical thinking (which can overestimate children's competence). The current work presents a novel paradigm for probing genuine counterfactual thinking that does not require counterfactual language. After watching a scenario where Granny drops two items that are caught by two different characters, participants are asked which of the two characters Granny should thank. Across three experiments that implement different versions of the task to rule out alternative accounts, we find that the capacity for genuine counterfactual thinking may be present by around age 5, while younger children may succeed on tasks that can be solved via hypothetical thinking. By offering an intuitive and practical method for assessing counterfactual thinking without counterfactual language, the current work opens up a range of empirical questions about the interplay between the development of counterfactual thinking and other cognitive capacities.",

In this paper, randomly selected pairs of variables that showed cross-sectional correlations between .20 and .70 in a large longitudinal study were analyzed using the cross-lagged-panel-model. Results showed that in 98% of these randomly selected pairs, evidence for significant causal effects emerged. The median effect size of these randomly selected effects was larger than the median effect from the literature. Alternative models that account for stable-trait or state variance led to fewer significant effects.

          "abstract": "Workplace inclusion is fundamental to fostering diversity and equity in organizations, yet it\nremains inconsistently defined and operationalized in the literature. This paper integrates\nresearch on the psychology of belonging with social network analysis to propose a framework\nthat bridges organizational practices of inclusion, meso-level network dynamics, and individual\nexperiences of belonging. We define inclusion as the organizational structures, policies, and\npractices that foster a sense of individual belonging; we conceptualize belonging as stemming\nfrom an individual's experience of value, reciprocity, and fit. And we argue that organizational\npractices of inclusion shape individuals’ experiences of belonging in part by re-shaping the\nsocial networks that comprise their daily interactions. Drawing from social network research, we\nposit key structural indicators of individual-level belonging, including network centrality,\nbidirectional ties, and structural equivalence, which shape employees’ experiences within\norganizations. Applying this framework, we then highlight how employees from marginalized\ngroups are disproportionately excluded from informal networks, restricting their access to\ninformation, mentorship, and advancement opportunities, and changing the affordances of\nnetwork positions. We argue that social network analysis provides a potential tool to diagnose\nand address these disparities, enabling organizations to measure and intervene in structural\nbarriers to inclusion. By linking organizational-level practices of inclusion to the richly theorized\nindividual-level experience of belonging, with networks serving as the bridge, we provide a\nroadmap for future research and practical interventions that promote retention, well-being, and\nengagement among diverse groups of employees and advance a more coherent and actionable\napproach to fostering inclusion in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "The use of noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation methods—such as transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)—has grown significantly over the past two decades. Evidence indicates that the dose-response relationship in brain stimulation is neither straightforward nor monotonic, with outcomes influenced by factors such as the brain state, anatomical variability, and neurophysiological mechanisms. Despite advancements in the field, there is still no consensus on standards for estimating and reporting delivered and received stimulation doses or defining dose-response relationships. This paper addresses these gaps by discussing four key areas: (1) factors influencing the delivered dose (stimulation parameters applied at the scalp), (2) quantification of the received dose (electric or acoustic fields delivered to brain tissue), (3) characterization of physiological, behavioral, and molecular responses to specific delivered/received doses, and (4) the dose-response relationship, which describes how variations in dose modulate brain function and behavior. Drawing on evidence from human and animal studies conducted in silico, in vitro, and in vivo, we outline challenges, propose solutions, and summarize current consensus standards. By promoting rigorous methodologies and transparent reporting, this paper aims to advance the reproducibility, safety, and efficacy of research on dose-response assessment in transcranial brain stimulation and its clinical applications.",

Psychometric analysis revealed good sensitivity, acceptable reliability and satisfactory indicators for several validity aspects (structural, convergent, divergent, nomological) – although powerlessness and hope showed consistently weaker indices. The Latent Profile Analysis conducted to identify emotional patterns revealed four distinct profiles, including three \"atypical\" ones (hostile, angry and affected) significantly associated with gender, political orientation or connectedness to nature.

          "abstract": "The Reversed Congruency Effect (RCE) typically observed with gaze targets has been rarely demonstrated with non-social stimuli like arrows targets. In a novel approach, we conducted two pre-registered experiments to investigate whether the RCE can be elicited using non-social stimuli (arrows) when directional information is visually masked. Participants performed a spatial Stroop task with arrows varying in perceptual complexity due to overlapping visual masks. Direction and spatial location were either congruent or incongruent. Remarkably, highly masked arrows elicited an RCE, with faster responses on incongruent trials. Distributional analyses showed reduced interference among the fastest responses and larger RCE in middle quantiles. Additionally, increased errors for both congruent and incongruent conditions were observed in the fastest responses, with congruent trials showing higher error rates, as previously observed with gaze targets. These findings suggest that the RCE reflects a dynamic interplay between early response capture and inhibitory control, shaped by the visual features of masked stimuli. Critically, they raise the possibility that similar perceptual constraints contribute to the RCE observed with gaze targets, offering a potential non-social mechanism underlying this effect. Our results highlight how visual complexity can modulate automatic activation and control processes, underscoring the value of distributional methods for revealing the temporal dynamics of interference.\n\nDraft version 1, 01/10/25.

          "abstract": "Does Automatic Morphological Processing Uniquely Contribute to the Reading Abilities of Middle School Students?\n\nPurpose: Morphological processing is theorized to contribute to skilled reading via the processing of high-level regularities (e.g., semantics). However, morphemes also may contribute to skilled reading via relatively low-level regularities: orthography and phonology. Evidence suggests that middle school marks the shift from effortful use of knowledge of morphological structure during word reading to its automatic activation, thus supporting the development of reading fluency and comprehension. Consequently, this study asked whether automatic morphological processing contributes unique variance to these reading outcomes in middle school students. \n\nMethod: Participants were 80 seventh- and eighth-grade students (n female = 42, n male = 38; mean age = 12.76 years). Four assessments measured decoding, oral reading fluency, and comprehension. Four computer-administered experimental tasks (each with a masked and unmasked version) indexed automaticity and knowledge in reading morphologically complex and simple words. Three analysis approaches were used in a conceptual replication of previous studies (Roembke et al., 2019; 2021): mixed ANOVAs, commonality analyses, and hierarchical regressions.\n\nResults: Only automaticity with morphologically complex words contributed unique variance to comprehension, and it also contributed unique variance to fluency. This was shown on a task that required the mapping of morpho-orthographic to morpho-phonological regularities. Automaticity with morphologically simple words most consistently contributed unique variance to decoding and fluency. \n\nConclusions: Results suggest that middle school students automatically apply morpho-orthographic to morpho-phonological regularities to support fluency and comprehension. However, there was no evidence that they automatically map morpho-orthographic to morpho-semantic regularities to uniquely influence these outcomes.",

This phenomenon has been interpreted as evidence that gaze engages unique social and perceptual mechanisms. The present study examined whether the RCE could also be elicited with non-social stimuli designed to mimic the asymmetric contrast between pupil and sclera. Across two preregistered experiments, we manipulated the contrast polarity of arrow targets: in gaze-similar arrows, a darker arrowhead and lighter tail paralleled the pupil-sclera configuration, whereas in gaze-opposite arrows this relation was reversed. We also varied perceptual context by embedding stimuli in complex backgrounds. Both manipulations influenced response speed and accuracy, eliciting the SCE, with complex backgrounds producing slower, less accurate performance and reduced SCEs. Distributional analyses further revealed modulations of early response dynamics but no evidence of an RCE. Target-specific effects also emerged, with gaze-similar arrows harder to process yet eliciting smaller SCEs than gaze-opposite arrows. These findings suggest that contrast polarity and perceptual complexity alone are insufficient to reproduce gaze-induced RCEs, underscoring the unique role of gaze in spatial conflict resolution.\n\nAuthor note: Draft version 1, 01/10/25.

Empathy is not a static trait, instead capable of growth and development, and this chapter explores whether AI can and, more importantly, should be used to increase one’s empathy. Nothing in principle stands in the way of AI improving our empathy, but the possibility raises unanswered questions about whether such an approach would be effective or would backfire in unexpected ways, such as encouraging the commodification of empathy as a technological tool that can make companies money, rather than a fundamental part of the human experience.",

It is important for researchers using the NCA to be aware of its susceptibility to spurious findings in order not to overinterpret findings. We recommend researchers using the NCA to scrutinize their findings by estimating ranges of spuriousness, i.e., effects that could be expected due to the correlation between variables. If the estimated necessity effect does not fall above the range of spuriousness, conclusions of necessity should probably be suspended.",

We computed dissimilarities between pairs of participants for face-judgements, self-rated-social-traits, and personality-traits, resulting in three separate dissimilarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we showed that both the self-rated-social-traits and personality-traits matrices were significantly correlated with the face-judgements matrix.

Confirming the first assumption, residents of more unequal areas reported stronger and more frequent upward and downward economic comparisons. These associations were mediated by perceived competitiveness. Challenging the second assumption, income inequality was associated with a mix of emotional responses to comparison: Inequality consistently predicted resentment when comparing with better-off others and compassion when comparing with worse-off others. Inequality also predicted shame, hope, relief, contempt, and anxiety in one study but not the other. Finally, inequality predicted support for redistribution, an association mediated by resentment and compassion. Together, the findings confirm that income inequality fuels social comparison but reveal that its emotional and attitudinal consequences are more nuanced than commonly assumed.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing use of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies in psychosis research and intervention. Although initial developments appear to be safe, effective and enjoyable, qualitative reporting of participants’ experiences of simulated psychotic-like experiences is lacking. Given the infancy of VR as a research tool, indicators that such investigations are important in developing safe, acceptable and conceptually valid tools. Fifty non-clinical participants undertook an experimental trial involving an immersive VR experience that simulated auditory hallucinations (VR-sAH). Cardiac parameters were taken to assess psychophysiological responses. Distress was recorded and constructed as drop outs, objective distress during the experiment, and self-reported Subjective Units of Distress post-experiment. Following the experiment, a subset of participants (n = 14) undertook semi-structured interviews guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Overall the VR-sAH was found to be an acceptable research tool. Participant interview highlighted key concerns moving forward with the tool development including ethical considerations regarding the use of clinical participants. Future research should examine the acceptability of VR-sAH in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "The replication crisis has raised our awareness that empirical findings may be much less robust than they seem; indeed, some highly influential psycholinguistic studies have seen failures to replicate. This shows that there are fundamental flaws in the way we (used to) go about doing empirical work. The current chapter discusses three methodological hallmarks that have emerged from the critical discourse surrounding the replication crisis: reproducibility, replication, and preregistration. It has become clear that they deserve to be regarded as integral elements of the scientific process, and the aim of this chapter is to help authors improve their work in the light of these insights. Following some initial terminological clarifications, we first turn to various aspects related to reproducibility, ranging from the FAIR principles for data sharing and data publication to computational tools and workflows ensuring the recoverability of statistical results. The focus then shifts to replication and replicability, with an outline of the continuum from direct to conceptual replication as well as advice on how to facilitate attempts by others to replicate our work. We also consider design, analysis and interpretation strategies that may be used to increase the replicability of our statistical conclusions and the linguistic claims they inspire. Finally, we discuss the essential role played by preregistration, where the researcher specifies their linguistic hypotheses and data analysis protocol prior to data acquisition; this form of academic self-discipline has culminated in the emergence of Registered Reports, a new publication format that is beginning to gain ground across the linguistic and cognitive sciences.",

          "abstract": "The tendency to overgeneralize fear learning has been identified as a potential risk factor for the maintenance of anxiety disorders. In this study, we used a morphed shape dimension to separately measure generalization of fear (learning when an aversive stimulus is present) and generalization of safety (learning when an aversive stimulus is absent) in participants classified as high or low in trait anxiety. In two experiments, we found that high trait anxious participants undergeneralized safety learning relative to low trait anxious participants, but there were no differences in overgeneralization of fear. A control group who learned about a neutral outcome did not show this pattern of results, and the aversiveness of the outcome predicted undergeneralization of safety learning, but did not predict overgeneralization of fear learning. Our findings suggest that overgeneralization of fear in clinically or high trait-anxious participants may be partly driven by undergeneralization of safety learning. Therefore, promoting generalization of safety learning may be a useful strategy to reduce the spread of fear.",

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "abstract": "Empathy plays a central role in human emotional relationships. Empathic accuracy, the ability to accurately infer another person’s emotional state, varies by informational modality and, in humans, is often intertwined with emotional and motivational processes. This study examines whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) - GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini - demonstrate empathic accuracy, and how their accuracy compares to that of humans when presented with only the semantic content (transcripts of recorded videos) of ecological, complex autobiographical emotional narratives. We compared the empathic accuracy of LLMs’ to that of human participants (N = 127, randomly sampled students, both in-lab and online) who either read the same transcripts or watched the original videos, which enabled them to use facial and bodily expressions, as well as paralinguistic cues, in addition to semantics. LLMs were able to infer emotional states from semantic content alone with a precision that is equal to or surpasses human performance. This was true both generally and when analyzing positive and negative emotions separately. Theoretically, these findings suggest that semantic information alone can support high empathic accuracy, though humans may not fully leverage this potential. Practical implications are discussed regarding the use of LLMs in introspective and emotional contexts, while raising critical concerns about privacy, ethical risks, and the potential reshaping of emotional understanding, intimacy, and human connection in an increasingly AI-mediated world.",

Using incentivized experimental data from a representative sample of English adults over the age of 50, we find that a higher genetic propensity for educational success is associated with lower risk aversion and greater patience—but only among those who experienced more advantaged childhood environments. Among participants who experienced an adverse early-life environment, risk aversion increases with genetic resources, whereas the positive relationship between genetic resources and patience is significantly attenuated. These findings suggest that early-life conditions can channel genetic resources in ways that are contextually adaptive. Concurrently, the results indicate that environmental inequality shapes the realization of genetic potential in ways that reinforce patterns of social immobility, thereby intensifying concerns regarding the systematic underutilization of potential arising from constraints on household resources.",

However, the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical conditions, such as depression and eating disorders, is understudied. Therefore, we devised a questionnaire to measure hunger-related mood dysregulation.\nMethods\nWe developed and validated the Mood, Emotions and Appetite List (MEAL) using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in adults and adolescents in the community, and adults with a history of mental health disorder (N = 1,119). We examined the association of MEAL scores with happiness, frustration and boredom during the frustration-inducing mood drift task, in which participants wait for six minutes and rate their mood every 30 seconds.\nResults\nThe MEAL showed good psychometric properties, capturing three factors for hunger-related ‘irritability’, ‘low mood’ and ‘somatic feelings’ (RMSEA = 0.03 in community adults, 0.05 in community adolescents, 0.08 in adults with mental health disorder history). Quantitative and qualitative responses evidenced that hunger-related mood dysregulation impacts relationships, work and other activities. MEAL scores were associated with irritability, depression, anxiety and menstrual symptoms. In the mood drift task, the irritability subscale (MEAL-i) demonstrated a significant interaction with time, such that individuals with higher MEAL-i scores reported steeper decreases in happiness (B = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.16–-0.06) and steeper increases in boredom (B = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00–0.12) and frustration (B = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.05–0.19).\nConclusions\nThe MEAL measures individual differences in hunger-related mood dysregulation, is associated with mental health, self-reported functioning, and predicts faster worsening of mood during experimentally induced frustration.",

          "abstract": "Understanding language in real-world interaction requires methods that integrate auditory, visual, and neural signals. We present a proof-of-concept study combining mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking to investigate referential selection during dyadic communication. Using a simplified version of the director task, pairs of participants engaged in naturalistic object-movement instructions while EEG and gaze data were recorded and synchronized via LabStreamingLayer. This approach allowed us to calculate overlap-corrected, regression-based event-related potentials (rERPs) time-locked to spoken nouns and to participants’ fixations, focusing on the N400/P300 (300–500 ms) and later (500–800 ms) time windows. Our results show that gaze behavior and fixation-related potentials provide crucial information for interpreting language-related ERPs: targets competing with occluded referents elicited stronger P300 effects, suggesting higher attentional demands, while fixation timing systematically modulated neural responses. Contrary to predictions, competitors received little visual attention, indicating that participants prioritized direct task-relevant information. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal data integration for understanding attentional and predictive mechanisms in real-world communication. Importantly, we demonstrate that established analytic techniques, such as artifact subspace reconstruction, independent component analysis, and linear deconvolution for ERP calculation, are applicable to noisy, naturalistic data sets. This study thus provides a methodological framework for linking gaze and neural activity during interactive language processing beyond laboratory constraints.

          "abstract": "This study investigates the behavioral and neural correlates of implicit and automatic gender stereotyping at the intersection of language and face processing, focusing on the bidirectional flow of gender-stereotypical information and previously observed asymmetries in stereotype processing. We recorded response times (RTs) and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to a target face (male, female) preceded by stereotypically associated words (e.g., conducente “driver”, badante “caregiver”), or to stereotypically associated target words preceded by a face (male, female). Participants performed a gender categorization task on target faces and a lexical decision task on target words/non-words. RTs showed typical priming effects for target faces, but an asymmetrical priming effect for target words: faster responses to stereotypically female words preceded by a gender-congruent face, whereas faster responses to stereotypically male words preceded by a gender-incongruent face. ERPs showed a gender stereotype asymmetry for target faces and only partially for target words. Female faces elicited a larger P300 and LPP when preceded by stereotypically gender-incongruent than -congruent prime words; male faces elicited a larger N400 when preceded by stereotypically gender-incongruent than -congruent prime words. Similarly, stereotypically male words elicited a larger P300 when preceded by a gender-incongruent than congruent face. Our findings reveal robust neural asymmetries in gender stereotype processing, extending beyond language, underscoring the need to treat female- and male-related biases as distinct cognitive phenomena in both future research and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research faces a fundamental challenge - the Precision-Breadth-Simplicity (PBS) impossible trinity. While experimental findings are often precise and simple, they tend to be narrow in scope. Conversely, broad and simple concepts frequently lack precision. Developing theories that are both precise and broad is scientifically valuable but inevitably introduces complexity, which conflicts with humans’ cognitive limitations in processing complexity. To address this impossible trinity, I propose a comprehensive exploration (CE) approach—a data-guided theory-building framework that involves: (1) designing experimental conditions in a stimulus-driven way, with minimal upfront theoretical specification; (2) conducting experiments with tens of millions of observations (e.g., 40 million responses in Huang, 2025a); (3) modeling the results through iterative improvements; and (4) producing the outcome: a moderately complex quantitative information-processing model to integrate diverse empirical findings. Inspired by similar strategies that drove breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (e.g., ImageNet’s role in advancing object recognition), the CE approach offers a promising path toward more integrative psychological theories. Initial implementations in visual working memory research demonstrate both its practicality and potential to transform how we study mental processes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive effort is a characteristic but understudied feature of many pro-environmental behaviors, and traditionally, it is mostly discussed as a barrier that keeps people from behaving pro-environmentally. In contrast, contemporary frameworks of cognitive effort show that effort can also be beneficial, for example by increasing the subjective value of the outcome of an effortful action. From this new perspective, we conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of existing data from an online study (N = 1160) featuring the Work for Environmental Protection Task (WEPT), which allows participants to exert real cognitive effort in exchange for donations to a pre-selected pro-environmental organization. We found that after performing the WEPT, participants were more likely to donate additional bonus money to their assigned organization compared to an alternative organization, suggesting a higher subjective value of the former. To assess the robustness of this finding, we conducted a high-powered, preregistered confirmatory study (N = 801). We found that the differential pattern in the donation decisions replicated with a larger effect size and was also consistent with self-reported subjective value of the organizations. These findings indicate that spending effort for the benefit of a pro-environmental organization can increase the value assigned to that organization. This resonates with the idea that effort is more than just a barrier and can have a positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.",

A plethora of methods exist for precisely quantifying these affect dynamics, but recent work pooling data from multiple studies has suggested that most of the variance in outcome measures of depression, borderline symptoms, and life satisfaction is captured by simple measures, such as the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) of affect ratings over time. Ever-more sophisticated approaches for measuring affect dynamics may offer little value for understanding mental health. Here, we examined a broad array of mental health outcomes and affect dynamic measures within a single cohort to comprehensively evaluate whether EMA-derived measures of affect dynamics are associated with specific psychopathological experiences.\n\nMethods  314 adults (97 males; 18–45 years of age) completed 28 days of EMA, which included once-daily ratings on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)-10 and daily measures of stress, sleep, and alcohol use. We calculated 16 established affect dynamics measures (M, SD, relative SD, mean-squared successive differences, autoregression, intraclass correlation, and Gini coefficient for positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), as well as emotion network density and PA–NA correlation) in addition to six additional measures derived using dynamic network analyses of participant responses (promiscuity and flexibility for the entire network, PA, and NA). Predictive power was assessed using cross-validated linear regression models predicting 117 outcomes spanning five cross-sectional psychometric questionnaires and EMA-based longitudinal behavioral measures. We compared models that included each complex measure against baseline models using only M or M + SD scores quantifying PA and NA.\n\nResults Across all 117 outcomes, no complex affect dynamics measures improved cross?validated R² by more than 5.3 % beyond the M and SD of PA and NA. \n\nConclusion Elaborate measures of affect dynamics, as indexed by the PANAS-10, offer minimal incremental explanatory power in predicting psychopathology beyond basic summary statistics of daily affect.

          "abstract": "Emerging research suggests some of the most profound meditation-induced psychological transformations require mastery of mental skills that enable access to advanced meditative states, stages, and endpoints. Such development, however, often demands years of sustained practice and expert guidance. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) offers a novel means of potentially supporting meditative development by modulating brain structures with high spatial precision. Suppression of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—a hub of self-referential processing—may reduce stickiness in internal cognitions and self-interference, thereby fostering equanimity, a crucial meditative faculty. This pilot feasibility study investigated the effects of tFUS-based PCC inhibition during a ten-day silent retreat. Twenty-eight meditators received two stimulation sessions during the retreat and completed standardized questionnaires and daily phenomenological reports. Quantitative analyses revealed significant increases in trait mindfulness, both state–trait nondual awareness, and interoceptive body listening. Qualitative analyses identified consistent differences between stimulation and non-stimulation days: tFUS was associated with enhanced meditative phenomenology, including equanimity, concentration, and sensory clarity, as well as shifts in self-perception and cathartic emotional release. These experiential effects often unfolded in interaction with participants’ ongoing psychological challenges, suggesting that tFUS may increase baseline equanimity and scaffold meditative capacities. Implementation was feasible but required logistical planning. Limitations include the quasi-experimental design, reliance on self-reports, and lack of long-term follow-up. Future studies should use randomized sham-controlled designs, neurophenomenological methods, and examine systematic dose–response parameters with MRI-guided targeting. Together, these findings highlight tFUS as a promising tool for augmenting meditation training and advancing the study of meditative development.",

Participants characterised menstruation as irrelevant to the workplace – and even taboo. They felt uncomfortable with the subject matter and believed that it should remain hidden, especially at work. They regularly represented their menstruating colleagues as emotionally unstable, weak, and less competent, reinforcing femmephobic stereotypes. Our findings extend applications of femmephobia to the devaluation and regulation of menstruating bodies in the workplace, and broaden the concept of dirty femininity to include menstruation.

          "authors": "David Alais; Sujin Kim",
          "abstract": "Continuous flash suppression (CFS) is a popular method for suppressing visual stimuli from awareness for extended periods. It involves a dynamic, high-contrast masking stimulus presented one eye which suppresses a target stimulus presented to the other. The strength of suppression is usually inferred from how long it takes for the target to breakthrough from suppression into awareness (the bCFS threshold). A new variant known as ‘tracking CFS’ (tCFS) directly measures the strength of suppression by measuring both breakthrough and suppression thresholds. Here, we employ the tCFS paradigm while varying the temporal frequency of the masking stimulus. Our data reveal two clear results: (i) CFS exhibits a clear temporal frequency tuning, with bCFS thresholds peaking for masks modulating at ~1 Hz; (ii) suppression depth (the difference between breakthrough and suppression thresholds) remains constant despite changes in bCFS. The first result confirms an earlier finding that peak bCFS occurs for very low temporal frequencies. The second result provides a valuable insight in showing that bCFS changes occur completely independently of suppression strength, which remains constant. In this study, suppression averaged 13 dB, around 2–3 times stronger than suppression reported in binocular rivalry studies.",

          "authors": "Bryant M Stone",
          "abstract": "Substance use among individuals with chronic pain represents an escalating public health crisis. Although opioid use and misuse dominate clinical attention amid the ongoing epidemic, cannabis legalization across the United States has introduced new complexities regarding cannabis use and opioid co-use patterns, potentially amplifying addiction risk in vulnerable populations. Despite growing concern, longitudinal research examining how psychosocial risk factors predict distinct patterns of opioid use, cannabis use, and co-use remains limited. This study employed latent growth modeling (LGM) to investigate trajectories of cognitive-affective risk factors and their differential prediction of substance use patterns among community-dwelling adults with chronic pain. Participants (n = 133; ages 19-67, M = 41.74, SD = 12.92; 55.88% women; 61.76% White) completed a 30-day ecological momentary assessment protocol to monitor stress, pain intensity, psychological distress, pain catastrophizing (helplessness, magnification, and rumination), substance cravings, and use behaviors. LGMs demonstrated an acceptable fit and explained a substantial variance in the observed variables. Substance use patterns remained relatively stable across the 30-day observation period. Critically, cognitive-affective pathways (both intercepts and slopes) consistently predicted opioid use across all risk factors. Cannabis use showed weaker associations, indicated only by helplessness trajectories and pain intensity intercepts. Most notably, elevated cognitive-affective pathways were inversely associated with co-use patterns across all risk factors. These findings challenge assumptions about polysubstance use primacy in chronic pain populations, suggesting that opioid use represents the predominant, persistent pattern driven by cognitive-affective mechanisms, while cannabis use and co-use appear more transient and less systematically predicted by these risk factors.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the form of large language models (LLMs) or chatbots, has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives. In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human–machine\ninteraction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how can we\nrigorously measure these biases?\nWe address this challenge by introducing STAMP-LLM (Standardized Test &amp; Assessment Measurement Protocol for LLMs), a principled two-phase framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases: (i) a Definitional phase for construct mapping, item development, and expert review; and (ii) a Data/Analysis phase for protocol control (prompts/decoding), automated sampling,\npre-specified scoring, and basic reliability/validity checks. We illustrate STAMP-LLM on racial bias using one explicit and two implicit measures.",

          "abstract": "Persistent negative feelings such as stress, loneliness, fatigue, pain, irritability, anxiety, and\ndepressed mood are more than temporary discomforts. When they endure, even at subclinical\nlevels, they predict disease, disability, and premature mortality as strongly as many traditional\nmedical and social risks. Yet decades of evidence have not yet been organized into a framework\nthat recognizes these states as determinants of health in their own right. This article advances the\nconcept of Affective Determinants of Health (ADoHs), a category parallel to Social\nDeterminants of Health (SDOH). We define affectivity as the systemic capacity to feel, affects as\nits phenomenal instances, and affective determinants as the subset of affects that meet criteria for\ndeterminant status.\n\nA novel contribution of this framework is the recognition that persistent affects function not only\nas indicators of strain, suffering, and distress, but as stressors themselves, producing cumulative\nbiological and psychosocial strain. To explain their operation, we introduce a Three-Channel\nModel of biological, behavioral, and coping pathways and describe the construct of cumulative\naffective load, which parallels allostatic load. By consolidating diverse evidence, we argue that\nsystematic recognition of ADoHs as transdiagnostic determinants can improve early detection,\nprevention, and intervention across clinical care, population health, workplaces, education, and\npolicy. Recognizing ADoHs highlights both the costs of neglect and the opportunity to address\nthe affective foundations of health, equity, and human functioning.\n\nKeywords: affective determinants of health, affectivity, social determinants of health (SDOH),\nemotion, health disparities",

          "abstract": "Contemporary models of emotion highlight the fundamental function of emotional expressions in eliciting adaptive social behaviors. Critically, past research testing the social effects of emotional expressions has primarily relied on simulated expressions that may not capture the complexity of real-world emotional displays. Across two studies (N=1,534), we examined how naturally diverse vocalizations influence prosocial behavior. In Study 1, authentic videos of crying individuals were synched with typical crying, atypical crying, typical laughter, or no vocalization. When participants were asked to make affective inferences (Study 1A), vocalization type influenced their perceived valence judgments. However, when participants made donation decisions without explicit inference instructions (Study 1B), vocalization type did not impact donations, except when audiovisual signals were affectively conflicting. In Study 2, we examined the role of explicit inferences of affect in facilitating the link between naturalistic expressions and prosocial behaviors. We found that when participants first made explicit inferences about others’ affective states, they donated more money overall and their helping behaviors were more sensitive to vocalization types. However, when participants donated without providing explicit inferences first, their helping behaviors were less influenced by vocal cues and donation amounts were lower overall. Collectively, these findings highlight the role of explicit inferential processing in establishing the link between naturalistic emotional expressions and social behavior.",

Several key priming effects underlying the composition of the mental lexicon have been found using this priming paradigm, non-exhaustively including orthographic priming effects, semantic priming effects, and phonological priming. This study revisits the effects of orthographic priming in an auditory lexical decision task with English heteronymic pairs, word pairs that share the same orthographic form but have distinct phonological codes. Although heteronymic pairs present an ideal condition for orthographic priming effects to surface, heteronyms are often related to each other semantically, making it difficult to isolate possible orthographic effects from semantic priming effects. To this end, we present a novel methodology for using language models to generate semantically matched prime target controls to compare reaction times against. Using these semantically matched controls, we gather reaction time results from a sample of 29 English speaking university student and conduct Bayesian Regression analysis on 153 heteronymic prime target pairs and 343 control pairs.

          "abstract": "Subjective features of memory are often treated as secondary to the objective content of remembered events. However, growing evidence suggests that these features actively shape how memories are constructed, experienced, and used. Rather than treating visual perspective as a peripheral correlate of subjectivity, this review positions it as a key mechanism that shapes the memory. Because perspective can be flexibly controlled and reliably measured, it offers a unique window into how retrieval goals interact with mental simulation to produce vivid and emotionally resonant recollections. Drawing on behavioral and neuroimaging research, this review shows that visual perspective determines the spatial framing of memory, and the emotional and sensory qualities of recollection. Focusing on the posterior parietal cortex, it outlines distinct roles for the angular gyrus (AG) and the precuneus in supporting perspective-dependent retrieval. The AG contributes to the selection and maintenance of a retrieval perspective, integrating perceptual and conceptual features into a coherent scene. In contrast, the precuneus supports spatial transformation and modulates the vividness, emotional tone, and embodied character of recollection, particularly when individuals recall events from a non-dominant or shifted perspective. Together, these findings position visual perspective as a central mechanism in the construction of subjectivity. Understanding how perspective shapes the process of remembering provides insight into how memory supports emotion regulation, mental simulation, and the continuity of the self across time.",

Traditionally, entropy has been interpreted as a marker of\nphenomenological richness, exemplified by psychedelic states. Yet MPEs such as advanced\nabsorptive meditation (jhāna) or 5-MeO-DMT exhibit high entropy despite radically reduced\nexperiential content. This tension—the entropy–content paradox—challenges the entropic brain\nhypothesis and calls for a refined framework. We propose that entropy does not directly index the\nrichness of conscious content, but rather the grain of inference by which the brain resolves\nvariability. Psychedelics exemplify a fine-grained regime, in which loosened constraints amplify\nfluctuations into proliferating content, whereas MPEs exemplify a coarse-grained regime, in which\nrigid stabilization smooths over variability into contentless awareness. Both regimes elevate\nentropy, but they diverge in phenomenology and perturbational signatures.

However, with time and energy as finite resources, humans face a unique challenge in determining the number of friendships they can sustain - do they prioritize maximizing friendship quantity (potentially at the expense of investment in each friend, thus compromising friendship quality), or do they prioritize friendship quality (potentially at the expense of friendship quantity)? Here, we introduce the novel concept of friendship promiscuity – an individual difference in preference for a wide friendship network and desire for friendship intimacy – and develop a tool for measuring this trait. Across 5 studies (NTotal = 5,707), we created and confirmed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale’s factor structure, its test-retest reliability, and construct and discriminant validity. Critically, we demonstrate that the scale achieves measurement invariance across three geographically diverse countries and is associated with friend-seeking motivation and behaviors beyond relevant controls.

In two state-based experiments, harmonic locking emerged as a system-wide property of brain-body coordination, associated with cognitive demand, task-related physiological arousal, and negative affect valence. Cardiorespiratory rhythms coupled to low-frequency, network-level brain rhythms, which in turn coupled to higher-frequency brain activity, enabled by a coordinated, oppositional modulation of low- and high-frequency rhythms. The converging effects of cognitive demand, physiological arousal, and negatively-valenced affect suggest a conceptual and functional overlap, potentially unified as constituent elements of state stress. A third, meta-analytical experiment found individual differences in perceived stress and interoceptive sensitivity to physiological arousal predicted latent expression of brain-body coupling. Finally, distinct elements of the stress response engaged distinct modes of synchrony, contingent on arousal activation: a purely cognitive stress promoted theta-anchored intra-brain coupling; stress accompanied by cardiorespiratory activation promoted delta-anchored brain-body coupling. Together, this study identified harmonic locking as a stress-responsive, hierarchically-organized substrate of brain-body coordination.",

In Parkinson’s disease (PD), where dopaminergic dysfunction is a core feature, alterations in corticobulbar excitability may provide insights into both motor and motivational deficits. Objective. This study investigated whether motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the submental muscle (SbM) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) differentiate PD patients from matched healthy controls, and whether SbM excitability is modulated by acute dopaminergic stimulation. Methods. Twenty-two participants (10 PD patients, 12 healthy controls) were tested using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients underwent stimulation in both OFF (≥12 h levodopa withdrawal) and ON (1 h after levodopa) conditions. MEP amplitude, onset latency, and elicitation rate were extracted. Linear and generalized linear mixed models tested between- and within-group effects. Results. At baseline, patients showed a higher proportion of elicited MEPs in ECR compared to controls (p = 0.045), but no differences for SbM. Within patients, levodopa intake was associated with longer SbM onset latency (p = 0.012), reduced SbM elicitation rate (p = 0.034), and a robust increase in ECR amplitude (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions. These findings suggest a dissociation between control (ECR) and target (SbM) excitability, SbM results differently sensitive to dopaminergic state, supporting its potential linkage to broader dopaminergic network, comprising corticobulbar and motivational function that are disfunctional in PD.\nKeywords: corticobulbar tract; submental EMG; Parkinson’s disease; transcranial magnetic stimulation; motor evoked potentials; motivational arousal.",

To meet these expectations, it is crucial to design robots that align with human models of social cognition. This study explores the extent to which humans co-represent actions performed by social robots and how prior attitudes influence this process. We use the social inhibition of return (SIOR) paradigm, where individuals are slower to respond to targets in locations previously acted upon by themselves or by a partner. In a within-subjects design, participants engaged first with a robot co-actor and then with another human co-actor. Overall, our findings suggest that interacting with a robot fosters positive perceptions of the robot and evokes co-representation of their actions. Additionally, we found a trade-off between self- and social-inhibitory processes when interacting with a robot, in contrast to interactions with humans. Furthermore, prior attitudes, particularly the tendency to attribute human-like qualities to robots, were paradoxically found to reduce the SIOR effect.  We discuss these results in relation to the uncanny valley effect, as well as broader implications for how human and robot factors that drive people’s co-representation of robot behavior may support more natural and effective human—robot cooperation.",

A new United States Video Speed Test (USVST) was developed.

In a pre-registered online study, the USVST showed high internal and test-retest reliability. Like the UQVST, the USVST correlated positively with scores on the speed subscale of the Driving Style Questionnaire and negatively with age. Further, the USVST showed a negative correlation with the cautious driving subscale of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory and a positive correlation with the sum of self-reported accidents, violations, and police pullovers.

Submental muscle (SbM) surface EMG may thus provide a convenient physiological window on motivational states during foods selection (Sato et al., 2021; Ferraioli and Vicario 2024). Objective. To test, in healthy participants, whether SbM activity recorded during an immersive virtual‑reality (VR) supermarket varies as a function of food motivational category (Daily, Hedonic, Dislike) and whether SbM contributes to the prediction of self‑reported preference, along with personality traits, like impulsivity in monetary choice, measured by Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ; Kaplan et al., 2016). Methods. Fourteen adults completed a VR shopping task selecting 10 products per three different conditions. SbM was recorded continuously and summarized within pre‑selection (−550/−200 ms) and post‑selection (T0/+550 ms) windows, as specified in our published protocol (Ferraioli et al., 2025). Linear mixed‑effects models (LME) examined effects of Condition and Phase on SbM. A separate LME predicted Preference from SbM, Condition, and impulsivity (MCQ). Results. SbM was higher in Hedonic vs Daily (β=0.342, p=.022), with no main effect of Phase (p=.774) and no Condition×Phase interactions. Preference was positively associated with SbM (β=0.441, p=.043) and strongly reduced in Dislike (β=−5.760, p&lt;.001); MCQ had no effect. Conclusions.

          "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of human experience is that of being a bounded and embodied agent. This basic sense of self typically operates implicitly, yet traditional contemplative accounts alongside recent work in philosophy, phenomenology and neuroscience suggests that it can be attenuated or even fully dissolved while retaining awareness. Here we present an extended analysis of data from a large-scale neurophenomenological study investigating such minimal modes of awareness, in which 46 long-term meditators alternated between resting-state and meditative conditions of self-boundary (SB) dissolution and maintenance during magnetoencephalography. Results show global increases in broadband entropy rate and directed information transfer in both meditation conditions compared to rest. Spectral decomposition of both measures reveals that broadband effects are driven mostly by high-frequency activity, and that information transfer and entropy rates exhibit qualitatively different spectral patterns. Although these global changes don’t clearly differentiate meditative self-boundary dissolution, localized reductions in information transfer from the anterior cingulate to mid and post cingulate and in high-beta entropy rate in sensorimotor and posterior-medial cortices did differentiate the meditation conditions. Furthermore, a relative reduction of broadband orbitofrontal cortex entropy rate, and broadband information transfer from occipital, cingulate, limbic and subcortical areas, both correlated strongly with SB-dissolution phenomenology. Together with a previously reported neural correlate from the same dataset of reduced high-beta power in the posterior-medial cortex, these two neural correlates synergistically explained over half the variance in phenomenological dissolution scores (R² = 0.52), exhibiting a neurophenomenological association of unprecedented strength. By integrating nuanced phenomenology with multiscale neural metrics, our findings provide novel insight into self-attenuation and advance the empirical investigation of minimal phenomenal experience.",

          "abstract": "Associative learning, like many mature fields of psychology, is endowed with a nearly unfathomable wealth of empirical data. These arise from multiple experimental procedures and animal species. To assess any proposed theory of associative learning, decisions must be made about which behavioral phenomena to account for. However, there is currently no systematic approach to prioritize observations within this body of evidence. Here, we propose a set of benchmarks that theories should explain: phenomena that are robust across experiments, generalize across procedural variations, and occur under broad but clearly specified circumstances. We queried the expert community for phenomena to be included, reviewed the relevant literature, graded the phenomena into four categories of robustness and generality, and compared our gradings with a second survey of the expert community. We identified 94 benchmark phenomena, of which 16 are domain- and species-general and hence should be explained by any theory claiming generality, and 30 are species- and/or domain-specific but highly robust across procedures. Strikingly, some textbook phenomena that have motivated influential and general associative learning theories are not among these. The remaining 48 phenomena were either tied to particular experimental procedures or of inconclusive generality. Some of their boundary conditions appear to be informally known across laboratories but rarely investigated in a systematic manner. Thus, our review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current evidence, which will direct theorizing towards high-priority phenomena while also re-focusing research into areas in which evidence is lacking.",

          "abstract": "The sensitive period for phonetic learning, normally considered to be between 6 to 12 months of age, has been demonstrated as one of the earliest milestones for language development. Infant speech processing towards the end of the sensitive period has been shown to predict individual language development trajectories up to school entry and most recently, risk of speech and language disorders, suggesting its potential clinical relevance. Yet, this literature is largely limited to typically developing infants with regard to their family histories of speech and language delays or disorders. The current study begins to fill the gap by investigating associations between neural markers of the sensitive period, family history risk factors, and language outcomes by gathering extensive information from a large group of infants. Specifically, family information includes an extensive parental survey of family background and clinical history, a comprehensive assessment of language skills for one older sibling by a research speech-language pathologist (SLP), and a daylong audio recording in infants’ homes for assessing their language environment. The study design focuses on comparing neural predictors of language development in infants with or without first-degree family history of speech and language delays and disorders (i.e., High vs. Low-risk infants). Infants’ neural speech processing is measured three times using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) at 6 months, 12 months, and 14 months of age. Infants’ language development is tracked until school entry by both parental surveys (MB-CDI) and the same comprehensive assessment protocol with a research SLP. This protocol documents the study design and methodological details for data collection and preprocessing. This study will allow our research team to start tackling important questions regarding early predictors of speech and language delays and disorders (e.g., late-talking, Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)) and contribute significant value to the broader field.",

          "abstract": "The post-treatment continuation of effective elements, strategies, techniques and behaviors acquired in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents a key element of relapse prevention. Research indicates that the quality rather than the quantity of these elements predict therapeutic outcomes in CBT. However, it remains unclear which factors facilitate the post-treatment implementation and continuation of individually helpful elements. This study investigated whether the quality of \"bridging elements\" predicts their implementation in the post-treatment phase. Bridging elements were defined as any element of previous therapy that a patient has experienced as helpful and that helps maintain treatment effects from the patient's perspective after treatment termination. Criteria were derived from the literature to rate the quality of patients' open-ended descriptions of their bridging-elements. A prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted with 120 inpatients who had been previously treated with CBT. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that a quality score composed of four quality criteria significantly predicted implementation of bridging elements even after controlling for motivational factors, while none of the single quality criteria alone was predictive at four-month follow-up. Prior to treatment termination individually helpful bridging elements should be identified to foster enduring change. Specific attention should be paid to defining high-quality bridging skills, which should be specific, time-limited, independent from others, action-oriented, measurable, and frequently applicable.",

          "abstract": "Youth who are simultaneously engaged in both the juvenile justice and child welfare systems—commonly referred to as dually involved youth—face disproportionately high rates of trauma exposure, psychiatric comorbidity, and adverse developmental outcomes. Traditional accounts of juvenile impulsivity often emphasize sensation seeking or underdeveloped executive function, portraying defiance as a product of poor judgment or deliberate noncompliance. Emerging evidence, however, highlights the role of negative urgency, defined as rash action in response to distress, as a more precise explanatory construct. This paper develops and applies the concept of the Urgency Loop, a cyclical process in which trauma-induced emotional dysregulation drives impulsive actions aimed at short-term relief, producing long-term negative consequences that reinforce distress and perpetuate maladaptive patterns.\n\nDrawing from neuroscience, developmental psychology, and criminology, the Urgency Loop framework situates behaviors such as runaway episodes, aggression, and substance use not as thrill-seeking but as relief-seeking adaptations to overwhelming affective states. This reorientation challenges prevailing juvenile justice interpretations of 'willful defiance,' which often justify punitive sanctions and surveillance. Instead, the framework underscores how trauma reshapes limbic–prefrontal circuitry, heightens vulnerability to negative urgency, and interacts with systemic responses to exacerbate cycles of involvement.\n\nThis manuscript reviews theoretical models of impulsivity, empirical findings on trauma and neurodevelopment, and critiques of trauma-informed practice. It further explores implications for juvenile justice reform, including the potential utility of ecological momentary assessment, ethical considerations of pharmacological interventions, and the need for more nuanced adjudicative approaches. By reframing impulsive behavior as a neurobiological adaptation to distress rather than intentional rebellion, this work seeks to inform interventions that are more effective, equitable, and developmentally appropriate.",

We conducted a preregistered questionnaire study of 956 participants to examine how vulnerable and grandiose narcissistic traits differ in relation to mentalizing capacity, tendency to trust in socially transmitted information (epistemic trust), belongingness needs, and experiences of internal and external shame. Our findings confirmed hypotheses, differentiating distinct inter- and intrapersonal patterns between narcissistic subtypes: Individuals high in vulnerable narcissism displayed compromised mentalizing and were associated with increased epistemic mistrust and credulity, higher need for belonging, and heightened experiences of internal and external shame. Conversely, grandiose narcissistic traits predicted lower belongingness needs, reduced shame experiences, and higher epistemic mistrust without credulity or clear deficits in mentalizing abilities. These results clarify clinically meaningful distinctions within narcissistic presentations, highlighting vulnerable narcissisms pronounced interpersonal instability and grandiose narcissisms defensive self-regulation. The findings emphasize the importance of differentiating narcissistic subtypes to inform targeted therapeutic strategies addressing specific emotional and relational impairments.",

          "abstract": "The ubiquity of over-optimism, overconfidence, wishful thinking and desirability biases suggest that a universal motivational mechanism distorts all decisions and judgments uniformly. Here, we investigate this intuition, by assessing the relative effects of incentives on two types of probabilistic judgments: beliefs about externally generated hypotheses, versus confidence in one’s own decisions. Across four perceptual decision-making experiments, we manipulate the agency of decisions over ambiguous states-of-the-world and the monetary incentives for accurate probabilistic judgments about decision accuracy. Results show that incentives consistently bias participants’ reports, but, contrary to the uniform motivational bias intuition, substantially more for confidence than belief judgments. Modelling probabilistic judgments as an incentive-dependent weighting of evidence that is congruent with a (covert) decision rationalizes this apparent discrepancy. We conclude that gain versus loss prospects modulate how we integrate evidence confirming our endorsed hypothesis, shedding light on the formation of beliefs and confidence, and their interaction with motivational processes.",

          "abstract": "Exploitation is a pervasive yet under-theorized phenomenon shaping interactions from intimate relationships to global institutions. Existing approaches typically examine narrow domains—manipulation in interpersonal contexts, cheating in economic games, or corruption in political systems—without an integrative account. The General Exploitation Theory (GET) addresses this gap by conceptualizing exploitation as a continuum, ranging from benign utilization of opportunities to abusive appropriation that imposes disproportionate costs on others or the environment. This continuum-based approach aligns with dimensional models in psychology and the behavioral sciences. GET advances a bio-psycho-social model in which exploitation emerges through the interplay of evolved biological mechanisms, intrapsychic processes, interpersonal strategies, and societal structures. Reward circuits, hormonal modulation, and cognitive biases may bias individuals toward short-term opportunism; emotions and motivational drives such as envy, greed, and status striving provide proximate energy for exploitative behavior; interpersonal dynamics translate these tendencies into deception, coercion, and betrayal; and societal and institutional arrangements embed exploitation at scale through hierarchies, inequalities, and legitimizing ideologies. Evolutionary theory clarifies its resilience, framing exploitation as a conditional strategy that can yield reproductive or material benefits despite long-term costs. By synthesizing insights across disciplines, GET offers a comprehensive framework for understanding exploitation as an adaptive, multi-level process. This perspective not only explains its persistence but also provides a roadmap for systematic research on mechanisms, variability, and consequences. In doing so, GET positions exploitation as a central construct for the behavioral sciences and a consequential dimension of human nature across levels and contexts and over time worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Trust is a critical factor in the acceptance and safe deployment of automated vehicles (AVs). In recent years, it has remained a prominent topic of discussion, with market data indicating that public trust in these technologies remains suboptimal. As a result, researchers have explored various strategies to enhance trust in AVs. One such strategy involves anthropomorphizing AVs in different modalities, such as adding human-like visual features or human voices. Initially, it was assumed that incorporating anthropomorphic features would enhance trust in AVs. This meta-analysis addresses the role of anthropomorphism in AV trust as a timely response to the ongoing debate. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 66 articles and 70 effect sizes from 5903 participants from seven databases were included in this meta-analysis.\nThe results revealed that anthropomorphic interfaces, compared to non-anthropomorphic interfaces, do not significantly improve trust in AVs (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.04, not significant). However, in general, adding auditory anthropomorphic features is recommended for increasing trust compared to visual anthropomorphic features (SMD: 0.30 vs. -0.48). Moreover, different levels of anthropomorphism (superficial vs. deep) did not have a significant impact on trust in AVs.  The overall trend indicated that with increasing age of participants, the reliance on anthropomorphic interfaces for increasing trust became more pronounced.\nThis meta-analysis shows that adding human-like features is not a dependable way to build trust in AVs. Future works are needed on how it can be compared to other approaches like explainability. Generally, as a suggestion for stakeholders, it is important to recognize that the impact of anthropomorphic interfaces on trust in AVs is not the same as assumptions.",

We localized two effects to R DLPFC (1) a simple single-dissociation of higher activity in RB categorization, and (2) a negative relationship between overall task performance and the magnitude of neural activation.

Across four experiments, listeners heard various speakers describe two characters while their eye-movements were measured to these referents. Afterwards, listeners provided judgments about the speaker’s intent. Eye-movements revealed frequency effects for literal but not ironic meanings, systematic reference restriction for ironic but not “opposite” speakers, and late-emerging conflicts between literal and ironic meanings. Judgments revealed intuitions about the pragmatic function of irony and relations to truth conditions. These findings demonstrate that ironic interpretations are not directly retrieved from conventionalized representations in the lexicon. Instead, they involve real-time reasoning about utterance semantics and speaker intentions, and that these dual processes yield distinct signatures during comprehension.",

The model is specified by three behavioral indices—associative-distance density, analytic-verification ratio, and convergence latency—and mapped onto a neural motif in which Default Mode Network (DMN) activity alternates with Central Executive Network (CEN) activity on a sub-second timescale. A review of recent fMRI, EEG, and causal stimulation studies shows that (i) DMN–CEN coupling increases with idea originality, (ii) rapid network switching predicts insight accuracy, and (iii) dual site neuromodulation that balances the two networks boosts creative output without loss of practicality. System 3 also reframes cognitive biases as scalable heuristics that expand the search space when monitored by metacognitive confidence signals, and positions dopamine and serotonin as chemical gain controls on the generate–evaluate loop. Practical applications range from AI assisted ideation and precision neurofeedback to cautious exploration of pharmacological and genetic levers. An ethical framework is proposed to safeguard psychological integrity, authenticity, and equity as such interventions mature. Finally, developmental data suggest that the generative component matures early in adolescence, whereas evaluative gating and full-loop metacognition continue to develop into adulthood, inviting longitudinal tests of the model. System 3 thus offers a falsifiable, multi-level account of creative cognition and a scaffold for responsible enhancement technologies.",

This has sometimes been attributed to age-related change in communication goals, yet little is known about how different age groups modify their discourse style when they have different goals. Here, young and older adults produced discourse on a range of topics, first without specific instructions and then when instructed to be as entertaining or as focused as possible. When aiming to entertain, both age groups spoke more quickly and were less globally coherent, particularly in the later stages of responses. This later decline in coherence was more pronounced in the older group.  These results indicate that deviations from the topic of discussion can stem from a desire to entertain one’s audience. Thus, a shift in communication goals is a viable possible explanation for age-related declines in coherence.",

Most statistical methods for assessing reliability with a single test administration are designed for fixed-item questionnaires. We introduce a novel Bayesian procedure called relative measurement uncertainty (RMU) for estimating reliability that can be broadly applied, including to many widely used computational models. Our approach draws pairs of samples from each subject's posterior and calculates the correlation between draws. We demonstrate analytically and via simulation that this method provides accurate reliability estimates and well-calibrated credible intervals across linear factor, signal detection and reinforcement learning models. Simulations found that RMU was more accurate (lower root mean square error) than existing measures (coefficient alpha, coefficient H, split-half), but more importantly, it can be applied across a wide range of computational models. RMU offers a general method for estimating reliability, leveraging the modelling flexibility of Bayesian statistical methods.",

          "abstract": "The present study explored whether people share a common understanding of different settlement concepts despite individual variation. Participants completed a property listing task where they were asked to generate features for 57 settlement concepts (e.g., “city”, “college town”). We used hierarchical cluster analysis to identify distinct clusters based on shared features. Central tendencies extracted from the clusters at different levels of abstraction revealed featural prototypes and an overall family resemblance structure. To probe the effects of regional context on conceptual structure, we used a subset of participants who were long-term residents of Canada or the United States. We found that prototypical features varied regionally, suggesting an effect of participants’ geographical region on conceptual structure. This work is the first to investigate how people represent settlements as concepts and helps centralize the utility of semantic feature norms in understanding how people collectively think about where they live, and the importance of context effects on representations of settlements.",

          "abstract": "There is growing interest in the application of EMDR therapy for those with psychosis. Despite decades of evidence to support its efficacy in treating PTSD, little is conclusively known about EMDR’s defining feature: Bilateral Stimulation (BLS). A small number previous studies have shown that BLS effects autonomic activity by increasing parasympathetic arousal. This study recruited 64 non-clinical participants to undertake a 4 minute immersive VR experience that simulated audio-verbal hallucinations. Tactile stimulation was induced by EMDR pulsers. The index group (n = 32) received bilateral stimulation (BLS). The control group (n = 32 ) received unliteral stimulation (ULS). Primary outcome measures (Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability) were recorded using ECG. Secondary outcome measures (self-reported distress, anxiety, valance and arousal) were recorded using questionnaires. Analysis revealed that tactile BLS resulted in increased heart rate variability. Posthoc test showed decreased anxiety, distress and subjective arousal in the BLS group. These findings support the concept that BLS attenuates affective responses to negative stimuli. Furthermore, this effect appears to operate on both a physiological and psychological level.",

          "abstract": "The prenatal period is a critical window for the emergence of sensorimotor coordination and early relational processes. Within this framework, yawning—a stereotyped behavior linked to arousal regulation and social contagion—offers a unique opportunity to explore maternal-fetal relationships before birth. While contagious yawning has been extensively studied in postnatal contexts, its presence and developmental role in utero remain unexplored. This study investigated whether fetal yawning behavior is modulated by maternal yawning, suggesting a primitive form of behavioral contagion within the dyad. Thirty-six pregnant participants were exposed to video stimuli designed to elicit yawns, while fetal facial movements were recorded using 2D ultrasound. Maternal and fetal yawning frequencies were analyzed across four conditions: baseline, maternal still-face, maternal mouth opening/closing movements, and maternal yawning. Fetal and maternal time series were further examined using Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), and an LSTM-based neural network was employed for automated behavioral classification. Results showed a significant increase in fetal yawns following maternal yawning, but not during control conditions, indicating selective behavioral responsiveness. CRQA revealed enhanced temporal structure in true mother-fetus dyads compared to shuffled pairs, suggesting non-random coordination. The LSTM model accurately distinguished yawning from other facial actions, supporting the reliability of the behavioral data. These findings provide the first evidence of prenatal yawning contagion and support the notion that behavioral alignment may reflect embodied mechanisms of attunement that precede postnatal social engagement, offering new insights into the developmental origins of intersubjectivity.",

          "authors": "Andreas Mädebach; Stefan Wöhner; Jörg D. Jescheniak",
          "abstract": "Semantic-categorically related distractor words slow down picture naming more than unrelated distractor words do (e.g., “dog” vs. “car” for the picture of a horse). This semantic interference effect in the picture-word interference task has been replicated numerous times and is an empirical cornerstone of speech production research. However, picture-picture interference studies in which the distractor words were replaced with distractor pictures have yielded highly inconsistent results, reporting semantic interference, semantic facilitation, and null effects. We present a meta-analytic summary of the published studies. We found the estimated semantic effect to be close to zero (2 ms, 95% CI [-5, 9]). This contrasts with the results of 14 previously unpublished picture-picture interference experiments from our laboratory. Across these experiments, the estimated semantic interference effect was 15 ms (95% CI [9, 21]). When all data were included in a meta-analysis, the pooled estimate was 9 ms (95% CI [4, 14]). This suggests that the magnitude of semantic interference from distractor pictures has been underestimated and that it is not as elusive as previously thought. We conclude that there is no qualitative difference in the semantic effects caused by distractor words and pictures, and we discuss the implications for modelling word production.",

          "abstract": "When asked “How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark?”, most people answer “Two”, failing to notice that it was Noah, and not Moses, who took the animals in the Ark. “Fast-and-slow” dual process accounts of such semantic illusions posit that incorrect responders are not sensitive to their error and that overcoming the illusion requires deliberate correction of an intuitive erroneous answer. We present three experiments that force us to revise this dual process view. We used a two-response paradigm in which participants had to give their first, initial answer under cognitive load and time pressure. Next, participants could take all the time they wanted to deliberate and select a final answer. This enabled us to identify the intuitively generated response that preceded the final response given after deliberation. Results show that participants do not necessarily need to deliberate to avoid the illusion and that incorrect respondents consistently display error sensitivity (as reflected in decreased confidence), even when deliberation is minimized. Both reasoning performance and error sensitivity in the initial, intuitive stage tended to be driven by the semantic relatedness between the anomalous word (e.g., “Moses”) and the undistorted word (e.g., “Noah”). We show how this leads to a revised model where the response to semantic illusions depends on the interplay of both incorrect and correct intuitions.",

          "abstract": "Olfaction is one of our most archaic senses but its central mechanisms are lesser known than those of other senses. In this work, we address a possible link between olfactory stimuli and mental spatial representations. Although olfactory percepts are not commonly related to space (as are visual or auditory percepts), perfumiers tend to describe scents in terms of top/head or base notes, using spatial terms, and arrange notes vertically on olfactory pyramids, with more volatile notes on top. Based on preliminary evidence, we tested in a well-powered, preregistered study whether odors evoke in naïve participants a mental vertical representation dependent on odor quality, in the absence of any explicit references to elevation. In a speeded choice classification task, 110 participants were asked to press one of two vertically aligned buttons in response to a series of olfactory stimuli. A spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effect was expected to emerge from alternative mappings (compatible vs incompatible) of stimuli to responses, due to the hypothesised dimensional overlap between odors and response alternatives. However, the preregistered contrast on means of median correct responses neither confirmed the presence of a vertical SRC effect at the group level, nor provided conclusive evidence for its absence. An analogous exploratory test on restricted means did support the presence of the predicted effect at the group level, whereas its Bayesian counterpart found the outcome inconclusive. Exploratory analyses revealed the presence of three distinct clusters of participants with regards to the vertical SRC effect for odors, with two clusters (N = 61 and N = 19) showing a significant effect in the expected direction and one cluster (N = 30) showing a significant effect in the opposite direction. These results call for replications with an approach that factors in potential sources of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Are people better at remembering the truth or falsity of information? Due to inconsistent results in the literature, three experiments investigated the role of statement type and study context as potential moderators. Experiments 1 and 2 examined memory for veracity feedback with comparative statements and definitions—varying within or between participants. Experiment 3 focused on the impact of instructed study goals (preparing for a quiz show vs. learning a foreign language) on participants’ memory for veracity feedback. The results indicated that statement type and study context influenced memory for “true” and “false” feedback. For comparative statements, participants showed symmetric memory for truth and falsity. For definitions, on the other hand, participants remembered truth better than falsity, but only when the statement type was manipulated between participants.\nFurthermore, this effect was amplified by the study instructions. Taken together, these findings challenge traditional models on the mental representation of truth and falsity, which propose a rigid encoding of “false” tags (and “true” tags, respectively). Instead, the results argue for an optional encoding of “true” and “false” tags, which is shaped by the informational value of the different types of veracity feedback in a given study context.",

Nine LLMs models (Deepseek, Gemini, Gemma, GPT‑3.5, GPT‑4, GPT‑4o, LLaMA, Microsoft, StabilityAI) were assessed using automated metrics, including BERTScoreF and ROUGE-L for differences from human-expert generated responses (degree of biasness). Analyses showed that models produced responses that differ lexically and semantically.. Moreover, the significant interaction effects of type of mental health symptom and severity across LLMs and type of social questions were indicative of weaker concordance of reasoning between LLMs and human-expert depending on specific symptom-severity, suggesting potential biases and differential generalization. Research and clinical implications, such as the importance of human expert oversight throughout the development and application of LLMs for mental health use, were discussed.",

          "authors": "Shawn Prest",
          "abstract": "Meditative experience has long been associated with conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity to phenomena, increased present moment perception and more pleasant experience. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such meditative “deconstruction” are not well understood, with no formal computational models available to explicate how deconstruction alters perception and action during meditation. Using the active inference framework, I demonstrate that the phenomenology of deconstruction–in terms of conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity and shorter temporal scale perception–naturally emerges from the dynamics of hierarchical inference when the deconstructive notion of letting go is cast as a reduction in belief precision over hidden states at a specific level of the generative model. I present a formal hierarchical three-level generative model and simulate deconstruction as an intervention in a facial recognition task, where the agent selects a letting go policy when perceived affective valence becomes excessively negative. The results demonstrate that the capacity to deconstruct permits agents to self-regulate experienced affect via letting go. I furthermore propose that the proposed letting go mechanism may underlie the emergence of minimal phenomenal experiences such as pure awareness states. The model offers a novel perspective within the paradigm of computational phenomenology on conceptual attenuation, equanimity, stillness and affect during meditative deconstruction.",

          "abstract": "This preregistered study investigated whether linguistic information can influence low-level visual perception. We argue that many previous studies supporting this view have significant shortcomings. Specifically, these studies conflate measures of objective performance with those of subjective experience, and cannot exclude the possibility that their observed effects might have been mediated by post-sensory processes instead (e.g., semantics, memory). To address these issues, our paradigm combined elements from two published studies by Sekar et al. (2011) and Lupyan and Ward (2013). Participants (N = 19) observed and rated visual targets of fixed intensity corresponding to their 50% identification threshold; visual targets were preceded by nonpredictive speech cues which matched or mismatched the target. Participants carried out an identification task and rated their subjective experience (“didn’t see”, “couldn’t identify”, “unsure”, and “sure”), while event-related potentials were recorded. We found that identification of targets that remained unseen (“didn’t see”) was not facilitated by congruent cues, but was impaired by incongruent cues. In addition, cue congruence did not affect the relative frequency of nonconscious (“didn’t see”) to conscious visual experiences, nor did it affect the amplitude of the Visual Awareness Negativity, an electrophysiological correlate of visual awareness. The results indicate that language cues did not enhance the processing of subliminal visual inputs, nor boost them into conscious experience. This outcome aligns with accounts of low-level perception that exclude the influence of linguistic or conceptual knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Background: Despite clear evidence linking indoor sunbed use to an increased risk of skin cancer (melanoma), sunbed use among young adults in the UK remains prevalent. This research explored barriers and facilitators influencing the use of sunbeds and tanning alternatives among young adults in the UK, aiming to inform strategies to encourage safer tanning behaviours.\nMethods: An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted between February and June 2025. Using purposive sampling, we recruited UK-based young adults (aged 18–24) who had used sunbeds in the past year. A total of 502 participants (Mage = 21.73, SDage = 1.76) completed the survey and were included in the analysis. Measures included demographics (e.g., age, ethnicity), social deprivation, skin cancer risk, sun protection behaviours, willingness to use alternatives, and barriers/facilitators to indoor sunbed and sunbed alternatives use, based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Backward stepwise linear regressions predicted frequency of using indoor sunbeds and alternatives (past year) from TDF constructs. Significant predictors were entered into separate linear regressions controlling demographics in the first model. Qualitative feedback was gained to further assess barriers/facilitators for using each alternative; analysed using content analysis.\nResults: Quantitative findings indicated that facilitators for indoor sunbed use related to tanning addiction (behavioural regulation), lower intentions to reduce or replace sunbed tanning, achieving tanning goals, less knowledge relating to associated health risks, and beliefs that alternative tans are temporary. Frequent use of sunbed alternatives was associated with perceptions of a natural-looking tan, stronger future intentions, identity alignment, and social influence from other users. Qualitative findings indicated positive emotion and beliefs about consequences as key facilitators of sunbed use, whereas knowledge of health risks and costs were barriers. For alternatives, greater facilitators were associated with convenience and affordability. There were mixed views regarding beliefs about consequences between alternatives.\nConclusions: Efforts to promote switching from sunbeds to sunbed alternatives should target sunbed tanning addiction, knowledge of health risks, intentions to replace sunbed use, and beliefs about consequences from using sunbed alternatives. Understanding modifiable behavioural drivers can inform targeted strategies.",

          "abstract": "Meditation and psychedelics have separately been studied as powerful tools for probing consciousness through their capacity to deconstruct the sense of self. Yet, direct empirical comparisons remain scarce, particularly in expert meditators. Here, we report for the first time a case study in which an advanced meditator and Lama from the Mahāmudrā meditation tradition engaged in a traditional style of nondual meditation, placebo, and two doses of 5-MeO-DMT (5 mg and 12 mg), while high-density EEG (hdEEG), psychometric scales, and phenomenological interviews were collected in a controlled environment.\nThe nondual meditation practice employed and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT showed overlapping features, including timelessness, reduced labeling of sensory content, and reductions in the narrative self and thoughts. Both states were marked by increased alpha power and decreased gamma power, with cross-decoding confirming significant neural overlap driven by posterior and right frontal gamma reductions. At the same time, phenomenological and hdEEG profiles differed: nondual meditation uniquely emphasized the recognition of nonduality and clarity of mind, while low-dose 5-MeO-DMT was characterized by visual imagery. In contrast, high-dose 5-MeO-DMT produced a qualitatively distinct profile of sensory disconnection, seeing a ‘white-light’, and broad increases in gamma power.\nThese qualitative findings indicate that while self-dissolution in this style of non-dual meditation and 5-MeO-DMT overlap in certain respects, they also diverge along specific dimensions. The  hdEEG findings suggest that self-deconstruction and approximations to contentless awareness are associated with at least two distinct routes: a “saturation” route, characterized by increased neural firing (indexed by elevated gamma activity), and increased entropy, associated with experiences of spaciousness, white light, and sensory disconnection (high-dose 5-MeO); and a “subtractive” route, characterized by reduced neuronal firing, and decreased entropy, linked to drastic reductions in conceptual elaboration, and increased equanimity (nondual meditation and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT). The latter convergence points to low-dose psychedelics as a potential complement to meditative training, offering synergies that may expand both scientific understanding of consciousness and clinical applications. A promising avenue for testing this possibility would be for future studies to investigate non-dual meditation under low-dose 5-MeO-DMT.",

In line with recent recommendations in AI ethics, we investigate the power of whistleblowers to contain these negative externalities. Whistleblowers are inside observers who are willing to incur personal costs to alert about unethical practices in their organizations. In an incentivized experimental set-up capturing the tensions and costs of whistleblowing (N = 300), we show that the more unethical the request from a human principal, the more likely a participant is to become a whistleblower---which means that more participants, on average, become whistleblowers under AI delegation, to the point where the negative externalities of AI delegation are entirely neutralized by the behaviour of whistleblowers. These findings support recent calls to institutionalize protective mechanisms for whistleblowers within the AI sector.",

They typically reported the session was calm, pleasant, and easy, and their mean interbeat interval and heart-rate variability significantly increased relative to pre-session baseline. Scores for our primary measure of self-reported calm were significantly higher in the Focused Attention condition than for Stillness Meditation and Audiobook, but there were no significant differences for easiness, pleasantness, or the cardiac measures.

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) has been proposed to act as a gateway into long-term memory (LTM), such that only information successfully stored in WM can be transferred into LTM. Accordingly, the capacity limit of WM should constrain the acquisition of LTM traces. Evidence for that prediction is mixed: Some studies showed that increasing WM load translated into weaker LTM of the memorized information. Others found no effect of WM load on LTM learning. Here we present the results of three experiments that comprehensively test the gateway hypothesis. All experiments included a WM test and a delayed LTM test for the same information. WM set size was varied from 2 to 8 or 10 items. Further, we varied the type of materials (verbal or visual), whether the task requires memory for items or bindings, and the type of test (recognition vs. recall). The WM set size influenced performance in the LTM test only when two conditions were met: (1) The WM task involved tests of item memory through old-new recognition with concrete objects or words, and (2) LTM was tested for items not tested in the WM test. Yet even these effects were not found consistently across all experiments. This Registered Report indicates that increasing WM load rarely impairs LTM encoding, implying that WM capacity does not act as a bottleneck to the formation of memory traces in LTM under most conditions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Long waiting times remain a key barrier to accessing outpatient mental health care in the Netherlands and worldwide. Little is known about patterns of symptom change during waiting times and whether certain individuals are at greater risk of deterioration. This brief report used routine outcome monitoring data from Dutch outpatient clinics to examine changes in psychological distress during waiting and to test whether age, sex, socioeconomic status, and length of waiting predicted improvement or worsening. Methods: Routine outcome monitoring data were analyzed from 962 individuals referred by their general practitioner to a large Dutch outpatient mental health provider. Psychological distress was assessed with the Symptom-Questionnaire-48 (SQ-48), which participants completed at both referral and intake. We computed reliable Change Indices (RCI) to classify individuals as improved, deteriorated, or unchanged. Logistic and  multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the effects of waiting time, socioeconomic status, age, and sex on change status during waiting times. Results: Mean SQ-48 scores decreased significantly between referral and intake, but changes were not clinically meaningful. Most patients (92.02%) showed no reliable change; 6.03% deteriorated, and 1.35% improved. Waiting time, sex, age, and socioeconomic status did not predict symptom change during waiting time. Limitations include the relatively short average waiting time (M = 18.90 days), limited variability in socioeconomic status, and potential systematic dropout. Conclusions: Most individuals remained stable, with only small proportions showing reliable improvement or deterioration during short waiting times. These findings highlight the need for precision-based approaches to identify those at risk of worsening.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the crosslinguistic distribution of intrinsic vowel duration, the observation that high vowels tend to be shorter than low vowels, using a large-scale corpus phonetic approach. Previous studies have reported a durational difference but have been limited by small speaker samples and narrow language coverage. Nevertheless, this observation has been debated to reflect an automatic consequence of the vowel height difference, or to be under speaker control. We reconsider this dichotomy in terms of competing pressures of target uniformity and enhancement in phonetic realization. Target uniformity would be consistent with a systematically shorter duration for high than low vowels and no systematic asymmetry between front and back vowels. In contrast, enhancement would predict larger, more variable durational differences between high and low vowels. To address the empirical gap, we analyzed duration contrasts among /i/, /u/, and /a/ in inter-obstruent contexts from over 60 languages, 80 language–length contrasts, and 16 language families in the VoxCommunis Corpus using automatic and manual vowel segmentations. Linear mixed-effects models assessed duration differences across vowel height and backness, incorporating rate-normalized and raw measures, while by-speaker analyses probed individual consistency. High vowels were shorter than low vowels in approximately 90% of language contrasts and significantly so for almost 80%. Crucially, no consistent durational bias emerged between high front and high back vowels. These findings suggest that intrinsic vowel duration is better understood as a statistical universal emerging from the balance between uniformity and enhancement in phonetic realization, rather than as a purely automatic universal.",

          "abstract": "This preregistered study investigated whether linguistic information can influence low-level visual perception. We argue that many previous studies supporting this view have significant shortcomings. Specifically, these studies conflate measures of objective performance with those of subjective experience, and cannot exclude the possibility that their observed effects might have been mediated by post-sensory processes instead (e.g., semantics, memory). To address these issues, our paradigm combined elements from two published studies by Sekar et al. (2011) and Lupyan and Ward (2013). Participants (N = 19) observed and rated visual targets of fixed intensity corresponding to their 50% identification threshold; visual targets were preceded by nonpredictive speech cues which matched or mismatched the target. Participants carried out an identification task and rated their subjective experience (“didn’t see”, “couldn’t identify”, “unsure”, and “sure”), while event-related potentials were recorded. We found that identification of targets that remained unseen (“didn’t see”) was not facilitated by congruent cues, but was impaired by incongruent cues. In addition, cue congruence did not affect the relative frequency of nonconscious (“didn’t see”) to conscious visual experiences, nor did it affect the amplitude of the Visual Awareness Negativity, an electrophysiological correlate of visual awareness. The results indicate that language cues did not enhance the processing of subliminal visual inputs, nor boost them into conscious experience. This outcome aligns with accounts of low-level perception that exclude the influence of linguistic or conceptual knowledge.",

We found evidence reinforcing the structure of this multidimensional scale across groups. We found select mean-level differences in reported ethno-racial identity between our regional sample. We also found aspects of overlap and nuance between our current sample and a previous national sample of adults, showcasing the importance of contextual factors with our recruitment site. Lastly, we reinforced that dimensions of ERI were related to both mental health and well-being, with some dimensions of identity serving a more pronounced role among specific ethno-racial groups. We discuss the implications of these findings for appreciating measurement and the implications of multiple dimensions of ethnoracial identity in early adult development.",

The same mechanism that fuels success -- rationally integrating information from others -- can also create bias. Using hiring in labor markets as a relevant context, we simulate networks of Bayesian learners, generative agents, and human participants making hiring decisions independently or collectively. In all three cases, integrating social information improves efficiency when one option is best, but also produces inequality: agents converge on a few options even though all are equally qualified. Our experiments show that collective bias can emerge purely from individually rational and fully transparent social learning, even without any loss of information. Pooling information compresses experiences, reduces exploration, and amplifies early randomness, revealing a general mechanism of emergent inequality.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "The advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) poses a fundamental challenge regarding \nthe nature of scientific inquiry: what happens to theory when machines cease to pursue \nunderstanding and focus solely on prediction? This article posits that AGI signifies an \nepistemological rupture in the extensive continuum of scientific rationality, wherein \nexplanation, the quest for causal and conceptual comprehension, transitions to simulation, a \nmode of cognition propelled by predictive patterning rather than interpretative profundity. The \npaper engages figures from the philosophy of science and philosophical hermeneutics, \nincluding Popper, Kuhn, Hempel, and Lakatos, in conversation with Gadamer, Ricoeur, and \nHeidegger, to investigate how AGI redefines the concept of “knowledge.” Through a \nhermeneutic analysis of AGI manifestos, research papers, and policy documents, the study \ninterprets these scientific texts as manifestations of a novel epistemic attitude, one that \nprioritises performance over comprehension and reduces explanation to algorithmic efficiency. \nAGI's simulations have unparalleled predictive accuracy, but they jeopardise the foundational \nobjectives of science: justification, clarity, and accountability. The article finishes by proposing \na hermeneutic philosophy of AGI that reinstates the significance of interpretation and meaning \nwithin automated knowledge systems. Instead of seeing AGI as the end of theory, it is shown \nas a critical mirror that science must look into to rethink what it means to \"know.\" In a time \nwhen data may move faster than understanding, philosophy's job is to keep the space of \ninterpretation open to remind us that knowledge is not just about what works, but also about \nwhat makes sense.",

This study investigates how MLLMs evaluate hate speech via a series of conjoint experiments. Models are provided with a hate speech policy and shown synthetic social media posts that systematically vary in slur usage, user demographics, and other attributes. The decisions from MLLMs are benchmarked against judgments by human subjects (N=1,854). The results demonstrate that larger, more advanced models can make context-sensitive evaluations that are closely aligned with human judgment. However, pervasive demographic and lexical biases remain, particularly among smaller models. Further analyses show that context sensitivity can be amplified via prompting but not eliminated, and that some models are especially responsive to visual identity cues. These findings highlight the benefits and risks of using MLLMs for content moderation and demonstrate the utility of conjoint experiments for auditing artificial intelligence in complex, context-dependent applications.",

The study recruited 20 working parents (10 females and 10 males) working within knowledge industries as research participants. Diaries, along with in-depth interview methods, were deployed to capture nuanced sentiments and practices towards work and life coordination using ICTs. The data analysis revealed four main themes that identified the similarities and differences of remote working experiences between working mothers and fathers: (1) general trend towards working remotely, (2) shifting perceptions towards work-life responsibilities (opportunity), (3) gender ideology unfolding on ICT practices (risk) and (4) the different social consequences of role conflicts between gender (risk).",

          "abstract": "This article examines the emergence of digital program management systems in African \ndevelopment, concentrating on tools such as dashboards, biometric identity, and mobile data \nplatforms. It contends that these systems are not impartial technology of efficiency but modern \nmanifestations of colonial control mechanisms. The paper, based on Quijano's idea of the \n\"coloniality of power,\" says that digital program management is a form of epistemic violence \nsince it turns communities into databases and puts donor supervision ahead of relational \naccountability. Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) functions, integrated into these systems, \nexacerbate the issue by legitimising surveillance and data extraction as the prevailing \nframework of responsibility. Based on decolonial theory, the analysis compares the \ntechnocratic positivism that underlies today's management methods with epistemologies based \non Indigenous African Knowledge Systems (IKS), especially Ubuntu relationality. Biometric \nsystems erase relational identity by favouring individualised markers over community \nrecognition. Dashboards impose a managerial \"view from nowhere,\" turning complexity into \nmetrics. Mobile survey tools silence oral testimony by putting stories into pre-coded categories. \nThese behaviours show how digital program administration weakens local ways of knowing \nand gives more authority to outside funders and technocrats. In response, the article proposes \na normative framework of Relational Accountability. It asks for a change from data extraction \nto ethical witnessing, participatory discussion in community assemblies (baraza), data \nsovereignty as cultural sovereignty, and the speculative design of Ubuntu-centric technology, \nall based on IKS principles. The paper asserts that decolonising program management is crucial \nfor fostering trust, promoting epistemic fairness, and ensuring more ethical development \npractices. It advocates for epistemic disobedience that re-establishes Indigenous African \nKnowledge Systems as fundamental to program design and digital responsibility.",

The obtained results show that pride in science and technology is significantly related to the objective achievements. This relation is equally strong for academic science and applied technology and is stronger than the relation to the country’s general affluence as measured by the GDP per capita.

          "abstract": "This article examines how competitive authoritarian regimes reshape state administration through informal, extralegal structures that bypass formal institutional frameworks. While prior research highlights how regimes centralize power by restructuring bureaucracies and appointing loyalists, the formal institutional framework typically remains the main conduit through which partisan control and management of state administration are exercised. This article presents a distinct model of partisan control under competitive authoritarianism — showing how these strategies may be reinforced, or even replaced, by party-run parallel networks that redirect authority flows. Drawing on the case of Serbia under Vučić, it documents a “para-state” shadow governance system that displaces formal command. This model enables centralized, discretionary control across the entire public sector while shielding elites from accountability. Conceptually, the article argues that Serbia’s model blurs the line between competitive authoritarianism and totalitarian rule.",

          "abstract": "We study how a large, exogenous trade shock --- triggered by China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 --- reshaped income, inequality, and import behavior across Brazilian regions. Using a shift-share instrument based on pre-shock export structures, we show that regions more exposed to China’s demand boom experienced increases in income per capita and within-region inequality relative to less exposed areas. These changes, in turn, led to rising import values and a shift in import composition, particularly toward consumption goods and medium- to high-tech manufactured products. To interpret these patterns, we classify goods by necessity and luxury status using Brazilian household survey data and develop a complementary ``demonstration luxury'' classification --- designed to capture status-oriented goods --- based on U.S. consumption patterns. Luxury imports rose most in regions that were initially more unequal or experienced sharper post-shock increases in inequality, consistent with non-homothetic preferences and status-driven consumption. Our findings highlight inequality as a key channel through which trade shocks shape regional import demand in developing economies.",

          "abstract": "In 1954, Dorothy Martin predicted an apocalyptic flood and promised her followers rescue by flying saucers. When neither arrived, she recanted, her group dissolved, and efforts to proselytize ceased. But When Prophecy Fails (1956), the now-canonical account of the event, claimed the opposite: that the group doubled down on its beliefs and began recruiting—evidence, the authors argued, of a new psychological mechanism, cognitive dissonance. Drawing on newly unsealed archival material, this article demonstrates that the book’s central claims are false, and that the authors knew they were false. The documents reveal that the group actively proselytized well before the prophecy failed and quickly abandoned their beliefs afterward. They also expose serious ethical violations by the researchers, including fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation. One coauthor, Henry Riecken, posed as a spiritual authority and later admitted he had “precipitated” the climactic events of the study.",

          "authors": "Mark Carew",
          "abstract": "A key but under-addressed driver of the health inequalities facing persons with disabilities is disability stigma. However, disability stigma remains poorly conceptualised and consequently inconsistently measured and addressed within health research. Many studies treat disability stigma and health stigma as interchangeable. However, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as the globally accepted framework for conceptualising disability clearly distinguishes between the concepts of “disability” and a “health condition”. This paper applies the ICF to show that disability stigma and health stigma have overlapping components but are conceptually distinct. Specifically, while health stigma is recognised to arise from adverse judgements about health conditions, this paper argues that disability stigma arises from adverse judgements about impairment(s), activity limitation(s), and/or health-related participation restriction(s) that may or may not relate to an individual’s health condition. This paper also explains why this distinction matters. First, it aligns the study of disability stigma with modern definitions of disability and the lived experiences persons with disabilities have of stigma. Second, it enables intersectional analysis of the impact of distinct stigmas arising from judgements about health condition(s) and disability status. Third, it contributes to better ways to measure disability stigma and consequently address it within interventions and policies. Fourth, it contributes to an improved classification of stigma within the ICF itself, which can be used to more comprehensively study health inequalities affecting persons with disabilities.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to deepen open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence International Corps through artificial intelligence methods, exploring AI's application potential and methodological value in complex warfare information environments. The core objectives address two questions: First, how can AI technologies be effectively integrated into the OSINT cycle to enhance information screening, pattern recognition, and risk prediction? Second, can AI-driven OSINT provide more forward-looking and systematic support for strategic decision-making? Methodologically, this study adopts a multidisciplinary mixed methodology, integrating text metrology, semantic network analysis, risk radar modeling, and time-series projection to form a comprehensive framework: “Data Collection → AI Processing → Risk Assessment → Timeline Analysis → Insight Output.” The research process extensively leverages multilingual datasets (English, Ukrainian, Russian) and cross-platform information sources (official, media, social networks), utilizing visualization modeling to present data and risks in multidimensional formats. Results demonstrate that AI significantly enhances the depth and breadth of information processing in OSINT analysis. It outperforms traditional methods in misinformation detection accuracy, multilingual keyword extraction efficiency, and predictive power for risk patterns. Military risks and information warfare risks were assessed as highest priority, followed by public opinion risks and legal risks, revealing an overall “military-information warfare-public opinion” triple-high-risk configuration. Concurrently, time-series analysis revealed rhythmic patterns in risk evolution, providing quantitative foundations for future strategic planning. The study concludes that AI not only transforms OSINT's technical framework but also propels it toward structured, systematic, and forward-looking intelligence generation. AI-driven OSINT effectively bridges the tension between data fragmentation and systematic strategic analysis, enabling a qualitative leap in the intelligence cycle from “information accumulation” to “strategic insight.” This study provides an empirical paradigm for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and intelligence studies, holding significant theoretical and practical implications for future military conflicts, national security, and policy formulation.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "This essay redefines Microsoft Power BI as not merely a business intelligence tool, but as a \ncognitive prosthesis and an epistemic infrastructure that influences management cognition, \nattention, and the generation of organisational knowledge. Although traditional literature \nregards Power BI mainly as a visualisation or decision-support instrument, this study employs \na critical conceptual and metascientific perspective to analyse how the platform pre-defines \nlegitimate evidence, influences organisational reasoning, and reallocates interpretive labour \nwithin knowledge-driven organisations. The analysis puts up three connected arguments. To \nbegin with, Power BI acts like a cognitive prosthesis by automating basic operations like trend \nidentification, forecasting, and comparison measurements. This frees managers from low-level \nduties while also making them dependent on its dashboards and algorithmic logic. Second, it \nworks as a micro-technology of cognitive capitalism by capturing, directing, and turning \nmanagement attention into a resource of economic and organisational value. Third, the platform \nincorporates epistemic authority into its visualisations and metrics, gently regulating the \ngeneration of organisational knowledge and influencing the ethical and political aspects of \nmanagerial decision-making. By integrating perspectives from cognitive science, critical \ntheory, science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and political economy, the \narticle illustrates that the automation of cognition is inherently biased, resulting in epistemic \nconstriction, ethical challenges, and technocratic validation masquerading as “data-driven” \nobjectivity. The research enhances metascientific discourse by elucidating the infrastructure of \nknowledge production within organisations and advocating for reflexive literacy in the \nutilisation of data analytics platforms. It emphasises the ethical, epistemological, and \norganisational implications of cognitive prostheses such as Power BI and promotes a more \ncritical approach to the technologies that increasingly shape managerial cognition and decision\nmaking.",

          "abstract": "tina and Malik are excited to be invited to talk about their music project Circle A at a practice-based research symposium on music, sounds, and the political. They founded Circle A in 2014 as the first Radical Eurodance act ever, with the self-declared mission of “making Eurodance a threat again” and framing it as “a four-to-the-floor declaration of war against any kind of injustice and oppression that haunts the world we live in.” Over the past few years, they have only occasionally performed or recorded, due to their time being taken up by kids, other bands, and a pandemic. In early 2024, they meet over a beer to revisit their joint work and think about the topics they would like to discuss at the symposium. They reminisce about when, how, and why they founded Circle A; how the band and its music developed; what the future may hold for it; how and to what ends they mixed Eurodance and politics; and what all of this has to do with their shared background in musicology. In the process, tina and Malik also engage in discussions about fundamental questions regarding the relationship between music and the political, such as: What makes music political? Who are the audiences of political music, and how do they influence musicians’ practices? What are criteria for deciding whether a piece of political music is “good,” or maybe rather: “successful”? Can (political) music change the world? If so, how and to what extent? How can the seriousness of social struggles be squared with humorous modes of artistic expression? – As the conversation unfolds, tina and Malik switch back and forth between spoken language and song. In the end, they fail to produce notes for their symposium presentation, but they certainly enjoyed the intellectually stimulating – and sometimes controversial – exchange.",

          "authors": "Sinourn Huot; Rany Sam; Thou Nguon",
          "abstract": "An education system should strive to attract well-qualified teachers and teacher candidates who have a high degree of professional commitment to meet society requirements such as teacher shortages, increasing numbers of schools and students (MoEYS, 2023), teacher policy adjustments (TPAP: 2024--2030, 2023) and Cambodia’s socioeconomic status (ESP: 2024--2028, 2024) toward country development. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing teaching career choice among fourth-year primary and lower secondary school student teachers at Teacher Education Colleges (TECs). The study uses a quantitative paradigm with the survey method in the form of a structured questionnaire, which was adapted from Sardana et al. (2021) and Martinez Moreno &amp; Petko (2023), to collect the data. A simple random sampling method was used to select a sample of 223 participants, including both primary and lower secondary student teachers, whose ages ranged from 22--25 years (71.3%), 26--29 years (24.2%) and 4.5% of the other ages. This study uses descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the validity, reliability, mean, standard deviation, and significance of the collected data through a one-sample t test. The study revealed four main factors that influence the decision to choose teaching as a career, such as the influence of others, including family, friends, teachers and mass media; extrinsic, intrinsic, and altruistic motivational influences; and teaching as a fallback career and sociocultural factor. Altruistic motivation had the most significant influence on teaching career choice, with the highest mean score (M=4.26, SD=0.59), whereas teacher influence had the second greatest influence (M=4.20, SD=0.65), followed by intrinsic motivation (M=4.17, SD=0.62), while teaching as a fallback career had the least influence on all four factors, with the lowest mean score (M=2.37, SD=1.12). This study will help relevant people and institutions, such as the Cambodian ministry of education, parents, administrations, teachers, students and other researchers to be aware of the factors influencing career choice so that they can refine recruitment policies, increase their actions and efforts, and enter preparation programs for teaching careers in the Cambodian context today and in the future.",

          "abstract": "Corporate governance and financial statement fraud have increasingly attracted scholarly and regulatory attention in the ASEAN region. This focus aligns with more frequent accounting manipulation and rising demands for transparency. Although literature on this topic is expanding, comprehensive quantitative reviews remain scarce. This study aims to present an updated mapping of the literature on corporate governance and financial statement fraud. It compiles 269 articles published between 2005 and 2024 from the Scopus database. This study employs bibliometric methods, including VOSviewer and the R-Bibliometrix (Biblioshiny) package, to examine productivity, collaboration networks, citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and thematic evolution. The findings identify leading journals, authors, universities, and countries, with Malaysia and Indonesia as dominant contributors. Thematic analysis highlights earnings management as the key issue linking various research streams. Governance mechanisms such as audit committees, audit quality, and ownership structures follow. This study maps the intellectual structure of the literature using co-citation networks and outlines future research directions through thematic maps and the evolution of keywords. It offers the most recent synthesis of the literature, fills gaps in previous reviews, and points to a forward-looking agenda. The agenda encourages the exploration of other ASEAN contexts, the integration of non-traditional issues such as sustainability, and increased cross-country collaborations.",

          "abstract": "Human collective intelligence—the capacity of groups to solve problems, make decisions, and\nacquire knowledge beyond individual capabilities—is here understood as an emergent\nphenomenon that evolved in our lineage from a distinct trajectory of epistemic niche\nconstruction (ENC), and progressively sustained the latter. Humans systematically alter their\ninformational landscapes in materially visible ways by creating enduring spatial and\nartefactual scaffolds for improved cognitive performance and social coordination. In this\npaper, we propose a set of criteria to define ENC and track its emergence in the archaeological\nrecord. These criteria highlight the importance of persistent, publicly accessible, and\nevolutionarily incremental modifications that sustained behavioural coordination among\nindividuals in space and time. We apply this framework to three major domains of material\nculture: the structuring of space for collective action, the culturalization of the human body,\nand the emergence of exosomatic artefacts to store coded information. We argue that these\npractices did not merely externalise knowledge but progressively transformed material\nculture and environments into targeted epistemic infrastructures able to scaffold and amplify\ngroup-level performances characteristic of collective intelligence, thus shedding light on the\nevolution of human cognition and social organization.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how competitive authoritarian regimes reshape state administration through informal, extralegal structures that bypass formal institutional frameworks. While prior research highlights how regimes centralize power by restructuring bureaucracies and appointing loyalists, the formal institutional framework typically remains the main conduit through which partisan control and management of state administration are exercised. This article presents a distinct model of partisan control under competitive authoritarianism — showing how these strategies may be reinforced, or even replaced, by party-run parallel networks that redirect authority flows. Drawing on the case of Serbia under Vučić, it documents a “para-state” shadow governance system that displaces formal command. This model enables centralized, discretionary control across the entire public sector while shielding elites from accountability. Conceptually, the article argues that Serbia’s model blurs the line between competitive authoritarianism and totalitarian rule.",

These incidents illustrate how, under the guise of technical neutrality, AI can reinforce dominant narratives, amplify disinformation, and undermine dissent. Drawing on a recently proposed framework for AI regulation (Tomić &amp; Štimac, 2025), we show how failures across three dimensions—decision models, data sourcing, and interface semantics—create pathways for political manipulation and reputational harm.

          "authors": "Alice Daeun Oh; Tony Jiwon Oh; Seongeun Oh",
          "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine factors that improve life satisfaction for Korean adolescents. As the future generations of the country emerge, South Korea must increase its life satisfaction, a comparably low value compared to other countries, as they are ranked 23rd out of 38 OECD countries (Cho, 2021). Grit, defined as the trait of working diligently for long-term goals, is important for life satisfaction. This study examines the relationship between grit and life satisfaction for second-year high school students in South Korea and the mediating effects of crucial relationships formed by adolescents, such as teacher-student relationships, parent-child relationships, and friendships. The data was collected through the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), and there were 2,252 second-year high school students who participated in this study. By completing regression analyses on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, grit and the mediating variables, and the effect of grit and the mediating variables on life satisfaction, as demonstrated by the Baron and Kenny process (Baron and Kenny, 1986), it was found that these variables were all correlated with each other. On the third step of the regression analysis, where the mediators were controlled for, it was found that the mediators had a significant effect on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, and a partial mediation took place. Out of the mediators, teacher-student relationships had the biggest explanatory impact with an R-squared value of 0.177. From these results, it is evident that there needs to be interventions, potentially with grit involved, to increase relationships between teachers and students, parents and children, and friends.",

          "abstract": "What explains the enduring popularity of authoritarianism and authoritarian leaders? In addition to theories rooted in regime performance, propaganda, and punishment, I propose system justification, a well-established socio-cognitive motive favoring established systems and stability, as a novel explanation for authoritarian support. I theorize the relationship between system justification and political behaviors in authoritarian contexts and test this in data from two original surveys of Egyptian citizens. After validating that the system justification scale reflects needs for certainty and structure in an authoritarian political setting, I show it is strongly associated with preferences for authoritarian governance. An embedded experiment shows that security, infrastructure, and identity systemic threats mobilize high system justifiers, further increasing support for authoritarian governance. Finally, additional analyses reveal that system justification predicts attitudinal and behavioral support for a specific authoritarian regime. The findings suggest a central role for individual psychological motivation in authoritarian persistence.",

Despite the existence of off-the-shelf commercial qualitative data analysis software, there is a dearth of highly scalable open source options that can work with large data sets, and allow advanced statistical and language modeling. The foundation of the toolkit is a pragmatic approach that aligns research tools with social science project goals— empirical explanation, theory-guided measurement, comparative design, or evidence-based recommendations— guided by the principle that research paradigm and questions should determine methods. Consequently, the CMAP visualization toolkit offers a range of possibilities through the adjustment of relatively small number of parameters, and allows integration with other python tools.",

          "abstract": "The color of each cord is often highlighted as one of the primary sites of meaning on an Inka khipu -- the mostly undeciphered recording device of the Inka empire. However, while there are a variety of historical, ethnographic, and archaeological suggestions for how the semantics of color worked, none of these approaches systematically explains how Inka khipu cord colors denoted meaning. Instead, they present a range of fragmented, sometimes contradictory snapshots of a much larger, more complex system. This study aims to address the question: is there even a \"system\" of color that can be discovered and deciphered? If so, how did it work? Or is the sheer variety of uses discussed in prior studies an empirical indication that color had limited semiotic consistency for Inka khipukamayuqs (\"khipu makers/interpreters\" in Quechua)? To answer these questions, I employ an AI khipukamayuq -- a custom \"transformer\" deep learning model trained to parse all of the cord colors in the Open Khipu Repository (OKR) -- to analyze the semantic space of Inka khipu cord color. My findings reveal a coherent system of color signs, wherein different colors occupy distinct, relationally-opposed semantic domains, with many colors demonstrating polysemy. This suggests a versatile set of color signs adaptable to various contexts and domains of representation, akin to other linguistic media. In the domain of khipus and beyond, this study points toward the importance of continued interaction with AI models as archaeologists learn (together with machines) to systematically represent and delineate the past.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study anchors its analysis on the controversy surrounding Shanghai Maritime University's “First-Class Undergraduate Programs” initiative in China. It aims to validate whether AI-enhanced open-source intelligence (OSINT) evidence governance can reconstruct auditable evidence chains and quantify narrative discrepancies in education-related public incidents, while extrapolating governance performance to multidimensional national security risks. Methodologically, we collected university announcements, mainstream media reports, platform-accessible pages, and judicial leads within a unified time window to construct a “source-time-version” evidence graph. We introduced multilingual NLI and sentence vectors to measure narrative consistency, combined with JSD to monitor monitoring scope drift. We employed temporal propagation networks and DTW to measure the temporal misalignment between “post deletion/restriction” and public opinion peaks. Further, we mapped “evidence governance/information control opacity” to four normalized risk dimensions—academic integrity, rule of law and institutional trust, ideological security, and social stability—using structural causal models, providing 95% confidence intervals. Results indicate: The foundational evidence chain can be robustly reconstructed, yet significant narrative gaps exist regarding “whether ‘7 categories, 40 items’ of fraud occurred” and “whether platform actions were implemented/compliant.” Communication peaks typically precede search peaks by approximately one cycle (moderate DTW misalignment), with public nodes consistently holding the highest intermediary scores. Among the four risk dimensions, “academic integrity” and “ideological security” exhibit relatively higher levels. Conclusions indicate that earlier, auditable evidence disclosure (versioned notifications, third-party verification, platform log retention) simultaneously reduces all four risk dimensions and shortens the public opinion chain, whereas declarative statements alone fail to resolve disputes. AI-enhanced OSINT provides a reusable methodological pathway for evidence governance in educational settings and national security assessments.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Deepfake technology has quickly become one of the most disruptive new technologies in the digital information ecosystem. It can make convincing audio-visual content that looks just like real media.  Although much of the current research has looked at deepfakes from legal, technological, or ethical points of view, this article uses a psychological point of view to explain their particular potency.  The main point is that deepfakes don't work mostly as rational lies; instead, they work as cognitive exploits, types of \"perceptual malware\" that attack the way people trust each other.  The article illustrates how deepfakes exploit entrenched biases, such as the truth bias, familiarity effects, and the fluency of perceptual processing, by referencing cognitive psychology and neuroscience.  In doing so, they avoid higher-order logical inspection and use autonomic processes of recognition and belief construction.  The paper also puts deepfakes in the context of other research on false information and how memories can change, suggesting that fake media can create false memories or strengthen existing biases through repeated exposure.  Deepfakes undermine epistemic trust by eroding the dependability of visual and aural evidence, which have historically been regarded as the \"gold standard\" of credibility, in contrast to conventional kinds of propaganda. This situation not only puts democratic discourse and trust in the media at risk, but it also poses a serious psychological challenge: fighting deepfakes requires using cognitive and perceptual mechanisms that are mostly outside of conscious control.  This article provides an interdisciplinary framework for comprehending deepfakes as psychological weapons by integrating insights from cognitive science, information warfare studies, and emerging media research.  It suggests that protecting against this phenomenon necessitates treatments that transcend detection technologies, highlighting cognitive inoculation, media literacy, and the development of \"epistemic resilience\" in an age where visual evidence is increasingly distrusted.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines publications related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from Latin American and European countries, specifically focusing on whether the issues and challenges faced by these regions differ significantly. Latin American countries may be addressing region-specific health concerns or environmental challenges different from the European countries. A bibliographic universal classification of SDGs may overlook such crucial issues and nuances vital to the development of these countries. This study emphasises the differing priorities between Latin America and certain countries in the Global North regarding the health and well-being of all individuals. It focuses on improving reproductive, maternal, and child health, ending epidemics of major contagious diseases, reducing non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health and well-being, and addressing behavioral and environmental health risk factors. While Latin American countries often focus on topics like infections or mental health, the Global North tends to priorities Covid 19 and cancer. These differences reflect distinct economic, social, and political contexts, with us Global North sometimes overlooking the foundational needs of Global South countries. The research employs a sample from the Open Alex database, focusing on the ten most productive countries in Latin America and the ten most productive countries in Europe in SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being in the period of 2023-2024. The study, which falls under the framework of SDG 3 publications and employs data analytics techniques, identifies priority topics for Latin America and Europe, as well as common interests across both regions. Utilising predictive models based on machine learning, the study forecasts the topics that these countries are likely to prioritize in the near future with an accuracy of 60%. This level of accuracy may be influenced by the sample size used; therefore, future analyses will incorporate additional data, such as examining abstracts to determine whether European countries continue to diverge in their focus or if they find common ground on certain topics. This approach will provide valuable insights into regional priorities and the potential evolution of research related to the Sustainable Development Goals.

          "abstract": "This study assesses the accuracy of findings on self-rated health (SRH) and its demographic variation across gender, education, ethnicity, race, and age in non-probability surveys, evaluating their potential to advance research on health disparities.\nWe analyzed three NP surveys with extensive health measures: the Research and Development Survey 8 (RANDS-8), the Quota-based Population Health Survey (QPHS), and the Project Implicit – Health Survey (PI-H). These were benchmarked against the U.S. Census’s Current Population Survey (CPS) and compared with four probability-based surveys: NHIS, NHANES, GSS, and UAS. Data from 145,775 respondents aged 18 to 65, collected between 2021 and 2024, were included.\nNP surveys showed lower accuracy than probability surveys. However, NP surveys performed well on several benchmarks, including univariate SRH distributions (in RANDS-8 and QPHS) and bivariate and multivariate associations (e.g., age-SRH and education-SRH in RANDS-8 and QPHS, and Black race-SRH in PI-H). Yet, biases on other benchmarks were substantial, including overestimated gender-SRH associations in all NP surveys and strongly diverging disparities by race-ethnicity in RANDS-8 and QPHS.\nThese findings highlight both the promise and pitfalls of NP surveys, emphasizing the need for case-by-case validation against reliable benchmarks.",

          "authors": "Susanne Müller",
          "abstract": "Contrary to the growing emphasis on resilience in sustainability science, I argue that resilience continues to reflect a mindset of human–nature domination, and thus represents continuity rather than a real relational turn. Instead, I propose vulnerability as a critical mode of relation. Drawing on Robin May Schott’s ontological critique of resilience, I extend her arguments into the field of sustainability science by examining its ontological assumptions, primary discourses, and existing critiques. I advance a threefold plea: first, that reconnecting with nature requires a particular relational mode; second, that vulnerability is a necessary precondition for this mode; and third, that sustainability transformations may benefit from less emphasis on resilience. By combining rational argumentation with art-based, transdisciplinary approaches, this paper seeks to foster psychological reflection, new relational imaginaries, and ultimately more just sustainability transformations. I conclude by inviting readers to engage with their own vulnerabilities as part of this process.",

Using monthly employment data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I apply group-based multi-trajectory modeling to identify typical combinations of mothers’ and fathers’ full- and part-time employment over time (Nagin et al., 2016). I find eight distinct multi-trajectory groups. Five reflect traditional specialization, in which mothers partially or fully reduce their paid work for an extended period following childbirth, while fathers remain consistently employed full-time or increase their likelihood of full-time employment. The remaining three reflect less gendered patterns, including dual full-time, female full-time, and dual part-time groups. I examine how couples’ baseline characteristics are associated with multi-trajectory membership. Findings indicate that couples are more likely to specialize when only he holds tertiary education, whereas non-traditional patterns are more likely when only she or both partners are highly educated. The patterns differ across two periods marked by distinct policy contexts and between couples with mothers of East and West German background, even after 2007. The study contributes to our understanding how institutions, absolute and relative resources shape joint parental employment trajectories from a dynamic dyadic perspective.",

          "abstract": "Governments continue to face challenges integrating refugees into the local labor market, and many past interventions have shown limited impact. This study examines the Job-Turbo program, a large-scale initiative launched by the German government in 2023 to accelerate employment among refugees—primarily individuals from Ukraine and eight other major countries of origin. Using monthly administrative panel data from Germany’s network of public employment service offices and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program significantly increased both caseworker–refugee contact and job placements over a 23-month follow-up period. Among Ukrainian refugees, the exit-to-job rate nearly doubled. Effects were broad-based—spanning demographic subgroups, unemployment durations, skill levels, regions, and local labor-market conditions—and concentrated in regular, unsubsidized employment. The program also raised both the rate and share of sustained job placements, consistent with improved match quality. Other refugee groups saw meaningful gains as well, but increases in job placements were concentrated among males and in low-skilled jobs, with only limited effects for females. We detect no negative spillovers for German or other immigrant job seekers, finding no signs of either resource reallocation or displacement. The results offer insights for governments responding to displacement crises. They indicate that intensified job-search assistance---embedded within the early stage of integration and implemented at scale through public employment infrastructure---can meaningfully improve refugees' labor-market outcomes, even amid significant arrivals.",

As an increasingly important part of digital political information ecosystems in many countries, they have the potential to contribute to a more separatist or publicist orientation of digital counterpublics. This article analyzes the contextual conditions for the mainstream orientation of broader digital alternative news environments that form around the dissemination of alternative news content on social media. We draw on a network-analytical approach and more than 900 million social media posts shared on nine social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram, VKontakte, Reddit, Gab, and 4Chan) from 2019 to 2021 that have ties to right-wing, left-wing, or anti-system alternative news outlets based in four European countries (Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Sweden). Our findings indicate that the mainstream orientation of European digital alternative news environments is more pronounced in countries with a cordon sanitaire tradition in the political sphere, as well as in left-wing-oriented environments. The article adds to a growing body of research on the complex relationship between alternative news media and the mainstream by highlighting the importance of contextual conditions and the nature of the broader information environments in which alternative news content is circulated.",

On rare occasions when Bourdieu does attempt to explicate his knowledge of Gramsci through quotations, he does so hastily, vaguely and instrumentally. However, this does not imply that Bourdieu's postures and stances with respect to Gramsci's thought do not find expression within his own texts; on the contrary, they emerge precisely from the reticence, allusions and dissimulations. From here one can even explore a closeness underlying an apparent and declared detachment, to reflect on a disinterestedness that is actually interested. The analysis is thus based on an “against the grain” reading of the direct and explicit occurrences of Gramsci traceable in Bourdieu's texts, highlighting the space of their possible sociological implications and their tacit and implicit connotations.",

Utilizing the ArchMatNet agent-based model (ABM), we simulate the social behaviors of small-scale communities and their material culture production, enabling a comparative analysis of social and material culture networks. The networks were compared using a graph correlation method, and the underlying network structures were compared using ERGMs (Exponential Random Graph Models). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures. The findings highlight the potential of ABMs as a methodological tool in archaeology to explore and validate methodological tools.",

Racial thinking is exemplified in Aaron Panofsky’s observation that “one can believe that genes cause racial behavioural differences and also that science cannot substantiate that belief”. Race, I argue, is a  useful logical fiction.",

While supporters embrace the movement’s messaging around healthier lifestyles and nutritional choices, critics point to its political undertones and the widespread misinformation associated with it. To better understand the dynamics of public perceptions of the MAHA movement, our study leverages sentiment classification and topic modeling to analyze discourse about the movement on X. Our analysis reveals an interesting trend: although the movement initially generated overwhelmingly positive sentiment, overall positivity declined following the nomination and subsequent confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as President Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services to the point where negative sentiment began to outweigh positive sentiments. Further integration of such trends with topic modeling analysis suggests that while the public initially supported the ideals of healthier lifestyles promoted by the MAHA movement, enthusiasm diminished and eventually turned negative once the movement became entangled with political dimensions and controversial policies.",

          "abstract": "How does coethnicity shape host attitudes toward refugees? Existing research often assumes that refugees who share the ethnic or cultural background of host populations will face less backlash. We test this assumption in Pakistan, where both refugee and host communities include substantial Pashtun populations. Drawing on original survey experimental, observational, and qualitative data, we find that while coethnicity increases refugee acceptance on average, this result masks sharp internal variation. Coethnic hosts who live in provinces where they are ethnic minorities are far more likely to express inclusive attitudes than those living in their ethnic homeland. The impact of coethnicity therefore depends on local context: in settings where ethnic identity is politically salient and shaped by marginalization, coethnicity with refugees can carry both instrumental and symbolic value. These findings complicate standard assumptions about the primacy of cultural threat and underscore the need to attend to subnational variation in refugee-host dynamics.",

But When Prophecy Fails (1956), the now-canonical account of the event, claimed the opposite: that the group doubled down on its beliefs and began recruiting—evidence, the authors argued, of a new psychological mechanism, cognitive dissonance. Drawing on newly unsealed archival material, this article demonstrates that the book’s central claims are false, and that the authors knew they were false. The documents reveal that the group actively proselytized well before the prophecy failed and quickly abandoned their beliefs afterward. They also expose serious ethical violations by the researchers, including fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation.

          "abstract": "Governance is increasingly understood to be a complex system shaped by diverse actors. However, understanding of how these actors interact with the institutions and infrastructure systems in which they are embedded to drive change is still limited. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to understand factors shaping actors' political behavior and how power dynamics influence their ability to create change. This study addresses this gap by combining analysis of actors' narratives about water issues and governance with dynamical systems modeling of the socio-hydrologic system in the context of California's San Joaquin Valley. Through interviews and focus groups with growers, advocacy groups, and rural residents, distinct narratives emerge around water issues and power dynamics. Modeling strategies that would maximize each actor's water access reveals that existing structures incentivize strategies that would mainly benefit larger growers, and thus conflict with the goals of environmental justice narratives. Comparing these modeled strategies with actors' actual strategies also reveals disparities in different actors' ability to pursue the \"optimal\" strategy. These findings highlight how system structures entrench certain interests as well as the potential of narratives for shaping strategies aimed at long-term transformation.",

          "authors": "Amanda Welsh; Jenna Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Multiple jobholding (MJH)—the practice of maintaining more than one paid position simultaneously—is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by digital platforms, remote work normalization, and the expanding gig economy, which have all democratized access to diverse work opportunities. This expansion has altered the demographics of multiple job holders, shifting from predominantly low-wage workers seeking economic survival to include professionals across the income spectrum pursuing varied employment arrangements. Exploration of MJH has typically been dichotomized into two perspectives: those who view it as an unfortunate necessity forced upon the economically vulnerable and those who celebrate it as empowering \"side hustles\" that provide supplemental income and personal fulfillment. To examine workers' actual preferences and motivations, we fielded a survey (n=254) investigating whether workers actively desire MJH arrangements, whether financial considerations alone drive these preferences, and what other factors influence their appeal. Results revealed that workers across demographic groups express a genuine preference for MJH arrangements, transcending economic boundaries. While compensation remains important, workers value MJH for the flexibility and autonomy it provides. In contrast to the universal appeal of these characteristics, the youngest generation (Gen Z) is distinguished by significantly higher interest in using multiple roles to maintain different professional identities and build diverse networks (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest the emergence of what we term the \"Career Mosaic\"—a deliberate construction of professional identity through intentionally curated work experiences that together create a more complete expression of self. This shift from viewing careers as linear progressions to seeing them as multifaceted compositions among the next generation of workers has profound implications for employment policy, workforce development practices, HR technology, and organizational strategy, all of which were designed for a single-employer paradigm that may no longer reflect workers' evolving relationship with work.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) has emerged as a critical component of development practice, especially in African contexts where donor legitimacy and accountability are upheld by demonstrable quantitative impact. Typically seen as a technical endeavour, M&amp;E is frequently presumed to yield impartial, objective assessments of societal advancement. This paper contests that assumption by proposing a philosophical redefinition of M&amp;E as performative ritualism, a fusion of Judith Butler’s theory of performativity and Victor Turner’s anthropology of ritual. The analysis employs a critical conceptual methodology and normative critique. Butler's explanation of performativity shows how indicators and reports work not just as reflections but also as performative utterances that have an \"impact\" through their repeated use in rituals. Turner's ritual theory shows that evaluation cycles baseline, midline, and endline act as rites of passage, turning ambiguity into symbolic closure for funders and policymakers. Post-humanist insights further expand these frameworks, illustrating how dashboards, algorithms, and artificial intelligence tools now operate alongside human evaluators, reinforcing evaluative categories through automated repetition. The findings indicate the cultural and ethical conflict of these activities within African cultures. Western evaluation rituals focus on linearity, abstraction, and bureaucratic closure. In contrast, African communitarian ethics focus on relational accountability, oral testimony, and cyclical processes of responsibility. The difference shows how theatrical imported evaluative systems are; it also shows how to recreate ethics by thinking of evaluation as participatory storytelling and communal debate instead of a bureaucratic audit. The article finds that monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is not a neutral tool but a symbolic system that enacts legitimacy and authority. Thinking of M&amp;E as performative ritualism brings out its cultural and philosophical sides and makes room for hybrid models that mix computational tools with community-based, relational practices. The paper provides a novel framework for examining development evaluation in the algorithmic era, rooted in African ethical philosophy.",

          "abstract": "While existing research highlights the occupational advantages of citizenship for immigrants, little is known about how such advantages might vary, and previous studies have not fully dealt with issues of selection. We study the heterogeneous effects of naturalization by leveraging a novel historical dataset of naturalization records from New York City’s Southern District in the early 1900s. We link these to U.S. census data from 1920, 1930, and 1940, tracking 1,947 immigrants who declared their intent to naturalize, analyzing occupational trajectories among them, and modeling selection into naturalization using random forests. Our findings reveal that immigrants who completed the naturalization process attained significantly higher occupational status than those who initiated but did not complete naturalization. In addition, propensity-stratified results support a negative selection hypothesis: Immigrants less likely to naturalize enjoyed greater returns to naturalization, surpassing the unnaturalized in the high-propensity, more advantaged group. We support these results with supplementary analyses of full-count census data, where we find similar trends. These results underscore the role of naturalization as a key driver of socioeconomic mobility while highlighting citizenship as a critical stratifying force.",

In this regard, it is emphasized how the points of contact between some couples of interpretative categories of each-habitus and doxa, hegemony and common sense, respectively-might detect some paths of interaction. Essentially, by highlighting the commonalities and shared ground of the two conceptual universes, we seek to understand whether it is possible to refer to them in social research; and whether their intertwining can give rise to reformulations and developments of conceptual and epistemological devices, with a view to their use in social theory.",

          "authors": "Peter Odhiambo Ouma",
          "abstract": "People sometimes call social engineering the \"human factor\" in cybersecurity; however, this \nkind of language hides the underlying philosophical aspects of the issue. Instead of viewing \npersons as the most vulnerable component in technical systems, social engineering should be \nrecognised as a means of revealing the cultivation, maintenance, and exploitation of moral and \nintellectual inclinations within digital contexts. Current ethical frameworks predominantly \nexhibit deontological and utilitarian influences, prioritising adherence to regulations or the \noptimisation of favourable results. Although these frameworks possess practical applicability, \nthey inadequately represent the moral agency of individuals faced with deception. This essay \nconstructs a conceptual analysis that reinterprets social engineering within the context of \nDigital Virtue Ethics. Utilising Aristotle's notion of phronesis and MacIntyre's interpretation \nof practices, the argument underscores that effective resistance to manipulation relies more on \nthe cultivation of qualities such as wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice than on strict \ncompliance with laws. Insights from virtue epistemology, especially in the writings of \nZagzebski and Sosa, enhance this study by highlighting epistemic vigilance through \nattentiveness, humility, and conscientiousness. The amalgamation of these traditions facilitates \nthe emergence of Digital Phronesis: a distinctive form of practical wisdom tailored to the \ninherent unpredictability and persuasive dynamics of online existence. The important point is \nthat technical precautions and compliance procedures are necessary, but they are not enough \non their own. They need a philosophical framework that sees people as moral actors who can \ndevelop strong inclinations. From this perspective, social engineering is not just a technological \nviolation but also an affront to moral character and intellectual integrity. When you talk about \ncybersecurity in terms of virtue, you move away from the idea of the \"weakest link\" and make \nhuman agency the most important layer of defence.",

          "authors": "Meri Dankenbring",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread interest in the role of insurgent ideologies in civil war. However, the concept has been understood in a variety of ways, which are at odds with how ideology is conceptualised in political theory and election research. This results in fragmented theorising and a lack of systematic empirical insights. I argue that we should conceptualise ideology in a theoretically sound, and empirically measurable manner to enable quantitative research. Using a definition of ideology common in political science, I argue that we should reclaim the term extremism to theorise effects of insurgent ideologies. I conceptualise ideological extremity as an insurgent group's ideological distance to an average ideology. Instead of relying on ideology-specific arguments, this novel concept enables theorising and empirically studying the effect of extreme, compared to moderate ideologies in a generalisable way, allowing insights that are transferable to future ideologies. The concept maps onto a measurement model, enabling me to estimate insurgent's ideological extremity based on their manifestos.",

          "abstract": "The rise of citizenship stripping as part of a broader securitisation trend in the post-9/11 world has \nbeen frequently observed in public discourse and academic scholarship. Europe has been on the \nforefront of this trend with an increasing number of states since the early 2000s introducing \nregulations on security-based citizenship deprivation in national legislation, often allowing for \nsubstantial administrative discretion with few procedural safeguards. Remarkably, there is limited \nunderstanding of how new this phenomenon is and what the most common deprivation grounds are. \nIn this paper, we leverage new longitudinal data on the regulation of security-based citizenship \ndeprivation in 47 European states, going back to 1960. We identify two ‘waves of securitisation’, \nincluding an early wave focused on disloyalty in the 1970s and 1980s. After a liberalising period in \nthe 1990s, we observe a strong resurgence of security-related deprivation provisions. Closer scrutiny \nof the language deployed by deprivation provisions, confirms a discursive shift from concerns about \ndisloyalty towards state security",

          "abstract": "National research assessment policies, designed to boost international competitiveness, have intensified “publish or perish” pressures and reshaped the global academic publishing landscape. However, the impact of these pressures on the domestic publishing infrastructures of semi-peripheral nations remains underexplored. This paper investigates how a nation’s domestic publishing infrastructure shapes whether new, high-volume open-access publishing models function as a portfolio addition or a systemic substitute. Using a comparative mixed-methods analysis of Spain and Lithuania, we combine bibliometric data from the Web of Science (2004–2024) with 28 semi-structured interviews with researchers. The findings reveal two divergent, rational strategies. In Spain, a resilient domestic publishing infrastructure, accommodated by a flexible evaluation system, allowed researchers to adopt new publishers as a pragmatic portfolio addition to an already diverse set of options. In stark contrast, Lithuanian research assessment policies actively marginalised domestic journals, creating acute strain on the country’s publishing ecosystem. Researchers in Lithuania thus adopted these same new publishing models as a systemic substitute and a survival measure. We conclude that control over a community-managed domestic publishing infrastructure is a key factor shaping the autonomy of a national academic system. It is this infrastructure that separates a strategy of dependent displacement from one of autonomous coexistence: a crucial lesson for policymakers engaged in global research assessment reforms.",

          "abstract": "This paper analyzes joint employment trajectories of first-time parents in Germany from one year before to six years after the birth of their first child. Using monthly employment data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I apply group-based multi-trajectory modeling to identify typical combinations of mothers’ and fathers’ full- and part-time employment over time (Nagin et al., 2016). I find eight distinct multi-trajectory groups. Five reflect traditional specialization, in which mothers partially or fully reduce their paid work for an extended period following childbirth, while fathers remain consistently employed full-time or increase their likelihood of full-time employment. The remaining three reflect less gendered patterns, including dual full-time, female full-time, and dual part-time groups. I examine how couples’ baseline characteristics are associated with multi-trajectory membership. Findings indicate that couples are more likely to specialize when only he holds tertiary education, whereas non-traditional patterns are more likely when only she or both partners are highly educated. The patterns differ across two periods marked by distinct policy contexts and between couples with mothers of East and West German background, even after 2007. The study contributes to our understanding how institutions, absolute and relative resources shape joint parental employment trajectories from a dynamic dyadic perspective.",

          "authors": "Kazuhito Kitamura",
          "abstract": "Persistent macroeconomic imbalances, long‑run deflation, and entrenched inequality are often interpreted as outcomes of market incompleteness or failures. This paper offers an alternative perspective by developing a dynamic equilibrium framework for open economies that incorporates asset‑side mechanisms. Within this framework, and by re‑examining the transversality condition (TVC) as an asset‑valuation criterion, such persistent imbalances can emerge as structural outcomes of optimal behavior rather than anomalies. The model yields the relationship:Rt-ρ=n+Da-U(θa)/Uc; This relationship shows that the gap between the asset return (Rt) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the combined effects of capital diffusion (Da), population growth (n) and preference terms (U(θa)/Uc). This reinterpretation explains how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist, and frames equilibrium as a dynamic configuration shaped by interdependence across economies and agents, beyond the traditional price‑clearing mechanism. The results align theory with observed realities and offer tools for policy design, including structural selection of the steady state, policy control of capital flows, and asset‑dynamics‑based policy reconstruction. Furthermore, by formalizing a concept akin to “economic entropy,” this framework provides a pathway beyond quantitative equilibrium theory toward a richer understanding of qualitative development.",

This study analyzes a stratified sample of Library and Information Science publications to examine how citance segmentation and annotator expertise influence the consistency of classification. Using two annotators with different professional backgrounds, the findings show that agreement is high when citances are defined identically, but reliability decreases sharply once text boundaries diverge. Citance length, rather than subject category or citation density, emerges as the strongest predictor of disagreement. These results identify segmentation as a methodological rather than a purely technical issue, shaping both human and automated tagging outcomes. By highlighting the interplay between expertise effects and boundary definitions, the study underscores the need for clearer operational frameworks in citation analysis. The contribution lies in demonstrating that methodological refinements in citance identification are essential for improving reproducibility, enhancing hybrid human-machine approaches, and strengthening the validity of citation-based indicators in research evaluation.",

This paper develops a\nframework of regenerative governance, combining Meadows’ leverage points, Ostrom’s\ncommons, and post-growth ethics, to analyze enterprises as micro-governance experiments in\nsustainability transitions. Using four cases, a US family farm, Dutch start-up, UK cooperative,\nand an Ecuadorian cacao partnership, we examine how organizational forms intervene at\nsystemic levels by redesigning rules, feedbacks, and paradigms.\n\nCross-case analysis shows that family and partnership models often catalyze paradigm shifts,\nwhile cooperatives and entrepreneurial networks codify rules and incentives at scale. Together,\nthey illustrate regenerative enterprises as “living laboratories” of ethical innovation, embedding\nfairness, stewardship, and resilience into governance. The paper contributes by: (1) integrating\nsystems, commons, and post-growth theory into an operational governance lens; (2)\ndemonstrating how organizational forms activate distinct leverage points; and (3) advancing\npractice-oriented propositions for testing regenerative governance in food systems. By\npositioning regenerative enterprises as governance innovations, the paper reframes business\nstrategy not only as value creation but as systemic intervention, with implications for sustainable\nbusiness models. The findings suggest that small, place-based initiatives can prefigure systemic\ntransitions when nested in polycentric networks and supported by aligned incentives, pointing to\npathways for post-growth transformation.",

          "abstract": "Immigrants with higher levels of education tend to report more discrimination and a weaker attachment to their destination country than immigrants with lower levels of education. This so-called integration paradox is thought to occur because of two basic, mutually independent mechanisms: (1) highly educated immigrants more often experience unmet migration expectations, and (2) show stronger negative reactions when their expectations about their life abroad are not met. Existing research mainly focused on the first mechanism, and empirically tracing the second has been challenging due to a lack of evidence comparing less- and more-educated immigrants’ reactions over time. Here, we address this gap and examine how unmet migration expectations contribute to education-related differences in destination attachment. Using panel data on recent immigrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility Survey (N = 5,242 immigrants and 13,890 observations, 2016-2022), we assessed the extent of unmet expectations and associated disappointment through a question on dissatisfaction with the decision to migrate. Consistent with theory, we found that increasingly negative evaluations of pre-migration expectations were linked to reduced destination attachment, especially for immigrants with higher levels of education. These results suggest a fundamental mechanism for the emergence of the integration paradox, enhancing our understanding of immigrant integration.",

At the syntactic level, the extended idea that complements introduced by en are direct objects is refuted, and the possibility is noted of the alternation taking place with verbs that select an indirect object as their second argument. At the semantic level, it is concluded that the structure introduced by en describes a dynamic, durative, atelic event that entails agentivity.

It examines inequalities across intersections of social identities (e.g., gender, ethnicity, class) and is argued to provide more accurate predictions of intersectional means than conventional methods that estimate group means directly or via regressions with all interactions. This study evaluates that claim using analytic expressions and an empirical illustration to compare simple and MAIHDA-predicted means against population values. Predictive accuracy is assessed via variance, correlation, bias, and mean squared error. Results show that MAIHDA estimates generally outperform simple means, particularly when decomposing intersectional means into additive and non-additive identity effects. The magnitude of the advantage depends on inequality patterns and group sample sizes. MAIHDA is especially valuable when inequalities are subtle or data for marginalized intersections are sparse—conditions common in practice. These findings highlight MAIHDA’s practical relevance for quantitative intersectionality research.",

          "abstract": "Agroforestry adoption by smallholders globally has been limited despite long-term encouragement from national policies. In India, a dedicated agroforestry policy, combined with its potential to contribute to forest restoration goals, has led to a renewed emphasis on promoting the adoption of agroforestry practices among smallholders. However, the views of smallholders residing near forest fringes, who are often approached for adopting agroforestry as part of restoration plans, have not been extensively documented. Using surveys and interviews, we investigate the motivations for engagement and non-engagement in agroforestry for forest restoration among smallholder farmers in Chhota Udepur district, Gujarat. Our logistic regression model indicates that the results of agroforestry from fellow farmers and knowledge about government programs have a strong positive association with agroforestry engagement. In contrast, water availability and trust in government are negatively associated with engagement. Our interviews substantiate these associations and provide additional information about perceived risks. Specifically, water shortages and labour scarcity are significant barriers to smallholders considering the adoption of agroforestry. In all sampled villages, smallholders have emphasised a need for reliable markets for selling agroforestry produce. The mobilisation of sales through existing farmer producer organisations in the region presents an opportunity to increase agroforestry uptake among farmers. Additionally, we find that the impact of the national agroforestry policy has been limited; however, given smallholders’ preference for government programs, this trust can be leveraged to provide better financial and technical support. Overall, our study reinforces the finding that unless livelihoods are secured, engagement in restoration by smallholders is likely to remain limited, ultimately undermining the potential co-benefits of forest restoration to the most vulnerable.",

Community mindfulness moderator training can foster neutral non-judgmental awareness of all factors involved in public health decisions and health education efforts, including trustworthiness of sources, potential bias, and short term and long term implications. Five processes of community mindfulness theory are presented which include: Creating a neutral nonjudgmental state of mind for objective analysis of evidence; Fostering trust, common ground, and a safe environment for discussion; Incorporation of a social-ecological perspective; Addressing dimensional and long range perspectives; and Inclusion of mindfully-based social media.",

Existing research often assumes that refugees who share the ethnic or cultural background of host populations will face less backlash. We test this assumption in Pakistan, where both refugee and host communities include substantial Pashtun populations. Drawing on original survey experimental, observational, and qualitative data, we find that while coethnicity increases refugee acceptance on average, this result masks sharp internal variation. Coethnic hosts who live in provinces where they are ethnic minorities are far more likely to express inclusive attitudes than those living in their ethnic homeland. The impact of coethnicity therefore depends on local context: in settings where ethnic identity is politically salient and shaped by marginalization, coethnicity with refugees can carry both instrumental and symbolic value. These findings complicate standard assumptions about the primacy of cultural threat and underscore the need to attend to subnational variation in refugee-host dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of STI prophylaxis using doxycycline (aka DoxyPEP) amongst gay and bisexual men (GBMSM) has been positively received by healthcare professionals (Molina et al. 2018; Cornelisse et al. 2023; Leutkemeyer et al. 2023), community health organisations (Weil &amp; Nutland 2023), and community members (Holt et al. 2024). Alongside high acceptability, integrating DoxyPEP into clinical medicine has raised clear issues about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and complex disruption of the human microbiome (Bachmann et al. 2024). These issues present new challenges for community health research and practice, including refining existing HIV/STI prevention strategies and new methods for engaging communities in conversations about sustainable antibiotic use and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) (Broder 2020; Weil 2023, 2024). This paper brings together interviews with UK clinicians with scholarship on STI/HIV health promotion to consider how emergent use of DoxyPEP plays into the making of queer AMS. I demonstrate how clinicians establish links between microbiome health and generalised antibiotic consumption to construct AMS principles. Based on these principles, I consider what a queer AMS might look like for GBMSM, including social and ethical procedures for assembling safer sexual practices and deterring onward transmission of bacterial STIs (Davis et al. 2022). Building upon Davis et al.’s (2022) work, I argue that the assemblage of normative and non-normative use of DoxyPEP constitutes queer AMS through the negotiation of what I call a ‘threshold of acceptable STI transmission’. Attending to this threshold might allow healthcare practitioners to stay with social complexity (Law 2004; Haraway 2016) and multiply engage with sexual communities (Epstein 2022) to cultivate queer AMS. Finally, when sufficiently contextualised and localised within larger debates about AMR, queer AMS can enable new understandings of how GBMSM actively understand and/or contest biomedical power through negotiated safer sex practices.",

          "abstract": "The inclusion of affective-sexual and gender diversity is an ongoing challenge due to the persistence of negative attitudes. The educational context is a critical space where either prejudices may be perpetuated or egalitarian attitudes fostered. A crucial step for advancing the inclusion of sexual diversity is being able to measure this construct. For this, several authors develop, validate, or applicate instruments to assess attitudes toward sexual diversity in Education. The objective of the present study was to review this type of measures. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses follows the recommendations of PRISMA and APA’s standards. After the eligibility criteria were applied, 7 papers were included. The instruments were analyzed according to (i) their ability to capture subtle attitudes and the dimensions of diversity addressed; (ii) the context in which they were validated and their target population; (iii) their psychometric properties and methodological rigor. As result, it can be state that most of the instruments present some evidences of validity and reliability. In order to reduce social desirability and reactivity, the scales combine positively worded items, with the traditional use of negatively items. In addition, they incorporate more subtle expressions associated with modern prejudice. However, certain items may no longer effectively capture the subtle attitudes or evolution of language to more accurately name sexual diversity. In conclusion, it would be beneficial to address certain challenges, such as the generality of the items, the reactivity of old-fashioned-prejudice measures, and the need to accumulate further evidence to strengthen their psychometric properties.",

The analysis employed policy papers, corporate announcements, independent watchdog and scholarly outputs as sources and was triangulated on analytical case study practices. Three case studies were selected as illustrative examples as each reflected patterns of interest. Carbon offsetting is heralded as a solution to the climate crisis; in practice carbon offset projects often validate land dispossession and alienation, harm ecosystems, and exacerbate pollution through mitigation claims of neutrality. The Indian Railways' introduction of kulhad cups shown as an example of the process of \"symbolic\" policy wherein environmental costs are displaced as new costs emerge where the value of ecological virtue is claimed. The 'traceability' of the commodity chains of cobalt and lithium demonstrates the deliberate obfuscation of brands taking little, if any responsibility for the human and environmental costs of the so–called green transition.\nThe evidence implies that sustainability is now less a universal ecological principle and more a curated agenda for political legitimacy and corporate profit. Greenwashing, reliance on offsets, ignorance of Scope 3 emissions, and reliance on interventions that are yet to be proven as technically feasible, are a few standard tactics that disguise the ecological damage. Unless sustainability is reclaimed as a holistic framework that accounts for the ecological, social, and ethical, we have the potential to duplicate unsuccessful, false solutions while entrenching systemic inequity.",

          "authors": "Maxwell J Harrell",
          "abstract": "Human consciousness may represent a constructed neural interface rather than foundational cognitive architecture. This framework proposes consciousness as an emergent system that develops through subconscious absorption of environmental behavioral patterns and genetic interpretive processing. Preliminary evidence suggests infants demonstrate behavioral competence before developing reflective self awareness, indicating sophisticated unconscious systems preceding conscious interface construction. Neural timing studies consistently show unconscious decision initiation before conscious awareness, though interpretations remain debated. The proposed theory includes three hypotheses: temporal precedence of unconscious processing, environmental construction of conscious identity, and neural interface formation through absorbed behavioral patterns. This theoretical investigation addresses questions about cognitive architecture while acknowledging substantial empirical limitations requiring further research. Testing these predictions would advance understanding of consciousness architecture and unconscious processing mechanisms while informing methodological approaches across multiple psychological domains, regardless of whether the specific theoretical framework receives empirical support.",

          "authors": "Daniel McArthur",
          "abstract": "The emergence of mass higher education in high-income countries represents a profound social and economic transformation. There is much research investigating the consequences of an increasingly large population of degree holders for socioeconomic inequalities. However, despite rising regional inequality and income segrega?tion in many countries, sociologists have neglected the implications of the expansion of higher education for disparities between places. This paper examines inequalities\nin the geographical distribution of the degree educated from the 1980s to the present day across 17 high-income democracies using granular data from the newly-available Regional Human Capital Database (RHCD). Results show an increasingly unequal distribution of degree holders across places in all countries studied. Educational expansion appears to exacerbate existing inequalities, with faster growth in areas that already had highly educated populations. The paper provides a tentative  explanation of these trends, with evidence suggesting a role for sorting: the selective migration of highly educated individuals to already well-educated urban centers. These findings suggest that previous analyses of educational expansion have overlooked its’ highly disparate geographical incidence. They underscore the importance of examining sub-national geographies when assessing the the role that mass higher education plays in shaping inequalities.",

          "abstract": "Objective(s): Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into the legal system, raising questions about trust, fairness, and legitimacy in judicial decision-making. This study examined how professional identity, cognitive appraisals, and perceptions of fairness shape judges’ openness to AI.\nResearch Questions: Five questions guided the study: (1) Do different message framings (role enhancement, efficiency, neutral) influence judges’ trust, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and adoption intentions? (2) How do professional identity and prior experience with technology and AI shape evaluations and willingness to adopt AI? (3) How are procedural justice, legitimacy, and trust interrelated in predicting adoption? (4) Do judges differ in their levels of trust across legal contexts? (5) What concerns or reflections do judges express about AI in courtroom decision-making?\nMethod: A national sample of 317 judges (56.6% male, 41.1% female; M age = 60.41, SD = 10.24; 80.2% White, 8.4% Black, 3.4% Hispanic/Latinx, 2.7% Asian, 1.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, 1.9% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) was recruited through the National Judicial College. Judges were randomly assigned to one of three message framings. Measures included professional identity, trust in AI across eight legal contexts, perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitudes, procedural justice, legitimacy, and adoption intentions.\nResults: Role-enhancement framing significantly increased trust (η² = .02), perceived usefulness (η² = .06), and adoption intentions (η² = .04). Mediation analyses indicated that procedural justice predicted adoption indirectly through legitimacy and trust (indirect effect = .08, 95% CI [.05, .10]). Prior AI experience was the strongest predictor across outcomes (e.g., trust: β = .10, p &lt; .001; adoption: β = .37, p &lt; .001). Judges expressed higher trust in AI for research and educational tasks than for sentencing, bail, or parole.\nConclusions: Adoption of AI by judges depends on both functional evaluations (usefulness, familiarity) and normative judgments (fairness, legitimacy, identity alignment). Findings suggest that role-congruent framing, experiential training, and governance safeguards that emphasize fairness and transparency are critical for the responsible integration of AI into courts.",

          "abstract": "Early childhood is a critical period for the reproduction of social inequality. While extant literature focuses on socioeconomic background, less is known about the role of parents’ employment uncertainty, notwithstanding its significant presence in post-Fordist societies. We investigate the relationship between household employment uncertainty (HEU)— including temporary work and unemployment—and children’s cognitive and socio-emotional development, as well as their physical health. We leverage four waves of the nationally representative French Longitudinal Study of Children (ELFE). First, using OLS and Linear Probability Models, we find that the accumulation within the household and the persistence of HEU over time are both associated with lower cognitive development (up to -0.2 SD) at ages two and three and a half. Results for socio-emotional development are less robust, and physical health appears not to be correlated with HEU, possibly due to comprehensive healthcare. Second, we examine potential mechanisms using counterfactual mediation analysis. In line with the family investment and the family stress models, income and parental investment in cognitively-enhancing activities mediate the link with cognitive development, whereas parental stress mediates the association with socio-emotional development. Robustness tests include regression-with-residuals to account for other mediators and sibling birth as post-treatment confounders of the mediator-outcome link. Overall, HEU emerges as an important pathway in early inequality, calling for targeted policy.",

Im Rahmen der sozialwissenschaftlichen Begleitforschung wurden alle Bewohner*innen zwischen 2020 und 2023 zweimal zur Teilnahme an standardisierten Umfragen zu den Themen Wohnen, Quartier, Mobilität und Energie eingeladen. Ergänzend wurden drei qualitative Leitfaden-Interviews mit Bewohner*innen und eine Umfrage unter den Käufer*innen der Wohnungen (Investor*innen) durchgeführt.\nDas Klimakonzept der „Neuen Weststadt“ spielte für die Beurteilung der Wohnqualität durch die Bewohner*innen eine untergeordnete Rolle, im Alltag fielen die neuen Technologien weder positiv noch negativ auf. Es gab v.a. in der Anfangszeit Informationsdefizite bezüglich des Energiekonzepts des Quartiers. Diese führten jedoch nicht zu Akzeptanzproblemen.\nDie Bewohner*innen des Klimaquartiers sind grundsätzlich aufgeschlossen für Wasserstoff als Technologie zur Energiespeicherung. Das gilt auch für die Wasserstoffelektrolyse vor Ort im Wohnquartier. Die eigene Erfahrung im Klimaquartier fördert die Zustimmung zu dieser Technologie.\nMit der Wohndauer im Klimaquartier, wird das Bekenntnis zum Energiesparen stärker. Das Leben im Klimaquartier scheint ein höheres Umweltbewusstsein also eher zu fördern. Die Bewohner*innen interessieren sich für ihren eigenen Energieverbrauch, fühlen sich über diesen aber nicht gut informiert. Eine App mit Informationen zum eigenen Energieverbrauch wird von den meisten Bewohner*innen begrüßt.\nDie Bewohner*innen sind überwiegend jung, überdurchschnittlich hoch gebildet und beruflich erfolgreich. Sie haben ein ausgeprägtes Umweltbewusstsein, das sich jedoch nur eingeschränkt in ihrem Alltagsverhalten widerspiegelt. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie sind daher nur auf Quartiere mit ähnlicher demographischer Zusammensetzung übertragbar.",

          "authors": "Giacomo Lemoli",
          "abstract": "Language policy is focal in the relations between states and ethnolinguistic minorities, yet empirical evidence on its political effects is limited. Although accommodation of minority languages in state-mediated domains can be expected to favor national integration and reduce conflict, the implied delivery of cultural and material benefits along linguistic lines can empower ethnic parties and further policitize identities. I examine the 1986 linguistic reform in the Spanish province of Navarre, which divided the territory into three zones with different levels of normalization of the Basque language. Using Difference-in-Differences and Regression Discontinuity designs across zones, I find that the introduction of bilingualism in public institutions did not significantly alter Basque nationalist mobilization in the short run. However, support for Basque parties diverged markedly across zones from the late 2000s, suggesting that intergenerational identity realignments and the end of political violence by ETA catalyzed political change over the medium to long run. Consistent with this interpretation, the reform led to an increase in the share of candidates with Basque names in local elections. Overall, the reform appears to have affected political behavior and the making of social boundaries between linguistic groups by widening the constituency of voters with Basque identities rather than changing the behavior of pre-existing Basque speakers. Machine-learning analyses of thousands of streets and geographic names reveal that an important boundary-making process, the linguistic make-up of human geography, remains in part contested in communities at the language frontier.",

          "authors": "Emil Bakkensen Johansen; Nicole Milman-Doerr; Mathias W. Nielsen",
          "abstract": "While a growing sociological literature documents how visuality shapes collective identities, less attention is given to the temporal dimension of symbol construction and the shifting meanings and practices associated with prominent images and objects. We introduce the concept of momentary symbols to describe and examine processes where objects for a shorter period rapidly grow into a dominant symbol for a collective, but just as quickly acquire a less central symbolic role. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of this concept by tracing how umbrellas, lasers, and masks became central but temporally contingent visual symbols of Hong Kong’s protest movement, Anti-ELAB. Specifically, we use methods from computational sociology (including dictionary classification, object detection, and actor-network visualisations) and tweets about the 2019 Hong Kong protests (N = 1,615,832) to trace the provisional and unstable characteristics of Anti-ELAB’s visual expressions. Drawing on actor-network theory, we analyse objects and technologies as non-human actants that express protest and oppositional voices alongside humans. Results show that the three actants (umbrellas, lasers, and masks) oscillate between symbolic-visual and practical-confrontative translations during the protest period. Our study demonstrates the relevance of using processual and temporal approaches to capture the erratic and volatile nature of symbol construction processes.",

We\napply three forecasting methods: freeze rates, five-year extrapolation, and a nonparametric approach\nbased on historical first-birth probabilities. Results reveal the steepest increases in ultimate\nchildlessness among the lowest educated, approaching as high as 40% among low-educated women\nand 50% among low-educated men in some of the countries. Among the higher tertiary educated,\nchildlessness is overall lower and remains relatively stable. By contrast, men with lower tertiary\neducation show notable increases in childlessness, in some cases reaching levels similar to or higher\nthan those of upper-secondary-educated men. While overall childlessness in Denmark remains\nstable, it exhibits the fastest widening educational gap.

          "authors": "Jens Hainmueller; Moritz Marbach; Dominik Hangartner; Niklas Harder; Ehsan Vallizadeh",
          "abstract": "Governments continue to face challenges integrating refugees into the local labor market, and many past interventions have shown limited impact. This study examines the Job-Turbo program, a large-scale initiative launched by the German government in 2023 to accelerate employment among refugees—primarily individuals from Ukraine and eight other major countries of origin. Using monthly administrative panel data from Germany’s network of public employment service offices and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program significantly increased both caseworker–refugee contact and job placements over a 23-month follow-up period. Among Ukrainian refugees, the exit-to-job rate nearly doubled. Effects were broad-based—spanning demographic subgroups, unemployment durations, skill levels, regions, and local labor-market conditions—and concentrated in regular, unsubsidized employment. The program also raised both the rate and share of sustained job placements, consistent with improved match quality. Other refugee groups saw meaningful gains as well, but increases in job placements were concentrated among males and in low-skilled jobs, with only limited effects for females. We detect no negative spillovers for German or other immigrant job seekers, finding no signs of either resource reallocation or displacement. The results offer insights for governments responding to displacement crises. They indicate that intensified job-search assistance---embedded within the early stage of integration and implemented at scale through public employment infrastructure---can meaningfully improve refugees' labor-market outcomes, even amid significant arrivals.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Rosche",
          "abstract": "Coalition research increasingly emphasizes party-level explanations of coalition outcomes. However, this work does not account for the complex multilevel structure between parties and governments: many parties participate in multiple governments and governments often comprise multiple parties. In this paper, I show that this crisscrossing structure creates dependencies among observations both across and within governments. If ignored, these dependencies produce downward-biased uncertainty estimates that cluster-robust standard errors fail to fully correct. To address this issue, I then introduce a model that extends the Multiple Membership Multilevel Model to represent the multilevel structure of coalition government data. The model accounts for party-level dependencies across governments through party-specific effects in each coalition they join, and for dependencies within governments by representing the total party effect on a government as a weighted sum of its members’ contributions. By allowing party weights to vary with covariates describing their interrelationships, the model enables researchers to examine the interdependent nature of coalition outcomes. I validate the model through simulation and an empirical application to coalition government survival, showing that ignoring party-level dependencies can produce misleading conclusions at all levels of analysis. The model is estimated via Bayesian MCMC and implemented in the accompanying R package ‘bmlm’.",

Evidence on prevalence and determinants of RSIs in Bangladeshi handloom workers is limited. Objective: To determine the prevalence, anatomical distribution, and predictors of upper extremity RSIs among handloom weavers in Tangail district. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 303 male handloom workers in Pathrail Union, Delduar Upazila. Data were collected via structured interviews and the Standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Socio-demographic, occupational, and ergonomic factors were assessed. Logistic regression identified independent predictors of RSIs. Results: The prevalence of RSIs was highest in the neck (60.7%), shoulders (56.8%), and wrists (55.8%). Repetitive movements ≥4 hours/day, awkward posture, prolonged working hours, low income, and limited education were independently associated with RSIs. Prevalence increased with years of experience: 58.7% (&lt;10 years), 72.2% (10–20 years), and 85.9% (&gt;20 years). Severe cases often required job modification and had multi-site involvement. Conclusion: Upper extremity RSIs are highly prevalent among Bangladeshi handloom workers, reflecting a combination of ergonomic strain and socio-economic vulnerability. Interventions targeting workplace ergonomics, work hours, and socio-economic support are essential to safeguard worker health and sustain the handloom sector.",

While existing scholarship has largely examined philanthrocapitalism as an ideology, relatively little attention has been paid to how funders themselves understand and engage with these approaches. This paper addresses this gap through an exploratory qualitative study of 28 UK funders. Using written interviews, sentiment analysis, and thematic coding, the study identifies four recurring themes in funder perspectives: pragmatic adoption, loyalty to traditional grantmaking, contextual constraints, and resistance to the term “philanthrocapitalism” itself. By foregrounding funder perspectives, this paper provides a first exploration of how philanthrocapitalism is operationalised in the UK context and highlights implications for philanthrocapitalists and sector practitioners regarding opportunities for sector training necessary for effective adoption of philanthrocapitalist approaches.",
