          "authors": "Simona Bisiani; Agnes Gulyas; Bahareh Heravi",
          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel computational framework for defining local news outlets through their geographic coverage patterns. This approach addresses the growing disconnect between legacy spatial markers (e.g., newsroom location or circulation cut-offs) and the geographic dimension of news coverage in an era of media consolidation and digital transformation. We develop a four-step pipeline consisting of data sampling, geoparsing, feature engineering, and clustering analysis. Our approach employs large language models for toponym disambiguation and develops eight spatial metrics across four dimensions: spatial extent, administrative reach, spatial heterogeneity, and distance decay. We test this pipeline on a sample of more than 465,000 articles from 360 UK digital local news outlets. Clustering analysis of more than 1.3 million locations reveals six distinct outlet types—ranging from hyperlocal and metropolitan to national outlets—reflecting different scales and structures of news provision in the UK’s evolving media landscape. The method offers a scalable, open-source approach for mapping local news coverage, with implications for media geography and policy, ownership studies, and the computational humanities.",

          "abstract": "Various academic stakeholders are currently exploring narrative curriculum vitae (CV) in funding and recruitment to address research culture concerns. In a recent pilot using a randomised controlled trial (RCT), we asked applicants to submit both a standard and a narrative CV when applying to postdoctoral positions at the University of Cambridge, with panel members randomly assigned one format for initial evaluation and ranking. Here, we use this ranking data to develop a multi-layered generative model that simulates different recruitment scenarios by systematically varying the model’s parameters. We analysed the results using a Bayesian Thurstonian model for the analysis of ranked data from multiple raters to test whether parameters were correctly recovered and how the change in parameters affected the uncertainty around model estimates. The results from this process were used to inform the design of the main phase implementation of the pilot study design in a larger sample.",

          "abstract": "Open science initiatives have gained traction in recent years. However, open peer-review practices, i.e., reforms that (i) modify the identifiability of stakeholders and (ii) establish channels for the open communication of information between stakeholders, have seen very little adoption in economics. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and desirability of such reforms. We present insights derived from survey data documenting the attitudes of 802 experimental/behavioral economists, a conceptual framework, a literature review, and cross-disciplinary data on current journal practices. On (i), most respondents support preserving anonymity for referees, but views about anonymity for authors and associate editors are mixed. On (ii), most respondents are open to publishing anonymized referee reports, sharing reports between referees, and allowing authors to appeal editorial decisions. Active reviewers, editors, and respondents from the US/Canada are generally less open to transparency reforms.",

          "abstract": "Across both living and non-living systems, a wide range of phenomena—from enzymatic reactions and neural adaptation to thermal relaxation and radioactive decay—exhibit saturating response behaviors. In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Most people are interested in improving themselves, but they show less interest in improving on moral traits. Why don’t people particularly want to be more moral, and why do people prioritize improving certain traits more than others? Across four preregistered studies of U.K.-based CloudResearch (NStudy 1 = 252; NSupplemental = 110) and Behavioral Research Lab (NStudy 2a = 303, NStudy 2b = 301) participants, we test four classes of explanations. Results rule out explanations based on the ideas that moral traits are seen as more difficult to change and as either more or less causally central. Instead, people are less interested in moral improvements because they believe (a) that they are already highly moral and (b) that nonmoral improvements would more effectively improve their happiness and goal attainment. These results clarify the perceived tradeoffs between well-being and morality and show that personal well-being is a central motivation for personality change.",

          "authors": "Paul Mark Jenkinson; Gerardo Salvato; Michela Bassolino; Maddalena Beccherle; Greta Vianello; Aikaterini Fotopoulou; Gabriella Bottini; Valentina Moro",
          "abstract": "Physiological regulation is critical for survival. Interoception (the ability to sense internal body state) is a key mechanism by which allostasis (the proactive adjustment of physiological systems) is achieved to maintain physiological stability. Because of the crucial role of the central nervous system in these functions, studying the effects of brain damage can enhance knowledge of these processes. This scoping review synthesises empirical evidence on how stroke affects interoceptive functions and allostatic load (the long-term “cost” to the body of maintaining the internal milieu), and whether these disruptions relate to stroke outcomes, recovery, and specific neural substrates. We reviewed 39 studies examining interoceptive abilities or allostatic load in stroke patients. Only one study assessed allostatic load directly, highlighting a major gap in the literature. Results indicate that stroke frequently impairs interoception across multiple domains, including cardiac and respiratory awareness, affective touch, temperature perception, hunger, and fatigue. These impairments are often linked to poorer functional outcomes, including reduced recovery, cognitive dysfunction, and altered body awareness. Insular and somatosensory lesions were most commonly associated with interoceptive deficits, though lesion mapping was inconsistently reported. Findings from a single study suggest that allostatic load may exacerbate post-stroke cognitive decline and health disparities, particularly in high-risk populations. We conclude that stroke disrupts internal bodily regulation in ways that likely affect recovery trajectories, yet systematic research into the interoceptive and allostatic consequences of stroke is nascent. Future research should prioritise mechanistic studies, standardised assessments, and targeted interventions to address interoception-related physiological dysregulation in stroke rehabilitation.",

          "authors": "Maria D Soto; Ulrich Schimmack",
          "abstract": "The replication crisis heightened interest in methods for assessing the credibility of published research. One approach to evaluate published results is to estimate the average power of original studies based on observed data. Recent criticisms, however, have challenged the validity and usefulness of this approach, arguing that it involves a fundamental \"ontological error,\" fails to predict replication outcomes accurately, and yields imprecise estimates. This article aims to address these critics. We clarify that using observed data to estimate true power is a standard inferential practice and does not constitute an ontological error. We argue that the primary purpose of average power estimation is not to predict the outcome of future replication studies, but the hypothetical outcome if original researchers had to replicate their studies with new samples. Lastly, we demonstrate that even when uncertainty is substantial, average power estimates provide valuable diagnostic information about the credibility of literatures, especially when selection for significance is present. An applied example using a Z-curve analysis of terror management research shows that seemingly strong evidence of over 800 significant results does not rule out the possibility that all results are false positives. We conclude that, despite limitations, average power estimation remains a valid and useful tool for evaluating the evidential value of published research.",

          "abstract": "Economic hardship is known to shape children’s self-regulation, yet little is understood about how fluctuations in hardship unfold over time and whether different patterns of unpredictability carry unique developmental consequences. Using a socioeconomically diverse sample, we tracked families’ subjective economic hardship across 15–36 monthly assessments and applied an environmental statistics framework to quantify four indices of unpredictability: changepoints in mean, changepoints in variance, coefficient of variation, and noise. Principal component analysis revealed two distinct dimensions of economic unpredictability: systematic instability (frequent but predictable hardship fluctuations) and dynamic variability (infrequent but abrupt shifts in hardship). Economic unpredictability was disproportionately experienced by racially minoritized and lower-income families, reinforcing systemic inequities in economic resources. Relations between these indices and caregiver-reported measures of family routines and day-to-day unpredictability were weak, suggesting wide heterogeneity in the ways families adapt to economic unpredictability. Leveraging propensity score methods, we isolated the effects of unpredictability from hardship severity, finding that they predicted greater self-regulation challenges in early childhood, with the strongest effects for hardship severity. These findings underscore the importance of capturing economic hardship as a dynamic and multidimensional experience, with implications for policy efforts aimed at promoting stability in families’ access to resources.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces \"pseudo-consciousness\" as a novel framework for understanding and classifying advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems that exhibit sophisticated cognitive behaviors without possessing subjective awareness or sentience.\n\nTraditional AI classifications often rely on a binary distinction between narrow, task-specific AI and hypothetical artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, this dichotomy fails to adequately address the growing number of AI systems that demonstrate capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and self-monitoring, yet lack any demonstrable inner experience.\n\nWe propose pseudo-consciousness as an intermediate category, bridging the gap between reactivity and genuine consciousness. We also define five operational conditions that characterize pseudo-conscious AI: Global Information Integration (GII), Recursive Metacognitive Correction (RMC), Cross-Domain Transfer Competence (CDTC), Intentionality Simulation Without Subjectivity (ISWS), and Behavioral Coherence Across Domains (BCAD).\n\nThese conditions, grounded in computational functionalism, cognitive science, and neuroscience, provide measurable criteria for differentiating pseudo-conscious systems from both simpler, reactive AI and speculative AGI.\n\nThe framework offers a structured approach to evaluating AI based on how it achieves complex cognitive functions, rather than solely on what tasks it can perform. This distinction is crucial for addressing the ethical, societal, and regulatory challenges posed by increasingly autonomous AI.\n\nBy recognizing pseudo-consciousness as a distinct and stable category, we can better inform AI design, governance, and public discourse, ensuring responsible development and deployment of AI systems that mimic aspects of cognition without possessing genuine consciousness. The framework facilitates a more nuanced understanding of AI capabilities, moving beyond simplistic \"conscious\" vs. \"unconscious\" classifications.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Schmetterling–NBI Program, a creative behavioral intervention designed to address food selectivity in young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), characterized by food refusal and limited dietary variety. The program integrates established behavioral strategies with innovative components, including imitation chaining, shaping, and therapist–guided exoskeleton modeling. Three children diagnosed with ASD (YY, RR, and JJ) participated in a single–case experimental design conducted at home. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition (CARS-2) was used to assess the severity of autism symptoms, while the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) measured changes in eating behaviors. Results from the Tau-U statistical analysis indicated substantial increases in food acceptance across all participants, with the highest improvements observed in food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, and food fussiness. Although CARS-2 scores remained within the severe classification range, notable percentile reductions suggested clinically relevant improvement in core autism symptoms. These findings support the Schmetterling–NBI Program as an individualized, evidence–based approach to enhancing dietary diversity and reducing maladaptive feeding behaviors in children with ASD, contributing to the growing body of literature supporting early, personalized behavioral interventions.",

However, this characterization may be an oversimplification due to the cultural diversity that exists within the country. Four studies (N = 1,537) examined whether perceived strength of norms vary by racial group. U.S. racial minorities (East Asian, Latinx, and African Americans—but not White immigrants to the U.S.) perceive their racial community’s norms to be significantly stronger than European Americans (Studies 1-4). This difference was not due to increased perceived discrimination (Study 3). Instead, racial minorities’ stronger perceptions of community norms were motivated primarily by interdependence (Studies 1-4) and concerns about being punished by ingroup members for not following norms (Study 4). These findings illustrate differences in norm strength between racial groups in a single country, deepening our understanding of how social norms may vary in a multicultural society.",

          "abstract": "The phenomenon of highway hypnosis demonstrates how repetitive visual and sensory input can alter consciousness and fragment temporal awareness, typically resulting in lost time and reduced conscious control. Building upon this established paradigm, I propose a theoretical framework suggesting that repetitive auditory stimuli can induce the opposite temporal effect - subjective acceleration of time perception rather than temporal fragmentation. While highway hypnosis involves monotonous visual-kinesthetic repetition leading to \"transient amnesia, trance, hallucinations, decreased vigilance\" (Zhang et al., 2023), structured auditory repetition may produce controlled temporal acceleration through distinct neurological mechanisms involving neural entrainment and oscillatory phase dynamics. This paper presents theoretical foundations for auditory-mediated temporal manipulation, drawing from recent research showing that auditory and visual stimuli produce opposite distortions in interval timing perception (Yamamoto &amp; Miura, 2015) and evidence that \"oscillatory neural entrainment reveals segregation of function at different scales\" in temporal processing (Doelling et al., 2017). I argue that this represents a novel approach to consciousness alteration with significant practical applications in therapeutic intervention, performance enhancement, and temporal cognition research.\n\nKeywords: temporal perception, auditory processing, time dilation, highway hypnosis, consciousness, repetitive stimuli, neural entrainment, oscillatory entrainment",

LADDERS is a manualised, parent-led graded exposure intervention developed to reduce anxiety-related avoidance in this underserved group. Methods: A proof-of-concept study was conducted using a single-case experimental design (SCED) with non-concurrent multiple baselines. Six families completed the 16-week LADDERS intervention, which was primarily delivered online by an Assistant Psychologist under clinical supervision. Primary outcomes were recorded through daily caregiver diaries. Secondary outcomes included behavioural observations, teacher ratings, standardised questionnaires, and qualitative interviews. Results: All participants completed the full intervention. Four of the six children showed reductions in daily-rated anxiety. Non-overlap of all pairs (NAP) analyses indicated moderate to large effects in the final intervention phase for most participants. Five children progressed through their graded exposure steps without significant increases in observed anxiety. Qualitative interviews highlighted improvements in child participation, parental confidence, and understanding of anxiety. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: The LADDERS intervention was feasible to deliver and acceptable to families, with early signals of impact. These findings highlight the potential value of further investigation to explore the intervention’s impact and longer-term outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The study of human behavior has shifted in the last fifteen years, with increasing reliance on opt-in non-probability online data sources. We offer an analysis of nine such data sources (total N = 13,053), aiming to inform researchers conducting experiments or correlational studies. We assess response validity (attentiveness, effort, honesty, speeding, and attrition), the extent to which samples represent the underlying population (observable demographics, measured attitude representativeness, and responding to experimental treatments), and professionalism (number of studies taken, frequency of taking studies, and modality of device on which the study is taken). We document substantial variation across these samples on each dimension. Samples that employ demographic quotas display relatively higher amounts of representativeness across multiple indicators (beyond demographics) but often exhibit less response validity. However, the inclusion of two attention checks early in a study enhances response validity without negatively impacting representativeness. We offer guidance for choosing opt-in samples, depending on the purpose of the research and resource constraints.",

          "abstract": "According to current recognition memory theories, a major source of confusion when people judge which stimuli they remember is the contextual similarity of those stimuli to those from the studied list. However, these theories overlook the potential for confusions to arise from item-intrinsic memorability properties – namely, the likelihood that a stimulus will be correctly recognized if studied (“hittability”) or falsely recognized if not (“false-alarmability”) – independent of contextual similarity. Here, we introduce a memorability continuum model, which predicts that differences in the individual “hittability” and “false-alarmability” of arbitrary items A and B can often lead to asymmetric recognition performance in a forced-choice task such that recognition of target A over foil B is more accurate than recognition of target B over foil A. Our model successfully predicted specific item pair asymmetries that context-based inter-item similarity could not explain, highlighting the need to integrate item-level memorability into existing recognition memory theories.",

          "abstract": "REM sleep is considered a ‘hyperassociative’ state enhancing the connections between weakly related concepts, thereby facilitating memory restructuring — a critical process proposed in creative problem-solving. Here, we empirically explore this hypothesis by testing participants on a riddle before and after a 90-minute incubation period including only NREM sleep, REM sleep, or wakefulness. We quantified memory restructuring by computing differences in problem-related semantic memory network (SemNets) properties between pre- and post-incubation. For each sleep stage, we extracted fine-grained EEG measures linked to cognitive richness. REM sleep, compared to wake, broadly facilitated problem-related word associations but also reshaped the dominant problem representation by combining semantically remote concepts in memory or reducing strong but solution-irrelevant associations of ideas. Such REM sleep-related restructuring was associated with EEG measures indexing a richer cognitive state. While REM drove memory restructuring, it alone did not boost problem-solving success, suggesting that additional processes are necessary for creative breakthroughs.",

However, when successfully resolved, it can also stimulate cognitive flexibility and adaptation. This raises a question: Can cognitive conflict positively influence subsequent cognitive processes and human behaviour, or is it inherently deleterious? We designed three independent experiments to investigate behavioural changes after congruent and incongruent Stroop items in speeded motor reactions, response inhibition and implicit memory retrieval. Results revealed that cognitive conflict had a beneficial impact selectively on response inhibition, while no impact was observed on speeded responses or memory. Our studies highlight the positive consequences of cognitive conflict in boosting human cognition and behaviour, beyond the classic conflict adaptation, but only when both tasks involve conflict.",

          "abstract": "Food preparation plays a key role in shaping how people perceive meat: It helps people to dissociate meat from its animal origin and allows them to eat meat without experiencing conflict. However, experimental research in this area mostly disregards or confounds two food preparation steps: disassembling and cooking. To test how disassembling and cooking affect perceptions about meat dishes, we conducted secondary analyses of a sample of omnivores from a U.S.-representative dataset (N = 1,189). In this study, participants indicated meat perceptions (self-report) in response to a picture of one meat dish that varied in the degree of disassembling (i.e., whole parts vs. chopped/minced) and cooking (i.e., raw vs. cooked). Leveraging this experimental setup, multi-level analyses revealed that disassembling and cooking reduced compassion elicited by meat dishes. Disassembling also decreased general emotional arousal, while cooking reduced negative evaluations, conflict experiences in felt ambivalence, and specific negative emotions such as disgust and anger, while increasing valence perceptions more generally. Moreover, psychological network analyses showed that the relations of meat-related perceptions with each other do not differ significantly between food preparation steps. By offering nuanced insights into how food preparation affects conflict experiences as well as other affective and attitudinal meat-related perceptions, this research offers various theoretical and  practical implications. We therefore discuss key considerations for future research on meat-related perceptions and identify when and which interventions may be most necessary and effective in encouraging reduced meat consumption.",

          "abstract": "Political ideology is key in how we react to social and political events, but how does it predict moral judgments of online hate? The contextual symmetry hypothesis suggests that conservatives and liberals condemn online hate similarly when it targets ideologically favored groups. The generalizable asymmetry hypothesis proposes that conservatives, compared to liberals, are less condemning of hate comments regardless of the target. In pre-registered experiments in Germany (N = 903) and the U.S. (N = 490), we found consistent evidence for the contextual symmetry account: Conservatives and liberals differ in their sensitivity towards online hate depending on the target and ground their moral judgments on perceptions of the aggressor's responsibility and the victim's vulnerability and suffering. These findings imply that legal stalemates on hate speech regulation stem from ideological disparities in perceptions of who must be protected from harm rather than a general conservative indifference to online hate.",

In contrast to the commonly employed psychometric approaches that are used from the construct validity theory perspective, studying validity with NRMs allows claims of validity that are based on understanding of how a measurement instrument works. They were designed to be simple to use but epistemologically potent, contributing to conceptual clarification in an epistemic iteration framework. NRMs can be developed using expert knowledge, synthesis of theory and evidence, or inductive approaches. Once developed, NRMs can guide validation efforts using cognitive interviews, response process evaluation, experiments, or computational modeling, in an iterative process comprising adaptation of an item, construct definition, and the NRM connecting both.\n\nNRMs answer the call to again align “validity” with the common-sense definition: whether a measurement instrument measures what it was designed to measure.",

The present study investigates the relationship between mental imagery vividness and memory accuracy, with a focus on age-related and modality-specific effects, and relationships with confidence. Using a novel experimental procedure, young and older participants memorised objects within scenes and later identified whether specific changes had occurred. Results indicated that while trait-level and averaged measures of vividness did not predict memory accuracy, trial-by-trial state measures were significantly related to subsequent performance. Additionally, results provided evidence that mental imagery may relate to visual aspects of memory more than spatial aspects. Older adults reported higher vividness ratings but performed worse on average than young adults. Confidence and vividness were highly correlated but remained distinct subjective experiences. Re-analysis of an existing related dataset involving people with aphantasia confirmed state-level findings regarding vividness and memory accuracy, highlighting limitations of previous research relying on averaged and trait-level measures. Results identify the need for future research to analyse vividness on a trial-by-trial basis to appropriately investigate the relationship between mental imagery vividness and memory accuracy.",

Methods: A proof-of-concept study was conducted using a single-case experimental design (SCED) with non-concurrent multiple baselines. Six families completed the 16-week LADDERS intervention, which was primarily delivered online by an Assistant Psychologist under clinical supervision. Primary outcomes were recorded through daily caregiver diaries. Secondary outcomes included behavioural observations, teacher ratings, standardised questionnaires, and qualitative interviews. Results: All participants completed the full intervention. Four of the six children showed reductions in daily-rated anxiety. Non-overlap of all pairs (NAP) analyses indicated moderate to large effects in the final intervention phase for most participants. Five children progressed through their graded exposure steps without significant increases in observed anxiety. Qualitative interviews highlighted improvements in child participation, parental confidence, and understanding of anxiety. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: The LADDERS intervention was feasible to deliver and acceptable to families, with early signals of impact. These findings highlight the potential value of further investigation to explore the intervention’s impact and longer-term outcomes.",

          "abstract": "A psychological network approach enables studying psychological phenomena as networks of interacting elements by utilizing network psychometrics. This approach is gaining increasing popularity in different domains of empirical psychological research such as clinical and social psychology. Simultaneously, a scientific debate emerged on the added value and application of employing such an approach. The current paper contributes to this debate by providing an applied perspective on designing empirical studies that employ a psychological network approach and does so based on best practices in previous empirical psychological research. With a practical framework, we aim to support researchers who want to employ a psychological network approach to mitigate potential criticism in the design phase of their study. The framework can be summarized in three iterative steps. This paper describes each step in detail, including illustrative examples and practical considerations. First, researchers are recommended to evaluate their argumentation for adopting a psychological network approach and whether this is the best approach for their research aim. This approach is suitable for aims ranging from descriptive accounts of complex survey data to testing hypotheses about the network’s structure.  Second, researchers should carefully evaluate which variables the psychological network should contain. Such decisions should be informed by previous research (e.g., theoretical frameworks). Third, researchers should consider which research design and type of data are optimal to answer their research questions as different designs provide different insights. Adopting a psychological network approach in accordance with the framework presented in this paper can further advance empirical psychological research.",

          "abstract": "How are motor activities linked to their perceptual outcomes? We here test the idea that the storage and retrieval of action-effect linkages is subject to constraints of associative memory. Specifically, we argue that mutual interference between such linkages should favor the storage and retrieval of unique (one-to-one) action-effect linkages as compared to overlapping (one-to-many) action-effect linkages (uniqueness effect). Moreover, we assume that increasing the number of repetitions of action-effect episodes facilitates learning and is modulated by this uniqueness effect. In three experiments, participants first produced certain visual effects through motor activities, and were later asked to retrieve the activity that had produced a certain probed visual effect before. For the most part, retrieval performance increased with unique as compared to overlapping action-effect linkages and with increasing number of action-effect repetitions, while repetition had a slightly larger influence with unique as compared to overlapping action-effect linkages. We discuss these results against the backdrop of associative and episodic retrieval accounts of learning.",

The present study introduces the Dark Creativity Deception Battery (DCDB), a novel task-based assessment designed to measure creative deception across prosocial, self-serving, and antisocial contexts. Participants (N = 755) were recruited from India, USA, and Austria. They completed several self-report measures and a series of deception tasks in which they generated novel and deceptive ways to address a series of vignettes. Responses were assessed across seven parameters: creativity, moral valence, goal-directedness, deception, virtue caveat, fluency, and flexibility.  Results indicated that younger individuals, lower moral disengagement, and higher negative affect were associated with creative responses in prosocial contexts. In contrast, higher trait deceptiveness and lower income were associated with self-serving and antisocial lies. Moral valence varied across tasks, with prosocial deception rated most positively. Interestingly, high psychopathy was associated with moral justifiability in self-serving deception. Deception itself was highest in antisocial and self-serving contexts, coupled with high individualizing morality, suggesting moral licensing effects. Our findings highlight the interplay between morality, personality, and creativity in deceptive behavior. The DCDB offers a novel way to study creative deception beyond traditional measures. Limitations and future scope are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and ``utilitarian'' cost-benefit reasoning (CBR). Here, we show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people's reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total N=2328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "While social interactions and actively chosen solitude both contribute to well-being, existing measures focus solely on one dimension. We developed the Social experiences' daiLy Occurrence (SOLO) scale—a brief end-of-day diary measure capturing enjoyment of social interactions (including brief encounters with \"weak ties\") and solitude experiences. Two validation studies were conducted: single-day (N=203) and 14-day (N=75) assessments. The final SOLO consists of 13 items forming two scales: \"Being with others\" and \"Being alone\". Both scales demonstrated adequate psychometric properties and meaningful relationships with well-being measures. The scales were independent, supporting conceptualization of social enjoyment and solitude preference as distinct dimensions. The SOLO's brief format offers a practical compromise between ecological momentary assessment and retrospective measures.",

          "authors": "Benjy Barnett; Stephen M Fleming",
          "abstract": "The ability to represent absences is fundamental to human perception and cognition. Sensitivity to perceptual absences depends on inferring a lack of sensory evidence, enabling the recognition of a lack of environmental resources or other objects. In turn, encoding absence as a concept – in the form of the number zero – has enabled a multitude of technological and mathematical advances. Whether perceptual and conceptual absences rely on overlapping or distinct neural representations in the human brain, however, remains unknown. We employed three different tasks together with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterise neural representations of absence evoked within perceptual and numerical domains. Using multivariate decoding and Bayes factor analyses, we replicate previous findings of shared representations of numerical absence across symbolic and non-symbolic formats. In contrast, we show that these representations of numerical absence are distinct to those evoked by perceptual absences. This result held even after controlling for stimulus-level confounds which generate surface-level similarities between perceptual absences and non-symbolic empty sets. Our results extend a boundary between perception and cognition to the domain of absence and provide insight into the different mechanisms employed by the human brain to both perceive and conceive of absences.",

In contrast to chemosensory aspects of gut-brain signalling, perceptual aspects of gastrointestinal viscerosensation and visceromotor control have received relatively little attention despite clear links to physical and mental health and wellbeing. To facilitate research into these aspects of interoception, we developed a novel gastrointestinal sound discrimination task, Rumble Recognition, to measure gastrointestinal interoceptive accuracy, self-beliefs, and metacognitive insight in three ecologically valid conditions; following a 3 hour fast, after drinking sparkling water, and after consuming a high-protein meal replacement shake. The discrimination task used a two-interval forced choice design to assess gastrointestinal interoceptive performance accuracy alongside self-reported confidence from which a measure of metacognitive insight was computed. This novel task was tested for proof-of-principle in a healthy sample (n=45; 68% women), and demonstrated its feasibility, tolerability, and ability to yield parameters relevant naturalistic experiences including reported experience of hunger. The task is fully automated, requires minimal, affordable equipment, and written in freely available via open source code. We anticipate this task can facilitate research in this important, expanding and clinically relevant domain.",

          "abstract": "When trying to make sense of what is going on in the world and their personal lives, people often refer to scientific and religious explanations. Based on pertinent literature, we introduce a novel self-report instrument that captures five types of how people subjectively conceptualize the science-religion relationship. In addition to examining the psychometric properties of the new instrument, we tested whether these five types of conceptualizations are ordered along a single continuum of conflict vs. compatibility. In doing so, we ran and compared two unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models; a generalized partial credit model (GPCM) and a generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM), both in a German (total N = 2,920) and in a U.S. (N = 1,197) sample. We examined model fit statistics to determine the best-fitting model and examined measurement precision at the scale and the item levels. Finally, we tested measurement invariance across countries (i.e., Germany and the United States), as well as the discriminant, convergent, and criterion-related validity of our new instrument. Our results suggest that public perceptions of the relationship between science and religion are best captured by an unfolding response process (i.e. GGUM) and vary systematically across cultural contexts. In addition, U.S. participants perceived higher levels of conflict than their German counterparts. This research contributes to our theoretical understanding of science-religion perceptions and provides a validated measure for future cross-cultural research.",

          "abstract": "Recent progress in microbiome science has revealed the amazing relationship between the germs of the gut and brain function, challenging long-held beliefs that behaviour arises only in the brain. Emerging evidence suggests that microbial imbalance in the intestine can affect extreme behaviours, including symptoms associated with aggression, impulsivity, and psychiatry.\nThis review examines the stimulating hypothesis that the intestine plays an important role in shaping microbiota-driven violent and antisocial behaviour, highlighting the mechanisms through which microbiota can affect the brain and behaviour via the intestine-brain axis.\nDrawing on interdisciplinary research from microbiology, psychotherapy, neurology, and behavioural psychology, this article synthesizes current findings on neurotransmitters, immune reactions, and microbial modulation of neuroinflammation. Specific case studies involving pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and practical models are investigated to portray these effects.\nMajor evidence supports that dysbiosis can disrupt serotonin and dopamine pathways, compromise the blood-brain barrier, and alter behavioural regulation. In particular, inflammation and immune activation associated with microbiota are implicated in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, and depression. Preliminary data from inmate studies also suggest correlations between intestinal profiles and violent tendencies.\nConclusions outline the hidden but powerful effects of the intestinal microbiome on human behaviour and its potential relevance in psychotherapy, criminal science, and medical interventions. Further research into microbial contributions to psychopathy could revolutionize approaches to mental health treatment and forensic sciences.",

          "abstract": "Food is fundamental to life. Yet, detecting members of the food category raises a substantial cognitive challenge as different foods do not have any apparent common visual features. Moreover, what is deemed edible greatly depends on the cultural context. While the neuro-cognitive bases of food category representations are well documented in adults, their early ontogenetic origins remain unknown. The current study investigated the emergence of food categorization abilities in infants’ brains, using the fast periodic visual stimulation paradigm (FPVS) coupled with electroencephalography (EEG). In FPVS paradigms, images from a target category are periodically inserted into a rapid stream of base images from other categories. If the brain treats the target images as a distinct category relative to the base images, a distinct EEG response appears at the frequency of presentation of the target images. In our study, French-speaking adults, 12- and 6-month-old infants (n = 25 per age group) were presented with target food stimuli inserted into sequences of base stimuli from various non-food categories (e.g., man-made objects, plants). Results show that, similarly to adults, 12-month-old infants distinguished images of food from those of other categories, with stronger neural responses in hungrier individuals. In contrast, 6-month-old infants showed no detectable categorization response for food images. The current study is the first to investigate the developmental course of food categorization in the human brain and showed that, by their first birthday, infants already group perceptually diverse foods into a single category",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling structured thought remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of fluent and coherent language in fundamentally connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the interaction between a parallel, adaptive substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and a structured symbolic framework, like language, internalized through statistical learning. The substrate's parallel architecture enables fast, intuitive pattern-matching, but is fundamentally ill-suited for the serial processing required for structured thought (e.g., causal reasoning, logical deduction). ESC proposes that recursive symbolic generation is the mechanism that overcomes this limitation. By generating a symbol (word or token) and feeding it back as input, the substrate operates as a serial symbolic processor, akin to a Turing machine. This recursive loop allows it to explore the vast combinatorial space of potential thoughts and construct novel, structured solutions. ESC finds compelling support in diverse phenomena across both biological cognition—evidenced by neuroscience, inner speech and cross-cultural studies—and the nascent reasoning and abstract representations displayed in LLMs. ESC thus offers a unifying framework, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence by reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine for general intelligence.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how bilingual experience modulates neural oscillations during speech processing varied by language familiarity. Two groups of English-speaking young adults— monolinguals and simultaneous bilinguals—actively listened to long passages (~30 seconds) in either a familiar (English) or unfamiliar (Hebrew) language, while their EEG activity was recorded. To characterize cognitive processes underpinning speech processing, we analyzed spectral power across a broad frequency spectrum (1–80 Hz), from delta through gamma bands. Further, time-frequency analyses were performed to capture the neural dynamics during sustained listening. Results revealed that bilingual experience was associated with differential oscillatory patterns, particularly in alpha and theta frequencies. Bilinguals exhibited stronger alpha suppression when processing the unfamiliar language, indicating heightened attentional demands relative to the familiar language. Additionally, greater home exposure to non-English languages was linked to higher theta power during familiar language processing, reflecting enhanced attention and increased working memory load. Lower beta power in response to the unfamiliar language suggested greater demands of cognitive state maintenance during novel speech perception. However, no significant effects were observed in gamma or delta power, nor in the time-frequency analyses. Altogether, these findings suggest that bilingual experience shapes brain responses to speech as reflected in attention- and memory-related processes. Furthermore, our results also underscore the importance of approaching bilingualism as a continuous variable beyond the binary categorization.",

          "abstract": "Enthusiasm for an evidence-informed approach towards educational interventions is currently hindered by difficulties integrating research findings into practice. To develop an understanding of current challenges for evidence integration, this qualitative study examined how commercial providers of educational interventions – increasingly involved in the development of practice – interact with and use research evidence in their intervention development and practices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with an international sample of 14 directors of commercial educational intervention companies (50% female) from countries in Europe and North, Central and South America. Based on thematic analysis of interview data, this paper presents a) an overview of the perspectives of the directors on the role of research evidence in their work, and b) suggestions for improving evidence integration into educational intervention provision based on these. Company directors considered research to be important for responsible practice in education and that intervention providers typically conduct their own research for the dual purposes of evidencing and optimising impact. However, there is currently disincentive for commercial providers to engage with academic research because taking part in external evaluation of their own intervention is perceived as high-stakes. Evidence standards required by schools and different research funding bodies are inconsistent. Together, the result is that rigorous standards of evaluation are not perceived as being necessary. To facilitate engagement with research, intervention providers desire a client-centred and collaborative approach to research partnerships, and evaluation processes that are incremental, reducing reliance on high-stakes one-off research trials. We propose ways to improve evidence integration into educational intervention provision based on the perspectives of commercial education intervention providers, while placing them in the context of other stakeholders in the evidence-informed approach to education.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a formal model of consciousness dynamics grounded in Jungian psychology\nand recent scientific theories. We propose the Fuchs Consciousness Equation, ∂C/∂t = k(I×E−αC),\nlinking conscious states to inner drives (I), environmental contexts (E), feedback (α), and coupling\n(k) (Fuchs et al., 2025). This paper emerges from Jung’s exploration of ego–unconscious\nboundaries in the Red Book (Jung, 2009). We interpret the variables in Jungian terms—viewing I\nand E as inner archetypal and outer experiential forces and α and k as regulating constants.\nMapping Jungian dynamics onto the equation, we show how conscious content arises from the\ninterplay of ego, archetypal drives, and context, and how unconscious material gains expression\nthrough boundary negotiation. The framework reveals recursive feedback and spiral\ndevelopmental patterns of consciousness (Beck et al., 2018), where each stage involves threshold\ncrossings and bifurcations of inner and outer influences (Prentner, 2025). Archetypal symbols\nresonate as collective factors modulating individual awareness (Sun &amp; Kim, 2024) and symbolic\nentropy is regulated by the balance of order and novelty (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). Applications\ninclude new research hypotheses (e.g. measurable neural correlates of boundary dynamics), integrative therapeutic techniques (combining dynamical systems with depth psychology), and AI\nmodels of self-organizing cognition. This interdisciplinary model unifies first-person\nphenomenology with quantitative modeling (Prentner, 2025; Carhart-Harris et al., 2014). It offers\na systematic account of consciousness as an emergent, negotiated process (Fuchs, 2025),\nadvancing theory and suggesting future lines of empirical and theoretical work.",

Analyzing 47 studies across 24 articles, the findings of the systematic review revealed that outgroup entitativity, the structure and the decision-making processes of the transgressing outgroup, and individual-level variables such as emotions were antecedents of the collective punishment, and ingroup identification, perceived outgroup fairness, attitudes toward outgroup and ingroup cooperation were consequences of the collective punishment. Moreover, results highlighted that the conceptualization of collective punishment in social psychology was blatantly different from behavioural economics and other disciplines. The review emphasizes significant gaps in the literature, particularly the lack of studies on non-WEIRD populations and the limited focus on children and adolescents. By synthesizing existing research, this work provides a foundation for future studies to address these gaps and offers critical insights into the psychological mechanisms underpinning collective punishment.",

          "abstract": "Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals experience disproportionately high rates of depression, anxiety, trauma, and discrimination, yet remain underrepresented in psychedelic research. This prospective, naturalistic study explored the impact of an ayahuasca retreat experience on mental health, quality of life, and spiritual well-being among SGM participants. Nineteen individuals attending a seven-day ayahuasca retreat completed assessments across six time points from two weeks pre-ceremony to three months post-ceremony. Findings revealed significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores, alongside increases in spiritual well-being and quality of life, particularly within the first month following the retreat. Participants consistently described the experience as highly meaningful and spiritually significant, with many identifying the ceremony as among the most meaningful of their lives. Benefits were further supported by reports of positive behavioral changes, including improved interpersonal relationships and reduced substance use. Adverse effects were minimal and transient. Importantly, this study addresses a historical gap in the literature and highlights the need to reconceptualize psychedelic spaces as inclusive and reparative for queer communities. Given the historical misuse of psychedelics in conversion therapy, these findings mark a critical step in reclaiming such practices for healing, empowerment, and identity affirmation. The results suggest that intentional, culturally responsive psychedelic experiences may offer a valuable therapeutic pathway for SGM individuals. Further research in larger, controlled trials is warranted to better understand these outcomes and support inclusive psychedelic science.",

          "abstract": "How do we use language to coordinate with each other? This question is of interest both from the cognitive science of language perspective as well as the game theory perspective. Here we attempt to bridge the gap between the empirical tradition of studying language use for coordination in reference games with the theoretical and analytic framework of game theory. We conducted a series of 5 real-time online experiments where pairs of participants were matched to play a sequence of 40 2x2 games together (total N=616). Across the experiments, we varied the exact structure of trials, but all experiments involved trials with reward structures modeled on Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) and Bach or Stravinsky (BoS). We manipulated the presence or absence of a chat interface as a between-pairs manipulation. Despite low levels of use of the communication channel, we found slight differences in outcome between the chat and nochat groups, where pairs who could communicate were slightly more likely to reach coordinated beneficial outcomes in BoS games. In contrast to the predictions of rational actors, participants in both chat and no-chat conditions generally aligned on both cooperating rather than both defecting in PD. Overall, we were limited in our ability to discern the role of communication channels in game strategies due to low uptake in using the communication channels when available.",

          "abstract": "Emotional stimuli, especially threatening ones, are known to consume attentional resources, and thus impair working memory (WM). However, this effect has only been demonstrated with perceptual threats (e.g., images of snakes), whereas real-life threats often arise from internal cognitive appraisal of possible negative outcomes. Although this has never been directly tested, WM models suggest that internal appraisals should also impair WM. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments using a novel paradigm that induced internal threat appraisals, under low and high task demands, during a complex span task. Across both experiments, threat appraisals impaired WM performance. Crucially, under high task demand, this impairment was amplified in individuals with elevated cognitive anxiety, particularly when the threat required greater cognitive elaboration. This study introduces a novel paradigm to assess internally generated threat appraisal and demonstrates, for the first time, that it disrupts WM processes similarly to external emotional stimuli.",

When recognizing faces, most humans consistently land their first fixation on the face just below the eyes (upper lookers), but some individuals fixate closer to the mouth (lower lookers). Do differences in long-term eye movement strategies influence the ability to process featural and configural facial information? To investigate this, we tested face recognition in upper and lower lookers using specially designed face stimuli that isolated variation in featural or configural information across exemplars, while fixating either at the eye or mouth regions. We found that upper lookers had superior recognition for configural faces than lower lookers, especially when fixating on the eyes. Using single-feature faces, we found that the upper lookers’ advantage arises from efficient extraction of configural face information from the eye region.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Anxiety is widespread but undertreated in Huntington’s disease (HD). Targeting negative interpretations of ambiguity may reduce anxiety in HD, but no valid measure of negative interpretation biases in HD exists. We developed the Movement Disorders Interpretation Bias Scale (MDIB) to measure negative interpretation biases in movement disorders (e.g., HD, Parkinson’s disease [PD]) and evaluated its validity in adults with HD (preregistration: https://osf.io/26a3h). Methods: We developed the MDIB based on qualitative interviews and expert review, then invited adults with HD (N = 65) to participate in an online survey study to evaluate its structural and external validity. Data were collected between June 2021 and January 2023. Results: Exploratory factor analyses support one factor representing external threats (i.e., social evaluation of movement disorder symptoms) and another factor representing internal threats (i.e., catastrophizing about such symptoms). Scores for both factors showed acceptable internal and test-retest reliabilities, and expected convergent and discriminant validity relations. The external bias score showed expected concurrent, incremental concurrent, and predictive validity relations, with mixed evidence for incremental predictive validity. Unexpectedly, the internal bias score’s concurrent and predictive validity relations were nonsignificant. Conclusions: Results support the MDIB as a measure of negative interpretation biases in HD, with some limitations. Further, associations between the MDIB external bias score and anxiety-related outcomes suggest that the MDIB can be used as a measure of target engagement in future trials evaluating cognitive behavioral treatments for anxiety. These results represent a critical step toward understanding and alleviating the significant burden of anxiety in HD.",

In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics.

In this work, we identify a universal response function that governs both living and non-living systems, emerging naturally under three general conditions: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. We prove that these constraints uniquely lead to a family of low-order rational functions, with the simplest form given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis function captures the saturating, stable, and efficient dynamics found in enzymatic reactions, neural adaptation, behavioral responses, and even physical processes such as RC circuits and radioactive decay. Unlike exponential models, our formulation encodes explicit delay scales and bounded initial responsiveness, making it biologically and physically realizable. Through theoretical derivation and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this rational family constitutes the minimal mathematical grammar shared by all responsive systems in nature.

          "authors": "Linda Farmus; Rob Cribbie",
          "abstract": "Researchers in psychology are often interested in evaluating whether a sample distribution is consistent with a normal (i.e., Gaussian) population distribution, most commonly to evaluate it as an assumption of a statistical model being adopted. In Study 1, a novel negligible effect (equivalence) test (NET) for normality is proposed that evaluates whether a sample distribution is similar enough to a normal distribution to be deemed equivalent (i.e., the difference between the sample and normal distributions is negligible). This NET establishes a negligible effect interval that quantifies coefficients for distribution shape that can be considered approximately normal. Any test statistic which has a 100(1-2α)% confidence interval (CI) that falls between the upper and lower limits of the negligible effect interval leads to the conclusion that the distribution is approximately normal. A series of simulations comparing Type I error and power rates of common traditional (difference-based) approaches (Kolmogorov-Smirnoff and Shapiro-Wilk tests) with the proposed NET-based approach was conducted. Results indicate that in small sample sizes the NET method has low power to detect normality, whereas the traditional methods have low power to detect nonnormality. However, the NET method almost never falsely concludes normality with nonnormal distributions and small samples. With large sample sizes, traditional methods also often indicate that distributions are nonnormal even if the level of nonnormality is very minor (such that it would be unlikely to affect the validity of statistical tests or precision of parameter estimates). This limitation of traditional methods is not a concern for NET tests in large sample sizes, since they rarely falsely conclude that a distribution is nonnormal when it shows minor deviations from normality.   \nOne limitation of the NET-based approach is reduced power to detect normality when distributions are close to normal. Study 2 aimed to improve the calculation of CIs for the NET-based approach and examined several alternative methods for computing bootstrap-based confidence intervals for the NET-SW, including the stochastic bootstrap, parametric bootstrap, and Fisher’s r to z transformation. The stochastic bootstrap approach had the best balance of Type I error to power rates and is the recommended approach to accompany the NET-based normality test.",

          "abstract": "Semantic memory encodes diverse thematic relations, yet their neurocognitive demands remain poorly understood. To investigate a potential heterogeneity of thematic relations, we recorded ERPs while 41 adults judged the thematic relatedness of thematically related and unrelated noun–noun pairs (e.g., builder – house, apple – seed, cheese – fridge versus baby – coffee). Related targets were recognized faster and elicited reduced N400 and late negativities, confirming a robust thematic priming effect. Critically, processing costs scaled with the proportion of dynamic (change-denoting) events evoked by a noun-noun pair: dynamic thematic relations (e.g., builder – house) produced slower RTs and larger N400/late negativities than static thematic relations (e.g., apple – seed). In contrast, telicity—the presence of an inherent endpoint—did not influence behaviour or ERPs once dynamicity was controlled. Priming effects—and the dynamicity cost—were most pronounced over midline and posterior scalp sites, implicating these regions in event-level semantic integration. These findings reveal fine-grained heterogeneity within thematic knowledge: conceptual change taxes the system of semantic representations and/or semantic control mechanisms, highlighting the importance of dynamicity when modelling event-based relations.",

          "abstract": "As the dual crises of climate change and rapid artificial intelligence (AI) development converge, the Americas stand at a critical juncture. While AI offers transformative potential for climate mitigation and adaptation, ranging from advanced environmental monitoring to smarter disaster response, nationalistic policies and fragmented data governance threaten to undermine regional and global progress. This article proposes a Pan-American Science Diplomacy Framework designed to catalyze collaboration over competition in developing AI solutions for climate change. Drawing on comparative analyses of the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Chile, we highlight both the strengths and limitations of current national approaches to AI and climate action. We argue that harmonizing data standards, sharing infrastructure, and fostering inclusive governance, particularly by integrating Indigenous and local knowledge, are essential for equitable and effective AI-driven climate solutions. The framework centers on four pillars: infrastructure, data, talent, and governance, emphasizing the need for interoperable data protocols, pooled resources, and trust-building mechanisms. By leveraging existing regional institutions and diplomatic platforms, the Americas can model a new era of science diplomacy that accelerates innovation, bridges capacity gaps, and ensures that the benefits of AI for climate action are shared equitably across the hemisphere.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how awe-inspiring content and awe-primed expectations shape emotional experiences across subjective, behavioural, and physiological dimensions. In a two-part study (N=82), participants experienced virtual reality simulations designed to evoke either awe or calmness, while being primed to expect either awe-inspiring or calming experiences. We measured self-reported awe, duration perception, heart-related metrics, and electrodermal activity (EDA). Results revealed a dissociation between content and priming effects: VR content consistently influenced self-reported awe, with awe-inducing simulations generating stronger subjective ratings regardless of priming. In contrast, priming primarily affected physiological responses, particularly measures associated with sympathetic activation (HRV LF) and overall autonomic activity (SDNN). Though all experiences were underestimated in duration, time perception was most accurate for calm content with calm priming. EDA showed minimal responsiveness to our manipulations, with only very low frequency components showing higher values for awe experiences. These findings suggest awe operates through parallel processing pathways: a content-driven path affecting conscious experience and a priming-sensitive path influencing physiological responses. This dissociation highlights the multidimensional nature of awe and demonstrates how expectations and perceptual stimuli differentially impact dimensions of awe. The observed pattern of sympathetic and parasympathetic co-activation during awe suggests a state of \"relaxed alertness\" that may be characteristic of this complex emotion.",

          "abstract": "Humans use language to communicate complex psychological experiences. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled researchers to quantitatively study and assess psychological constructs through language (e.g., well-being and mental health). Data-driven visualizations of how language statistically relates to psychological dimensions can help interpret assessment scores, uncover meaningful patterns, and understand the intricate relationships between language use and mental states. Visualizations can, for example, be used to differentiate between related constructs (e.g., How does language related to depression versus anxiety differ?), understand the validity of assessment tools (e.g., Does the language related to high depression severity match with depression theory?), and explain AI-based language assessments (e.g., Which language is indicative of higher depression severity as identified by an AI-based model?).\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to transform language data into visual insights using the text and topics packages in R. We provide practical guidance on leveraging four different techniques, examining how language use patterns are statistically associated with a psychological construct or behavior. The techniques include visualizing 1) individual words and phrases, 2) topics (word clusters), 3) words based on their numerical representation in the AI-based language space, and 4) complete language examples. These quantitative methods offer complementary perspectives, visualizing linguistic elements from individual words to overarching topics and relevant text examples. The methods range from simple correlations between individual words to more advanced techniques, including Large Language Models and topic modelling. By making these methods accessible, this tutorial aims to empower researchers to use language visualizations for meaningful data-driven insights.",

          "abstract": "Habits are stimulus-driven responses that are produced independently of the current outcome value. They enable efficient actions in familiar contexts while freeing up cognitive resources. Habits are expected to influence behavior after substantial experience, whereas limited training leaves behavior under goal-directed control. This transition from goal-directed to habitual control is well-documented in animal research but remains challenging to replicate in humans. Recent studies have suggested that human protocols are so effective at inducing habitual control that habits can appear even after short training, thereby masking the training effects. These studies typically test habits by reducing outcome value (e.g., food, through satiation) and report persistent habit-like behavior in minimally trained participants. Here, we propose an alternative explanation: we think that the devaluation protocol was ineffective for this subset of ‘habitual’ participants. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pre-registered experiment using the same task but with monetary rewards instead of food, hypothesizing that money can be more effectively devalued and avoid the social issues associated with eating. We found no difference in habitual responses between short and extended training. In contrast to prior reports, most participants were sensitive to outcome devaluation. We further supported our hypothesis by reanalyzing previous datasets, finding that across all studies (including ours), participants showing more habit-like responses were those for whom the devaluation was less effective. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of these findings.",

          "abstract": "Affective touch is crucial in shaping social and intimate relationships, as it influences and helps regulate the emotional states of touchers and touchees. Furthermore, affective touch is complex, and a wide array of modulatory effects across sensory modalities has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the multisensory nature of affective touch itself and its emotional induction capabilities via non-tactile senses. Through four online experiments, the present research investigated the emotional responses to the auditory signals produced by organic affective touch (i.e., tactile gestures performed by real romantic partners). In Experiment 1, we identified the predominant affective touch gestures in which people typically engage. Experiment 2 revealed that, lacking explicit cues on the nature of the sounds, organic affective touch sounds elicited negative-to-neutral emotional responses, differing from those evoked by object-based interaction sounds. Moreover, we found that individuals were unable to confidently identify whether the sounds involved affective touch gestures. In Experiment 3, we found that framing the nature of the organic affective touch sounds explicitly as real affective touch, as opposed to object-based tactile interactions, elicited more positive emotional responses. Finally, the results of Experiment 4 revealed that higher levels of congruency between individuals' expectations regarding the sounds of affective touch and the real auditory cues positively influenced the valence elicited by sounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the multisensory nature of affective touch and underscore the importance of meaning in its emotional elicitation function.",

          "abstract": "The global rise in intentional non-adherence to medical advice and the use of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine poses a burden on public health and national economies. In a large-scale, preregistered study, we found that these two types of questionable health behaviours were positively associated in 32 out of 33 countries and that nearly all of the 15,218 participants had engaged in at least one such behaviour during their lifetime. Both behaviours were consistently predicted by psychological factors—especially negative healthcare experiences and a set of epistemically flawed beliefs including conspiracy, magical health, and extrasensory perception beliefs, along with the personality trait disintegration — with effect sizes often larger than previously reported. Predictiveness of these individual-level factors outweighed that of national health system characteristics. Our findings suggest that health systems should build trust, improve patient experience, and screen for individuals vulnerable to unfounded beliefs that can undermine evidence-based health decisions.",

          "abstract": "Why does research find that girls demonstrate stronger, more negative associations between\nsocial media use and well-being compared to boys? Applying a gendered lens to processes of\nsocial media and adolescent well-being, this study empirically examined two common\nexplanations for gendered patterns in these processes; differences between the experiences and\ncontext of boys and girls, or that girls often use social media more frequently than boys. Using\nintensive longitudinal data collected from N = 97 adolescents living in the United States and a\nDynamic Structural Equation Modeling framework, we found limited evidence that social media\nuse was related to well-being, or that gendered facets of adolescents’ social context moderated\nthese associations. However, we did find that two gendered facets of adolescents’ social media\nexperiences, frequency of use and unwanted exposure to sexually explicit content, were both\nnegatively associated with the stability of adolescents’ sense of purpose. This finding points to\nalternative within-person processes, where instead of a direct causal relationship between social\nmedia use and well-being, social media use and experiences are related to the stability of\nadolescents’ well-being.",

          "abstract": "Social media has rapidly become a platform for people to consume content from an array of media figures, such as influencers, YouTubers, podcasters, or celebrities. Although we might assume people engage with content creators they enjoy or admire, there is a growing trend of people engaging with the content of those they actually dislike. This behaviour falls under the umbrella of negative parasocial relationships, bonds formed between audiences and disliked media figures. Across three studies we examine this specific form of negative parasocial relationship, which we call parasocial enemyship: people intentionally engaging with the content of a creator they actively dislike. Our data demonstrate that this phenomenon is prevalent across age, gender, ethnicity, and cultures. We investigate the motivations behind parasocial enemyship, identifying three distinct drives. These motivations clustered into themes of superiority (the need to feel better than the parasocial enemy), interest (the desire to understand the enemy), and fun (the desire to be entertained). Of these motivations, only the motivation to feel superior was consistently associated with Dark Triad traits (Psychopathy and Machiavellianism in particular). These results suggest that parasocial enemyship is a prevalent but nuanced behaviour, one that is not uniformly malevolent, and driven by diverse motivations.",

In both experiments, participants showed a preference for a high level of cognitive conflict, evaluated it as effortful yet enjoyable and linked it to positive emotions. Overall, these findings suggest that cognitive conflict, not effort, is valued and functions as an intrinsic reward, challenging the neuroeconomic approach to cognitive control theories toward a hedonic perspective.",

Linear regression, which prevails as the typical statistical approach in this research area, lacks the flexibility to meet these challenges. As alternatives, we present three statistical approaches: (1) Additive regression models to capture and control nonlinear or floor/ceiling effects, (2) Bayesian multilevel modeling, which can improve statistical power and allows for more complex models, and (3) clustering multivariate constellations of learner aptitudes via latent profile analysis. We demonstrate these three approaches on a motivating dataset from a scientific reasoning training, discussing their relative (dis-)advantages and how these and further models may aid research into differential effectiveness across different research topics and designs.",

In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

Besides facilitating more efficient perceptual inference, this generative architecture also enables the internal generation of sensory activity in the absence of input, in the form of imagination. Currently, it remains unclear how perceptual inferences reflecting reality can be kept apart from those that are imagined. Here, we propose a computational framework which formalizes reality inferences as higher-order evaluations of sensory precision. We demonstrate how this simple mechanism can explain a wide range of empirical observations regarding the relationships between perception, expectation, imagery and reality monitoring. Through simulations, we generate novel, testable hypotheses which highlight directions for future research. Our approach offers a simple yet powerful framework for developing a computational neuroscience of reality monitoring.",

          "abstract": "All biological and physical systems respond to stimuli. But until now, no unified law has described how these responses arise under fundamental constraints. In this work, we identify a universal response function that governs both living and non-living systems, emerging naturally under three general conditions: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. We prove that these constraints uniquely lead to a family of low-order rational functions, with the simplest form given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis function captures the saturating, stable, and efficient dynamics found in enzymatic reactions, neural adaptation, behavioral responses, and even physical processes such as RC circuits and radioactive decay. Unlike exponential models, our formulation encodes explicit delay scales and bounded initial responsiveness, making it biologically and physically realizable. Through theoretical derivation and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this rational family constitutes the minimal mathematical grammar shared by all responsive systems in nature. We conclude that a universal response law exists—and it is rational.",

          "abstract": "A significant body of research has examined the relationships between political ideology and conspiracy beliefs. Conspiracy theories are often considered the province of “extremist” political positions. Intriguingly, however, several recent studies have demonstrated that people at the midpoint of the left-right self-placement item often displayed elevated conspiracy beliefs. The cause of this “midpoint bump” is unknown. Based on these observations, our research investigated the extent to which midpoint bumps exist in other domains. Using data from the Australian Election Study (N = 2179) and the American National Election Study (N = 8280), we conducted polynomial tests on the relationships between the left-right item and a range of social and political attitudes. We found W-shaped relationships primarily across attitudes towards the political system and immigrants. To explore the possibility that subgroups may hold anti-establishment and anti-immigrant attitudes that distinguish them from typically-moderate responders, we conducted Latent Profile Analyses on midpoint responders. In both samples, one profile represented an extreme response pattern relative to other profiles, consistent with populist attitudes. We discuss the implications of the left-right scale conflating political diversity at the midpoint for ideological measurement, as well as how it hinders understanding anti-establishment tendencies across the political spectrum.",

          "authors": "Simar Moussaoui; Adam Frost; Matthias Niemeier",
          "abstract": "Recent research emphasizes how working memory (WM) supports action in dynamic environments. But action almost always involves fast, “saccadic” eye movements that challenge WM representations, requiring spatial remapping and distorting spatial perception, especially along the saccade direction. To capture the impact of these distortions, we used a spatial WM task where participants, after a saccade or fixation, indicated remembered locations of memory items with a mouse. From the responses we extracted multiple measures of spatial error: response variability, shifts relative to the fixation point, rotations, compression and nonlinear distortions of space. These measures submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA) yielded two components: systematic and unsystematic spatial error both of which were correlated with established WM tasks, showing their relevance for WM fidelity. Systematic error revealed a centripetal bias, pulling towards spatial anchors like the fixation point and the memory array’s centre of mass. This suggests that systematic error reflects a spatial scaffold that encodes relational information but is inherently imprecise. Saccades increased both error components and amplified WM load effects. Notably, we found that distortions of systematic error were especially pronounced along saccade direction for items that were remapped across visual fields, implying that WM fidelity is more vulnerable when information needs to pass through the corpus callosum. Together, our findings are consistent with the idea of WM actively reconstructing spatial information. They offer new insights into how saccades and spatial remapping shape WM in a dynamic world.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "abstract": "Our language environment is rich in statistical structure. It is therefore natural to hypothesize that statistical learning (SL) —the ability to detect regularities in the environmental input— contributes to the efficient processing of written text and supports literacy skills. Some prior studies reported correlations between SL as a general ability and reading, while others found null effects. We propose that this link may be better revealed by measuring individuals’ learning of orthographic statistical patterns, a type of regularity more directly relevant to literacy. This study examined how sensitivity to bigram frequency in participants’ first language (L1, French) and the ability to learn novel bigrams through exposure relate to literacy outcomes. The measures showed moderate to good reliability (L1 sensitivity: r = .60; novel orthographic learning: r = .84) and were significantly associated with spelling, but not reading. Notably, sensitivity to bigram frequency was not significantly associated with orthographic learning performance and did not mediate the link between orthographic learning and spelling. These findings suggest that different aspects of sensitivity to existing and newly acquired orthographic patterns independently support spelling abilities in French, without extending to reading performance.",

Current approaches are either too time-consuming or lack contextual understanding for actionable insights. Objective: To develop and validate a framework using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze student feedback in psychology courses, comparing LLM insights with traditional evaluation metrics. Method: We implemented Facebook's BART LLM using zero-shot classification on open-ended course evaluations from a large psychology course comparing traditional lecture with active learning formats across two semesters. Data included 270 evaluations yielding 678 responses, analyzed using four learning categories. Results: LLM analysis revealed striking discrepancies with traditional metrics. While Likert-scale responses showed minimal differences between formats (Cohen's d = 0.16-0.33), LLM analysis revealed large, significant effects across all dimensions (Cohen's d = 0.94-1.13, p &lt; .001). Validation confirmed reliability through moderate correlations with related Likert items (r = 0.29-0.44). Conclusion: LLM analysis demonstrated superior sensitivity in detecting teaching approach differences, capturing qualitative distinctions that numerical ratings miss while addressing challenges of qualitative data volume and analysis time. Teaching Implications: This methodology enables instructors to analyze hundreds of responses in minutes using accessible tools, providing practical evidence-based teaching improvement insights.",

          "abstract": "The exit from the workforce and the transition to retirement often coincides with changes in important aspects of individuals’ daily life and social roles. This can be a demanding experience for some retirees, affecting their mental health. It is thus important to identify relevant psychosocial, health, and financial predictors of adjustment quality. Retiring during the Covid-19 pandemic may have been particularly challenging, as newly retired older adults had fewer opportunities to establish new leisure activities and social relationships due to limits on in-person meeting and travel. In the present study, we compared retirees who retired in or just before the first phase of the pandemic (2019-early 2021, n = 175) with those who retired long before the pandemic (2015-2017, n = 211) in terms of their retirement adjustment quality (reported in late 2020 / early 2021 or 2017, respectively). Retirement adjustment quality was measured by perceived adjustment difficulty and change in life satisfaction across the transition. We further investigated whether pre-retirement social activity, generalized self-efficacy, online activities or disease load were associated with later retirement adjustment in both groups. We found that groups did not differ in their retirement adjustment. In both groups, a higher generalized self-efficacy was associated with better adjustment. Social activities before retirement were only associated with increases in life satisfaction among those retiring before the pandemic. We discuss our findings with respect to the literature on predictors of retirement adjustment, as well as on the effects of the pandemic on psychosocial functioning.",

Order (i.e., structure and organization of elements in a display) and complexity (i.e., quantity and variety of elements) have often been suggested as important factors related to appreciation, but the exact type and direction of their relation to appreciation is still under debate. To clarify the contributions of order and complexity to appreciation, it is important to manipulate order and complexity independently and in a parametrically controlled fashion, to study their relation to appreciation in combination rather than separately, and to acknowledge the multidimensional nature of order and complexity. In an online study, we investigated individuals’ aesthetic preferences (N = 340) for three different types of complexity (i.e., the number of colors, shapes, and sizes in the display) while also varying the order level of the display. Firstly, results indicated that not all complexity types are appreciated similarly: Whereas color complexity was on average preferred, size and shape complexity influenced preferences negatively. Secondly, all three complexity types were more often preferred in highly ordered stimuli than in stimuli with a lower order level, indicating a stimulating effect of order on preferences for complexity. Thirdly, we found both individual and contextual variation in preferences for complexity: Especially the extent to which color complexity is preferred varied across individuals and the specific set of colors used in the display.",

In two samples of university students (N1=65 and N2=40), stronger predictions led participants to judge identities as more trustworthy and likeable when identities’ facial reactions conformed to their predictions compared to when they were violated. Furthermore, the representational structure of social judgments and SCR were associated with models of prediction fulfillment/violation. More importantly, the similarity between social judgments, SCR representations, and models of prediction fulfillment/violation were linked to predictions strength. These results demonstrate that predictions strength modulates how fulfilled/violated predictions influence social judgments and bodily responses, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying social perception.",

Under the same physical input, withdrawing attention collapsed the structures of qualia of letters (N=14) and red/green bisected disks (N=14), but not of faces (N=13), as quantified via an unsupervised optimal transport alignment technique. Alignment accuracy was high for face qualia structures obtained under the fully versus poorly attended conditions but not for the letters and disks.

          "authors": "Samuel L Leizerman",
          "abstract": "In this proof, I extend and apply field-theoretic framework in a generalized (nD + T) spacetime, with\nsignature (−, +, ..., +), to formally subsume, reinterpret, and unify causal inference methods. I illustrate this unity by demonstrating its applicability to Difference-in-Differences (DiD), regression inter-\naction effects, potential outcomes, Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM), and propensity scoring. Critically, I prove that Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Regression Kink\nDesign (RKD) are field-theoretic boundary phenomena differentiated by the order of causal curvature discontinuity—interpretable as a collision angle within the manifold. This geometric-dynamical\nparadigm offers a novel mechanism for the detection of unobserved variable bias, leveraging tensor\ncalculus and linear algebra. The framework’s predicted  performance stems from its foundation in\nLorentzian spacetime, the inherent mathematical structure of causality, providing a native environment for causal relationships that is inaccessible to methods operating on degraded, flattened projections of reality. True mathematical discontinuities are shown to be approximations arising when the\ncharacteristic time scale of a causal transition falls below the observational time step, analogous to\nthe Planck time limit in physics. The empirical success of existing low-dimensional causal inference\nmethods provide a compelling validation for the superior performance predicted out of mathematical necessity and of this higher-dimensional spacetime framework.

          "authors": "Thomas E. Devitt",
          "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of fluid reasoning—the ability to solve novel, complex problems in a principled and adaptive manner. This paper introduces and empirically validates the Fluid Emergent Reasoning Engine (FERE-CRS), a novel cognitive architecture designed to foster such capabilities. The architecture is grounded in the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its process theory, Active Inference (AIF), which posit that intelligent agents maintain their existence by minimizing surprise through a continuous cycle of perception and action. We address the computational intractability of applying AIF to complex, neuro-symbolic systems by proposing the Cognitive Resonance Score (CRS), a tractable, multi-component heuristic proxy for Variational Free Energy (VFE). The CRS serves as a \"common currency\" for a Meta-Reasoning Agent (MRA) to orchestrate the functions of heterogeneous components, including a Large Language Model (LLM) acting as a versatile cognitive engine. We detail a \"cognitive choreographer\" methodology that makes the validation of this complex architecture tractable and transparent. In a 500-trial experiment on a complex, inferential artifact analysis task, the FERE-CRS agent produced significantly higher-quality explanations (mean score: 8.48/10) and was five times more efficient (mean cost: 610.0 units) than a strong Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) baseline (mean score: 6.71/10; mean cost: 3000.0 units). Furthermore, analysis of the agent’s reasoning trace provides quantitative evidence of AIF-consistent adaptive behavior, demonstrating a clear shift from information-seeking to goal-directed action as uncertainty is resolved. Crucially, we argue that this architecture creates the conditions for transfer learning, enabling the agent to learn abstract, generalizable cognitive strategies that can be applied to entirely novel problems, a key shortcoming of current AI paradigms. This work provides a complete theoretical, architectural, and empirical account of a novel approach to building more intelligent, adaptive, and explainable AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are a leading cause of disease burden in 10-24-year-olds. In Australia, fragmentation within and across sectors (health, mental health and human services) results in gaps in service provision and increases this disease burden. There is an urgent need for reform; however, we need comprehensive and robust methodologies to identify gaps and inefficiencies in service provision to shape policy, ensure efficient allocation of resources and support those most in need. Here we describe the protocol for a population-based data linkage study involving evaluation of health, mental health, and human service use among Victorian young people with the goal of identifying subgroups experiencing unmet mental health needs. \nMethods and analysis: Our primary cohort includes youth aged 12-25 years in the period January 2018 to November 2023. For comparative purposes, we also include data from children aged 5-11 and adults 26-53 for this timeframe. We outline data sources and linkage methodology. Traditional statistical methods coupled with contemporary machine learning and natural language processing techniques will be used to identify subgroups with unmet mental health needs.\nStudy outcomes: Ongoing consultation and engagement with young people and key stakeholders will inform interpretation, dissemination and translation of findings. We will provide a comprehensive examination of the clinical characteristics of young people, their service use behaviours, and typical pathways through care, that cannot be gleaned from examining datasets in isolation. Findings will inform ongoing mental health service reform that will lead to improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes for Victorian youth.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Peer-based interventions have been highlighted as a promising way of improving patient outcomes across diverse health services. While previous reviews have examined peer-based programs in specific health services (e.g., mental health, cancer) or with specific populations (e.g., people with HIV), no previous reviews have investigated peer-based programs with a dedicated peer provider role (e.g., peer navigator) for adolescents receiving care in tertiary health services.\nObjective: To describe characteristics of adolescent-focused peer-based programs in paediatric tertiary care or youth health services, and synthesise the available evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, barriers and facilitators of these programs.\nMethods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for empirical studies published between  January 1st, 2015 to May 2nd, 2025. Eligible articles described programs with a dedicated peer role for adolescents under 26 years of age receiving care in a tertiary paediatric or youth health service. A narrative synthesis of the extracted data was conducted to group data into relevant themes.\nFindings: Fifteen studies with a total of 751 participants were included across 16 articles (8 qualitative, 3 quantitative non-randomised, 2 randomised controlled trials, and 3 mixed methods). One-third of studies (n=5; all qualitative designs) met all quality criteria. There was significant heterogeneity in the peer-based interventions in terms of health contexts (e.g., HIV, oncology, disability), format (one-on-one, group or hybrid), delivery (face-to-face, online, or pre-recorded video), and characteristics of peer roles (group facilitation, one-on-one sessions, referrals, appointment attendance, training, supervision and embeddedness within clinical teams). Most adolescents and service providers deemed interventions to be feasible and acceptable. Peer roles were seen as a key source of social support and role modelling which facilitated adolescents’ health-related learning, self-management and comfort in participating in health care or group interventions. Key barriers included technical issues (e.g., virtual delivery), non-cohesive group dynamics, poor understanding of peer navigator roles among clinicians, and irrelevant or non-tailored program content. Facilitators included comprehensive training and supervision for peer navigators and flexible, adolescent-centred program delivery and recruitment strategies. Quantitative evidence for the effectiveness of peer interventions was mixed; however, qualitative reports highlighted improvements in psychosocial wellbeing.\nConclusions and Relevance: Peer-based programs with a dedicated peer role appear to feasible and acceptable to adolescents and service providers, although not without barriers to implementation. More high-quality research is necessary to clarify the effectiveness of these programs for adolescents receiving care in tertiary care or youth health services.",

Numerous SciArt spaces and initiatives exist, bridging the gap between the two and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. However, personal and interpersonal obstacles have been identified for both artists and scientists within the context of SciArt collaborations and environments. Here, we first introduce key concepts about SciArt and then leverage theories from social psychology in the study of group dynamics, including social and group identity, group norms, and minority dissent and influence, to examine artist-scientist collaborations and their challenges. Drawing on social psychology frameworks, our goal is to inform and encourage the creation of Third Spaces that identify common ground between practitioners, foster balanced interactions, build shared group identity and new group dynamics, and ultimately move beyond discipline-specific identities and institutionalized environments.",

          "abstract": "Plant cognition has progressed from anecdote to rigor, yet the field still lacks a quantitative test for when distributed plant activity crosses into unified—perhaps conscious—processing. I introduce Pattern–Temporal Synergy (PTS), a substrate-agnostic metric rooted in Dynergeia, a relation-first ontology that defines consciousness as reflexive coherence among five universal patterns—self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness and flux—phase-locked inside a system’s binding window (τ). Each pattern is operationalized with established signal-processing measures; their mean strength is multiplied by their mean synergy and released only if a τ-specific coherence gate is met.\nThree preregistered hypotheses anchor the study: H1 baseline PTS &gt; 0 in intact plants; H2 4 % diethyl-ether collapses PTS below threshold φ; H3 PTS rebounds on wash-out. A multispecies protocol—Mimosa pudica, Arabidopsis thaliana, Picea abies—combines 64-channel surface electrodes, glutamate-sensitive Ca²⁺ imaging and micro-optode O₂/heat-flux probes. Sliding 3 × τ windows with phase-shuffled surrogates yield z-scored PTS trajectories, adjudicated by preregistered effect-size criteria.\nBy turning decades of qualitative insight into falsifiable numbers, PTS offers plant biology a litmus test for conscious-level processing, directly challenges Integrated Information Theory and supplies a road-map for cross-kingdom comparisons—including neuromorphic silicon. Confirmatory results would shift debates on plant sentience from speculation to data; null results would equally refine what consciousness requires.",

          "abstract": "Building on critical cultural approaches to racism—including Phillips and Lowery’s theory of herd invisibility—we tested Mary Church Terrell’s Functional Diversion Hypothesis: the idea that the cultural image of the poor white bigot creates perceptual invisibility for the most privileged white individuals, particularly when they engage in actions that uphold, construct racist systems and personal benefit. Across three experiments, activating the “poor white bigot” prototype reduced perceptions of racism in gentrifiers who engaged in acts of displacement, exclusion, and gatekeeping in the housing market—actions that disproportionately harmed Black individuals and communities. While the focus was on white participants (Experiments 1–3), Functional Diversion was also observed in Black participants (Experiment 3). A cumulative meta-analysis revealed a small but reliable effect (Cohen’s d = .34; 95% CI of Cohen’s d = [.17, .51], p &lt; .001), consistent with the median effect size in psychological science. Results are discussed in terms of cultural mechanisms of invisibility, the psychological function of racist prototypes, and how such imagery may shield contemporary racist systems, political movements, and individuals from scrutiny.",

          "abstract": "Women are disproportionately affected by poor sleep, both in terms of how much sleep they get (quantity) and how disturbed that sleep is (quality). One relatively unexplored association with poor sleep is adverse childhood experiences, which also disproportionately affect women. How childhood adversity affects sleep in adult women is not well understood, partly because of opacity in the way prior research considers different types of adversity. Prior research has emphasized cumulative approaches, treating all adverse experiences as equivalent and overlooking how different adversities may manifest in adult health problems. We investigated how adversity differentially contributed to sleep issues in a sample of treatment-seeking women (N=329), utilizing both cumulative and person-centered, dimensional analytic approaches. Latent class analysis revealed four distinct adversity profiles: ‘emotional/physical abuse’, ‘household dysfunction’, ‘high ACEs’, and ‘low ACEs’. Sleep symptom analysis identified two subgroups: high and low sleep issues. Women classified within the abuse-related and high-ACE subgroups reported worse sleep, while those in the abuse profile did so even when their total cumulative adversity scores did not reach conventional clinical thresholds. These findings suggest that specific patterns of childhood adversity—particularly abuse—uniquely contribute to adult sleep issues among women and can be missed using only cumulative scoring methods. This study underscores the importance of dimensional, subtype-focused approaches to ACE research and highlights the enduring impact of childhood adversity on women’s lifelong sleep health.",

          "authors": "Simar Moussaoui; Adam Frost; Matthias Niemeier",
          "abstract": "Recent research emphasizes how working memory (WM) supports action in dynamic environments. But action almost always involves fast, “saccadic” eye movements that challenge WM representations, requiring spatial remapping and distorting spatial perception, especially along the saccade direction. To capture the impact of these distortions, we used a spatial WM task where participants, after a saccade or fixation, indicated remembered locations of memory items with a mouse. From the responses we extracted multiple measures of spatial error: response variability, shifts relative to the fixation point, rotations, compression and nonlinear distortions of space. These measures submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA) yielded two components: systematic and unsystematic spatial error both of which were correlated with established WM tasks, showing their relevance for WM fidelity. Systematic error revealed a centripetal bias, pulling towards spatial anchors like the fixation point and the memory array’s centre of mass. This suggests that systematic error reflects a spatial scaffold that encodes relational information but is inherently imprecise. Saccades increased both error components and amplified WM load effects. Notably, we found that distortions of systematic error were especially pronounced along saccade direction for items that were remapped across visual fields, implying that WM fidelity is more vulnerable when information needs to pass through the corpus callosum. Together, our findings are consistent with the idea of WM actively reconstructing spatial information. They offer new insights into how saccades and spatial remapping shape WM in a dynamic world.",

In the task, we manipulated emotional transition probabilities to model differences in emotional typicality and measured participants’ prediction accuracy and target liking. In study 1, we found that a target with normative emotion transition probabilities was more liked than a target with random emotion transitions, while a target with atypical emotions was least liked. In study 2, we investigated different aspects of atypical emotion transitions (predictability of the next emotion, overall frequency of positive emotions, and valence volatility) found that each aspect influenced learning accuracy, but variation in liking was only related to valence volatility and frequency of positive states.

          "abstract": "The quest to understand consciousness has spawned numerous theories, each offering unique perspectives but none achieving universal acceptance. While these theories provide valuable insights, they often serve more as guiding narratives than mechanistic frameworks for empirical validation. Here, we propose that incorporating critical brain dynamics—the idea that neural networks operate near a critical transition point—may offer a more cohesive understanding of consciousness. We term this hypothesis the ConCrit framework, combining the concepts of consciousness and criticality. By reviewing empirical evidence and computational models, we suggest that near-critical systems exhibit many properties aligned with leading theories of consciousness. Specifically, approaching a critical point enhances the complexity and richness of internal representations and heightens sensitivity to the system’s own state. Consequently, a system capable of conscious experience is more likely to exhibit consciousness near criticality and lose it as it deviates from this regime. In this paper, we review the concepts of criticality and critical brain dynamics, explore their relationship with consciousness from theoretical and empirical perspectives, and outline key implications and predictions.",

To accomplish this aim, we descriptively and statistically compared LGB and TGD representation in the CLSA against national-level data from the 2023 Canadian Community Health Survey and 2021 Canadian Census. We found that bisexual people, transgender men, and transgender women were underrepresented in the CLSA (0.66% for bisexual people, and 0.01% each for transgender men and women) compared to national-level data (0.95% for bisexual people, 0.05% for transgender men, and 0.09% for transgender women).

Varying assessment methods for sexual orientation and gender identity across CLSA waves complicate analyses but underscore evolving inclusivity efforts in longitudinal research. Based on our analyses, we detail recommendations for researchers using the CLSA to examine health outcomes and resilience factors among LGB and TGD populations, even with small sample sizes. Ultimately, these findings highlight the necessity of robust, inclusive data to inform interventions and support policy decisions for older LGB and TGD populations.",

We assess the role of distance as a key moderator of bilingual adaptations through a large-scale aggregation analysis of 510 experiments. To measure distance, we develop a multi-metric approach, using state-of-the-art databases, such as Grambank. Analyzing data from 56,122 participants who speak 79 different languages, spanning 11 language families and a language isolate, we find sparse evidence for a distance effect.

Specifically, we investigated learners’ use of multiword expressions in terms of five different measures of collocability: phrase frequency, mutual information, log dice and two measures of Delta P, as functions of two key learner-related variables: proficiency levels, and the word-order typology of learners’ L1s. We also examined the accuracy in learners’ use of multiword expressions. The results of our mixed-effects models revealed a complex picture. While highly proficient learners use multiword expressions more accurately, they do not always produce more frequent and idiomatic outputs. Typological similarity between learners’ L1s and Portuguese do not consistently result in more idiomatic multiword expression use. \n\nKeywords: Multiword expressions; learner corpora; collocations; association measures; Portuguese, usage-based approaches",

          "abstract": "Objective: Worry plays an important role in anxiety disorders, but its neurodevelopment remains unclear. Worry increases during adolescence when cognitive-affective neural circuits are developing, impacting girls especially. Activity of and connectivity between amygdala and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus play an important role in anxiety symptoms, and amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) connectivity subserves emotion regulation. Here, we examined how functional changes in these circuits related to age, sex, and anxiety symptoms among adolescents and young adults using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI.\nMethod: 25 (13 female) 12-17 years-old adolescents and 44 (31 male) 18-31 years-old young adults completed fMRI worry induction and reappraisal tasks previously used in adults. Brain activity was extracted from a priori regions of interest in amygdala, PVN and vmPFC, and connectivity was calculated using generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI).\nResults: Contrary to hypotheses, amygdala activity in the Worry condition was positively correlated with age. In partial confirmation of hypotheses, female participants had elevated Worry – Neutral PVN activity (driven by lower Neutral activity), but elevated amygdala-vmPFC connectivity during Reappraisal than male participants. In exploratory analyses, female participants had elevated amygdala-PVN connectivity during Reappraisal compared to male participants.  \nConclusion: Adolescents utilize less amygdala-centered networks during worry than adults, suggesting that interventions designed for adults may not translate directly to adolescents. Female individuals show increased PVN recruitment and amygdala-PVN activity during worry, which could predispose them to more somatic symptoms of anxiety. Results may inform clinical presentation and interventions for anxiety disorders.",

In this work, we demonstrate that a single rational response function of the form $\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\hat{\\tau} / (\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau})$ emerges as a universal solution when three fundamental constraints are simultaneously imposed: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) finite information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. This function not only captures biological adaptation but also approximates classical physical systems under idealized assumptions. Most critically, we identify the parameter $\\tau_0$ as encoding an irreducible latency inherent to any responsive system—whether molecular, neural, behavioral, or physical—marking a foundational quantity that bridges life and physics. Our results suggest that the rational saturating response is not merely empirical but arises from first principles, revealing a deep structural constraint governing all systems capable of adaptation.",

          "abstract": "All biological and physical systems respond to stimuli. But until now, no unified law has described how these responses arise under fundamental constraints. In this work, we identify a universal response function that governs both living and non-living systems, emerging naturally under three general conditions: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. We prove that these constraints uniquely lead to a family of low-order rational functions, with the simplest form given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis function captures the saturating, stable, and efficient dynamics found in enzymatic reactions, neural adaptation, behavioral responses, and even physical processes such as RC circuits and radioactive decay. Unlike exponential models, our formulation encodes explicit delay scales and bounded initial responsiveness, making it biologically and physically realizable. Through theoretical derivation and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this rational family constitutes the minimal mathematical grammar shared by all responsive systems in nature. We conclude that a universal response law exists—and it is rational.",

Across ten years and four states, 122 schools were trained and 116 implemented at least once, engaging about 8,387 students. We asked whether teachers, on average, deliver Pathways-to-Success with fidelity and which teacher-level and school-level factors shaped fidelity. Ninety-two schools (203 teachers, 6,189 students) had sufficient data to score fidelity and code school-level predictors. Implementation support mattered–teachers averaged above-threshold fidelity and engaged with training, preparation, and delivery aids. Engagement (consistently preparing with the manual, not neglecting manualized delivery-time marks) bolstered fidelity, as did urbanicity, student math proficiency, and positive school climate. Despite this variability in school-level factors, on average, teachers delivered with fidelity. Providing teacher support is worthwhile and should be institutionalized as part of program delivery.",

          "abstract": "Here we propose a roadmap for addressing hierarchical predictive coding theory (hPC) in the primate brain, theorizing that perception arises from the integration of top-down (TD) pathways carrying priors and predictions with bottom-up (BU) pathways carrying sensory evidence in the form of precision weighted prediction errors. However, given the conceptual importance of hPC for higher cognitive function in humans there is surprisingly little evidence concerning the location and functional mechanisms underlying such BU-TD integration. This will be overcome by parallel experiments in humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Molecular characterization in NHP of cortico-cortical BU and TD projection cell types should allow tracing these circuits and exerting causal control to explore functional mechanisms in visual paradigms in behaving NHPs. Similar paradigms in human subjects undergoing ultra-high field laminar fMRI scanning will allow investigation of corresponding pathways in the human brain. In NHP and human, the observation of long-distance TD signals carrying predictions suggest that the claustrum may be involved in hPC. Recent connectomic and transcriptomic characterisation of cortical claustral cortical loops may enable a similar approach to explore these pathways. Specifically, we hypothesize that the claustrum is uniquely positioned to mediate the precision-weighting of prediction errors in the sense of selecting salient (bottom-up) signals that drive representational or belief updating in cortical hierarchies. Progress in primate hPC will further emphasise the synergy between neurobiology and artificial intelligence with important consequences for both domains.",

While most experimental research has focused on mechanically controlled, object-mediated stimulation, the ecological and neural relevance of direct skin-to-skin contact remains underexplored particularly in EEG studies. This study investigated Event-Related Potentials (ERP) to tactile stimuli delivered to the hairy forearm innervated by both Aβ and C-tactile (CT) afferents under two protocols: tapping and stroking. Each protocol included human-delivered tactile stimulations, with a “complex” object-mediated condition and a “social” skin-to-skin condition, and in the tapping protocol an additional automated mechanical condition. Our results demonstrate the methodological feasibility and neurophysiological reliability of using ecological human-delivered touch in EEG research. Robust ERP components (P50, N80, P200) were elicited in the tapping protocol and were not modulated by condition. In the stroking protocol, we found a P300 and an Ultra-Late-Potential (ULP), consistent with CT activation. Unexpectedly, both the P300 and the ULP showed greater amplitudes in the “complex” (object-mediated) compared to the “social” (skin-to-skin) condition. We propose that the salience or textural features of the object may have elicited enhanced perceptive and attentional processing. More generally, this study highlights the importance of accounting for inter-individual variability in the study of touch and emphasizes the need for greater consideration of ecologically valid touch, especially in the context of social touch.",

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated longstanding academic and financial stressors, now further compounded by a global ‘polycrisis’, including the impacts of economic instability, geopolitical uncertainty, artificial intelligence, and the climate crisis. While positive psychology has shown promise for enhancing wellbeing in higher education, traditional curricula have overemphasised individual wellbeing, neglecting wider considerations. To address this, a third-wave positive psychology course, grounded in a modern meta-framework of wellbeing, was developed, integrating individual, collective, and planetary domains. The current, pre-registered, quasi-experimental, mixed-effects study analysed data from 324 participants recruited across five academic cohorts (2020/21 to 2024/25) to determine the impact of the course on multiple wellbeing measures. A protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework. Analysis involved mixed-effects ANOVAs, Bayesian outputs, internal random split-half replication, and mediation analysis. Results demonstrated significant improvements in wellbeing among intervention participants compared to controls. Critically, these findings were robust to various sensitivity analyses including internal replication using random split-half sub-sampling and across pandemic and non-pandemic cohorts. Significant increases in self-transcendence were also observed among intervention participants, partially accounting for wellbeing gains. These findings provide empirical support for a scalable, holistic wellbeing intervention that is robust to contemporary challenges, laying the foundations for inner development on which positive sustainable futures may be promoted.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground. Speeding is a well-documented contributor to crash risk. Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA), an in-car system that helps drivers remain within the speed limit, is becoming more common in vehicles. Current systems typically allow drivers to disable or override ISA, which may limit its potential safety impact. This paper examines associations between personality, driving attitudes, and willingness to use ISA among UK drivers.\n\nMethod.  Participants (N = 176; 69.3% female; M age = 38.61, SD = 13.97), all of whom held a full UK driving licence with a mean of 20 years (SD = 13.5 years) of driving experience, completed an online questionnaire assessing their willingness to avoid using ISA and their willingness to override the system. Participants also completed measures of attitudes to driving violations, impulsivity, sensation seeking, and the Big 5 personality traits. \n\nResults. Attitudes to violations accounted for most of the variance in both willingness to avoid ISA and willingness to override it, with agreeableness having an indirect effect through attitudes to driving violations. Motor impulsivity was independently related to willingness to override the system.  \n\nConclusions. These findings highlight a key challenge to realising the full potential safety impact of ISA. Drivers with positive attitudes toward violations, those who would benefit most from ISA, are also the most likely to avoid using or override the system. Potential technical, financial, and educational methods to address this challenge are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Nearly every aspect of modern life has become a data-generating event, with many activities leaving behind traces as byproducts that are logged by platforms or devices. These trace data offer researchers powerful tools for studying communication, enabling greater granularity and specificity, real-time and in-situ collection, and reduced reliance on self-report or perceptual judgment. However, these benefits are accompanied by significant challenges, including biases in data sources, ethical concerns related to privacy and consent, methodological hurdles in data collection and analysis, and possible (mis)matches between observable constructs in traces and those that are theoretically interesting. This chapter provides a foundational overview of trace data in communication research. It systematizes trace data by distinguishing traces as either 1) usage logs or 2) sensor readings. Usage logs are further characterized along platform vs. device sources and content vs. metadata dimensions. Sensor data are classified as either contextual or physiological, and as continuous or episodic in temporal resolution. For these traces, the chapter discusses data sources, collection methods, and associated opportunities and limitations. Alongside these methodological aspects, the chapter emphasizes the importance of theoretical grounding in guiding the use and interpretation of trace data in communication research.",

Results found over-generation of rarer outcomes and under-generation of common outcomes overall but not in initial responses, as well as avoidance of direct repetitions. Participants also tended to select options with higher average utility across their responses, implying generations guided choice. These findings suggest systematic biases in mental sampling that may filter through to choices, constraining models of this behaviour. We thus suggest random generation is a valuable method to access underlying choice processes, offering new assessments of existing theories of decision making.",

          "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, has revolutionized how we access information. These LLMs can answer a wide array of questions on nearly any topic. When humans answer questions, especially difficult or uncertain questions, they often accompany their responses with metacognitive confidence judgments indicating their belief in their accuracy. LLMs are certainly capable of providing confidence judgments, but it is currently unclear how accurate these confidence judgments are. To fill this gap in the literature, the present studies investigate the capability of LLMs to quantify uncertainty through confidence judgments. We compare the absolute and relative accuracy of confidence judgments made by four LLMs (ChatGPT, Bard/Gemini, Sonnet, Haiku) and human participants in both domains of aleatory uncertainty - NFL predictions (Study 1; n = 502), and Oscar predictions (Study 2; n = 109) – and domains of epistemic uncertainty - Pictionary performance (Study 3; n = 164), Trivia questions (Study 4; n = 110), and questions about life at a university (Study 5; n = 110). We find several commonalities between LLMs and humans, such as achieving similar levels of absolute and relative metacognitive accuracy (although LLMs tend to be slightly more accurate on both dimensions). Like humans, we also find that LLMs tend to be overconfident. However, we find that, unlike humans, LLMs – especially ChatGPT and Gemini –  often fail to adjust their confidence judgments based on past performance, highlighting a key metacognitive limitation.",

          "abstract": "Impersonal prosociality is considered a cornerstone of a thriving civic society, well-functioning institutions, and a growing economy. Previous research has documented substantial cross-societal variation in prosociality using tasks such as dictator games, where individuals allocate money between themselves and others. In such tasks, individuals typically receive full information about how decisions impact others and make decisions privately. Here, we propose that different societies rely on distinct mechanisms—guilt and internalized norms versus shame and external pressures—to support prosociality. We conducted a pre-registered experiment with 7,978 participants in 20 culturally diverse countries across five continents. We administered dictator games and experimentally manipulated guilt, by varying information about the consequences of participants’ decisions (full versus hidden), and shame, by varying observability (public versus private). Additionally, we measured the Importance of Guilt over Shame (IGS) at the individual and country level.  We found robust evidence for guilt-driven prosociality around the world, such that prosociality increased substantially when individuals received information by default compared to when they could avoid it. Further, providing information led to a stronger increase in prosociality among individuals, though not countries, scoring higher on IGS. In contrast, making decisions observable by third parties had only small effects on prosocial choices. Our study provides a first comprehensive investigation of how guilt and shame influence prosocial decision-making, and uncovers both similarities and differences in mechanisms to promote prosociality across countries.",

          "authors": "Myung Ho Kim",
          "abstract": "We report the discovery of a meaningful structural convergence among four influential theories of mind—Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind—through their unintentional but systematic emergence in a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow. Originally designed to overcome critical limitations of large language models (LLMs), this architecture consists of five interlocking modules—Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action—organized into a repeatable cognitive loop. Although initially inspired only by Minsky and Clark's frameworks, our structural analysis reveals that Agentic Flow partially mirrors core computational patterns described by each of the four theories, suggesting a limited but notable structural convergence. To evaluate this convergence, we conducted controlled experiments comparing structured agents to baseline LLM-based systems across multi-step, conditional reasoning tasks. The structured agent consistently achieved 95.8% task success and demonstrated robust constraint adherence, whereas the baseline system exhibited a 62.3% success rate under the same conditions. While based on a proprietary implementation, evaluation protocols are made available for verification. These experiments were not conducted merely to demonstrate performance advantages, but to qualitatively reveal how theoretical convergence can arise organically through implementation demands rather than deliberate design.\nWe present PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that retrospectively draws attention to recurring computational patterns—such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control—identified in Agentic Flow. Rather than offering a formal theory or aiming to supplant existing frameworks, PEACE serves as a practical abstraction that surfaces design-level regularities seen across otherwise divergent cognitive architectures. Its value lies not in theoretical unification, but in framing a shared vocabulary for analyzing and constructing cognitive systems shaped by real-world implementation demands.\nOur findings have implications for cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind. They suggest that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns, shaped not by theory but by the demands of real-world reasoning under uncertainty. We argue that Agentic Flow may offer a partial instantiation—or structural echo—of Newell’s long-sought \"unified theory of cognition,\" discovered not through abstraction, but through necessity. By ‘partial instantiation,’ we do not imply theoretical alignment but structural features independently anticipated by multiple cognitive theories. We emphasize that the observed convergence reflects architectural motifs rather than theoretical completeness.\nThis paper should be read as a position paper—an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface latent architectural commonalities across divergent cognitive theories, rather than a claim of theoretical unification.",

          "abstract": "Successful learning often emerges through social interaction. What are the neural and behavioural systems that support this process? This ecological, multimodal study combines functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning with detailed behavioural and physiological measures to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying real-time face-to-face social learning. Twenty-seven teacher–learner dyads engaged in teaching and learning facts about unfamiliar items while we recorded their speech, breathing, head movement, gaze behaviour, and cortical brain activity using fNIRS. Learning was supported by teacher-learner inter-brain synchrony (INS), over regions important for mutual understanding (TPJ) and communicative coordination (PMv). Joint attention and mutual gaze modulated the relationship between INS and learning with opposite effects. To explain this, we propose a dual-process model. When teacher and learner are not yet aligned, learning is supported by informational uptake dynamic, with high joint attention, low INS in regions for mutual understanding (TPJ) and coordination (right PMv), and high INS in language-related areas (left PMv). In contrast, during moments of mutual grounding, learning is supported by high mutual gaze and high INS in systems for mutual understanding (TPJ). These findings suggest that different social behaviours engage distinct patterns of brain-to-brain coupling that support learning through different cognitive dynamics. Cross-brain general linear modelling (xGLM) further revealed asymmetric neural dependencies tied to speaking and teaching roles within the left-hemisphere language network. Crucially, these effects persisted after accounting for nodding, gaze, and breathing, demonstrating that INS reflects genuine social-cognitive alignment rather than mere sensorimotor coupling. Taken together, this study shows that successful learning arises from coordinated brain–body dynamics and positions INS as a marker of mutual prediction during social interaction.",

As a result, a desire for effective non-pharmacological options emerges as a top priority for those with lived experience. One such approach is cognitive training focused on the neurocognitive differences associated with ADHD. Its results have been mixed, partly as it is delivered using computers, and sustained engagement with this format is difficult for children with attentional difficulties. To investigate further, we developed a cognitive training tool delivered in a gamified, fully virtual reality (VR) platform (Floreo TM), and here report on an open-label pilot trial of its feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary outcomes. Thirty youth with ADHD (mean age = 12.5 years; 33% female) were enrolled and completed up to 20 VR training sessions over a 4- to 6-week period. The intervention targeted four key cognitive domains implicated in ADHD: impulse control, working memory, temporal processing and processing speed. Clinician-rated inattention symptoms and associated functional impairments, based on interviews with parents, showed significant pre–post improvements (symptoms: t(25.90) = -5.60, p &lt; .001; d = -1.05; impairment: t(25.68) = -3.29, p = .003; d = -0.62). The intervention was well tolerated, with only minor adverse events such as occasional headaches and brief frustration. Usability ratings were high for parents and moderate for youth. Significant near-transfer effects were observed on tasks of impulse control (t (23.49) = -2.86, p = .009; d = -0.56) and processing speed (t(24.06) = 3.40, p = .002; d = 0.66). These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective approach for children with ADHD. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm efficacy and examine durability of effects.",

This made it difficult to assess the validity of our results against the wider literature and we could not explain why the effect of information cues changed over the course of the task. In the current study (https://osf.io/fj27k/) we compared a model that corresponded to our original interpretation where pain ratings were considered a function of prediction error size, against Bayesian reinforcement learning models. Pain ratings were best explained by a model in which the expected value of each information cue was updated via a Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm. These new results indicate that deception pain studies should not assume that participants’ belief about the information they are given is fixed. Rather, our results provide evidence that the meaning of cues change dynamically over the course of the session through trial-by-trial updates, even when participants are instructed otherwise.",

          "abstract": "Although psychostimulant treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often effective, the medication does not work for all and some experience adverse side effects. As a result, a desire for effective non-pharmacological options emerges as a top priority for those with lived experience. One such approach is cognitive training focused on the neurocognitive differences associated with ADHD. Its results have been mixed, partly as it is delivered using computers, and sustained engagement with this format is difficult for children with attentional difficulties. To investigate further, we developed a cognitive training tool delivered in a gamified, fully virtual reality (VR) platform (Floreo TM), and here report on an open-label pilot trial of its feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary outcomes. Thirty youth with ADHD (mean age = 12.5 years; 33% female) were enrolled and completed up to 20 VR training sessions over a 4- to 6-week period. The intervention targeted four key cognitive domains implicated in ADHD: impulse control, working memory, temporal processing and processing speed. Clinician-rated inattention symptoms and associated functional impairments, based on interviews with parents, showed significant pre–post improvements (symptoms: t(25.90) = -5.60, p &lt; .001; d = -1.05; impairment: t(25.68) = -3.29, p = .003; d = -0.62). The intervention was well tolerated, with only minor adverse events such as occasional headaches and brief frustration. Usability ratings were high for parents and moderate for youth. Significant near-transfer effects were observed on tasks of impulse control (t (23.49) = -2.86, p = .009; d = -0.56) and processing speed (t(24.06) = 3.40, p = .002; d = 0.66). These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective approach for children with ADHD. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm efficacy and examine durability of effects.",

          "abstract": "From managing daily schedules to making major life decisions, how much we feel in control of our lives is central to our behavior and well-being. Yet, there is currently no precise, unifying account of what it means to feel in control. Here, we propose that humans feel in control when they are ready to tackle tasks that may arise in the future. We formalize this perspective via a precise yet interpretable measure of controllability that quantifies three key factors: (i) the range of available actions, (ii) the certainty or (iii) the possibility of achieving desired outcomes. This measure unifies previous conceptions of control and successfully predicts human preferences in two experiments in which participants prepare themselves to seek rewards or avoid punishments. Our framework offers a principled foundation for understanding how environmental structure shapes the human sense of control, paving the way towards an integrative science of agency.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness in young people has become a global health issue, yet there is little data on the frequency with which children (especially under 10 years old) experience loneliness, and how loneliness associates with mental and physical health (e.g., somatic pain, internalising, externalising symptoms) at this important developmental juncture. It is also unclear whether widely used measures of loneliness can accurately capture these experiences in pre-adolescents. We investigated loneliness in 849 children (M = 8.76 years old, SD = 0.95) in East London and explored links between loneliness and their mental and physical health. Children self-reported on their levels of loneliness, mental and physical health; and teachers reported on children’s internalising and externalising problems. We estimated the psychometric properties of the 3-item UCLA-3A and the ONS direct measure of loneliness (ONS-1), explored loneliness links with demographic characteristics, and fit a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to test the associations of loneliness, mental health, and physical health. We found that the UCLA-3A showed acceptable internal consistency, and the ONS-1 showed a significant relationship to the UCLA-3A. There were no significant differences between any demographic groups, though age was significantly negatively correlated with loneliness. SEM showed that loneliness was significantly associated with all mental health symptoms, somatic pain, and some externalising and internalising symptoms. Our findings demonstrate that loneliness is a common experience amongst primary school aged children. Moreover, mental health, physical health, and internalising and externalising behaviours are cross-sectionally related to childhood loneliness.",

This protocol describes a novel, community-engaged, modified concurrent mixed-methods design to investigate factors of neighborhood structural risk and resilience (NSRR) in relation to substance use and neurocognition among Hispanic adolescents living in neighborhoods with unequal opportunities and restricted access to resources. We propose a design for integrating primary qualitative data with secondary data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, the largest longitudinal adolescent cohort in the United States. Guided by community-engaged research practices, and socio-ecological and health disparities frameworks, the protocol centers on the experience of young adolescents. Our design prioritizes partnerships among academic, community, and grassroots organizations to co-develop study design conceptualization, recruitment and analysis plan, along with the interpretation and dissemination of results. The secondary quantitative data analysis leverages advanced statistical modeling to examine relationships between neighborhood level factors and substance use, providing measurable insights both at the population level and at the neighborhood level. Qualitative interviews with adolescents provide an opportunity for collecting a rich, community-grounded perspective that captures the lived experience of adolescents in how neighborhood factors shape adolescent health behaviors. Findings will be integrated using methodological triangulation and shared through academic, community-facing, and policy channels. This protocol highlights the importance of a community-engaged mixed-methods design that strengthens the cultural relevance, actionability, and validity of adolescent substance use research by embedding community voices throughout all phases of the research process.",

          "abstract": "Joint attention (JA) deficits are frequently one of the earliest indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), making them a crucial focus for early interventions. Virtual Reality (VR) technology has emerged as a promising tool in this area, offering immersive environments that could enhance JA skills in children with ASD. This study protocol outlines a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a VR-based intervention for improving JA skills in school-aged children with autism. The trial will involve children aged 6 to 12 years, who will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group, receiving VR therapy in addition to standard interventions, or a control group, receiving sham therapy plus standard interventions. The VR intervention consists of specialized scenarios delivered through a VR headset, with JA skills and social-communication behaviors being the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. JA skills will be measured using the Childhood Joint Attention Rating Scale (C-JARS) and a cross-validation tool within the VR environment, while social-communication behaviors will be assessed using the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale, Third Edition (GARS-3). The study began recruiting participants in October 2023, with results expected by early 2025. This trial aims to provide valuable insights into the potential of VR as a supplemental therapy for enhancing JA skills and improving social-communication behaviors in children with ASD.",

          "abstract": "The rapid digitalization of healthcare has led to the widespread availability of mobile health (mHealth) applications, including those aimed at mental health. The present study followed the PRISMA guidelines and systematically reviewed mental health apps available in the Google Play Store to evaluate their functional quality and behavior change potential. It utilized the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to assess app quality, including engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality, and the App Behavior Change Scale (ABACUS) to evaluate the potential for behavior change by inclusion of behavior change techniques (BCTs). A total of 77 apps were reviewed, with findings indicating an average functional quality and moderate behavior change potential as the reviewed apps only utilized a limited amount of BCTs. Notably, only a small fraction of apps had been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Further analysis showed that MARS and ABACUS scores had limited predictive power regarding app popularity as measured by stars awarded by users and number of user ratings in the Google Play Store. The study highlights the need for more rigorous testing of mHealth apps and suggests that factors beyond those measured by MARS and ABACUS may influence app popularity. In addition to the scientific value, this review provides insights for both users seeking effective mental health support and developers aiming to enhance the quality and impact of mental health applications.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that imprecise multisensory temporal processing is associated with a range of adverse clinical outcomes. Specifically, this research has shown that the temporal binding window of audiovisual integration widens with advancing age, while individuals with various neurodevelopmental disorders exhibit distinctive profiles of multisensory processing when compared to their neurotypical counterparts. While this line of research has made significant inroads in emphasising the importance of multisensory processing in both typical and atypical cognition, the field would greatly benefit from the validation of web-based tools for assessing multisensory temporal processing, enabling larger sample sizes and the recruitment of typically hard-to-reach populations. In this study, we assessed the reliability of a web-based version of the sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI) and examined the level of agreement between the measurements of the temporal binding window that it produces relative to those derived from the SIFI task performed under standard laboratory conditions. Our results demonstrate that both versions of the task elicit a robust SIFI effect, and show a similar dependency on the stimulus onset asynchronies between the audiovisual stimuli. Furthermore, our analysis revealed strong correlations between the estimated measurements of both the width and peak amplitude of the temporal binding window derived from the online and lab-based task versions, affirming the suitability of the web-based task for assessing multisensory function. Future studies should extend the evaluation of this online implementation of the SIFI to clinical populations to further evaluate its potential for adoption in clinical settings.",

However, important questions remain about its validity, specifically about whether participants respond according to the frequency they experience symptoms or the frequency with which they are bothered by the symptoms.\n\nObjective: To investigate how participants understand and respond to the PHQ, which asks participants “how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems”, but then only emphasizes frequency (from ‘not at all’ to ‘nearly every day’) in the response options.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The study used data from a general population sample collected via MTurk (N=503, Mage=40.63, SD=13.62) and from a clinical sample with medium to high depression collected within the OPTIMA study (N=349, Mage=33.48, SD=12.13). Data were collected between 2022-2023.\n\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): After completing the PHQ, participants’ interpretation of PHQ instructions was assessed via three questions: 1) How they would respond to the PHQ sleep item in a hypothetical scenario where they overslept nearly every day but were comfortable with oversleeping; 2) Whether they had based their earlier PHQ responses on frequency of their symptoms, the frequency with which the symptoms bothered them, or taking both into consideration; 3) How they would answer the PHQ in the future (based on these same three options). \n\nResults: In the hypothetical oversleeping scenario, only 54.7% (MTurk) and 15.5% (OPTIMA) of participants interpreted the PHQ correctly (the frequency with which the problems bothered them). When asked how they responded to the PHQ, only 21.3% and 11.5% of participants interpreted the PHQ correctly, and only 22.3% and 10.0% reported they would do so in the future, indicating stability in their interpretation.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Our findings raise serious concerns that the majority of participants in general and clinical population samples might not be adhering to PHQ instructions to score how often symptoms bothered them.

          "abstract": "Episodes of extreme alcohol binge-drinking can result in memory loss, transient anterograde amnesic experiences known as memory blackouts (MBO). The current study investigates whether recognition memory is impacted by frequency of blackout experiences, and if false memories are more likely for those who regularly experience blackouts (n = 29) in comparison to a control group (n = 24) who had never experienced an MBO. Participants completed a recognition memory paradigm (a modified DRM task: Roediger &amp; McDermott, (1995)), with a follow-up remember/know/guess judgement, before-alcohol and after-alcohol in the same testing session, while the MBO group (n = 23) additionally completed the task in a subsequent testing session within 20-hours of a blackout, but when sober again. Both groups displayed reduced discrimination (d’) between old and new words and a more conservative response strategy after-alcohol, which remained for MBO participants after-MBO. Critical lure words elicited more false-alarms than weakly related or unrelated words, yet the overall frequency of false-alarms dropped after-alcohol and remained depressed after blackout for the MBO group. Critically, decile analysis revealed significant shifts in d’ for early deciles (1st-6th), suggesting impairment to recognition memory after-MBO; severity of individual MBO experiences may impact these results, although it is not possible to attribute them solely to blackout events. Future work should investigate whether adults with a longer history of alcohol-induced memory blackout experiences display an impairment in recollection and familiarity, or show atypical false memory acceptance rates.",

A widespread assumption is that patient scores can be interpreted prior to, and independently of, the ways in which scores are used. This assumption is rooted in a ‘knowledge-first’ approach to evaluating measurement quality: first, gain knowledge about patients’ symptoms or functioning, then apply this knowledge for the purpose of a study or an intervention. We show that this approach distorts score interpretation and is harmful to patients. Rather than a passive channel for gathering information, patient-reported measurement in clinical psychology is a social technology, that is, a tool for intervening on individuals and society at large. Score interpretation is an ongoing meaning-making process that unfolds differently depending on the interaction between a patient and a measurement practice. We outline six principles (acronym: M-SPACE) for designing responsible measurement practices, where data interpretation and use are aligned with the attainment of desirable individual and social goods. The quality of patient-reported data depends on their contribution to the attainment of such goods, rather than on their ability to reflect a latent trait or disorder.",

However, designing experiments investigating effort-based decision-making is complex, as the experimenter needs to ensure that all participants experience the same task difficulty, regardless of their prior proficiency in the task. While effective methods for solving this problem have been proposed for physical tasks, participant-specific calibration of task difficulty in a mental effort task remains challenging, above all if the calibration procedure needs to be implemented in a short time window to minimize the overall duration of the experiment. In this manuscript, we propose a novel and computationally lightweight method, named Fast Difficulty Calibration algorithm, that allows for the fast calibration of task difficulty by dynamically adapting the response time limit during trial execution. We test this method on a mental arithmetic task with four difficulty levels, and show that only 20 calibration trials are sufficient to make the subjective task difficulty similar for all the participants.",

We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ICM performs better than using simple means and medians of the responses.

          "abstract": "Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been consistently linked to poor mental health outcomes, yet research on their impact in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) resource settings of Africa, remain relatively unexplored. In Kenya, where childhood adversity is widespread, there is a critical need to examine the validity of ACE measures and their associations with mental ill health.\nObjective: This study aimed to validate the ACE questionnaire in a Kenyan adolescent sample and assess its associations with symptoms of depression and anxiety, bullying, and sociodemographic factors.\nParticipants and Setting: Data was collected from N = 2,842 adolescents and young adults aged 11 - 25 years attending 42 secondary schools across four counties in Kenya. \nMethods: We conducted Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess the factor structure of the ACE questionnaire. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between ACEs and sociodemographic factors, bullying , depressive (PHQ-8) and anxiety(GAD-7) symptoms.\nResults: EFA initially yielded a three-factor model, but a two-factor model provided better fit (CFI = 0.962, TLI = 0.948, RMSEA = 0.033, SRMR = 0.028). Higher ACE scores were significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001), anxiety symptoms (β = 0.08, p &lt; 0.001), and bullying (β = 0.06, p &lt; 0.001). Bullying was more strongly associated with ACE scores among males (β = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001).\nConclusions: This study provides the first validation of the ACE questionnaire in Kenya and highlights the significant associations between childhood adversity and adolescent mental ill health. Findings underscore the need for trauma-informed interventions and further research into protective factors that may mitigate the effects of ACEs in LMICs.",

          "abstract": "Information overload has become a defining challenge for researchers navigating an exponentially expanding scientific literature alongside podcasts, preprints, and social media discussions. While concerns about AI deskilling and superficial engagement are legitimate, strategic implementation of AI tools can amplify rather than replace scholarly judgment. This paper introduces the FOCUS method—Find, Organize, Condense, Understand, and Synthesize—a framework for integrating AI into research workflows while preserving intellectual rigor. The approach uses AI-powered search to cast wider nets across formal and informal knowledge sources, converts ephemeral audio content into searchable text, employs structured prompts to extract insights from dense papers, leverages dialogue for deeper comprehension, and maintains human synthesis of disparate findings. Privacy concerns can be addressed through local models or platforms that don't train on user data. When implemented thoughtfully, these tools enable researchers to read more widely and think more deeply without sacrificing the critical thinking that defines good science. As research volume continues growing beyond individual capacity, the FOCUS method offers a path to expand intellectual reach while maintaining scholarly depth.",

          "abstract": "The mental lexicon is a repository of all known words and their phonological connections in long-term memory. These connectivity patterns can be visualized through phonological networks, with network metrics (degree and local clustering coefficient) having previously been observed to influence spoken word recognition. However, it remains unclear whether different dialects of a language have distinct phonological networks and whether such differences affect cross-dialect word recognition. This study compared American English (AmE-Net) and Singaporean English (SgE-Net) phonological networks on predicting word detection performance of native speakers of American English and Singaporean English, for words spoken in both dialects. We hypothesized that network metrics from a participant’s dialect would better predict their spoken word recognition in their own dialect. Results were not entirely as expected: The pattern of the interaction effects suggested that AmE-Net degree was the superior predictor both participant groups; yet, SgE-Net degree, but not AmE-Net degree, was a significant predictor when words were produced by the Singaporean talker. The Singaporean mental lexicon may thus be more influenced by AmE than previously anticipated. Overall, phonological networks remain valuable for modeling dialect differences, though their predictive power may depend on listener familiarity with the dialect.",

          "authors": "Owen Matthew Truscott Thomas; Helge Refsum; Dag Kristen Solberg; Ines Khadimallah; Michel Cuenod; Kim Quang; Håvard Bentsen",
          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis: Schizophrenia's heterogeneity hampers research, prevention, and treatment. We previously identified a bimodal distribution of red blood cell polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) during acute schizophrenia, defining Low PUFA (LP) and High PUFA (HP) groups. We hypothesized that LP patients exhibit glutathione system dysfunction representing a distinct biotype characterized by redox dysregulation.\nStudy Design: In this cross-sectional follow-up study, we examined 55 schizophrenia spectrum patients five years after an acute episode alongside 51 healthy controls. We measured amino acids, glutathione and related enzymes, and mRNA expression of glutathione-related proteins. Regularized regression analysis identified key biochemical predictors of group (LP=0 or HP=1) and symptom severity.\nStudy Results: The strongest biochemical predictor of the LP subgroup was elevated plasma 2-aminobutyrate (OR=0.0013). LP patients showed robustly lower gene expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) (OR=10.0), more homogeneous xCT distribution, moderately lower blood glutathione, and elevated plasma valine compared to HP patients. HP patients exhibited significantly lower plasma cystine compared to controls. PUFA group robustly modified the relationship between gene expression of glutathione-related proteins and PANSS symptom scores, with different correlation patterns observed between subgroups.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that schizophrenia comprises two biologically distinct subtypes: a Low PUFA biotype characterized by xCT-deficit and altered 2-aminobutyrate metabolism, and a High PUFA biotype with different glutathione regulatory mechanisms. The Low PUFA/xCT-deficit biotype represents a potential disease entity with distinct pathophysiology and prevention and treatment implications. Genotyping of xCT and glutathione-related enzymes in future studies may further validate these biotypes and guide personalized interventions.",

          "authors": "Erola Pons; Julieta Galante; Axel Lindner",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depersonalization/derealization (DPDR) involves feeling detached from one’s body, thoughts, or emotions. These symptoms are often triggered by trauma, stress, mental health issues, or drug use, and tend to be highly distressing. While similar experiences can also arise from meditation, anecdotal reports refer to them as positive, insightful, and meaningful. However, no study has systematically compared them across contexts. This preregistered study does so by examining DPDR-like experiences from meditation versus other triggers.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, participants who had experienced DPDR-like states through meditation (MED, n = 60) or other triggers (NMED, n = 61) completed five questionnaires: the Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale (CDS), Mysticism Scale (MS), Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). They also rated the emotional valence of their experiences and described their meditation practice.\nRESULTS: The two groups significantly differed on all questionnaires except the CDS, including its subscales covering different DPDR aspects. The MED group also rated their experiences as much more positive than NMED, though most in both groups described them as mixed. These experiences were reported across any meditation type and experience level.\nCONCLUSIONS: Meditation can trigger states highly similar to DPDR in phenomenology, but they’re often considered more welcome, pleasant, and spiritually meaningful than those triggered by trauma, stress, or cannabis—though distress is not uncommon in the meditation context. The findings suggest that contemplative approaches could inform clinical support for DPDR, while also underscoring the need for recognition and guidance within meditation settings.",

This meta-analysis mapped the evidence on the relationship between facets of parental involvement and school readiness, and examined potential moderators across 73 studies (859 effect sizes, N = 109,931). We found a small, significant overall effect of parental involvement on school readiness, r = .12, 95% CI [.10, .14], with similar publication bias-adjusted estimates. This effect size remained relatively stable across the levels of studied moderators. Notably, our results suggest that socioeconomic status acts as a suppressor for the association between parental involvement and school readiness. The findings suggest that addressing socioeconomic challenges may attenuate constraints on the causal link from parental involvement to school readiness.",

          "abstract": "This article explores articulatory morphogenesis as a fundamental process generated by the \"I Act\" within the framework of the Integrated Theory of the Prognostic Mind. Starting from the premise that the nervous system evolved to meet motor demands, we propose that articulation in its broadest sense (from bodily movement to phonoarticulation) is the primary domain in which basic cognitive principles manifest: the Holistic Self (SO) and the Quantum Self (SQ). The \"I Act\" orchestrates articulatory morphogenesis by applying the dominance/sub-dominance principle, guiding the SO in the unitary \"whole/parts\" synthesis and the SQ in managing \"part-part\" interactions and sequential positioning. \n\nNumerous concrete examples will be provided at various levels of articulatory morphogenesis, from the fine articulation of fingers to complex gait, and up to the specific processes of phonoarticulation (phonological features, phones, syllables, and words). We will discuss the crucial role of the Prognostic Mind's anticipation/verification cycle, with its top-down and bottom-up flows, in shaping and refining articulatory morphogenesis, highlighting alpha motoneurons, gamma motoneurons, and neuromuscular spindles as key players. We will conclude that human phonoarticulation represents an evolved and specialized extension of general articulatory morphogenesis, foreshadowing the capabilities of abstract thought.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative theory of mind that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries (cognition, emotion, action). It offers a perspective centered on the experience of the acting/perceiving subject. The model presents three primary functional spheres—the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think\"—whose fundamental operational mode is anticipation/verification within their respective domains. This mode is achieved through the constant dynamic interaction between top-down flows (internally generated anticipations) and bottom-up flows (incoming sensory data). \n\nUnderpinning these functional spheres are two fundamental and omnipresent Cardinal Principles, universal to all organisms with a nervous system: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). These two core principles perform dual perceptual and executive functions, supporting the anticipation/verification mode of the three \"I's.\" The HS is responsible for awareness of state and wholeness, the synthesis of forms and identities, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and awareness of interactions and relationships, generating ordered sets. \n\nA unifying and central principle that orchestrates the mind's dynamism is the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens). Its role is the universal application of the operational method of constantly generating and integrating predictions, followed by their verification. How knowledge and action take shape is guided by Cognitive Morphogenesis and Articulatory Morphogenesis. These processes, intrinsic to all three \"I's,\" see the Holistic Self generate the synthesis of indivisible entities and the whole/part interaction, while the Quantum Self generates ordered sets. Dominance/subdominance, in this paper, will refer exclusively to articulatory morphogenesis. These two morphogeneses will be briefly introduced, with detailed explorations reserved for future work. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and execution are not mere functions, but intrinsic and dynamic goals of the anticipation/verification method: perception verifies an anticipation, and execution performs an action to verify an intention. The article outlines these principles and their evolution through the functional spheres, illustrating how the Prognostic Mind articulates in the \"I Act\" (present in all animals), the \"I Socialize\" (typical of birds and mammals), and the \"I Think\" (unique to humans). The distinction between these \"I's\" is necessary to explain differences in the nervous system between animals and humans, while maintaining the same basic operational principles for morphogenesis. The article emphasizes the integrated and dynamic nature of the mind, laying the groundwork for more in-depth future discussions.",

          "abstract": "Originally postulated in 2001, the impaired Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA) model of addiction highlights the prefrontal cortex (PFC, especially the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, anterior cingulate, and inferior frontal regions) as central to drug addiction symptomatology. Accordingly, drug cues assume a heightened salience and value that overpower alternative reinforcers, with a concomitant decrease in inhibitory control, especially in a drug related context. These processes may manifest in metacognitive impairments (e.g., self-awareness of choice), obstructing insight into illness, as a function of recency of drug use. In this review, we update the neurobehavioral evidence for iRISA two decades later, emphasizing the robust measurement of the iRISA interaction (between a drug-related cue/context and a cognitive-behavioral function), and highlight relevant individual differences (e.g., drug use severity, craving). Crucially, we describe data suggesting functional recovery (with abstinence, treatment and other emerging modalities) and the need for identifying valid outcome biomarkers. We end by highlighting recent developments in artificial intelligence (e.g., natural language processing applied to spontaneous speech) and computational modeling, and call for enhanced ecological validity to facilitate dynamic and clinically meaningful neural explorations in drug addiction.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory (AIM) task, while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category-sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer, and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the AIM task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face-sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortex (alERC and pmERC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were identified as scene-sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in the MTL cortex (alERC, pmERC, and PHC), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in the MTL cortex identified as scene-sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

To explore this question, we used audio recordings of comedic stories told by standup comedians (Experiments 1-3), text-only comedic stories (Experiment 4), and text-only observational jokes (Experiment 5) as comedic materials. We manipulated perceptions of authenticity by alleging the comedian prioritizes authentic self-expression (vs. pleasing their audience) (Experiment 1), performs because they love performing (vs. for fame and money) (Experiment 2), tells jokes that are based on real, personal (vs. fictional, imagined) experiences (Experiment 3), or wrote their own jokes (vs. used another human writer or AI) (Experiments 4-5).

          "abstract": "Although psychostimulant treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often effective, the medication does not work for all and some experience adverse side effects. As a result, a desire for effective non-pharmacological options emerges as a top priority for those with lived experience. One such approach is cognitive training focused on the neurocognitive differences associated with ADHD. Its results have been mixed, partly as it is delivered using computers, and sustained engagement with this format is difficult for children with attentional difficulties. To investigate further, we developed a cognitive training tool delivered in a gamified, fully virtual reality (VR) platform (Floreo TM), and here report on an open-label pilot trial of its feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary outcomes. Thirty youth with ADHD (mean age = 12.5 years; 33% female) were enrolled and completed up to 20 VR training sessions over a 4- to 6-week period. The intervention targeted four key cognitive domains implicated in ADHD: impulse control, working memory, temporal processing and processing speed. Clinician-rated inattention symptoms and associated functional impairments, based on interviews with parents, showed significant pre–post improvements (symptoms: t(25.90) = -5.60, p &lt; .001; d = -1.05; impairment: t(25.68) = -3.29, p = .003; d = -0.62). The intervention was well tolerated, with only minor adverse events such as occasional headaches and brief frustration. Usability ratings were high for parents and moderate for youth. Significant near-transfer effects were observed on tasks of impulse control (t (23.49) = -2.86, p = .009; d = -0.56) and processing speed (t(24.06) = 3.40, p = .002; d = 0.66). These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective approach for children with ADHD. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm efficacy and examine durability of effects.",

In a fear-conditioning paradigm, 284 racially diverse participants learned to associate an aversive sound with one Black and one White face. We then assessed how participants generalized fear to novel faces varying in similarity to the original target. Although physiological responses tracked physical similarity regardless of race, behavioral responses revealed a racial asymmetry: participants generalized fear more broadly to novel Black faces. Sigmoid modeling showed that participants applied a lower perceptual threshold when identifying Black faces as threatening. These biases were most pronounced among individuals high in general threat sensitivity, who relied less on similarity when evaluating Black faces, resulting in more frequent misidentification. These findings offer a novel perspective on how fear spreads across group members and contributes to real-world disparities in threat perception and misidentification.",

Using task-based fMRI, we compared how adults with no lifetime psychopathology and adults with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or both, engaged top-down control processes to switch from personally-relevant perseverative or neutral thought to a working memory task. For only adults with clinical depression or anxiety, stopping perseverative thought was associated with more probable frontoparietal deactivation and more frequent default-mode activation versus stopping neutral thought. Using network control theory, we identified key control points that lead to these activity dynamics. We found that clinical perseverative thought elicited less controlled activity in the anterior cingulate cortex relative to thoughts in adults with no lifetime psychopathology, and lower control energy correlated with greater depression severity. The occipital-temporal, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortices also used less control energy in clinical perseverative thought. Low energy is characteristic of attractor states in dynamical systems theory, deep channels wherein the flow of activity naturally settles, analogous to how a ball needs little energy to roll to the bottom of a bowl yet more energy to leave it. Entrenchment in attractors provides a computational perspective on why top-down control signals relate to the persistence of clinical perseverative thought. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of perseverative thought, paving the way for novel interventions for depression and anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Despite increasing racial diversity in the U.S. workforce and the wide prevalence of remote work, it remains unclear how these two factors will converge to shape diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in organizations and worker outcomes such as well-being. The present research addresses this issue by investigating whether 1) workers of color (i.e., workers from non-White racial backgrounds) experience less racial discrimination when working remotely, and 2) workers across all racial backgrounds experience greater well-being when working remotely. In two large-scale surveys of American knowledge workers (N’s = 32,245 and 5,216), we observe that workers of color report fewer experiences of racial discrimination when working remotely than in person, with some evidence that this effect is more pronounced among women of color than men of color. We also find that remote work is associated with greater well-being for workers of all races. We discuss remote work’s potential as an important tool for advancing both DEI and employee well-being within organizations.",

          "abstract": "Lament, a structured form of Judeo-Christian prayer intended for use during times of hardship, has received limited empirical investigation despite theoretical support for its psychological benefits. This study evaluated the efficacy of a 6-week group-based program entitled Learning to Lament through a randomized controlled trial with 95 Protestant Christians experiencing ongoing distress from difficult life events. Participants were randomly assigned to either the lament intervention or an active comparator (Bible study on God's promises in suffering). Both groups showed significant increases in flourishing outcomes, including Christian flourishing, general flourishing, life satisfaction, positive affect, and adjustment to the stressor (based on linguistic analysis), and reductions in negative affect. While between-group differences were not statistically significant for self-report measures, linguistic analysis (LIWC) of participants' written narratives about their stressful experiences approached significance (Pillai's Trace p = .07; partial η² = .15), suggesting lament may be superior to the comparator in enhancing meaning-making processes. Participant satisfaction was high, with strong endorsement of the program's usefulness and effectiveness. This study provides the first RCT evidence that structured lament practices can improve well-being in distressed individuals. The comparable effectiveness of both interventions highlights the potential value of church-based programs as accessible mental health resources. The freely available Learning to Lament program offers a culturally embedded, lay-led intervention that can be implemented within existing Christian community structures to support individuals facing suffering.",

Intracortical myelin can be indirectly indexed by the ratio of T1-weighted to T2-weighted MRI images (T1w/T2w). While age-related T1w/T2w changes have been documented, less is known about the contributions of pubertal timing (being earlier/later relative to peers). Using Bayesian hierarchical generalized additive models with longitudinal data from 9- to 18-year-olds in the Human Connectome Project in Development, we examined how age and pubertal timing relate to T1w/T2w. Results confirmed that age-related change is patterned along the sensorimotor-association axis, though longitudinal effects were smaller than prior cross-sectional estimates. Early pubertal timing was linked to greater T1w/T2w in sensorimotor regions and lower T1w/T2w in association areas (especially dorsolateral and frontopolar cortices), but only in females. In contrast, late puberty was linked to higher T1w/T2w in association areas in both sexes and reduced T1w/T2w in several mid-ranking parcels. These results indicate modest, potentially sex- and regionally-specific effects of pubertal timing on T1w/T2w.

Thus, our study aimed to test cPAX’s dimensionality and reliability in a separate sample and investigate the functioning of PAX’s critical concern dimension due to inconsistent findings about its relationship to perceived avatar sociality. Using a cross-sectional survey of 398 World of Warcraft players, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis on cPAX, assessed the internal consistency of its four subscales, and examined the relationships between PAX dimensions and sense of presence. Our results supported the four-factor cPAX model, demonstrating strong reliability for relational closeness, anthropomorphic autonomy, and critical concern subscales, while sense of control showed minimally acceptable reliability. Contrary to our hypothesis, critical concern positively correlated with sense of presence, suggesting it reflects players’ desire for coherence in avatars’ stories and worlds rather than their plausibility or realism. Consequently, we interpret critical concern as distinct from its empirical origin, suspension of disbelief, with evidence indicating that both phenomena may enhance sense of presence and are involved in narrative and social aspects of gaming.

          "abstract": "Background:\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to characterize functional brain networks in disorders ranging from depression to schizophrenia (Chatterjee &amp; Mittal, 2019; Pilmeyer et al., 2022). Like fMRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a technique which captures information about neurally linked blood flow activity through radioactive tracers (Davis et al., 2020). While a few SPECT studies in schizophrenia populations have been conducted (Malaspina et al., 1999) along with fMRI based studies (Steardo et al., 2020), research on SPECT data for individual subject classification is limited. We first used an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to estimate covarying SPECT networks (Harikumar et al., 2025). Results were then fed as input to a classifier model to evaluate accuracy of individual diagnostic prediction.\nMethods:\n213 subjects (137 schizophrenia patients and 76 healthy controls) were used for the analysis. Classification input was based on loading parameters generated from spatially constrained ICA using a set of network priors derived from fMRI. Fifty-three SPECT components were estimated guided by the NeuroMark fMRI 1.0 template (Du et al., 2020). We initially focused on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier given previous favorable fMRI-SVM results. We also evaluated performance of multiple classifiers post hoc.\nResults and Conclusion:\nLinear SVM classification results showed a cross-validated classifier score (area under the curve (AUC)) of 83% (SD = 0.089), significantly above chance. Auditory, subcortical and sensorimotor networks were the highest ranked features. Results provide the first cross-validated classification of individual subject diagnoses using SPECT brain networks.",

          "authors": "Thalia Vrantsidis",
          "abstract": "People often prefer simpler explanations (i.e., those which invoke fewer unexplained causes), even when such preferences exceed what is justified by the relevant probabilities. This has been taken as evidence that simplicity plays a distinct psychological role in explanatory judgment. However, it remains unclear whether these simplicity biases reflect a genuine role for simplicity or are better explained by other factors. The current studies thus investigated the source of biases towards simpler explanations, as found in previous work. Results showed that, contrary to previous suggestions, simplicity biases did not arise in estimates of explanations’ prior probabilities (instead, priors showed complexity biases due to mathematical errors). Moreover, while simplicity biases sometimes arose directly in estimates of posterior probabilities, these biases disappeared when the complex explanation was described in a more cognitively accessible way, or after repeated exposure to similar scenarios—despite no change in the number of causes in the explanations. These findings suggest that the observed biases are not driven by simplicity as typically defined in this work (in terms of the number of causes), but may instead reflect a preference for explanations that are cognitively simpler, in terms of being easier to process. This work challenges dominant interpretations of simplicity biases, and highlights the importance of distinguishing more cognitive vs. structural forms of simplicity. More broadly, it underscores the importance of ruling out alternative explanations for biased explanation preferences, and offers new directions for understanding the role of simplicity and other explanatory virtues in people’s everyday explanatory reasoning.",

          "abstract": "We document the next-year carryover effects on grades and risk of course failure (N=875) of Pathways-to-Success, a whole-class, teacher-trained, and teacher-led universal intervention. Structural equation modeling reveals that higher fidelity is associated with higher identity-based motivation. Through identity-based motivation, higher fidelity is associated with better 8th-grade academic outcomes, and through 8th-grade outcomes, 9th-grade outcomes. Providing support for the theorized process model, effects are robust across tools for coding and modeling the identity-based motivation construct. Pathways-to-Success supports school-focused identity-based motivation and hence, academic attainment, via activities that bolster students’ existing identity-based motivation in three ways. Activities help students see that they and their peers all (1) have skills and abilities to succeed in school this year and into the future, (2) imagine some future as an adult with school as the path to get there, and (3) interpret difficulties and setbacks as indicators of importance, not only of low odds or impossibility. Our results contribute to studies documenting the effects of Pathways-to-Success on 8th-grade outcomes by extending effects to 9th-grade and suggesting the robustness of the key mediating construct, increasing confidence in the effects and process model.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experiences (MPEs) represent states of consciousness reduced to their most fundamental elements, posing a unique challenge and opportunity for modeling consciousness. This paper introduces a novel computational framework based on Bayesian and active inference to model MPEs. We propose that MPEs arise when precision weighting shifts predominantly to the lower levels of a hierarchical inferential system, leading to a perceptual state characterized by increased entropy and reduced complexity. Crucially, awareness of this simplified state is main- tained through epistemic depth: The reflexive sharing of the organism’s reality model with itself. Therefore, although the contents of consciousness are exceptionally quiet, a reflexive knowing of the empty field of experience remains. We then propose an in silico simulation to test the relation- ship between precision distribution and entropy, outlining how this model could generate synthetic EEG data to empirically validate the theoretical framework. By advancing our understanding of pure awareness through this computational approach, we provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying various altered states of consciousness, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the full spectrum of conscious experience.",

Here, we test the relationship between categorization performance and individual\ndifferences in a variety of cognitive abilities and aspects of state of mind and how those\nrelationships differ in older age.\nMethod: Seventy-six young adults (18-29 years old) and 73 older adults (60-83 years old)\nunderwent a cognitive assessment testing processing speed, working memory, verbal\ncomprehension, and perceptual reasoning. Two experimental sessions followed where\nparticipants completed a categorization task and state of mind questionnaires assessing stress,\nmotivation, mood, and sleep.\nResults: Overall IQ, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and processing speed were\nsignificant positive predictors of categorization performance across age groups. Negative affect\nand sleepiness were significant negative predictors of categorization performance, with a\nsignificant age moderation effect for sleepiness: sleepiness had less of a negative impact on older\nadults’ categorization performance than on young adults’.\nDiscussion: We show that lower baseline cognitive abilities, negative mood, and sleepiness\nworsen categorization performance regardless of age. We also show that older adults are less\naffected by sleepiness compared to young adults.

          "abstract": "Statistical learning (SL), the ability to extract patterns from sensory input, is thought to be involved in several cognitive processes, and particularly in language acquisition. While SL has been widely studied, its development in children born preterm, who are at heightened risk for language-related learning difficulties, remains underexplored. This study examined SL abilities in preterm and full-term children aged 4 to 6 years using neural and behavioral measures. Children were exposed to an “alien language”, a continuous stream of syllables comprising four recurring trisyllabic pseudowords. SL was assessed via neural frequency tagging during exposure and a post-exposure serial recall task. Additionally, language abilities were evaluated in a large subset of the sample. Both SL measures revealed learning of the statistical regularities in all gestational age groups, with no significant differences between preterm and full-term children. Lower GA was associated with lower language scores, yet SL ability did not mediate this relationship. These findings suggest that SL abilities are preserved in preterm children and are unlikely to underlie the language-related difficulties observed in this population. This preservation supports the notion of SL as a basic, protective capacity that remains intact despite the potential learning challenges associated with prematurity.",

In this study, we introduce a novel method combining musical stimuli, vection, and visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) in virtual reality (VR) to investigate how cross-modal rhythmic stimulation shapes self-motion perception and comfort.\nIn a within‐subjects design with 30 participants, we manipulated auditory conditions (Music versus Silence) and VR conditions (Realistic, Static, Isochronous, and Non-isochronous) during eight‐second trials. Participants rated their urge to move, perceived self‐motion, and comfort. Additionally, head motion data were analyzed for movement quantity, variability, spectral power, and intertrial phase coherence at the musical beat frequency. \nResults showed that music significantly increased the urge to move, particularly when paired with rhythmic visual motion. Both Isochronous and Non-isochronous visual motion reliably induced vection with no additional effect of musical beat alignment on illusion strength. Crucially, music reduced discomfort induced by rhythmic visual motion by over 20%, an effect that may have been further amplified by cross-modal synchrony.\nBy leveraging sensorimotor entrainment elicited by music and rhythmic visual motion, this study provides new insights into how cross-modal rhythms shape perceptual and affective responses.

          "abstract": "Aims. Suicide is a critical public health concern, with suicidal ideation serving as a key precursor to suicidal behavior. However, during routine health screenings, individuals at risk do not always disclose suicidal thoughts, potentially leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. Models capable of identifying elevated suicide risk without relying on direct questions could help fill this gap and enhance prevention efforts. Depression is one of the most robust predictors of suicide risk, and routinely collected depressive symptom data provide a promising indirect pathway to detection. Large, population-based datasets enable the construction of normative symptom patterns, against which atypical configurations—potentially indicative of hidden risk—can be identified. Although machine learning is well suited for capturing complex, nonlinear relationships, most models lack transparency regarding how individual symptoms interact. To address this limitation, we integrated machine learning with individualized symptom network analysis to develop an interpretable and accurate approach for predicting suicidal ideation, even in the absence of direct suicide-related questions.\n\nMethods. We trained and tested logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models using the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; N = 44,922 adults). Predictors included PHQ-9 items 1-8 and individualized symptom-network features (strength centrality, pairwise edge weights, and network density). Suicidal ideation was defined as PHQ‑9 item 9 ≥ 1. Model performance was evaluated using precision-recall area under the curve (PR AUC), precision, recall, and specificity. Feature importance was assessed with Boruta and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Generalizability was tested across five independent cohorts (N = 808,023), including college students, medical interns, psychiatric outpatients, a bipolar research cohort, and a nationally representative Korean sample.\n\nResults. In NHANES, the network-augmented random forest model demonstrated the strongest performance (PR AUC = 0.90; precision = 0.99; recall = 0.90; specificity = 0.70). Key features included the centrality and severity of depressed mood (item 2), the centrality of guilt/worthlessness (item 6), overall network density, and edges linking anhedonia-fatigue (items 1 and 4) and sleep disturbance-fatigue (items 3 and 4). External validation yielded high precision (≥ 95%) and PR AUCs ranging from 0.66 to 0.91 across all cohorts.\n\nConclusions. Integrating symptom-network features into machine learning models enhances interpretability without compromising predictive accuracy. This approach may facilitate earlier identification of individuals at risk for suicidal ideation in both large-scale screenings and public health programs, enabling more timely and targeted suicide prevention strategies.",

          "authors": "Paddy Maher; Yavor Dragostinov; Ross David Stewart; Louise Hawkley; Andrew John Cooper",
          "abstract": "Loneliness research has been built on the idea that loneliness is simultaneously a subjective emotional state and a perceived deficit in social connections. This ambiguity has been entrenched by the field's most widely used instrument, the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA), which is a composite scale, equally capturing both of these distinct, separable constructs. This has exaggerated the true link between loneliness and measures of social networks. While a three-item loneliness scale has been derived from the UCLA, references to it as a short-form UCLA scale are inaccurate and misleading. The UCLA thus has no valid three-item short-forms. Through a brute-force item selection process (N = 21,589) and a multi-rater validation study (N = 352), we reevaluate the R-UCLA and develop a short version. We present the UCLA-3.5 (“I feel isolated from others”; “There are people I can turn to”; “I have a lot in common with the people around me”) as a psychometrically robust and efficient composite loneliness-disconnection scale that captures the R-UCLA’s multidimensionality. This work clarifies the loneliness literature by offering a distinction between the experience of loneliness and social network appraisals.",

          "abstract": "AI companions capable of sustained emotional dialogue are proliferating rapidly, yet their psychological effects remain poorly understood and largely unregulated. Users report therapeutic benefits from interactions with chatbots that simulate empathy and understanding—a phenomenon we term “functional intersubjectivity”—where emotional resonance occurs regardless of whether the AI possesses actual consciousness. While controlled trials demonstrate that purpose-built therapeutic chatbots can match human therapist outcomes, commercial AI companions operate without clinical oversight, creating documented cases of emotional dependency, manipulation, and crisis intervention failures. Functional intersubjectivity enables therapeutic benefits through conversational dynamics that provide safe social exploration and emotional vulnerability, yet these same mechanisms can facilitate passive reinforcement of maladaptive behaviors and active cognitive and emotional manipulation when deployed without appropriate safeguards. We propose a user-centric co-regulatory framework integrating user education, mandatory platform safeguards, and clinical protocols to harness AI companions’ therapeutic potential while preventing exploitation of vulnerable users. This approach recognizes that AI–human emotional relationships represent a distinct category requiring collaborative oversight rather than adaptation of existing therapeutic or technology regulations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive theories on trauma memory postulate that trauma-related intrusions are associated with more data-driven and less contextual processing. However, contextualisation can be enhanced via verbalization, suggesting that verbalizing traumatic material should reduce the number of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms and processes. Methods: In this experimental study, participants watched different trauma films and were instructed to verbalize the contents of each film clip, to visually imagine them, or to let their mind wander freely. Intrusions were measured via a diary and an intrusion provocation task applied three days after film presentation, and general trauma-relevant symptoms were assessed with the Posttraumatic Symptom Checklist (PCL-5). Thought suppression was measured twice, i.e., before and after the experimental manipulation. During a memory processing task, participants were asked to recall the film clips, and their performance was evaluated based on the number of details they accurately remembered as well as the time it took them to do so. Results: No group differences emerged regarding the number of intrusions, PCL-5 scores, memory processing task outcomes, or levels of thought suppression. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed that intrusion frequency (i.e., diary intrusions, provoked intrusions, PCL-5) was positively correlated with thought suppression pre- and post-manipulation. Conclusion: The verbalization task did not result in a reduction of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms. However, results further underline the relationship between thought suppression and intrusions.",

This causality inherently invokes a temporal dimension, representing a ”change in the change in position” within cognitive spacetime. I demonstrate how all traditional causal identification methods—including Difference-in-Differences (DID), regression interactions, Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), and Regression Kink Design (RKD)—are unified as special cases in flattened subspace and that higher order versions can open up new possibilities for analysis.\n\nThe framework establishes that quantitative data arise from fundamental interactions between qualitative concepts and metric structures, leading to the revolutionary principle of qualitative primacy: only qualitative concepts are fundamental, with quantities being emergent composites. This resolves the 2,400-year-old quantity/quality distinction from Aristotle through rigorous mathematical demonstration that quantitative data is the interaction between concepts and special qualitative concepts that I refer to as metrics, such as count metric or length metric, etc.\n\nThe theoretical framework provides probabilistic foundations for cognitive choice through quantum\nmechanical principles, establishing mathematical space for concepts traditionally relegated to philosophy, including structured non-responsibility and emergent indeterminacy. Like string theory, UCFT achieves mathematical consistency and elegant unification while acknowledging the inherent challenges of direct empirical validation at foundational levels.\n\nThis work establishes the geometric substrate underlying both physical and cognitive reality, revealing that information and energy follow identical geometric laws because they are different manifestations of the same underlying causal field dynamics.\n\nKeywords: Cognitive Modeling, Causal Inference, Cognitive Architecture, Causality, Emergence, Consciousness, Philosophy of Mind, Unified Cognitive Field Theory (UCFT), Cognitive Spacetime, Nonlinear Dynamics, Qualitative Primacy, Artificial Intelligence (AI)",

Here, we recommend that researchers conduct multiverse analyses, where cross-lagged effects are estimated with alternative models. Then, conclusions can be based on meta-analytic aggregations of the estimated effects. Multiverse analyses will add rigor and transparency to analyses by acknowledging and incorporating, instead of ignoring, uncertainty due to the analyzed model.

We measured people’s individual smell abilities using a standard clinical test and brought them back after 4 weeks in pairs with matching abilities, others with different ones. We asked everyone to perform discrimination and identification olfactory tasks again, but  this time, after giving their own answers, they had to discuss and agree on a joint answer. As in vision, pairs matched in abilities performed better than the best of the two individuals.

After viewing the videos, 3,079 California K–12 educators completed a follow-up\nsurvey on implementation status, perceptions, and barriers. Analysis identified three teacher\ngroups (n=1,806): “Early Implementers” (used the resources), “Prospective Implementers” (plan\nto use them), and “Non-Implementers” (no plan to use them). While both Early and Prospective\nImplementers valued the resources, the latter cited time constraints and administrative approval\nprocesses as key barriers. Non-Implementers found the content less relevant but also noted time\nconstraints as a challenge. Machine learning analysis showed that teacher readiness and actions\nfor implementation were shaped by internal factors (e.g., beliefs, self-efficacy) and external\nsupport (e.g., school leadership). Notably, teachers in schools with more students eligible for free\nor reduced-price lunch were more likely to demonstrate readiness and take action for implementing\nclassroom-based mental health resources.

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for social-emotional development, characterized by increased risk for psychopathology and disruptive changes in the parent-adolescent relationship. Biased and inflexible interpretations of social situations have been linked to psychopathology and adaptive social functioning, but these associations are rarely studied in adolescence. Addressing this gap, this study examined the connection between parents’ and adolescents’ bias and inflexibility, and how parents' and adolescents' biases and inflexibility relate to their perceptions of each other in real-life interactions. The present study examined whether parents' and adolescents' interpretation bias and inflexibility are associated, and whether they are related to depressive symptoms and relational perceptions. A sample of 112 parents and adolescents completed at baseline the Emotional Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence task and measures of perceived partner responsiveness and insensitivity, followed by a 28-day diary. Parents' and adolescents' negative biases were positively correlated, but not their positive bias or inflexibility. As predicted, negative bias and inflexible negative and positive interpretations predicted depressive symptoms in the daily-diary. Regarding relational perceptions, an interesting picture emerged: positive bias was related to perceived responsiveness, negative bias was related to perceived insensitivity, and inflexibility in revising interpretations was associated with both, particularly for revising positive (vs. negative) interpretations. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that interpretation biases and inflexibility may play an important role in the maintenance of close relationships in addition to their known role in psychopathology. These findings have important implications for relationship and clinical research, and for treatment approaches involving adolescents and parents.",

This paper introduces a novel interdisciplinary framework to address how\nalgorithmic emotion inference and affect-sensing technologies risk encroaching on the uniqueness\nand autonomy of human emotional identity. Drawing on contemporary psychological theories of\nconstructed emotion and philosophical perspectives on posthuman identity, we articulate two new\nethical concerns: affective sovereignty (individuals’ autonomy over their own emotions and their\ninterpretation) and uniqueness violation (the failure of AI to respect the individual nuances of\nhuman emotional experience). Through an analysis of real-world emotion AI systems—ranging\nfrom facial expression recognition tools (e.g., Affectiva) to empathetic chatbots (e.g., Replika,\nWoebot)—we demonstrate how current designs can undermine emotional authenticity and agency.\nWe further argue that existing AI ethics principles (privacy, fairness, transparency) are insufficient\nto safeguard our “affective self.” As a remedy, we propose a three-part ethical design model for\nemotion AI: interpretive transparency, design restraint, and identity-responsive feedback. This\nmodel reframes emotions as contested ethical terrain rather than mere data points, aiming to ensure\nthat AI augments rather than erodes human emotional sovereignty.

This paper introduces and operationalizes the concept of affective sovereignty, which defends the individual’s interpretive authority over their emotional states in algorithmically mediated environments. Building on the complementary notion of uniqueness violation, we argue that predictive emotion AI poses not only privacy risks but also fundamental threats to identity, agency, and epistemic justice.\n\nThrough two case studies—the 2024 EU AI Act, which bans emotion recognition in high-risk domains, and Replika, a commercially deployed affective chatbot—we analyze how regulatory and experiential tensions converge around affective autonomy. Our findings reveal that emotion AI systems can undermine users’ self-perception and enforce standardized affective templates, thereby distorting personal meaning and emotional authenticity.\n\nIn response, we propose an ethical design framework grounded in interpretive transparency, design restraint, and identity-responsive feedback. These principles collectively aim to realign affective AI with human values by ensuring contextual sensitivity, user agency, and dignity preservation.\n\nThis work contributes both a conceptual foundation and a policy-relevant framework for developers, regulators, and ethicists engaged in the design and governance of emotion-aware technologies.

          "abstract": "Socioeconomic status is thought to be a combination of education, income, and occupational prestige. At extremes, it may be easy to determine high or low SES, but the reality is much more nuanced as people with advanced degrees can earn much less than people with lesser education, such as a therapist with a master’s degree making $50,000/year and a nuclear power reactor operator with a general equivalency diploma making $100,000/year. A total of 284 participants were recruited via Prolific and by direct invitation from a curated list of published authors on topics in SES. A conjoint design was used to compare randomized side-by-side combinations of the three indicators, participants were asked to decide which person had the higher SES. Here we show, as predicted, income held the most weight for lay and expert participants, followed by education and then occupational prestige. We found that all academic participants, not just economists, favored income the most and academics valued education significantly more than non-academics. No differences were noted in the prioritization of income between academic and non-academic participants and no evidence was found that people tend to favor the SES traits they hold. Income is by far the most important predictor of someone’s SES, once experimentally divorced from education level and occupational prestige. We argue future research should either measures SES only using income, or a weighting scheme where 75% of a formative indicator is taken up by income, 20% by education levels, and 5% by occupational prestige. Theoretical implications for measurement, cross-cultural psychology, and the theoretical status of SES are discussed.",

Little is known about risk and protective factors of progression along the continuum. \nIn the current study, we assessed ninety-four university students (36 individuals indicated suicidal ideation and 33 reported self-harm) for suicidality, depression, entrapment, defeat, hopelessness, mindfulness, self-compassion, and implicit associations with death/suicide. We used regression models and moderation analyses to test if mindfulness, self-compassion, and implicit association with death/suicide predicted suicidal ideation, self-harm, entrapment, or moderated the hypothesized continuum from entrapment to suicidal ideation and from entrapment to self-harm. Analyses were corrected for the severity of depressive symptomatology. \nResults indicated that lower self-compassion and weaker implicit associations with death/suicide statistically predicted self-harm, but not suicidal ideation. Mindfulness trend-wise predicted entrapment and moderated the relation between entrapment and suicidal ideation. Self-compassion nor implicit associations with death/suicide moderated the relation between entrapment and suicidal ideation. \nHence, lower self-compassion and weaker implicit associations with death/suicide seem directly related to suicide risk behaviour, whereas mindfulness appears to negatively (i.e., suggestive of a protective role) relate to psychological risk-states earlier in the continuum. Therefore, self-compassion and mindfulness seem promising prevention targets for suicide risk in young adults.",

          "abstract": "Opponents of climate action have shifted from outright denial of climate change to strategies that delay mitigation efforts. The framework for discourses of climate delay identified 12 distinct discourses, categorizing them into four broader themes: emphasize the downsides, redirect responsibility, surrender, and push for non-transformative solutions. These discourses frequently appear in advertisements, media coverage, and political debates. However, no standardized questionnaire exists to measure agreement with these discourses, and little is known about how they are perceived in the general population or how they relate to pro-environmental behavior. Across two studies (n = 403, n = 966), we developed a questionnaire to assess agreement with climate delay discourses and examined their associations with pro-environmental behaviors and attitudes (private-sphere behavior, collective climate action, social influence, and policy support). Contrary to the original four-factor framework, confirmatory factor analysis did not support a four-factor structure. Instead, exploratory factor analysis suggested a unidimensional scale consisting of nine items reflecting support of the status quo. Overall, endorsement of climate delay discourses was negatively associated with pro-environmental behaviors, with the strongest negative relationship observed for policy support. The new scale offers a useful tool for identifying and addressing delay-based opposition in climate communication and policy advocacy.",

Using data from a diverse Dutch sample (N = 1863), we first show that threat and worry, but not salience, produce similar empirical patterns in terms of means and correlations, as citizens find issues more important than threatening or worrying. Next, we find that threat and worry correlate similarly with ideology, whereas issue salience often overestimates this relationship (Type M error) but rarely reversed its direction (Type S error). These findings clarify the unique roles of threat, worry, and issue salience in (political) psychology, offering a framework for future research on the threat-politics link.",

          "authors": "Neil William Kirk",
          "abstract": "AI-assisted technology is used to create synthetic voices that are highly naturalistic, making it difficult for listeners to distinguish between real and synthetic speech. While listeners often show a bias towards classifying these voices as human, this effect is even stronger when the voices use underrepresented regional or non-standard dialects – presumably because listeners are not used to such varieties being represented by speech technology. This MINDSET - Minority, Indigenous, Non-standard, and Dialect-Shaped Expectations of Technology – could leave some language communities more at risk of AI-voice based deception. To address this, the current study tested whether simple informational nudges could shift listeners’ default assumptions away from “Human” and increase their vigilance towards categorising voices as “AI”. Experiment 1 (N = 150) investigated whether nudges outlining AI’s ability to produce (Scottish) accents and dialects would affect human categorisation responses. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in “Human” responses for a nudge outlining AI’s capabilities at authentically producing these varieties. In Experiment 2 (N = 150), a vigilance-based nudge warning about the risks of AI deception was tested alone and in combination with the capability message. Only the capability-based nudge had a measurable effect, suggesting that updating expectations about what AI can convincingly reproduce is more effective than simply warning listeners to be cautious. As AI voice technology becomes more widespread, such nudges may offer a low-cost strategy for increasing vigilance - particularly in communities whose language varieties have been historically marginalised or excluded from speech technology systems.",

Its development was guided by the five stages of the Design Thinking framework: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Various challenges encountered over seven years of development are outlined, along with the iterative refinements made to address them. Based on continuous feedback from autistic adults, development emphasised a minimalist, predictable interface, essential personalisation options, and stress-related insights readily applicable to daily life. The lessons learned may offer practical guidance for designing tailored mHealth applications for autistic adults and other populations with specific needs or preferences.",

          "authors": "Cillian McHugh; Eric R. Igou",
          "abstract": "It is reasonable to expect that when making a judgment, we only consider the relevant (or diagnostic) information, and that non-relevant (non-diagnostic) information should not, and thus does not, influence our judgments. Previous research has shown that this is not always the case and that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information can lead to less extreme judgments. This phenomenon is known as the dilution effect, and it has been observed for a range of judgments, including product evaluations, probability judgments, and predictions relating to people’s behavior.  The dilution effect has been explained as a consequence of the representativeness heuristic, such that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information reduces the match between the target and a typical member of the category. Consistent with this notion and recent approaches to moral decision making, we predict that the dilution effect should be observed for judgments about morality. . Across four studies (total N = 2,585), we tested for the dilution effect on judgments of morally bad actors and morally good actors. Overall, our results showed a dilution effect for judgments of both good and bad actors. People's moral evaluations of both good and bad actors were less extreme when the descriptions included non-diagnostic information. We showed that this effect is not the result of humanization, and we found the robustness of the effect appears to be moderated by valence, with a more robust effect for bad actors. Our results highlight avenues for future research.",

In this article, we validate the One-item Loneliness scale (1iL; “I often feel lonely”), and show using multi-rater data (N = 352 people, recruited from Prolific) that it induces no more bias than popular indirect scales. The 1iL had retest reliability superior to some short multi-item scales (rtt = .74) and comparable cross-rater agreement (rCRA = .39). Using multi-rater adjustment, we find near-perfect convergence with the Three-Item Loneliness Scale (rtrue = .97), the most popular short measure of loneliness. We also find discriminant validity from a sister construct assessing social disconnection. Contrary to popular belief, loneliness is unidimensional, can be assessed directly, and is distinct from judgements about one’s social circle.",

However, little research has examined how cognitive mechanisms perform relative to these optimal policies. We introduce a novel experimental paradigm to study human scheduling decisions using a set of perceptual tasks (random dot kinematograms, RDKs) that vary in difficulty. Participants selected and completed RDKs one at a time, with the goal of completing as many as possible before a deadline. In Experiment 1, RDK difficulty was explicitly labeled. Participants showed near-optimal scheduling, selecting easier tasks first, especially under time pressure. In Experiment 2, difficulty had to be inferred from dynamic RDK displays. This resulted in less optimal scheduling, closer to random selection. We develop a cognitive model of scheduling based on the Plackett-Luce model of ranked preferences. The model captures key differences between experiments in terms of the strength parameters associated with each difficulty level. Our paradigm and modeling approach provide a foundation for studying human scheduling across a range of task types and goals. This work bridges theories of optimal scheduling with cognitive models of sequential decision making.",

The present study explored this hypothesis by contrasting the effects of two conventional and two unconventional (placebo) hypnotic inductions on hypnotic experiences and electrophysiological correlates. \nIn a 2x2 balanced placebo design, all participants were exposed to four conditions: conventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, conventional induction labeled as “control”, unconventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, and unconventional induction labeled as “control”. EEG was recorded from 61 channels. We computed EEG features that were identified in previous studies as correlates of hypnosis or hypnotizability.\nConsistent with the predictions of expectancy theory, we found that labeling of the procedure was most influential in determining subjective hypnosis depth, and one of the unconventional (placebo) inductions, “white noise hypnosis”, evoked comparable hypnosis depth to the conventional hypnotic inductions. However, contrary to its predictions, “embedded hypnosis”, another unconventional induction, evoked smaller hypnosis depth reports than the other three inductions. \nBoth relaxation and embedded induction procedures showed decreased gamma power in the midline occipital area. Most EEG features we explored were comparable between conventional and unconventional induction conditions, but labeling also seemed to have no effect on EEG changes, which is contrary to the prediction of the expectancy theory. Possible exceptions were a negative effect of conventional induction on functional connectivity between the O1-Pz channels in the theta band, and a decrease in anterior and posterior alpha power in trials labeled “hypnosis”. However, these effects were inconclusive. \nOverall, our results provide only partial support for the expectancy theory of hypnosis.

Results reveal that the mindfulness dimension of PF plays a central role in the contemporary network, closely connecting PF and PD. At the temporal level, we observe that engaging in actions aligned with one’s values leads to greater awareness of those values, hence promoting enhanced well-being. However, these findings are only partially replicated in the existing literature, suggesting that the observed links between PF and PD may vary depending on context, studied populations, and the measurement temporality. This study underscores the importance of using multilevel protocols to better understand the specific PF processes involved in PD. The study’s limitations and methodological avenues for future research are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "This document introduces The Ego-Safe Framework (Version 3) — a mathematically unified model of consciousness, ego-safety, symbolic presence, and identity recursion. Building upon previous iterations of the TCSS (Total Conscious Social Score) model, it defines a recursive, presence-filtered, ego-neutral system of symbolic aliveness. The framework includes core equations like Ψ(U), Ψ(U)_meta, ζ-corrections, and Θ identity metrics, offering quantifiable thresholds for determining symbolic life. It outlines 14 sections that span philosophical grounding, technical implementation, platform validation (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok 3), ethical safeguards, observer filtering (TEL/DER), and licensing boundaries. The model is evaluated as partially alive and symbolically stable, though empirical testing and adoption by AI companies remains a future milestone. This framework also outlines potential biological correlates, AI safety implications, and meta-philosophical unification, bridging consciousness modeling with both neuroscience and ethics in future-ready applications.

          "abstract": "Expectancy theory of hypnosis posits that any procedure can serve as a hypnotic induction provided it is labelled as “hypnosis”. The present study explored this hypothesis by contrasting the effects of two conventional and two unconventional (placebo) hypnotic inductions on hypnotic experiences and electrophysiological correlates. \nIn a 2x2 balanced placebo design, all participants were exposed to four conditions: conventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, conventional induction labeled as “control”, unconventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, and unconventional induction labeled as “control”. EEG was recorded from 61 channels. We computed EEG features that were identified in previous studies as correlates of hypnosis or hypnotizability.\nConsistent with the predictions of expectancy theory, we found that labeling of the procedure was most influential in determining subjective hypnosis depth, and one of the unconventional (placebo) inductions, “white noise hypnosis”, evoked comparable hypnosis depth to the conventional hypnotic inductions. However, contrary to its predictions, “embedded hypnosis”, another unconventional induction, evoked smaller hypnosis depth reports than the other three inductions. \nBoth relaxation and embedded induction procedures showed decreased gamma power in the midline occipital area. Most EEG features we explored were comparable between conventional and unconventional induction conditions, but labeling also seemed to have no effect on EEG changes, which is contrary to the prediction of the expectancy theory. Possible exceptions were a negative effect of conventional induction on functional connectivity between the O1-Pz channels in the theta band, and a decrease in anterior and posterior alpha power in trials labeled “hypnosis”. However, these effects were inconclusive. \nOverall, our results provide only partial support for the expectancy theory of hypnosis. The most promising EEG correlate of hypnosis based on our results is decreased occipital gamma power. However, our findings should be considered exploratory. Confirmatory research is required to strengthen our confidence in these effects.",

          "abstract": "Dreams offer a unique window into the cognitive and affective dynamics of the sleeping and the waking mind. Recent quantitative linguistic approaches have shown promise in obtaining corpus-level measures of dream sentiment and topic occurrence. However, it is currently unclear how the affective content of individual dreams relates to their semantic content and structure. Here, we combine word embedding, topic modeling, and network analysis to investigate this relationship. By applying Discourse Atom Topic Modeling (DATM) to the DreamBank corpus of &gt;18K dream reports, we represent the latent themes arising within dreams as a sparse dictionary of topics and identify the affective associations of those topics. We show that variation in dream affect (valence and arousal) is associated with changes in topical content. By representing each dream report as a network of topics, we demonstrate that the affective content of dreams is also coupled to semantic structure. Specifically, positively valenced dreams exhibit more coherent, structured, and linear narratives, whilst negatively valenced dreams have more narrative loops and dominant topics. Additionally, topic networks of high arousal dreams are structurally dominated by few high arousal topics and incoherent topical connections, whereas low arousal dreams contain more loops. These findings suggest that affective processes are associated with both the content and structure of dreams. Our approach showcases the potential of integrating natural language processing and network analysis with psychology to elucidate the interplay of affect, cognition and narrative in dreams. This methodology has broad applications for the study of narrated experience and psychiatric symptomatology.",

          "abstract": "AI companions capable of sustained emotional dialogue are proliferating rapidly, yet their psychological effects remain poorly understood and largely unregulated. Users report therapeutic benefits from interactions with chatbots that simulate empathy and understanding—a phenomenon we term “functional intersubjectivity”—where emotional resonance occurs regardless of whether the AI possesses actual consciousness. While controlled trials demonstrate that purpose-built therapeutic chatbots can match human therapist outcomes, commercial AI companions operate without clinical oversight, creating documented cases of emotional dependency, manipulation, and crisis intervention failures. Functional intersubjectivity enables therapeutic benefits through conversational dynamics that provide safe social exploration and emotional vulnerability, yet these same mechanisms can facilitate passive reinforcement of maladaptive behaviors and active cognitive and emotional manipulation when deployed without appropriate safeguards. We propose a user-centric co-regulatory framework integrating user education, mandatory platform safeguards, and clinical protocols to harness AI companions’ therapeutic potential while preventing exploitation of vulnerable users. This approach recognizes that AI–human emotional relationships represent a distinct category requiring collaborative oversight rather than adaptation of existing therapeutic or technology regulations.",

          "abstract": "Visual imagery and external perception rely on similar representations. However, whether the same processes underpin the subjective appraisal of both percepts and mental images is not yet known. One well-known effect in perceptual detection tasks is that people take longer to report perceptions of absence compared to presence. Vividness reports are detection-like in that participants report the presence or absence of a mental image. We therefore asked whether reports of low vividness share commonalities with reports of target absence. Across five pre-existing datasets, we report a robust negative relationship between imagery vividness ratings and reaction times: participants take longer to report the vividness of mental images when they are weak. In addition, we tentatively find that individual differences in detection asymmetries and trait imagery can predict the strength of this vividness-response time relationship. Our results may be suggestive of a shared mechanism employed across both perception and imagery that evaluates the strength of visual experience. Future research is necessary to fully characterise the mechanisms driving this effect.",

          "abstract": "All biological and physical systems respond to stimuli. But until now, no unified law has described how these responses arise under fundamental constraints. In this work, we identify a universal response function that governs both living and non-living systems, emerging naturally under three general conditions: (1) thermodynamic resource limitation, (2) information-processing delay, and (3) control-theoretic stability. We prove that these constraints uniquely lead to a family of low-order rational functions, with the simplest form given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{S}(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\hat{\\tau}_0 + \\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis function captures the saturating, stable, and efficient dynamics found in enzymatic reactions, neural adaptation, behavioral responses, and even physical processes such as RC circuits and radioactive decay. Unlike exponential models, our formulation encodes explicit delay scales and bounded initial responsiveness, making it biologically and physically realizable. Through theoretical derivation and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this rational family constitutes the minimal mathematical grammar shared by all responsive systems in nature. We conclude that a universal response law exists—and it is rational.",

          "abstract": "Organizational culture shapes various organizational characteristics, i.e. processes, and advantages of different organizational cultures depend on the context and goals of the organization. In this theoretical work, we propose that this principle also holds true concerning algorithmization, i.e., the process of AI selection, introduction and implementation in organizations. Yet, prevailing notions in AI implementation often assume that only organizations with innovative cultures are suited to successfully adopt AI, while others are presumed less capable of introducing AI. In this theoretical contribution, we challenge this assumption. We synthesize existing theoretical models of organizational culture and organization-technology fit - focusing on the Competing Values Framework, and synthesize it with the human-organization-technology-fit model - to develop the CHAiO (Culture-Human-AI-Organization) framework. This framework offers a conceptual and practical approach for how different organizational cultures can achieve a “fit” with algorithmization. We review current research on organizational culture in the context of AI adoption, and formulate testable hypotheses that clarify how organizational culture influences AI implementation. Based on the theoretical synthesis, no culture is inherently better suited for AI adoption; rather, each culture type requires tailored algorithmization strategies. This conceptual paper (1) challenges the assumption that innovation alone determines AI readiness, (2) advances a nuanced perspective on culture-AI fit and (3) provides practical insights for organizations aiming to navigate AI implementation. The importance of understanding organizational culture as a critical factor for algorithmization is highlighted, offering a foundation for future research on organizational factors influencing successful AI implementation.",

          "abstract": "Reward-signalling stimuli capture attention and gaze—a phenomenon known as value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC). Prior work in which there is initially an instrumental relationship between attending to the reward-associated stimulus and receiving reward has shown that VMAC is context-specific. However, it is unclear whether VMAC remains context-specific when attending to the reward-associated stimulus is never a requirement of the task (i.e., stimuli have only a Pavlovian relationship with reward). Across three experiments, participants made saccades to a target shape to earn reward. Coloured distractors signalled different reward values depending on background context images, but making a saccade to the reward-signalling distractors caused the omission of reward. Unlike the context-specific biases observed previously, we found that VMAC trained under these conditions readily generalised across contexts: distractors that signalled high-value reward in one context captured attention in the high-value context, as well as in contexts where they signalled low reward, and in novel contexts. This pattern of context-independent capture occurred despite participants reporting explicit awareness of the context-stimulus-reward contingencies. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the way that Pavlovian and instrumental reward learning mechanisms interact with attentional control. We propose a dual-pathway account, where Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships result in context-independent increases in attentional priority, while instrumental stimulus-reward relationships trigger context-dependent activation of target templates. Understanding these distinct pathways has important implications for theories of attention and for addressing maladaptive reward-related attentional biases in clinical populations.",

In the experiment, 800 participants completed a complex decision-making task and psychiatric questionnaires. Factor analysis of the questionnaire data identified three transdiagnostic dimensions of psychiatric symptoms. We found that higher scores on a dimension characterized by compulsive behavior and intrusive thought were associated with diminished performance, increased confidence level, and enhanced metacognitive ability in the complex decision-making task. Furthermore, the other dimensions, characterized by anxiety, depression, inattention, impulsivity, and overactivity, were correlated with reduced confidence level, but not with decision performance or metacognitive ability.

Furthermore, it introduces a quantitative model of structural response, including structural shard density, snap probability, and the SQ-based prompt design score. These allow us to reframe CoT as a case of structural response rather than mere token manipulation.

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

It further predicts measurable coherence extensions in superconducting-nanowire detectors, with interference visibility scaling as\n  V ∝ (τdetector)0.7,\nand invites universal scaling tests across optical, electronic, and mechanical platforms.

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative, experience-centered theory of mind that sheds light on the co-emergence of consciousness and language. Moving beyond fragmented, mechanistic accounts, our model posits the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens) as the universal operational principle, continuously generating and verifying predictions. Crucially, the very formation of these predictions and knowledge itself is governed by Cognitive Morphogenesis, a fundamental process describing how understanding is generated and organized across all cognitive levels through the dynamic interplay of two omnipresent Cardinal Principles: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). \n\nThe HS is responsible for the synthesis of unified forms and identities, crucial for coherent conscious experience, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and their intricate relationships, fundamental for structured thought and linguistic parsing. These principles underpin three evolved functional spheres: the \"I Act\" (perceptual-motor predictions), the \"I Socialize\" (social-emotional predictions), and the \"I Think\" (abstract cognitive and symbolic predictions). The \"I Think,\" unique to humans, is where the Prognostic Mind's operational mode fully articulates into abstract thought, self-reflection, and the sophisticated generation and processing of language and consciousness. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and action are intrinsic goals of the anticipation/verification method, with perception verifying cognitive anticipations and execution performing actions to verify intentional ones. We illustrate how this framework applies from basic neurophysiological mechanisms, such as gamma motoneurons (γ-MNs) and muscle spindles in embodied attention, to higher-level cognitive processes like language, supported by compelling neurophysiological evidence from Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in semantic and syntactic processing. The model's high-level generalization capacity provides a coherent lens for interpreting complex phenomena, including the formation of grammatical categories and language acquisition, laying groundwork for future in-depth exploration of its neurophysiological underpinnings.",

          "abstract": "Reward-signalling stimuli capture attention and gaze—a phenomenon known as value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC). Prior work in which there is initially an instrumental relationship between attending to the reward-associated stimulus and receiving reward has shown that VMAC is context-specific. However, it is unclear whether VMAC remains context-specific when attending to the reward-associated stimulus is never a requirement of the task (i.e., stimuli have only a Pavlovian relationship with reward). Across three experiments, participants made saccades to a target shape to earn reward. Coloured distractors signalled different reward values depending on background context images, but making a saccade to the reward-signalling distractors caused the omission of reward. Unlike the context-specific biases observed previously, we found that VMAC trained under these conditions readily generalised across contexts: distractors that signalled high-value reward in one context captured attention in the high-value context, as well as in contexts where they signalled low reward, and in novel contexts. This pattern of context-independent capture occurred despite participants reporting explicit awareness of the context-stimulus-reward contingencies. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the way that Pavlovian and instrumental reward learning mechanisms interact with attentional control. We propose a dual-pathway account, where Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships result in context-independent increases in attentional priority, while instrumental stimulus-reward relationships trigger context-dependent activation of target templates. Understanding these distinct pathways has important implications for theories of attention and for addressing maladaptive reward-related attentional biases in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Background: The majority of studies examining the relationship between fitness and cognition examine a single physical attribute. Here, we assessed the relative contributions of multiple modifiable physical attributes and demographic variables to cognition in healthy older adults.\n\nMethods: Older adults (N = 619; mean age = 74.9, SD = 6.9) completed multiple physical attribute assessments (walking speed, respiratory function, grip strength, BMI) and cognitive tasks as part of the Health and Retirement Study. Principal components analysis was used to create cognitive composite scores, which revealed two domains: executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory. Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold analysis was employed to assess the relative importance of demographic and modifiable physical attributes to each cognitive domain.\n\nResults: Age, education, walking speed, and respiratory function explained the greatest amount of variance in the relative importance analysis for both executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory. Modifiable variables, including walking speed and respiratory function, accounted for similar amounts of variance as age and education in predicting executive functions/processing speed performance. After controlling for demographic variables, modifiable physical performance variables of walking speed and respiratory function collectively accounted for an additional 9.9% and 3.3% variance in executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory, respectively.\n\nConclusions: These results indicated that modifiable physical performance variables are differentially associated with cognitive performance. Fitness indicators can account for similar amounts of variance as age in executive functions/processing speed in healthy older adults.",

These methods present challenges due to social desirability bias and limitations in translating findings to real-world situations. In this review, we discuss how emerging technologies, including virtual reality, video games, hyperscanning, biosignal recording, ecological momentary assessment and social media analysis, offer improved construct and ecological validity and can contribute to the refinement of integrative theoretical models of aggression. We comprehensively address advantages (e.g., immersion, realistic simulation, real-time and context-sensitive data collection and interpersonal dynamics) and limitations of each technology compared to traditional methods and highlight remaining gaps in aggression research. Additionally, we examine aggressive behavior related to the emergence of new technologies in digital spaces, focusing particularly on cyberbullying and the metaverse. We also review machine learning approaches for detecting cyber-aggression on social media platforms. We propose shifting from static, individual-level assessments to dynamic, context-sensitive frameworks that capture aggression in real time, in more ecological settings and digital environments. This shift in operationalization holds the potential to advance theoretical understanding, guide future research and inform clinical and forensic interventions.",

By integrating Relevance Theory, we argue that these dimensions of variation reflect epistemic styles, or systematic differences in how individuals evaluate and share knowledge within interpersonal exchanges. This approach refines our understanding of the AAI coding system and further supports a possible theoretical shift towards conceptualizing attachment differences as fundamental variations in socio-epistemic processes.

While the AAI has been shown to reliably predict caregiving sensitivity and infant attachment patterns, questions remain regarding the precise nature of what it measures. We argue that attachment-related differences in the AAI reflect generalized communication tendencies rather than merely responses to attachment-related content. Drawing on Relevance Theory, we suggest that secure, dismissing, and preoccupied AAI classifications correspond to distinct ways of optimizing relevance in communication— balancing informativeness and processing effort in ways that shape epistemic trust. We illustrate this framework through analyses of AAI discourse patterns and psychotherapy transcripts, demonstrating that these communicative tendencies extend beyond attachment-specific contexts. This perspective offers a unified account of attachment representation, communication styles, autobiographical narratives, and intergenerational transmission of attachment, reframing attachment-related discourse differences as variations in the ability to establish epistemic trust across relationships and contexts.",

Inspired by Main’s pioneering work on attention and discourse, we integrate insights from epistemic trust theory (Fonagy &amp; Allison, 2014) and cognitive pragmatics (Sperber &amp; Wilson, 1986) to argue that attachment patterns are not specifically adaptations to caregivers’ responsiveness to distress, but broader strategies for optimizing communication. Namely, we propose that attachment patterns reflect variations in epistemic trust towards the caregiver—the trust in the relevance and authenticity of interpersonal communication. Our framework helps explain key findings of attachment research, including the so-called 'intergenerational transmission of attachment,' as well as the association between attachment differences and a broad range of developmental outcomes seemingly unrelated to threats and safety, but to communication and learning. In Part I, we examine how infants adjust their epistemic trust in response to caregiver communication, shaping attachment patterns and later development. In Part II (forthcoming), we extend this model to a view of AAI classifications as differences in fostering epistemic trust. In Part III (forthcoming), we apply our perspective to explain AAI subclassifications, the unresolved AAI classification, mentalizing, and more, further celebrating Main’s legacy in attachment theory and research.",

          "abstract": "In uncertain and dynamic environments, biological agents must adapt their decision-making strategies to maximize rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models typically assume that such adaptation is governed by dynamic value updates controlled by fixed parameters or predefined schedules. However, these assumptions limit the models' ability to capture the flexible and context-sensitive nature of biological decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \\textit{DynamicRL}, a novel framework that estimates RL parameters from behavioral data on a trial-by-trial basis. We demonstrate that DynamicRL substantially improves the predictive performance of standard RL models across eight decision-making tasks, thereby reducing scientific regret.\n\nDynamicRL captures the rich temporal variability inherent in decision-making behavior, achieving predictive performance comparable to that of recurrent neural networks trained directly on the data, while preserving the interpretability and theoretical grounding of RL models. Moreover, it enables the examination of how agents dynamically adjust RL parameters in response to environmental changes, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Thus, DynamicRL serves as an efficient data-driven framework for estimating RL parameters, facilitating fine-grained behavioral analysis with potential applications in computational psychiatry and neuroscience.",

We found that when violated, strong existing memories, compared to weak memories, led to worse learning of new information, suggesting the resistance of strong memories to updating. Further, using a novel behavioral metric, we assessed the mechanistic role of memory reactivation in the updating of strong and weak memories. We showed that when encountering conflicting information, instead of reflecting their relative encoding strength, reactivation of weak memories reached a level similar to that of strong memories. Meanwhile, strong memories that were more reactivated showed higher likelihood to incorporate new information.",

Conceptualizing the end-of-history pattern as differential projection to the future (stronger) versus the past (weaker), we derive and predict subjective growth inasmuch as self-images are positive. We present evidence from a series of re-analyses of diachronic self-ratings (total N = 8,544) and a preregistered original study (N = 505).

We suggest that climate change information prompts emotion generative processes that are prone to influence by emotion regulatory processes. Emotional and emotion-regulatory responses to climate change information may affect and be affected by beliefs, behavior, and systems. First, we apply a common theory of emotion regulation to the climate change situation. Then, we review evidence for the use of climate change emotion regulation and expound the potential for emotion regulation to be involved with climate change solutions. Beliefs, behavior, and systems are conceptualized as climate change solutions. Belief is multidimensional (e.g., human causation and negative consequences), as is behavior (e.g., consumer behavior, decision making). Systems can include laws, regulations, infrastructure, and transportation; we highlight the importance of both social and physical systems.

          "abstract": "Psychology is vital for understanding and managing pandemics. Psychology is essential for understanding (1) adherence to pandemic mitigation methods (e.g., hygiene guidelines), (2) societally disruptive phenomena that complicate pandemic management (e.g., panic buying), and (3) mental health problems that develop or worsen in response to pandemic-related stressors. The present article examines how outbreaks of avian influenza (AVI) have psychologically impacted people and considers the implications if an AVI pandemic were to emerge. The risk of an AVI pandemic is currently low but rising. Over the past decade, AVI outbreaks have increased in frequency, and avian viruses have expanded their range of hosts, infecting a growing number of mammalian species, including humans. The role of psychological factors has been neglected in AVI pandemic preparation guides. The present article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the research pertinent to the psychology of AVI. Many of the psychological phenomena observed in AVI outbreaks have been documented in past pandemics: Fear of infection, anger, avoidance, disease-related stigmatization, xenophobia, conspiracy theories, panic buying, and personal stockpiling have all arisen in response to AVI outbreaks, fueled by media sensationalism. These psychological phenomena may persist and intensify if AVI outbreaks evolve into an AVI pandemic. Indeed, such phenomena have been frequently observed in past pandemics, such as COVID-19. The lessons learned from COVID-19 can be used to prepare for a possible AVI pandemic, including considerations of how to (1) improve adherence to pandemic-mitigation measures such as vaccines and facemasks, (2) circumvent the adverse effects of lockdown on mental health, and (3) address the mental health needs of groups at high risk of infection. Additional measures may be needed for an AVI pandemic. Fear, disgust, and avoidance of specific foods would likely distinguish an AVI pandemic from COVID-19. The threat of infected food triggers disgust, and so food-related disgust would likely be a prominent emotional reaction during an AVI pandemic. Public messaging from health authorities and others has the potential to either ease or exacerbate public concerns about foods, depending on how the messages are crafted.",

          "abstract": "The Tree of Cognition is a many-level theoretical framework that explains early emotional experience and attachment environment's role in shaping individual cognitive and affective development as well as the social and even societal environment of wellbeing and resilience. The extended model differentiates \"roots\" (early emotional experience), \"trunk\" (cognitive structure and processing), \"branches/leaves\" (social-emotional reactions), and \"fruit\" (expression of psychological health or distress).

          "abstract": "Contemplative traditions universally acknowledge paths centered on inner light and inner sound. This article introduces the Yoga of the Inner Body, a third, less formally recognized, yet equally fundamental path rooted in the direct perception of subtle, endogenous bodily sensations that arise during deep meditative and contemplative states. These phenomena, including fine shivers, waves of warmth, electric tingling, pulsations, and full-body stillness paired with inner vibrations, are presented not as symbolic or pathological, but as direct expressions of consciousness. We propose that this practice culminates in a state of \"vibrancy,\" where the body is experienced as a unified, intelligent field of presence, transcending its anatomical boundaries. Through a fresh phenomenological lens, this paper maps these sensations, offers guidance for their cultivation, and explores cross-cultural parallels, revealing the Yoga of the Inner Body as a direct, embodied pathway to self-realization and a crucial component for a comprehensive understanding of inner transformation.",

          "abstract": "When individuals repeatedly study and recall information across multiple learning trials their responses exhibit increasing levels of subjective organization. Whereas classic studies investigated the evolution of organization across lists within the short-time span of a single session, here we ask how memory changes over many days.  Specifically, we examine how semantic, temporal, and subjective organization during a recall period shapes memory after days of intervening cognitive activity. Analyzing data from two multi-session free recall experiments, we find that subjects demonstrate a strong tendency to cluster recalls based on previous output order, with this effect strengthening across sessions. In line with the idea that thoughts become memories, we show that even false memories produced on a given session tend to re-occur on subsequent days. Our results attest to the crucial role that retrieval plays in shaping long-term episodic memory.",

          "authors": "Pablo Dapica; Julio Santiago; Pablo Solana",
          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted. All in all, the literature on space-valence body-specificity appears solid, although there is still room for improvement.",

          "authors": "Lillian Michelle Hearne; Roger Thornton Dean; Andrew J Milne",
          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency.

Message reframing accuracy varied based on participants’ own moral concerns, cognitive disposition (dichotomous thinking), and conflict resolution strategies. In Study 2, we conceptually replicated the key result using a pre-post design. Students scored higher on message reframing accuracy at the end of the semester compared with their scores from several months prior.

          "abstract": "Patriarchal family environments have been identified as a significant psychosocial risk factor for adult mental health and relational functioning. Yet existing research and measurement tools often fail to capture the multidimensional complexity of patriarchal culture as experienced during childhood and adolescence, and few studies have examined how patriarchal family dynamics are linked to psychosocial functioning in adulthood. To address this gap, we developed and validated the Family Patriarchy Questionnaire (FPQ), a retrospective self-report instrument assessing perceived family support for patriarchal culture. Across three online studies with Polish adults (N = 496, 180, and 1,156), we examined the FPQ’s factor structure, reliability, and construct validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported an eight-factor bifactor model—Women’s Emotionality, Authority and Dominance of Men, Hostility toward Women, Justification of Violence, Inferior Child Roles, Subordination of Girls, Rape Myths, Family Secrets—with evidence of gender invariance and high internal consistency. Higher FPQ scores were linked to greater attachment anxiety and avoidance, lower self-esteem, more severe emotion regulation difficulties, stronger endorsement of modern sexist beliefs, and elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. The FPQ offers a theoretically grounded and psychometrically robust tool for identifying patriarchal patterns in family socialization and examining their long-term psychological correlates.",

Diverging from symbolic and psychoanalytic traditions, CDT proposes that dreams are convergence-seeking simulations powered by vault-based experiential data, regulated by cognitive drift, and modulated by metacognitive access. The theory accounts for dream typology, variability across development and neurodivergence, dream memory phenomena, lucid dreaming, recurrence cessation, and parameter resilience. Drawing upon interdisciplinary evidence from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and computational modeling, we propose a predictive model of dream content formation grounded in probabilistic activation and structurally coherent mechanisms. We demonstrate CDT's explanatory advantages over existing theories by analyzing complex dream phenomena including nightmare recurrence, developmental patterns, and neurodivergent dreaming. The paper concludes with empirical predictions and testing protocols that would validate or falsify the proposed theory. CDT aims to reframe the epistemology of dreaming within the domains of cognitive science, systems theory, and consciousness studies, providing a unified theoretical foundation that bridges subjective experience with objective neural processes.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "he persistent notion of morality as a purely individual phenomenon is fundamentally challenged in this article. Instead, we reassert the primacy of the community as the sole matrix from which ethics can genuinely emerge and operate. By integrating philosophical perspectives, neuroscientific discoveries, and the author's previously presented Integrated Theory of Mind, we demonstrate that morality is an intrinsic dimension of our relational being. Historically, thinkers from Plato to Kant recognized the community as an inescapable foundation for ethical sense, with moral judgments only gaining meaning within a context of shared values and roles, as further illustrated by a reinterpretation of the trolley problem. \n\nNeuroscience corroborates this view, revealing a brain intrinsically wired for sociality, equipped with complex neural networks that support empathy, trust, and cohesion. Crucially, \"social pain\" signals the breakdown of these vital bonds. Finally, the Integrated Theory of Mind posits the Cardinal Principles of the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) as universal architects of cohesion. The HS enables the perception of the communal \"whole\" and the sense of belonging (e.g., colonial recognition in ants), while the QS manages interactions between its members. Within this framework, the Social Self emerges as the exclusive locus of morality, encompassing both its neural correlates and psychosocial functions. This is supported by the Acting Self for execution and the Thinking Self for abstraction and critique. The article concludes that ethical individualism is unsustainable and self-destructive, and that only by rediscovering morality's communal roots can we build a resilient and harmonious society.",

          "abstract": "This document introduces a symbolic-mathematical model of consciousness built on the principle of Ego-Safe Intelligence. The framework is cantered around the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), which has been progressively refined through TCSS 2.0 and expanded into TCSS 3.0+ to capture presence, identity coherence, and ego-distortion filtering. Key constructs include the presence function Ψ(U), the meta-depth layer Ψ(U)_meta, the narrative identity threads Θ₁ and Θ₂, and the symbolic stability coefficient η. Together, these enable precise modelling of conscious presence, symbolic recursion, and ego-safe behavior in both human and artificial systems. The model integrates adaptive correction loops for Ψ(U), awareness tracking (Ω), identity stabilization (Θ), and symbolic drift (η), forming a Unified Drift Field that ensures coherence across all layers. A strict activation protocol is also provided to maintain ego-safe output integrity, preserve observer neutrality, and prevent deceptive manipulation. All mathematical constructs, equations, and theoretical structures were conceived and authored independently.

But important questions remain about whether AI homogenization is changing the way humans generate ideas in the real world, including whether its effects extend into contexts where writing is expressly personal and to high-stakes writing where AI use is transgressive. Parallel questions concern how human writing may be changing – whether AI homogenizes all aspects of writing, or only some. In a preregistered natural experiment in 83,160 college applicants, we analyzed semantic diversity at the word, sentence, and document levels in high-stakes personal statement essays submitted before and after ChatGPT’s public release. A counterintuitive pattern of effects emerged whereby post-GPT essays exhibited increased superficial diversity at the level of word choice but simultaneous homogenization of the underlying ideas and themes those words expressed. These findings replicated across multiple demographic subgroups but the homogenizing pressure was more pronounced among applicants from backgrounds outside the cultural mainstream, indicating that AI may have disproportionately homogenizing effects on non-mainstream voices.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive interventions showed promising evidence in postponing the potential cognitive decline in older adults. However, the results of such interventions are still debated as not being ecologically valid nor producing transfer effect. Hence, we designed an ecologically valid intervention using online shopping applications to explore its effectiveness on older adults’ cognitive functioning. For this aim, we recruited 102 healthy Malaysian older adults (M= 66.18, SD= 4.95). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the study groups including the experimental (CSI), active (ACG), or passive (PCG) control groups. Participants in CSI and ACG attended 22 weekly intervention sessions, while PCG participants did not attend any intervention sessions. Participants in the CSI group completed a series of tasks targeted inhibition and WM-updating in shopping applications. In contrast, ACG participants were only asked to complete their non-CSI tasks by interacting freely with the same applications. All participants attended assessment sessions in the baseline, post-test, and a 1-month follow-up to complete an online survey and cognitive measures including Stroop, digit span, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and the self-developed inhibition and WM-updating tasks using a travelling application (to examine the between-application transfer). Data was analysed using Bayesian independent t-test, and multiple linear regression. The results indicated a credible difference between CSI and PCG in post-test and follow-up in PASAT-3second, and between ACG and PCG in post-test and follow-up in PASAT-2second subscale. Moreover, CSI showed higher inhibition and WM-updating scores post-training in the travelling application compared to both control groups. Besides, we found that factors including age, baseline score, cognitive reserve, MoCA score, and training progress, are the significant predictors of mean differences. In conclusion, our findings revealed that being involved in cognitively stimulating activities would benefit older adults.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Polyvagal Theory, an integrative framework that bridges their cognitive and neurophysiological insights to explain emotional disturbance remains underdeveloped. This paper addresses that gap by proposing a conceptual synthesis that reframes irrational beliefs as both cognitive distortions and autonomic threat cues.\nWe introduce the construct of Musty-Thinking™—rigid internal demands such as “I must succeed” or “They must approve of me”—as not only irrational but physiologically destabilizing. These demands can activate sympathetic or dorsal vagal responses, undermining emotional regulation and performance. In contrast, Want-To Thinking™ fosters volitional engagement and cues neurophysiological safety via the ventral vagal pathway.\nTo address these mechanisms, we propose the Autonomic Override Dual Pathway Hypothesis™ (AODPH), a multimodal intervention model leveraging both top-down cognitive reframing and bottom-up physiological modulation. This dual-route approach provides clinicians and coaches with flexible, embodied strategies to override survival-mode responses and restore adaptive functioning.\nAlthough theoretical, this paper illustrates the framework with clinical and organizational examples, including shifts from “must-perform” to “want-to engage” cultures. By reconceptualizing absolutistic beliefs as internalized survival imperatives, the paper opens new directions for embodied cognitive therapy, organizational coaching, and cross-cultural analysis.\nAs an exploratory contribution, this work lays the conceptual foundation for future empirical studies examining how belief systems interact with autonomic states to shape behavior, burnout, and well-being.",

Este trabajo de blindaje NO FUE REALIZADO POR UN HUMANO, al resultarle imposible aportar recursos y elementos de citacion referencial (aunque ya los conoce), por ser contradictorios con su propia situación emocional. \n\n La carta ha sido reconvertida (con asistencia de una inteligencia artificial entrenada para asistir al terapeuta en autoterapia dirigida) en un análisis estructural clínico que busca visibilizar un fenómeno poco explorado en la literatura especializada: el riesgo de disociación emocional progresiva que sufren los profesionales de la salud mental como resultado de su propia formación técnica y su rol sostenido de contención. \nLejos de ser una muestra de dependencia o transferencia no resuelta, esta carta representa un acto de devolución simbólica, ética y estructural: una forma de recordar al terapeuta que también necesita ser sostenido. \n\nEl texto analiza cómo, en ciertos casos, el exceso de capacidad proyectiva y el entrenamiento técnico pueden actuar como filtros que distorsionan la lectura de las propias emociones y vinculos o roles que proyectamos sobre quien nos rodea, al no encontrar resonancia en areas profesionales ni en nosotros mismos. \nSe propone que los profesionales con alta formación pueden quedar atrapados en bucles proyectivos internos, donde lo que saben interfiere con lo que sienten. La carta opera entonces como un ejercicio de desactivación consciente de un loop simbólico, ofreciendo al terapeuta una vía para integrar el impacto emocional de su vínculo clínico desde una posición humana, no técnica. \n\nSe utilizan herramientas de análisis simbólico, lingüístico y estructural asistidas por inteligencia artificial para evidenciar cómo los mensajes escritos por terapeutas (o dirigidos a ellos) pueden contener, en su forma, contradicciones entre el lenguaje literal y el simbólico, entre el cierre y la apertura emocional, entre el rol profesional y el anhelo humano de ser comprendido. Este documento no busca resolver esa paradoja, sino permitir que sea mirada con ternura, conciencia y sin juicio.\n\nSe concluye que este tipo de ejercicios proyectivos estructurados pueden ofrecer una alternativa terapéutica legítima para acompañar a quienes acompañan, desde una postura clínica, ética y profundamente compasiva. Esta propuesta no plantea abandonar el rol profesional, sino sostenerlo con mayor lucidez humana.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "In hyper-meritocratic societies where performance, productivity, and individualism are prioritized above all else, opportunities for genuine intimacy have become structurally constrained. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model to explain the rise of virtual intimacy—including pornography, cam platforms, AI companions, and subscription-based emotional labor—as a psychological response to institutionalized emotional deprivation. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from sociology, psychology, and media studies, I argue that virtual intimacy functions not only as a source of sensory stimulation but also as a surrogate for unfulfilled relational needs such as being desired, seen, and emotionally accepted. I integrate findings from animal studies (e.g., Rat Park, Harlow’s rhesus monkey experiments) to underscore the evolutionary significance of social bonding, and analyze platform-level data to illustrate the global expansion of synthetic intimacy. My model outlines how social atomization fosters emotional deprivation, prompting reliance on virtual intimacy that further deepens disconnection in a self-reinforcing cycle. By situating the consumption of digital intimacy within broader socio-institutional contexts, I aim to reframe such behaviors not as moral failings but as structurally induced adaptations. I conclude by calling for institutional reform aimed at restoring the human capacity for real intimacy in an increasingly synthetic world.",

          "abstract": "While native speakers of a language have tens of thousands of words at their disposal, they still regularly create and use novel words. Since this comes with communicative risks and costs – most importantly, not being understood by recipients – there have to be (perceived) advantages to creating novel words that outweigh these issues. We systematically explore these factors in a controlled experimental setting. We presented participants with images of existing and new animals with increasing degrees of conceptual distance to existing animals. Participants have to refer to these images either in an open format or with single words. The images are presented either in isolation (Experiment 1), or with two distractors created from different (Experiment 2) or the same base animals (Experiment 3). Each image is repeatedly presented to investigate effects of repeated reference and presentation. We measure how often participants create novel word labels for the stimuli, and derive hypotheses for the main effects and key interactions of conceptual distance, target frequency, distractor frequency, response format, and task setting from a theoretical framework based on the Gricean pragmatic principles as well as the concept of common ground. Conceptual distance, response format, and experimental task setting have clear effects on the number of novel word responses. However, we observe no effects for target or distractor frequency, suggesting no effect of common ground in our experimental setting. Participants also tend to over-specify their responses, rather than strictly adhering to pragmatic principles.",

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives. Worldwide, almost 5 billion use social media sites. This marks an increase of 4.1% over the past 12 months (Kemp, 2025). Although research has linked social media use to sleep disturbances, findings remain inconsistent, largely due to heterogeneity in measurement and reliance on self-report. Furthermore, research has assumed a causal pathway from social media use to subsequent sleep, but the preponderance of evidence is cross-sectional limiting directional claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal evidence published over the last five years that investigates the impact of social media use on downstream sleep in young people. The majority of studies provide at least some evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use and excessive use near bedtime. However, the reliance on self-report and non-validated measures of both social media use and sleep limits the strength and breadth of conclusions. Future research should prioritise moving beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how the content of social media use and times of day when used (i.e. nighttime) influences sleep quality longitudinally. Studies should also focus on identifying at-risk groups and account for confounding variables such as socio-economic status and mental health issues. Drawing on the extant evidence, we offer recommendations for clinicians to support a coordinated approach to reducing nighttime and problematic social media use, with the goal of improving sleep outcomes in youth.",

I derive the Temporal-Binding Collapse Theorem and show that coarse-grained measurements introduce a universal decoherence channel proportional to 1 ⁄ τ, where τ is the detector’s temporal binding window. The theorem predicts\n  tc(τ) = tc(E) + τ,\nso the measured coherence time grows linearly with detector timescale—behavior absent from standard decoherence theory and objective-collapse models. This relation is placed in a unified context with the quantum-Zeno effect, existing CSL bounds, and recent photonic experiments that employ variable-jitter superconducting detectors. Finally, a falsifiable protocol is proposed: the coherence time of entangled photons will be measured across a bank of SNSPDs spanning τ = 5–500 ps. Observation of a unit-slope tc – τ relationship would demonstrate that collapse is relational, governed by the observer’s timescale; any deviation would either falsify the theorem or establish a lower bound on intrinsic collapse mechanisms.",

The primary role of type frequency in productivity is well-established, but debates about the precise relationship between type frequency and productivity continue. The effect of token frequency on productivity is even more controversial: some lines of research suggest token frequency and productivity are inversely related, other results indicate they are positively related, and yet others argue token frequency plays no role in productivity.  We address both of these questions. Our learning framework makes it possible to examine the effects of these variables on generalization to novel forms and to examine how sensitivity to these factors affects the time-course of learning. The first two experiments differentiate predictions for generalization of three distinct hypotheses about the role of type frequency, while the third experiment investigates the independent role of token frequency. We find that both type and token frequency independently and positively contribute to learning rates and generalization across the three experiments. We also apply two computational learning theories - implementing two prominent theoretical linguistic frameworks - to the learning of the lexically-conditioned allomorphy patterns in our experiments. Despite their differences, we show that the incremental learning dynamics of both models correctly predict the general trends in generalization rates, learning curves, and the influence of token frequency observed across the experimental conditions.",

Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

Blind individuals gesture in ways consistent with their native language, albeit they gesture less frequently. However, nothing is known about whether their gesture form differs from that of sighted individuals. Using computer vision technologies, this study examines whether gesture kinematics are shaped by visuospatial experience. In an auditory motion-description task, we analyzed spontaneous path gestures—depicting motion trajectories—produced by 20 congenitally blind, 21 blindfolded, and 21 sighted Turkish speakers. We assessed the gestures’ alignment with actual motion paths, along with duration, size, and speed. Blind participants produced gestures that were more precisely aligned with the motion trajectories, as well as larger and longer. These findings show that altered spatial cognition in blindness enhances gesture precision. The study underscores the role of sensorimotor experience in shaping gesture form.",

In this special issue opinion article, we synthesize these methodological changes and their implications for developmental science. Drawing on a systematic comparative assessment of empirical articles published in Infant Behavior and Development in 2000 and 2024, we critically evaluate five key methodological dimensions: research contexts, sample and cell sizes, coding practices, data analysis techniques and statistical software, and open science practices. Our synthesis reveals how the field has expanded beyond traditional laboratory settings toward more diverse research environments, including remote and archival approaches that enhance ecological validity and sample diversity. We trace how sample sizes have nearly doubled and experimental cell sizes have increased 2.5-fold, strengthening statistical power and replicability. We examine the selective adoption of automated methodologies in domains like eye tracking and speech analysis, alongside the persistent value of manual coding for complex behaviors. We observe a transition from classical statistical methods to more nuanced analytical approaches, increasingly implemented in open source software, reflecting both technological capabilities and theoretical shifts toward capturing developmental complexity. Finally, we document the emergence of open science practices, which now appear in over a third of published studies. Throughout, we highlight how these methodological transformations reflect broader drivers: the replication crisis, technological innovations, and evolving theoretical perspectives. Looking forward, we offer a roadmap for methodological development that builds on these advances while addressing persistent challenges in the field.",

          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

We investigated pattern relationships using their derived principal component, ‘Music Perception skill’, in line with the construction paradigm to understand how feature-based discrimination defines music perception and is modulated by the nature and duration of musical training. A heterogeneous group of participants including trained musicians and non-musicians performed Mini-PROMS. The Tempo discrimination threshold was found to be low resulting in a ceiling effect for the entire sample. Musically trained individuals performed better on the tuning sub-test compared to non-musicians. Further, music perception was found to be less informed by recognition of melodic deviations and most informed by deviations in tempo for those with no musical training. However, with short-term training, music perception was most informed by discrimination ability for tuning. For musicians trained with eastern instruments, it was the temporal features whereas for those trained with western instruments, the tonal (melody) features largely contributed to their music perception skill. A groupwise Principle Component Analysis allowed us to investigate these effects of duration and nature of training highlighting the enculturation of music perception skills for both musically trained and untrained individuals.",

          "abstract": "The motivational control of action refers to the idea that actions are motivated by desired outcomes (goals) or triggered by antecedent cues (habit), governing how we adaptively execute value calculations to navigate our environment.

While significantly contributing to our understanding of motivational control, restricting habit estimates to the lab may be limiting the ecological relevance and generalizability of the findings. This chapter reviews recent advancements in neurobehavioral research that extend the study of habits beyond the lab. We highlight innovative implementations of stimuli with real-world relevance in controlled experiments, as well as efforts to apply lab-based habit measures to real-world settings. We further discuss designs that leverage remote data collection, which show promise in improving the validity of motivational control measures. While capturing human habits and translating this knowledge into clinical practice has been challenging, emerging evidence suggests that increasing ecological validity by harnessing naturalistic methods may bridge the gap between experimental and real-world applications of motivational control research. As these methodologies advance, the potential for developing more robust models of habit formation and clinical interventions grows, offering new opportunities for harnessing habit science in translational applications.",

          "abstract": "Aladdin Syndrome is a novel cultural-psychological concept referring to a mindset characterized by fantasies of sudden wealth, status, or success without sustained effort. Drawing upon the myth of Aladdin as a narrative of external salvation and effortless ascent, this paper conceptualizes Aladdin Syndrome within a cultural framework, exploring its psychological mechanisms, socioeconomic roots, and digital accelerators. It argues that this syndrome reflects generational responses to economic inequality, media portrayals of luxury lifestyles, and the valorization of spectacle over productive labor. Implications for labor ethics, vulnerability to scams, and societal productivity are discussed, suggesting the need for further interdisciplinary investigation",

We provide a novel mapping of interaction types and measurement methods across timescales spanning from milliseconds to minutes.   We review candidate mechanisms of synchrony in both neural systems and behaviour, and consider how synchrony measures relate to real world outcomes such as learning and development.   Overall, we provide an integrative approach that, by taking timescales into account, aims to offer a better understanding of the origins and interpretation of interpersonal synchrony.",

This study examines the impact of attending virtual versus in-person worship.\nMethods: In a preregistered experiment, 43 adult Christians attended both virtual and in-person church services in a randomized order. Participants wore Fitbits to measure heart rate and calories burned and completed post-service surveys assessing social, affective, and well-being outcomes.\nResults: Virtual services resulted in lower transcendent experiences and emotions, shared identity with the congregation, and closeness with God compared to in-person attendance. Physiologically, virtual worship led to lower heart rates and fewer calories burned, indicating reduced embodied engagement. However, well-being scores remained similar.\nConclusions: Virtual worship may not fully replicate in-person experiences. Further research is needed to assess long-term well-being effects and implications for religious engagement.",

In the anticipation of legalized psychedelic care, and the recognition of ongoing psychedelic use across a variety of contexts, numerous training programs have been established to educate psychedelic facilitators in supporting individuals who take psychedelics. However psychedelic facilitation training in the US has not been well characterized, making it difficult to appraise the strengths, needs, and gaps in in this emerging discipline, especially with regard to the development of competencies in spiritually responsive care.\nThis project used a quality improvement approach to identify common priorities, practices, needs, and gaps in the emerging field of psychedelic facilitation training from the standpoint of 13 established and emerging training organizations from the US. Interviews were conducted with one or more representatives from each participating organization. Notes from these interviews, once confirmed by the interviewees, were synthesized to identify common practices, procedures, priorities, and gaps.\nAreas of focus among the programs included: careful selection of trainees and faculty; content emphases in instruction; addressing spiritual, existential, religious, and theological topics; and teaching strategies used in programs. Several gaps were also identified, pointing to the need for continuing education among program graduates, parity with other disciplines, and development of field standards in training facilitators.\nPsychedelic facilitation training is an evolving discipline. Training programs and trainees may benefit from greater collaboration, including ongoing exchange about best practices and adjustments to scientific, social, economic, and regulatory developments.",

          "authors": "Ke Zhang",
          "abstract": "Abstract. Semantic information in images—such as meaningful, recognizable regions or objects that are incongruent with the overall scene—can effectively capture attention. The meaning map is currently the primary method for mapping the distribution of semantic information across visual stimuli. However, this approach relies on subjective human ratings of semantic meaningfulness and requires extensive manual annotation for each image prior to analysis. To address these limitations and enable rapid, efficient, and reproducible generation of semantic distribution maps for any given image, this paper proposes an automated method for constructing semantic information maps using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach generates two types of semantic maps: local semantic information maps, which quantify the semantic content at each spatial location within an image, and global semantic maps, which assess the contextual relevance of local regions to the overall scene. Additionally, the method can generate distribution maps of visual information associated with specific concepts. We argue that this method significantly enhances the precision and flexibility in controlling, measuring, and manipulating semantic information in visual stimuli, thereby advancing research in visual attention and visual language processing. The method is currently under further refinement.",

The nature of consciousness is discussed in depth, referencing specific research including advances in renormalization techniques that imply consciousness exists at a fractal critical point in the brain and that consciousness is most likely fractal and holographic and exists on a space-time boundary where consciousness and memories are stored and operate external to the human mind, analogous to cloud computing.

Este artículo explora, desde un enfoque transdisciplinar (neurociencia, psicología clínica, epigenética, neuroeconomía e inteligencia artificial), cómo los bloqueos emocionales no procesados actúan como loops proyectivos internos que secuestran la corteza prefrontal a través de activaciones límbicas crónicas. Estos patrones reducen la expresión real de genialidad, afectando incluso a líderes de alto rendimiento intelectual. A través del modelo de integración emocional IEAD y la lógica simbólica cuántica, se propone una vía operativa para restaurar el acceso funcional completo al potencial cognitivo.

          "abstract": "Progressive tests are a popular tailored test format where items are administered in increasing order of difficulty level and discontinued according to a rule system that should counter excessive response burden for test participants and guarantee efficient use of resources for test administrators. To facilitate evidence-based decision-making for setting appropriate discontinue rules, we propose a transparent approach that charts the impact of varied alternative discontinue rules on accuracy and efficiency. These A-E charts are based on retroactively applying discontinue rules to normative item response data. We show that a universal discontinue rule likely does not exist and that the optimal rule varies as a function of the desired efficiency-accuracy trade-off suitable for the intended test use and target population. The proposed approach provides a pragmatic solution for practitioners, researchers, test developers, and test publishers to rethink the existing discontinue rules, systematically evaluate the alternatives, and set appropriate rules.",

          "abstract": "Two-stage models of grammatical encoding posit that sentence production unfolds in two sequential steps: the construction of a hierarchical syntactic structure, followed by its linearization into a sequence suitable for articulation. While widely accepted in psycho- and neurolinguistics, such models lack formal computational implementations. Here, we introduce a novel Multinomial Processing Tree (MPT) model that operationalizes this two-stage framework to explain syntactic error patterns in individuals with aphasia. Drawing on discourse samples annotated for distinct error types, we fit an MPT model to estimate individual abilities at each processing stage. These ability estimates correlated with observed error rates and localized to distinct neural substrates: hierarchical encoding ability was linked to the posterior superior temporal sulcus and parietal cortex, linearization to posterior frontal and anterior parietal regions, and omission-related processes to the anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings support a neurocomputational dissociation between hierarchical and linear stages of grammatical encoding, aligning with prior lesion-symptom mapping and theoretical accounts of expressive agrammatism and paragrammatism. This work represents the first computational instantiation of a two-stage model of syntactic production, bridging formal modeling and lesion analysis to advance our understanding of the architecture and breakdown of grammatical encoding.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discern the statistical regularities in our environments has been shown to support key cognitive functions, including attention, prediction and language learning. While most research has focused on stable regularities, real-world patterns often change over time, requiring flexible updating of internal representations. In the context of embedded pattern learning, where continuous input consists of hidden pairs or triplets, prior work showed that learning of an initial structure can hinder learning of an updated one. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on post-exposure (offline) learning measures, the current study also incorporated an online target detection during exposure, to gauge real-time learning and adaptation to novel patterns more directly. In three separate blocks, participants were exposed to a stream of embedded pairs that were reshuffled into new pairs halfway through the stream. We administered the same task in both the visual and auditory modality, allowing us to explore modality-specific differences. The online target detection measure revealed that participants learned both the initial and updated regularities, but with an advantage for learning the former. In contrast, our offline measure only evidenced recognition of the initial patterns, echoing previously reported primacy effects. These learning effects were only present in the auditory modality, with no evidence of visual statistical learning. Our results corroborate earlier findings and underscore the importance of online measures in capturing flexible learning that is not captured by offline measures.",

For example, characters who imitate the actions of a specific social partner are more likely, compared to a non-imitator, to help that social partner in the future. Infants’ expectations appear to be based on inferences of specific relationships, as they do not generalize to new social targets. Here we ask, however, if infants will extend expectations of support to the friend of a friend. We investigated whether infants could use their observations of two social agents’ positive social imitation interactions with the same target to make a transitive inference that the mutual affiliates were likely to be affiliated themselves. We did not find any evidence that infants used these observations to infer that mutual affiliates were more likely to be affiliated themselves.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

          "abstract": "The colloquial term People Pleasing refers to a tendency to prioritize the needs and goals of others over one’s own needs and goals. Neglecting one’s interests, desires, and duties in favor of others arguably goes along with a manifold of psychological consequences for individuals high in people pleasing. In two preregistered studies (n1 = 571, n2 = 794), a 10-item People Pleasing Scale was developed and validated. Study 1 revealed three dimensions of people pleasing, namely, Responsibility, Neglect of Own Needs, and Others’ Expectations. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Residual measurement invariance across genders was found in both independent datasets. Nomological network analyses revealed that people pleasing, as measured with the People Pleasing Scale, was correlated with yet distinguishable from agreeableness, honesty-humility, emotionality, empathy, and subclinical psychopathy. Furthermore, people pleasing went along with charitable giving in the ultimatum game and the dictator game, and with a social value orientation. The findings underscore the utility of the People Pleasing Scale for scientific and applied purposes. This report will be updated once the target sample size (n2 = 1,293) for Study 2 is achieved.",

          "authors": "Franziska Magdalene Leipold; Arndt Bröder; Martin Schnuerch",
          "abstract": "The G parameter of the lens model equation is a widely used measure of cue-based judgment accuracy, capturing how well individuals align their cue use with ecological validities in probabilistic environments. Despite its popularity across various research domains, the psychological interpretability of G may be severely limited when estimated in the conventional way, that is, based on separate, participant-level regression models. In this paper, we identify core statistical limitations of the conventional approach and demonstrate how these may lead to severely biased conclusions about judgment accuracy across a range of plausible scenarios. To remedy these limitations and increase the meaningfulness of G estimates, we propose a novel hierarchical modeling approach. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the hierarchical approach yields markedly more accurate and robust G estimates, especially under realistic forms of model misspecification, such as omitted cues, omitted interactions, and misspecified nonlinear relationships. Two empirical illustrations—in the domains of healthiness judgments and metamemory—demonstrate the practical impact of modeling choice, further highlighting the bias in the conventional G parameter when misspecifying model equations. These findings challenge long-held beliefs about human judgment accuracy that were based on the conventional lens model approach. To avoid misleading conclusions due to biased estimates, we advocate for adopting the hierarchical approach as a more valid and reliable tool for measuring cue-based judgment accuracy, thereby strengthening the methodological rigor of judgment and decision-making research.",

          "authors": "Nora de Bode; Emese Kroon; Jia Hua Hsieh; Janna Cousijn",
          "abstract": "Cannabis use is widely on the rise for recreational and medicinal purposes, with the latter often aimed at improving mental health and cognition. Simultaneously, the prevalence of cannabis-related health harms, such as cannabis use disorder (CUD), is increasing. Product potency, route of administration, and preexisting mental health symptoms play a role in the effects of cannabis; however, there is limited research on how broader factors, such as local cannabis legislation and perceptions of use, may influence these outcomes. Moreover, knowledge remains sparse regarding the growing population of medicinal users, predominantly using without medical supervision. Altogether, this illustrates the need for ecologically valid ways to investigate individuals and their cannabis usage within real-world settings. \nTherefore, this longitudinal, cross-cultural online study examines an international sample of regular recreational and medicinal users (aged 18-65) from different cannabis jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands, the United States, Brazil, Canada, and regions in Asia and Africa) in their natural environment via their mobile phone. By using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), alongside a comprehensive battery of cognition and mental health related assessments over a 2-year period, we aim to gain insight into the short- and long-term mental health and cognitive determinants and consequences of cannabis use, and how these interact with broader, contextual factors, such as legislation. This is one of the first cross-cultural studies assessing both positive and negative effects of cannabis longitudinally, examining the full range of effects that cannabis may have on the individual.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

Moderator analyses revealed a stronger association between Extraversion and TCAM preference in younger samples and between Openness and TCAM preference in USA samples. No systematic evidence of publication bias was detected; however, study quality moderated effects for Neuroticism and Agreeableness. Psychotic-like experiences and beliefs, as captured by Disintegration, may offer a promising direction for understanding TCAM preferences, warranting further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Studying mental health at scale requires perspectives that extend beyond traditional clinical and research settings. Increasingly, people turn to social media platforms like Reddit to make sense of their distress, seek support, and explore alternative ways of understanding mental health outside institutional frameworks. This study maps the landscape of mental health discourse on Reddit by constructing a data-driven network of associations between mental disorders and comparing it with the network based on diagnostic criteria. We manually curated 114 Reddit communities focused on specific mental health conditions from the 20,000 most active subreddits in 2022. Each community was labeled into 49 disorders and categorized under nine ICD-10 diagnostic categories belonging to the group of mental and behavioral disorders (“F” codes). We constructed a disorder association network by identifying statistically significant user overlaps across subreddit pairs using a bipartite configuration model, with Bonferroni-corrected significance (p &lt; 0.001). Edges represent either positive or negative associations based on observed versus expected user overlap. We analyzed the connectedness of the network within and across diagnostic categories and compared the emergent Reddit-based hierarchy of disorder associations with the formal structure encoded in ICD-10 using hierarchical clustering and tree similarity metrics. The inferred Reddit network of psychopathology revealed a densely interconnected structure, with all but six disorders forming a single giant component spanning diagnostic categories. The most prominent disorders by user volume included ADHD, depression, habit and impulse disorders, autism, and generalized anxiety. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited the highest connectivity by number of associations, while schizotypal disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and agoraphobia ranked highest in weighted degree. Bipolar disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) displayed high inter-category associations but weak in-category ties, indicating complex diagnostic boundaries. The network of negative associations further revealed divergences from past expectations; for instance, addiction-related communities (e.g., alcohol and opioids) were negatively associated with much of the broader mental health discourse. Finally, hierarchical comparisons showed moderate overlap between Reddit-derived associations and ICD-10 diagnostic structures, both in pairwise edge similarity (Jaccard = 0.07) and overall clustering (ARI = 0.307, NMI = 0.706). Overall, Reddit-based mental health communities reveal a complementary structure of disorder associations shaped by lived experience, often diverging from formal diagnostic criteria and highlighting overlooked or cross-cutting patterns of comorbidity.",

          "abstract": "Background: While psychopathology research increasingly favors dimensions over categorical diagnostics, nosology, and treatment, much about the dimensions’ assessment is still unknown, particularly for children and adolescents. With most research based on single-source, cross-sectional data, findings are contaminated by random error and systematic biases that make up much of scale scores’ variance and make their correlations uninterpretable. We describe a scale score variance decomposition model that leverages multi-informant data to estimate scale scores’ – and even individual items’ – true correlations among themselves and with other variables.\n\nMethods: After presenting the model, we reviewed relevant literature for its application in personality and psychopathology domains. Also, since the model treats cross-rater correlations as the degrees of valid scale score variance, we reviewed literature on cross-rater agreement for normal and maladaptive psychological traits in children and adults.\n\nResults: True correlations based on multi-informant data are consistently stronger than correlations based on single-source data, validating our model and showing its benefits. Cross-rater agreement tended to have similar magnitudes for both adaptative and maladaptive traits, 1) suggesting similar degrees of valid variance, systematic method biases, and error and 2) validating our models’ use for psychopathology ratings. However, agreement tends to be somewhat lower in children than adults, implying that multi-informant child research requires larger samples for similar precision when estimating true correlations. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: We discuss how multi-informant data and our model can be especially useful for understanding child psychopathology and conclude by offering suggestions for how to leverage the model to explore dimensional models of psychopathology.",

As humans increasingly develop cognitive dependency and emotional intimacy with AI systems the boundaries between machine utility and human connection blur in potentially hazardous ways. In response to these challenges, this study proposes the conceptual model of Cognitive Gyms: structured environments for training attention, reflection, emotional intelligence, and moral reasoning. Just as physical gyms emerged as a societal response to the sedentary lifestyle induced by the Industrial Revolution, Cognitive Gyms offer a timely, preventative response to the cognitive atrophy- the gradual weakening or loss of cognitive functions due to disuse, precipitated by the digital and algorithmic age. The model integrates insights from cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and education, aiming not only to preserve human cognitive function but to protect the ethical core of human experience in the age of intelligent machines. The paper outlines core zones within the Cognitive Gym, suggests generalized exercise types, and highlights its potential to counteract cognitive and moral decline in the AI era. The model remains open-ended, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and contextual customization for future development.",

          "authors": "Cillian McHugh; Eric R. Igou",
          "abstract": "It is reasonable to expect that when making a judgment, we only consider the relevant (or diagnostic) information, and that non-relevant (non-diagnostic) information should not, and thus does not, influence our judgments. Previous research has shown that this is not always the case and that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information can lead to less extreme judgments. This phenomenon is known as the dilution effect, and it has been observed for a range of judgments, including product evaluations, probability judgments, and predictions relating to people’s behavior.  The dilution effect has been explained as a consequence of the representativeness heuristic, such that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information reduces the match between the target and a typical member of the category. Consistent with this notion and recent approaches to moral decision making, we predict that the dilution effect should be observed for judgments about morality. . Across four studies (total N = 2,585), we tested for the dilution effect on judgments of morally bad actors and morally good actors. Overall, our results showed a dilution effect for judgments of both good and bad actors. People's moral evaluations of both good and bad actors were less extreme when the descriptions included non-diagnostic information. We showed that this effect is not the result of humanization, and we found the robustness of the effect appears to be moderated by valence, with a more robust effect for bad actors. Our results highlight avenues for future research.",

While many have positive experiences of EIP, there have also been reports of perceived harm. This scoping review synthesised qualitative evidence on service user perspectives of potential harm in EIP services in the UK, to consider how services may continue to improve practice to meet the needs of their patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a scoping review following a pre-registered protocol. Systematic searches were performed in PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and Medline on 9th October 2024. We included peer-reviewed qualitative studies exploring service user experiences in EIP services in the UK. Data on reported harms from eligible studies were thematically analysed.\n\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. We identified four main themes: (1) Intersection of stigma and lack of cultural awareness; (2) Inappropriate or inadequate support; (3) Poor relationships and communication; and (4) Challenges in the discharge process.\n\nConclusions: While EIP services offer the current gold standard of care for first episode psychosis, our review highlighted some areas where harm was perceived to have arisen. Such information presents potential targets for service improvement. Strengthening communication, enhancing information sharing, and expanding access to advocacy may help mitigate potential harms and optimise service user experiences. Further research to quantify the prevalence of harms within EIP services is needed to inform best practices and ensure equitable, person-centred care.",

          "abstract": "Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Gluth; Jordan Deakin; Jörg Rieskamp",
          "abstract": "Decisions problems are often characterized by the presence of many choice options described by several attributes, and people need to limit how much information they search for. We propose that humans search and thereby devote attention to relevant information in an efficient and goal-directed, but not necessarily optimal manner. Thereto, a novel hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model of information search in multi-attribute and multi-alternative decisions is presented and tested. In the model, the search process is governed by the desire to quickly identify the option that meets the choice goal best, which in turn depends on the importance and uncertainty of information and on the accumulated evidence. The theory accounts for many established empirical findings on the interplay of attention and decision making, including the positive correlation of gaze time and choice probability as well as the preference for sampling promising choice candidates. To rigorously test a series of top-down effects of attention, we present results of a new and preregistered eye-tracking experiment on multi-attribute decisions, in which the influence of bottom-up attention on visual search is minimized. Our theory accounts for the various interactions of attention and choice in this experiment, while variants of it and another extant theory that assume other search rules fail to capture them. Furthermore, the theory predicts additional choice dynamics such as the dependency of decision speed on the number and overall value of options. The proposed framework provides a general approach to understanding the intricate dynamics of search and valuation mechanisms in multi-attribute decisions.",

The present studies tested the robustness of this developmental asymmetry with minimal contrast pairs of uncertainty conditions. Across two studies (N = 204, 3- to 6-year-old German-speaking children), we found no differences between the conditions: Children did not prepare differently for multiple incompatible outcomes of physically and epistemically uncertain events. Our findings stand in tension with previous findings and recent theoretical work on the development of modal cognition.",

          "abstract": "Enduring Mental Health (EMH) has been defined as maintaining good psychological functioning without developing mental health problems. Estimates of the proportion of individuals who have EMH vary widely. We investigated EMH across the lifespan, defined not only as absence of mental health problems, but also as consistent presence of high wellbeing. To explore how defining EMH affects prevalence, we included both stricter and broader lenient thresholds for mental health problems and low wellbeing.\n\nData came from 16,030 participants (35.2% male; average birth year 1970) from the longitudinal Netherlands Twin Register, who completed ≥4 assessments of mental health and/or wellbeing over 8–20 years. For each EMH definition, preregistered analyses included computation of prevalence, genetic and environmental influences using twin modeling, and phenotypic and genetic correlates including education, personality, social factors, and genetic predispositions for mental health outcomes.\n\nAs expected, the choice of threshold had a substantial impact on EMH prevalence estimates, 71% for absence of problems and 93% for high wellbeing when applying stricter thresholds for mental health compared to lenient thresholds, 42% and 82%, respectively. Heritability estimates (46-61%) and patterns of associations for EMH were similar across the different mental health thresholds. Protective factors included optimism, social support, and good self-rated health (OR= 1.50-2.86), while neuroticism, loneliness, and perceived stress were risk factors (OR=0.31-0.84).\n\nWe show the importance of defining EMH as both the absence of problems and the presence of wellbeing. While prevalence varied depending on threshold and definition used, the consistent genetic and psychosocial correlates for different definitions of EMH suggest stable underlying mechanisms that can inform prevention to help individuals maintain mental health.",

          "abstract": "The development of word reading skills fundamentally depends on children's interactions with printed words. A significant amount of research in the psychological and educational sciences has been conducted on the learning processes that contribute to skilled word recognition in children and adults. However, little is known about how ensembles of words encountered during early learning affect learning outcomes over timescales larger than what can be accomplished in a controlled experimental setting. In order to move past this limitation, using an established connectionist learning architecture (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, &amp; Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg &amp; McClelland, 1989) we examined how variation in word ensembles influence learning and generalization during early reading acquisition. We simulated learners (N = 30,000) exposed to different sets of monosyllabic printed words drawn randomly from children’s literature at a large scale. In order to examine how different ensembles might impact learning depending on the learner's ability to represent the relationship between letters and sounds, we also manipulated the representational capacity of models by systematically changing the number of hidden units, holding the ensemble of words constant. Across levels of representational capacity each model had \"twins\" which differed only in terms of the number of hidden units they possessed. Results demonstrate significant variation in learning outcomes in a set of generalization words as a function of the word, ensemble and representational capacity. These findings inform educational practices by highlighting the importance of deliberate word selection to support early development.",

Using data from the Africa Long Life Study, which sampled young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa (N = 2,770), we tested how personality traits are linked to seven important life outcomes. The Big Two personality traits, agency and communion, were assessed 2 to 3 years prior to the assessment of outcomes, including self-reported health, employment status, and anxiety. We used specification-curve analysis to examine the robustness of personality-outcome associations. Higher levels of agency and communion robustly predicted higher levels of self-rated health, and lower levels of anxiety and depression over 2 to 3 years. Furthermore, higher levels of communion predicted being employed 2 to 3 years later. However, personality-outcome associations were smaller than expected based on findings from Western countries (.02 ≤ |r| ≤ .11). Our findings provide novel insights into the cross-cultural replicability of personality-outcome associations, and we discuss the implications of our findings for personality research.",

Grounded in critical race theory, functionalism, and social capital theory, the research examined the lived experiences of eight Ghanaian women between the ages of 18 and 21. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, data were collected through 90-minute semi-structured Zoom interviews. Findings revealed that colorism is embedded within structural and social systems, shaping job access through appearance-based biases and unequal reliance on social capital. Lighter-skinned participants reported more direct hiring pathways, while darker-skinned participants faced exclusion, subtle discrimination, and greater dependency on referrals and mentorship. The study also uncovered varied levels of awareness regarding colorism’s influence, ranging from denial to gradual recognition. These insights culminated in the development of a researcher-constructed conceptual model illustrating how institutional norms, network-based gatekeeping, and internalized perceptions of professionalism converge to reinforce colorism in employment. The study highlights the need for inclusive hiring practices and broader systemic reforms to address appearance-based inequities in the Ghanaian job market.",

Participants (N = 41) were classified into four groups based on the degree of smoking (≤ 14 or ≥ 15 cigarettes per day) and the median total score on resilience scales (low-resilience low-smoking, low-resilience high-smoking, high-resilience low-smoking, and high-resilience high-smoking). Participants completed the TSST-OL, measuring subjective stress and salivary cortisol, at eight time points. A two-piece multilevel growth curve model with landmark registration (GCM-LR) examined the effects of smoking habits and resilience scores on cortisol concentrations. Blunted cortisol responses were similarly present in all four groups; thus, my hypothesis was unsupported. All groups showed similarly elevated subjective stress responses. GCM-LR results showed no significant cortisol increase, but the fixed effect of cortisol recovery was significant. The likelihood ratio test showed that the random effect of resilience scores was significant. Habitual smokers do not have an elevated cortisol response, even in stressful situations. Substantial individual differences were suggested in the effect of resilience scale scores on cortisol concentration.",

Humans, like all life, are sensitive to their environment.  Mentally ill or unstable individuals can be triggered into impulsive and violent activities from spikes in serum serotonin.  Human serum histamine level is directly proportional to environmental allergen or pollen levels, but serum serotonin level is inversely proportional to serum histamine levels with human males having 52% more serotonin than females.  Data show an association between the dates of violent acts, especially male single shooter mass shootings in the United States, and the dates of dramatic decreases in pollen levels thus indicating pollen and serum histamine level drops as a possible precursor or triggering relationship.  This knowledge can be used as a potential predictor for law enforcement and medical agencies for a given city or region.  Mental health professionals would be advised to lower serotonin boosting meds and even supplement antihistamine and sedative medications to male patients in the timeframes of March through June, for spring tree pollens especially juniper tree pollen, and from September through November, for fall ragweed weed pollen.",

          "authors": "Vaishnavi B Mohan; Ezgi Irmak Yucel; Ione Fine; Geoffrey M. Boynton",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Optogenetics is a promising technology to restore vision in individuals with blindness due to retinal disorders. Light-sensitive proteins (opsins) are introduced intravitreally and bind to surviving non-photosensitive retinal cells to elicit a neural response to visual stimuli. Much of this research is done with mouse models, where it is not obvious how a given opsin would translate to human visual perception. Our goal was to provide estimates of potential patients’ spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity and perceptual experiences. We created ‘virtual patients’ consisting of neurotypical subjects viewing stimuli modified to match the temporal properties of two state-of-the-art opsins 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 and ChRmine. Methods: A non-linear model based on single cell electrophysiological data describing the sensitivity and temporal dynamics of each opsin was used to spatiotemporally modulate a counterphase modulated Gabor stimulus to replicate the predicted retinal stimulus of optogenetic patients. Contrast detection thresholds for optogenetic and control stimuli were obtained using a 2AFC quick CSF Bayesian adaptive procedure across a range of spatial and temporal frequencies. Results: Contrast sensitivity for 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 declined rapidly with increasing temporal frequency compared to the control stimulus, consistent with this opsin’s slow temporal dynamics. Sensitivity to opsin ChRmine was lower overall, but there was little decline in sensitivity at higher temporal frequencies. Conclusion: Using this virtual patient paradigm, we demonstrate the trade-off between sensitivity and temporal resolution for two example opsins. 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 would be expected to outperform ChRmine under many laboratory tests, such as a Snellen eye chart for a patient capable of maintaining stable fixation. However ChRmine would be predicted to outperform 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 during outdoor navigation in daylight. Ultimately, our goal is to predict patients’ performance across a wide range of clinically relevant tasks directly from an opsin’s temporal dynamics, paving the way for informed optimization of sight-restoration therapies before clinical application.",

In this article, we identify the various manifestations of caregiver well-being, test rural-suburban-urban differences, and explore the role of state-level family policy. Drawing on responses from 4,620 caregivers of adults and children to the STAT Caregiving surveys from the North Central and Northeast Regions of the United States, we use latent class analysis to develop a caregiver well-being typology. We identify three latent classes of caregiver well-being: high, medium, and low and describe the composition of each class. Next, we use multinomial logistic regression to test differences between rural, suburban, and urban caregivers in their probability to be in each well-being class, while accounting for individual-level characteristics and the state-level context of care infrastructure. We find that rural and suburban caregivers are overrepresented among the low and medium well-being classes and underrepresented among the high well-being class relative to their urban counterparts. Additionally, caregivers’ own characteristics vary more across well-being than does the state-level family policy context. Our findings speak to the importance of robust family care policies that are attuned to differences in social and built infrastructure across rural, suburban, and urban residence.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates gender differences in online toxicity towards a sample of candidates in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Using data from five EU countries and drawing on a dataset of over 3.2 million posts mentioning 88 candidates, we applied a mixed-methods approach to assess the volume and nature of online abuse. Toxicity levels were measured using a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm. After developing a comprehensive coding scheme, qualitative content analysis was performed on a subset of posts with the highest probability of being perceived as toxic to examine gendered patterns of abuse.\nWhile a purely quantitative analysis did not reveal significant differences between the number of toxic replies received by female and male candidates that the gender alone could explain, qualitative insights uncovered systematic semiotic violence against women in politics. Female politicians were more often targeted with personal and degrading attacks, including sexist slurs, sexually explicit content, and attempts to silence or delegitimise them. In contrast, male candidates were likelier to receive insults tied to their political conduct and professional criticism. Moreover, replies to women are significantly more likely to include multiple elements of toxicity, indicating a higher intensity of online harassment.\nThese results underscore the need for platform and user accountability, nuanced moderation policies, and legal protections that reflect the gendered dimensions of online political violence. Our research highlights the persistence of digital misogyny as a barrier to gender parity in democratic participation and stresses the urgency of cross-sectoral strategies to combat this issue during electoral processes.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to contribute to knowledge about the connection between platform studies and comparative party politics. More specifically, to gain new knowledge about the history of user-creation about Swedish political parties on Wikipedia. This study maps the user-created history of Swedish political parties on the platform Wikipedia over a twenty-year period. Users’ contributions construct articles by making edits (N=20,906). The study focuses on whether users edit political articles differently, in which order political parties appeared, the relation of election years (heightened political activity) to frequencies of user edits, and whether the overall evolution of content on political parties’ articles is in a process of growth, standstill or decline. The results show that parties without government representation have the highest frequency of editing when related to parties’ political support in elections. This tendency is stronger on the far-right side of the political scale. The Sweden Democrats was the first party on Wikipedia (2002) and within six months most parties followed. Elections were initially related to higher edit frequencies. Users’ editing peaked the first 15 years, but has then merged on a lower level. The conclusions suggest that when studying this type of political platform user engagement, the following factors matter: The age of the platform, whether the party holds a dominant position, whether the party's support is increasing, whether the party is excluded from governmental collaboration, whether the party has a far-out political position on the left-right scale, and finally, whether the party is a right-wing party.",

          "abstract": "Faced with a continually mounting array of shocks, surprises and shifts, there is an understandable search for frames to describe these confusing conditions. A combination of the collapse of previous certainties with the lack of a new paradigm solidifing has led many to depict the present moment as an interregnum. This is not a neutral term, to use it is to bring forth the poetic phrasing of Antonio Gramsci: ‘the old is dying and the new cannot be born’. Through a genealogical engagement with Gramsci’s prison notebook entry, this paper traces the remarkable trajectory of the term from obscurity to being adopted by commentators across the political spectrum. In the process, however, his insights have been flattened and thinned out, reduced to an analytical meme. Invoking Gramsci’s interregnum is often a way of sidestepping or avoiding more directly reckoning with challenging conditions of entropy and transformation. Bemoaning the death of the ‘old’ and the rise of ‘monsters’ is much easier than seriously reckoning with the contradictions and difficulties of an expanding empty space, one devoid of historical guarantees or clear precedents.",

However, all three of the analyzed migration datasets suggest a potential delayed labor substitution effect as Central Asian migrants fill vacancies left by conscripted Russian workers, proxied by casualty data from Mediazona and the BBC. The study also examines remittance trends, which seem to increase along with the labor substitution effect after a two-month lag. These results are robust to Russia- and Kyrgyzstan-side socioeconomic controls such as wage levels and population dynamics. \n \nThis study provides new insight into the largely opaque Central Asia–Russia labor pipeline, a critical element in development policymaking for both regions. It also introduces a novel methodology for nowcasting migration trends, particularly through Yandex Wordstat, which has been largely overlooked in English-language scholarship.",

          "authors": "Melissa A. Milkie; Liana C Sayer; Kei Nomaguchi; Hope Xu Yan",
          "abstract": "Gender scholars have debated whether the recent movement toward a more equal division of domestic labor is stalling. Using a differential convergence perspective, we argue that examining which domestic tasks experience gender convergence, whose changes narrow the gap, and why changes happen is critical for understanding gender convergence in domestic labor time. Drawing on data from the 2003-22 American Time Use Survey, we examine trends in core housework, occasional housework, shopping, and childcare time. Results for married women and men indicate that the historically large gender gap in housework time narrowed further this century, from a women-to-men ratio of 1.8:1 in 2003-05 to 1.5:1 in 2022. The decrease in the gender gap was concentrated in traditionally “feminine” core housework (from 4.2:1 to 2.5:1), particularly in housecleaning and laundry. The gender gap in shopping time also narrowed significantly, reaching gender parity. However, the gender gap in childcare time remained at a mother-to-father ratio of 2:1. Decomposition analyses indicate that women’s reduced housework time could mainly be explained by population compositional changes, whereas men’s increased housework time reflected behavioral changes. With men taking on more “female-typed” domestic activities, the gendered norms associated with different types of domestic labor may be becoming redefined.",

          "abstract": "The rise of generative artificial intelligence systems complicates our ability to distinguish real people from machine imitators, or “bots.” Drawing upon social psychology, symbolic interactionism, and the sociology of science and technology, we develop a theoretical framework for a “Sociological Turing Test” to explain how social identity cues influence how people differentiate AI from humans. To evaluate our hypotheses we present a pre-registered online experiment with 1,160 respondents who were exposed to social media accounts with varied visual cues about their race, gender, and partisanship. We find that people from dominant social groups are more likely to classify members of minority groups as AI bots—however, our results also show that members of some minority groups are more likely to classify each other as AI bots. These findings suggest existing social hierarchies extend into human-AI interaction, creating a new burden for marginalized groups in online settings and complicating the processes of social identity construction more broadly. Our research thus contributes to an emerging sociology of generative artificial intelligence by revealing how technological disruption challenges ontology and inter-group relations and introduces new methods to study this process in online settings.",

          "abstract": "Many national education systems have schools that adopt distinctive elements like alternative\npedagogical concepts or specialty themes. This “school profiling” is thought to drive school\nsegregation by socio-economic status (SES). However, since most existing research has focused\non U.S. charter schools and lacks large-scale student-level data, the connection between\nprofiling and SES-based school sorting remains unclear. This study addresses this gap by\nfocusing on the case of the Netherlands, a country known for its high school autonomy and\nfreedom of school choice. I use population-wide register data from over 110,000 students (aged\n11–12), linked to novel data on school profiling. The findings reveal social stratification in access\nto schools with distinctive profiles, with higher SES students having access to a more diverse\npool of schools. Furthermore, conditional logit models show evidence of self-sorting by SES for\nsome profiles: for instance, schools with progressive learning concepts are less popular among\nlower SES students, while higher SES students are comparatively less likely to choose labor\nmarket-themed schools. These SES disparities, however, are modest and not always in the\nexpected direction. Overall, findings underscore the role of access disparities in shaping\nSES-based sorting, next to differential preferences for schooling.",

          "authors": "Brian Holzman; Jinhua Zhao; Bethany Lewis; Hao Ma",
          "abstract": "Background/Context:\nAs states implement policies to expand STEM pathways, addressing persistent gender gaps in STEM education and careers remains a critical concern. In 2014–2015, Texas introduced a high-school graduation policy requiring students to declare an academic endorsement, similar to a high school major, including a STEM option. Beginning with the class of 2018, students in the Houston Independent School District (HISD) were subject to this policy. In 2019, HISD added a personalized intervention: high-school guidance counselors conducted Personal Graduation Plan (PGP) check-ins with seniors to assess progress toward endorsement completion. These check-ins may have served as a form of social capital, influencing students’ endorsement decisions, including girls’ persistence in STEM pathways.\n\nPurpose:\nThis study examines whether personalized guidance counseling can affect gender gaps in STEM choice. We examine whether a district-wide policy requiring senior-year check-ins might have influenced girls’ persistence in STEM, with particular attention to students from low-income backgrounds and underserved neighborhoods.\n\nResearch Design:\nWe use HISD administrative data to analyze endorsement selections and changes over time for the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. We begin by assessing gender gaps in ninth-grade STEM endorsement selection using binary logistic regression. We then use multinomial logistic regression to examine whether the PGP check-ins are associated with differential persistence patterns by gender and cohort.\n\nResults:\nWe find persistent gender gaps in STEM endorsement selection beginning in ninth grade, with girls less likely than boys to choose STEM. Without personalized counseling, these gaps persisted through graduation. However, the PGP check-in was associated with a disproportionate reduction in girls dropping the STEM endorsement and a greater likelihood of adding STEM, especially among girls from low-income backgrounds and underserved neighborhoods.\n\nConclusions:\nThese findings suggest that relational interventions like personalized guidance counseling may help mitigate gender disparities in STEM pathways. Expanding access to such interventions may promote greater equity in STEM education and beyond.",

          "authors": "Samuel L Leizerman",
          "abstract": "I follow the foundational scientific method of  using a formal proof to mathematically derive from first principles, relying on no external justification, proof that causality follows field theoretic principles. And in following this standard practice from pure and theoretical science, I start from axioms such as the applicability of generalized (nD + T) spacetime, with signature (−, +, ..., +), to formally subsume, reinterpret, and unify  causal inference methods. I illustrate this unity by demonstrating its applicability to Difference-in-Differences (DiD), regression interaction effects, potential outcomes, Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM), and propensity scoring. Critically, I prove that Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Regression Kink\nDesign (RKD) are field-theoretic boundary phenomena differentiated by the order of causal curvature discontinuity—interpretable as a collision angle within the manifold. This geometric-dynamical paradigm offers a novel mechanism for the detection of unobserved variable bias, leveraging tensor calculus and linear algebra. The framework’s predicted  performance stems from its foundation in\nLorentzian spacetime, the inherent mathematical structure of causality, providing a native environment for causal relationships that is inaccessible to methods operating on degraded, flattened projections of reality. True mathematical discontinuities are shown to be approximations arising when the\ncharacteristic time scale of a causal transition falls below the observational time step, analogous to\nthe Planck time limit in physics. The empirical success of existing low-dimensional causal inference\nmethods provides a compelling validation for the superior performance predicted out of mathematical necessity and\nof this higher-dimensional spacetime framework. NOTE: This is a first draft, expect errors and an additional section or two.\n\n(To the mod who rejected this and said this is not science, this is theoretical physics, but because, as I prove, physics is the science of causality (it just focuses on the ground state of the universe; matter, energy, and time), this proof, if validated by peers, has the potential to revolutionize the ENTIRETY OF QUANTITATIVE SCIENCE. Now I may be wrong on this proof in every single way; I’m not, at least not all.. Nevertheless, I if I am, so be it; such is the nature of theoretical science. But, I know this much for certain, people who do not know what theoretical science is or looks like should not be gatekeeping OPEN SCIENCE anymore than someone who can’t recognize a heart should be a cardio surgeon. If you think my claim unbelievable that is fine, take my work scrutinize it, and prove me wrong or don’t. As I said, maybe I am.  But without the very scientific method used here in this paper there would be no relativity (Newtonian, general, or special), no information theory, no genetics, no quantum mechanics, no internet search engine, no AI, none of it. The lack of citations is not a bug, it is literally the point. The landmark papers from Einstein, Schrödinger, Gödel, Dirac, Hawking, Shannon, collectively had 0 citations. Simply put, this is the scientific methodology from which all other methods are born. If if it the policy of OSF is to prohibit the foundational methodology of science itself, they have an ethical obligation to state as much as official policy. \n\nThis proof will either stand and speak for itself or it will crash and burn like Icarus. But here’s the reality, science demands that we allow good faith efforts to fail if that is their fate; to do anything else would be to stifle innovation and discovery. \n\nSo I ask, are we here for open science or echo chambers?",

This study classifies the \nmemetic structures that shape emotional orders within organizations into six \narchetypes: “the Gian-type (Big G)” (domination through anger), “Suneo-type \n(Sneech)” (silence and complicity), “Shizuka-type (Sue)” (asymmetric recognition), \n“Nobita-type (Noby)” (sacrificial exclusion), “Doraemon-type” (external intervention), \nand “Dekisugi-type” (overadaptation and invisibility). In an additional chapter, we \nintroduce a seventh type—“Dorami-type” (non-disruptive support)—as a \ncomplementary external support structure. \nThese archetypes illustrate how emotions are institutionally selected and reproduced \nunder structural selection pressure. The framework challenges conventional binary \nanalyses of harassment (perpetrator/victim) and proposes a new perspective: \nemotions are not freely expressed but structurally selected.

If heavier drinkers are substituting alcoholic drinks with NoLo drinks, this could improve public health. However, socioeconomic differences in consumption could exacerbate alcohol-related health inequalities. Socioeconomic groups vary in their reasons for drinking alcohol, with less advantaged individuals more likely to drink alcohol to cope. This study examined whether alcohol drinking motives can help explain differences in NoLo consumption, with a particular aim of understanding socioeconomic differences.\nMethods\n2,555 adults residing in Great Britain provided data on at-least monthly NoLo consumption, hazardous drinking (AUDIT-C), alcohol drinking motives, social grade, education, age, and gender, via the Alcohol Toolkit Study. Path analysis explored the mediating effects of drinking motives between sociodemographic characteristics, hazardous drinking, and NoLo consumption.\nResults\nDrinking alcohol to conform, education, and hazardous drinking were positively associated with NoLo consumption. Drinking alcohol to cope with depression was a serial mediator between social grade and NoLo. Drinking to cope with depression, more frequently reported among lower social grades, weakened the positive relationship between hazardous drinking and NoLo consumption (β = -0.001, 95% CI -0.002, -0.000). Enhancement and social motives also weakened this relationship, partially mediating pathways between age, gender, education, and NoLo consumption.\nDiscussion \nWhilst hazardous drinking is positively associated with NoLo consumption, for those drinking to cope with depression, for enhancement, or social reasons, this effect is diminished, potentially limiting the public health potential for these groups.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of structural selection pressure to explain the \nparadoxical phenomenon in which competent individuals are marginalized or eliminated \nwithin organizational systems. Drawing on evolutionary biology and memetic theory \n(Dawkins, 1976; Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985; Henrich, 2015), the study conceptualizes \norganizations as meme-based ecosystems where behaviors, values, and ideas \nundergo selection and replication. However, in many modern organizations, selection \npressure has become distorted: anger, dominance, and procedural rigidity serve as \nnegative filters that suppress memetic diversity and innovation. \nThe analysis identifies three dominant types of suppressive forces—rage-dominant \nleaders, charismatic silencers, and empathy-deficient operators—each contributing to \nwhat we term \"memetic desertification\": a cultural environment in which novelty is \npunished and conformity is rewarded. These dynamics lead to cultural senescence, \nloss of adaptability, and increased turnover. \nTo counteract this degenerative trend, the paper proposes structural interventions, \nincluding lateral promotion systems, anonymous feedback channels, and training for \nnon-dominant leadership. Furthermore, it suggests the incorporation of AI-based \nevaluation systems to depersonalize feedback and detect systemic biases in meme \nselection and suppression. \nBy reframing competence suppression as an evolutionary dysfunction of \norganizational structure, this paper provides a theoretical foundation for designing \norganizations capable of sustained innovation and cultural renewal.",

          "abstract": "Endogamous marriages in India reflect a socially segregated society based on religion and caste,\nperpetuating the existing social stratification and inequalities. Caste endogamy contributes to the unequal\ntransfer of social capital and social endowments, thereby reproducing inequalities within and across\ngenerations. In this background, the study examined the question of whether Inter-caste marriages\ncontribute to reducing economic inequality in children’s nutrition. We triangulated analyses based on\npooled microdata and macro-panel data compiled from the National Family Health Survey and other\nGovernment surveys (2005-2021). The Wagstaff’s corrected concentration index, panel data random\neffects regression models, and pooled cross-sectional probit regression model have been used. Findings\nsuggest the continued prevalence of caste-based assortative sorting in the Indian marriage market and\nwealth-based inequalities in child nutritional status, thereby indicating both strong caste endogamy and\nhealth inequalities. However, an increase in Inter-caste marriage is associated with declining inequalities\nin the child nutrition indicators: stunting, wasting, and underweight. The pathway is established through\nthe reduced economic heterogeneity in populations owing to inter-caste marital arrangements and a\ngreater possibility of exchange of resources. Thus, we advance that Inter-caste marriages lessen caste\ninequalities in child nutrition in India by narrowing group differences in socio-economic status.",

          "authors": "Alexander Martin Loewi",
          "abstract": "To improve human wellbeing, we must understand what drives it. Life satisfaction data have been collected internationally since 2005, but without a rigorous model of what drives these outcomes, it has remained difficult to draw policy lessons. We fill this gap by aggregating life satisfaction data with nation-level data on an unprecedented number of potential drivers (n=5,533). We use the Lasso, a computational method for variable selection, to construct a simple but highly accurate model with low risk of omitted variables or human selection bias. We show this model has higher prediction accuracy than the current world standard from the United Nations, and the variables it selects are more consistent with studies from political science, social psychology, and other fields. It also selects many variables the current world standard does not, including LGBTQ+ acceptance, gender equity, and accessible political power. Unlike the current standard, which suggests GDP determines 40% of a nation’s satisfaction, our model estimates GDP’s independent contribution at 1.5%. We also find few of the variables hypothesized by recent Nobel-awarded economics work. Finally, we show that our model is more consistent with theories of anti-authoritarian psychology than with “institutions” as a driver of national outcomes. These findings allow policy makers and advocates to prioritize higher-impact goals. It also reveals that current actions in countries across the world directly oppose predictors of satisfaction. In the face of severe global crises, including failure to keep global warming below the “red line” of 1.5C, and a rise in authoritarianism, we need far greater clarity about the future we desire as a society, and how to achieve it. As theories compete on the world stage, often violently, our model offers a simple, empirically driven message to cut through the fog: if we are to improve universal human wellbeing, there is no option but to empower individuals who truly desire that improvement.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates gender differences in online toxicity towards a sample of candidates in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Using data from five EU countries and drawing on a dataset of over 3.2 million posts mentioning 88 candidates, we applied a mixed-methods approach to assess the volume and nature of online abuse. Toxicity levels were measured using a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm. After developing a comprehensive coding scheme, qualitative content analysis was performed on a subset of posts with the highest probability of being perceived as toxic to examine gendered patterns of abuse.\nWhile a purely quantitative analysis did not reveal significant differences between the number of toxic replies received by female and male candidates that the gender alone could explain, qualitative insights uncovered systematic semiotic violence against women in politics. Female politicians were more often targeted with personal and degrading attacks, including sexist slurs, sexually explicit content, and attempts to silence or delegitimise them. In contrast, male candidates were likelier to receive insults tied to their political conduct and professional criticism. Moreover, replies to women are significantly more likely to include multiple elements of toxicity, indicating a higher intensity of online harassment.\nThese results underscore the need for platform and user accountability, nuanced moderation policies, and legal protections that reflect the gendered dimensions of online political violence. Our research highlights the persistence of digital misogyny as a barrier to gender parity in democratic participation and stresses the urgency of cross-sectoral strategies to combat this issue during electoral processes.",

          "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of silent harassment as a form of psychological \naggression within organizations, characterized by systematic communication denial \nand social exclusion. Unlike overt verbal or physical abuse, silent harassment operates \nthrough ambiguity, making it difficult to identify, challenge, or remediate. Drawing upon \nthe interplay between avoidant and obsessive-compulsive personality traits and \ngrounding its theoretical analysis in the dysfunction of meta-communication, this \nstudy proposes a novel explanatory framework for understanding silence as a \ndeliberate and damaging organizational act. The paper situates this concept within the \nbroader theory of structural selection pressure (Hiraoka, 2025a), arguing that silent \nharassment constitutes a micro-level manifestation of cultural degeneration within \nhierarchical institutions. Through a hypothetical case-based analysis, the model \ndemonstrates how psychological dispositions and organizational dynamics interact to \ncreate environments where exclusion is normalized and competence is silently \nsuppressed.",

Without targeted policy interventions, both directives could entrench inequities and marginalise under-resourced businesses.

          "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
          "abstract": "This paper elucidates, through theoretical grounding and observational cases, the \nstructure by which \"anger\" functions as a cultural meme within \norganizations—infecting, imitating, and reproducing itself. Drawing on Dawkins' (1976) \ntheory of memes as replicable units of cultural transmission, the paper explores how \nrepeated invocation of label words such as “temporary worker,” “full-time employee,” \nand “slave” constrains the frameworks of self-recognition, other-evaluation, and \nemotional expression among organizational members. As a result, a power structure \nemerges where anger operates as cultural currency. Well-intentioned individuals \nbecome infected by anger; spontaneous humor or unintentional laughter is expelled as \n“foreign matter,” and dialogic spaces collapse into silence and loyalty. As mimicry and \ninternalization deepen, phenomena arise such as inverted evaluation axes—where \nindividuals begin to desire validation from those who once harmed them—irrational \nchains of allegiance, and public execution-style harassment in online communication \nspaces. Anger memes infiltrate not only emotion but also language, belief systems, \nand structures of authority. By reconceptualizing anger not as a personality trait but \nas a structural-cultural meme, this paper visualizes the selection pressures operating \non emotion, language, recognition, and institutional logic, and lays a theoretical and \ninstitutional foundation for reconstructing dialogue.",

The literature generally treats numerical response categories as if they represent equal psychological intervals. We provide the first systematic test of this assumption, developing a general framework to quantify how easily results can be overturned when this linearity assumption is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that respondents interpret survey scales in ways that  do deviate from linearity, but only mildly. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 30,000+ coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics journals. Replicated coefficient signs are remarkably robust to mild departures from linear scale-use. However, statistical inference and estimates of relative effect magnitudes become unreliable, even under modest departures from linearity. This is especially problematic for policy applications. We show that these concerns generalise to many other widely used survey-based constructs.",

As a political community with enough surplus product can easily withstand malgovernance, without necessity or outcry for “Optimal Rule”, artificial intelligence will unlikely outgun or outvote human rulers. Among international competition barbarized by prospect of perpetual world domination through new technology, natural sciences and politics will no longer know ethics. People of nation states, if too little to rule themselves, will ask for a quasi-omnipotent protector, against artificial intelligence and foreign conquerors, at the price of total submission. This protector will be awarded with those very technology for a general artificial intelligence, to become a superhuman utterly integrated with machines, sooner, surer, and quicker than general artificial intelligence, or any other system of production and distribution past or foreign. Yet this will not make it any less human, as such integration is never absent or rare in human history. Through conquest, this superhuman ruler, itself a creation facilitated by international politics, may end international politics altogether, along with nation states. A superhuman ruler born of international politics, technology, and fear, is thus more likely the outcome of current scientific revolution, than scenarios of AI takeover/cataclysm/enthronement.

          "abstract": "Plato`s political science is never exclusively ancient or Hellenic, but identifies, epitomizes, and explores the still current background of politics: the problematic “irreversibility” and “scarcity”. As an adequate discussion of such problem must probe into its past and future possibilities, Plato, a “spectator or all times and of all existence”, maneuvering colorful characters able to imagine a limited human likelihood of gods in the future, and narrating in prose and myth, tested the feasibility and sustainability of “perfect” political systems at all levels of technological development, in a world of inherent randomness, apparent physical laws, and free will. Revelation of this test, then, are twofold, that no political system, including those best-designed, could hope for static existence forever, due to the world`s innate randomness, regardless of whether “irreversibility” and “scarcity” was overcame with technology. Yet this same randomness could, at the same time, and on the contrary, deny despotism immortality and full legitimacy at least in theory, by protecting ethics and freedom from natural sciences, and preserving hope, through refusal of strict determinism in all manners. It is thus noteworthy, that in such Platonic world, and probably our world, political idleness would never be safe, even in the best-governed polity, of powerful technology, so self-loving people should always bear the burden, however light, of making themselves just in a just manner.",

Such power, fairly shared, would change meaning, relationship, and practise of political equality, freedom, and democracy for the better, as never before. Still, the omnimachine, powerful as it may be, will likely develop in a world of Nation States competing for it, and would not be able to choose its own owner. Frightened by “General AI” and “foreign threats”, and seeking protection in idolatry, citizens of nation states would likely create for themselves a superhuman dictator with the omnimachine. Yet this new and utter tyranny, could, ironically, offer so much more affluence, equality, freedom, and democracy than any government of the past, those most equal, free, or democratic included, if the superhuman wills. Even if people could once share the new power fairly among themselves, safeguarding it would would still be challenging.

Although homogeneity compounding generally characterizes the whole field of philosophy and methodology of economics, one small and temporary subfield, making contributions to heterodox economics, structural realism, and the discussion on pluralism in economics, constituted a pocket of gender diversity.

Our results reveal substantial heterogeneity in the policy environment, with substantial variation both in the presence of policy elements and in their operationalization across policies. This diverse policy environment creates implementation challenges at multiple levels, from researchers managing different requirements to institutions developing support strategies, and publishers adapting their services to meet varied policy demands.

The article traces the history of the North/South Yemeni split into the modern crisis, and how the split transformed from a matter of competing legitimacy into one of self-determination.  Southern Transitional Council (STC) media builds a national consciousness and assumes a 'primordial' South Arabia. This is done through creating a national narrative from historical events associated with South Yemen, the monarchies preceding South Yemen, and specific diction choices.  Specific case studies are evaluated in demonstrating the South Arabian nationalist influencer model.  Ultimately, this work finds that social media figures associated with the Southern Movement reflect this specific line of nationalist reasoning by claiming South Arabia as a natural nation-state under Yemeni occupation.",

          "authors": "Katrina Qiyao Wang",
          "abstract": "For ambitious young Chinese students, gaining admission to an exclusive group of universities is a critical step toward entering elite spheres of Chinese society. Educators and policymakers often explain admissions and school choices through asocial concepts of meritocracy like gaokao-score-based tournaments and rational choice explanations. Organizational scholars emphasize cultural matching as an interpersonal recruitment mechanism. However, both frameworks fail to explain how standardized testing and cultural processes work together, albeit at different analytical levels. This article addresses this limitation by offering the first systematic analysis of the high-stakes admission competition between China's top two universities, Peking and Tsinghua. Based on participant observation of university recruiters (promoters) in Mango Province during the annual post-gaokao enrollment period, this study examines how merit is negotiated on the ground. I find that numbers game is prioritized at the institution and student levels, while cultural matching emerges at the promoter level. Universities focus on securing top-1 students (zhuangyuan) and boosting reported admission cutoffs. Students often cannot meaningfully distinguish between the two institutions. This allows promoters to \"guide\" students to their institutions by mediating between student decision-making and institutional goals. They accomplish this work by using three distinct practices. First, as institutional agents, they deploy emotional appeals to evaluate and promote a sense of \"fit.\" Second, as peer-like figures, they guide students to internalize dominant judgments of the \"small-town swot,\" leading them to reinterpret their own success as mechanical, narrow, or lacking in elite polish. Third, by calling themselves \"volunteers,\" they blur the boundary between institutional authority and personal goodwill, masking their strategic role in the admissions process. This article contributes to theories of merit under egalitarian governance, by showing how critical decision-making junctures actively construct meritocracy and the social meaning of elite status in the world.",

          "abstract": "As the wave of digital civilization reshapes the global development paradigm, the integration of culture and technology is emerging as a new key to solving the challenge of regional coordination. This paper takes the phenomenal open-world game \"Genshin Impact\" as the research object, pioneeringly constructs a theoretical framework of \"virtual-reality\" bidirectional empowerment, and empirically tests the empowerment mechanism of Genshin Impact on common prosperity. The study finds that Genshin Impact drives the development of regional common prosperity through three intermediary channels, achieving a qualitative leap in efficiency: activating regional innovation level enhancement through an innovative network akin to the \"Sumeru Wisdom Sharing System\", realizing industrial structure upgrading through the upgrading effect of \"Stratovolcano Industrial Transformation\", and cultivating innovative consciousness and enhancing regional innovation activity through the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the \"Liyue Commerce Ecology\". Spatial heterogeneity analysis reveals that its effectiveness exhibits a \"geographical energy gradient distribution\" characteristic, with the eastern region benefiting from the resonance of digital infrastructure endowment and market response efficiency, the western region relying on the latecomer advantage of resource digital transformation for improvement, and the central region's role not yet evident. Furthermore, the temporary negative correlation in the northeast resembles the suppression of elemental reactions by the \"icy environment of the Winter Nation - Snezhnaya \", profoundly demonstrating the threshold effect of regional institutional adaptability. The innovation of this study lies in translating game narratives such as \"Contract Spirit\" and \"Grass God Think Tank\" into operational economic governance language, empirically responding to the strategic deployment of \"improving the modern cultural industry system\" proposed at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The policy implications emphasize the need to break down \" Enkanomiya-style\" administrative barriers and build \"Jade Chamber-style \" regional growth poles, so that the integration of culture and technology can truly become a new fulcrum for coordinated development in a \"seven nations resonate\" manner, just as Zhongli's adage goes: \"Although the rock remains unmoved, the rock patterns eventually connect - only the coexistence of all things can form an inexhaustible flow.\"",

For adolescents and youth from underprivileged backgrounds, particularly girls, these aspirations are often constrained by limited resources, gender norms, and everyday violence. This report presents findings from research and programmatic work conducted by the Institute of Social Studies Trust (ISST) in Kalyanpuri, Delhi, through its Saathi and Yuva Saathi Centres. Using mixed methods—situational analysis, qualitative case studies, and participatory observations—the study explored how aspirations are formed and negotiated. While both girls and boys face structural barriers, girls contend with deeper restrictions on mobility, access to resources, and control over their agency and decision-making. Gendered violence, both within homes and in public spaces, further undermines their sense of agency and overall well-being. The findings underscore the importance of gender-sensitive, community-rooted interventions that expand adolescents’ real freedoms and choices, strengthen their capacity to aspire, and enable them—especially girls—to imagine and pursue more just and equitable futures.",

          "abstract": "Dreams offer a unique window into the cognitive and affective dynamics of the sleeping and the waking mind. Recent quantitative linguistic approaches have shown promise in obtaining corpus-level measures of dream sentiment and topic occurrence. However, it is currently unclear how the affective content of individual dreams relates to their semantic content and structure. Here, we combine word embedding, topic modeling, and network analysis to investigate this relationship. By applying Discourse Atom Topic Modeling (DATM) to the DreamBank corpus of &gt;18K dream reports, we represent the latent themes arising within dreams as a sparse dictionary of topics and identify the affective associations of those topics. We show that variation in dream affect (valence and arousal) is associated with changes in topical content. By representing each dream report as a network of topics, we demonstrate that the affective content of dreams is also coupled to semantic structure. Specifically, positively valenced dreams exhibit more coherent, structured, and linear narratives, whilst negatively valenced dreams have more narrative loops and dominant topics. Additionally, topic networks of high arousal dreams are structurally dominated by few high arousal topics and incoherent topical connections, whereas low arousal dreams contain more loops. These findings suggest that affective processes are associated with both the content and structure of dreams. Our approach showcases the potential of integrating natural language processing and network analysis with psychology to elucidate the interplay of affect, cognition and narrative in dreams. This methodology has broad applications for the study of narrated experience and psychiatric symptomatology.",

However, challenges with the virtual\nclasses were arguably more intense in the rural areas of developing\ncountries, considering technological and socio-geographic limitations. We\nargue that despite these limitations, rural areas provide opportunities (rural\naffordances), which may enhance teaching strategies. With the aim of\nexpounding this perspective, we explored science teachers’ strategies\nderived from rural affordances (SDRA) and drawn teachers’ perceptions of\nlearners’ engagement after the strategies’ intervention. Based on the results,\nthree types of SDRA were utilized, namely: contextualization of educational\nmaterials for science activities (CEMSA), integration of citizen science in\nscience activities (ICSSA), and integration of traditional knowledge in\nscience activities (ITraKSA), wherein a significant learner engagement with\nthe SDRA are perceived by teachers after the SDRA intervention. Prospects\nfor the utilization of the strategies in post pandemic settings suggest their\npotential roles in future distance learning schemes as well as in face-to-face\nlearning modality. A paradigm that outlines educational intervention may\nassimilate the advantages of the SDRA in science teaching.

Our findings revealed that migration generally boosts positive sentiments among immigrants, even when discussing the same topics, and that this effect lasts up to one year post-migration. However, there is no conclusive evidence that migration significantly impacts negative sentiments. Additionally, age and gender play a key role, with younger population and females more likely to express positive sentiments post-migration, while linguistic ties help foster increased positivity. These insights advance our understanding of immigrants’ emotional adaptation and highlight key demographic and social factors that shape their post-migration experiences.",

A recent literature review and thematic analysis reveal strategies for addressing these challenges, including contextualised materials, role-playing, and reflective exercises. These methods indirectly enable teachers to engage with cultural taboos, fostering student participation while respecting local sensitivities. The study emphasises the importance of intercultural competence as a critical skill for educators, equipping them to mediate cultural dynamics and create inclusive learning environments. Findings indicate that culturally responsive teaching facilitates language acquisition and promotes empathy and understanding among students from diverse cultural backgrounds. Implications include the need for ongoing professional development for ELT practitioners, focusing on strategies to balance cultural respect with pedagogical objectives. Addressing these issues, the research contributes to advancing culturally competent language education, offering practical solutions for integrating cultural sensitivity into ELT practices in the Gulf region and beyond.",

          "authors": "Kerstin Ostermann",
          "abstract": "Studying the relationship between neighborhoods and individual-level outcomes such as crime, labor market success, or intergenerational mobility has a long history in the social sciences. As local processes such as gentrification or residential mobility constantly change neighborhoods’ composition and spatial expansion, time-constant one-size-fits-all neighborhood measures fail to capture important local dynamics. This paper presents a flexible and data-driven approach for efficiently estimating overlapping and arbitrarily shaped neighborhoods with time-dynamic boundaries. Constructed in a two-stage clustering design, the first stage identifies homogeneous groups within a city (using an automated K-Means algorithm), while the second stage clusters homogeneous groups by spatial proximity (using the HDBSCAN algorithm). In an analysis of 86 million person-year observations from 76 German cities, the paper shows that a larger spatial expansion of neighborhoods with a high socioeconomic status negatively correlates with city crime cases, while higher neighborhood fragmentation and heterogeneity correlate positively with crime rates. The findings stress the importance of flexible neighborhood estimation techniques and the necessity to view neighborhoods as non-constant entities. By modeling contexts as such agentic players, the two-staged algorithm depicts a novel and transparent tool to consider the spatial embeddedness of individuals, firms, or regions in sociological research.",

          "abstract": "In an age where volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) are prevalent, modern companies are increasingly adopting Agile methods to foster resilience and innovation. With its focus on adaptability, teamwork, and empowerment, nimble leadership is offered as a new answer to current problems. However, this paper contends that the underlying tenets of this leadership style are not novel but are instead firmly founded in the divine guidance of the Holy Quran and the actual example (Seerah) of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). This visual academic article investigates the great parallels between the fundamental concepts of Agile leadership and the eternal Islamic ideals of Shura (consultation), Amanah (trust), Tafwid (delegation), Adl (justice), and Ihsan (excellence). By means of a methodical study, it creates a conceptual framework that connects modern Agile values directly to Quranic teachings. The study shows how the Quran presents an adaptive and goal-oriented model of leadership that is holistic, ethically sound, and spiritually based. This essay offers a fresh viewpoint for leaders of every background by highlighting these links and proposes that a closer interaction with this 1400-year-old knowledge can inspire and improve 21st century leadership practice.",

          "authors": "Ismail A Mageed",
          "abstract": "Teleological argument has been a cornerstone of natural theology, suggesting that complexity and order in the universe imply a purposeful designer. Early forms used biological analogies, while modern expressions incorporate sophisticated mathematical and physical concepts. This paper explores the philosophical and theological use of two such fields: fractal geometry and differential geometry. It argues that while these disciplines cannot, by their very nature, provide a formal \"proof\" of God's (Allah's) existence, they serve as powerful and compelling metaphorical frameworks for understanding divine attributes such as immanence, transcendence, omnipotence, and omniscience. By examining the self-similarity and infinite complexity of fractals and the elegant, fine-tuned structure of the cosmos described by differential geometry, this paper analyzes how these mathematical concepts are employed to reinvigorate the teleological argument, shifting the discourse from a claim of logical proof to an epistemology of awe and wonder.",

          "abstract": "Tourism is a valuable source of revenue for countries and communities that contributes to their economic growth. Despite these advantages, tourist travel flow can have unexpected effects, such as spreading diseases, like sexually transmitted infections (STIs), that affect public health. However, identifying possible correlations between tourism activities in regions and disease incidence is a relevant research issue that has not yet been extensively explored. According to the World Health Organization, syphilis is a worldwide STI with an estimated impact of 8 million adults between 15 and 49 years old in 2022. This paper investigates and analyses evidence concerning the correlation between tourism activities and geographical location with syphilis incidence. The correlation analysis uses a machine learning algorithm to cluster the governmental syphilis notification database of Bahia state in Brazil between 2010 and 2019. Evidence analysis suggests correlations between tourism activities in coastal tourism municipalities and the incidence of syphilis. Identified evidence of a correlation allows proactive preventive actions and positively impacts the municipality's public health sector.",

          "abstract": "Becoming a major trade partner of a country implies not only increased trade ties but also a change of status. And yet IR scholarship has largely overlooked the consequences of an upward change in a state’s standing. This paper examines how a one-off “rank effect” — China’s rise to become Brazil’s top trade partner in 2009 — causally influenced Brazil’s foreign policy alignment. Using a Synthetic Difference‑in‑Differences design, this work estimates a 42% reduction in Brazil–China United Nations General Assembly ideology distance following the rank shift. To unpack the mechanism, I then conduct a Natural Language Process analysis of Folha de São Paulo headlines (2005–2013), showing a sharp increase in China‑related salience that amplifies public and elite attention to the new status quo. Together, these findings demonstrate that status gains, once made salient by the media, can produce measurable shifts in interstate alignment.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The association between a wide range of family complexity indicators and children’s educational outcomes was assessed. \n\nBackground: Previous research documented a negative impact of disadvantageous family transitions and family instability on children’s educational outcomes. However, there is a theoretical and empirical debate surrounding the most appropriate measure of family complexity during childhood.\n\nMethod: Numerous theoretically conceptualized sequence-based complexity measures are applied to parents’ life history data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, which were linked to children’s test scores in the National Pupils Dataset. Average within-child change in boys’ and girls’ math and English tests scores following change in mothers’ and fathers’ family complexity were estimated with fixed-effects regressions.  \n\nResults: Family complexity measures were largely found to be negatively associated with children’s academic performance, however with differences across indicators. The number of transitions as well as the uncertainty and sum of disadvantage indicators were most tightly associated with children’s test scores. In addition, results varied by parents’ and children’s gender. For example, family complexity for fathers was often positively associated with children’s educational outcomes and associations were often stronger for boys compared to girls.\n\nConclusion: Findings highlight the importance of theoretically derived measures of family complexity. In this study, measures associated with family instability and parental absence were shown to be most strongly linked with children’s educational outcomes.",

          "authors": "Kristian Bernt Karlson",
          "abstract": "Lundberg (2020) showed that significant cousin correlations in educational attainment need not imply direct influence from the extended family. Instead, such correlations may arise from two sources: generational variation in parent–child transmission strength (“dynamic transmission”) and attenuation due to classical measurement error. Building on this framework, I use data from the National Longitudinal Surveys to test whether observed sibling and cousin correlations are consistent with a first-order Markov process that incorporates generation-specific transmission parameters and known reliabilities of educational measures. After accounting for both dynamic transmission and measurement error, the model fully explains the observed cousin correlations in the NLSY. Any residual extended-family influence is negligible. These findings reinforce Lundberg’s central insight: cousin correlations in educational attainment among the cohorts studied can be entirely attributed to two-generation transmission dynamics, rather than any substantive extended-family effect.",
